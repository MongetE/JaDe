Where the three magenta%%
Breakwaters take the shove%%
And suck of the grey sea%%
To the left, and the wave%%
Unfists against the dun%%
Barb-wired headland of%%
The Deer Island prison%%
With its trim piggeries,
Hen huts and cattle green%%
To the right, and March ice%%
Glazes the rock pools yet,
Snuff-colored sand cliffs rise%%
Over a great stone spit%%
Bared by each falling tide,
And you, across those white%%
Stones, strode out in you dead%%
Black coat, black shoes, and your%%
Black hair till there you stood,
Fixed vortex on the far%%
Tip, riveting stones, air,
All of it, together.
