listen, he said, you ever seen a bunch of crabs in a%%
bucket?&&
no, I told him.&&
well, what happens is that now and then one crab%%
will climb up on top of the others%%
and begin to climb toward the top of the bucket,&&
then, just as he's about to escape%%
another crab grabs him and pulls him back%%
down.&&
really? I asked.&&
really, he said, and this job is just like that, none%%
of the others want anybody to get out of%%
here. that's just the way it is%%
in the postal service!&&
I believe you, I said.&&
just then the supervisor walked up and said,&&
you fellows were talking.&&
there is no talking allowed on this%%
job.&&
I had been there for eleven and one-half%%
years.&&
I got up off my stool and climbed right up the%%
supervisor%%
and then I reached up and pulled myself right%%
out of there.&&
it was so easy it was unbelievable.&&
but none of the others followed me.&&
and after that, whenever I had crab legs%%
I thought about that place.&&
I must have thought about that place%%
maybe 5 or 6 times%%
before I switched to lobster.&&
