DIM thro' the sculptured aisles the sunbeam falls%%
More like a dream%%
Of some imagined beam,&&
Than actual daylight over mortal walls.&&
A strain of music like the rushing wind,&&
But deep and sweet%%
As when the waters meet%%
In one mysterious harmony combined.&&
So swells the mighty organ, rich and full,&&
As if it were the soul%%
Which raised the glorious whole%%
Of that fair building, vast and wonderful.&&
Doth not the spirit feel its influence,&&
All vain and feverish care,&&
All thoughts that worldly are,&&
Strife, tumult, mirth, and fear are vanished hence.&&
The world is put aside, within the heart%%
Those hopes arise%%
Thrice sacred mysteries,&&
In which our earthly nature has no part.&&
Oh, Christian Fane, the soul expands in thee,&&
Thine altar and thy tomb%%
Speak of the hope and doom%%
Which leads and cheers man to eternity.&&
