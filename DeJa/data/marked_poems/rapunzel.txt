All day, all day I brush%%
My golden strands of hair;
All day I wait and wait..
Ah, who is there?
Who calls? Who calls? The gold%%
Ladder of my long hair%%
I loose and wait..and wait..
Ah, who is there?
She left at dawn..I am blind%%
In the tangle of my long hair..
Is it she? the witch? the witch?
Ah, who is there?
