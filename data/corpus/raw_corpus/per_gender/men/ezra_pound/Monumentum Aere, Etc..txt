You say that I take a good deal upon myself;
That I strut in the robes of assumption.

In a few years no one will remember the buffo,
No one will remember the trivial parts of me,
The comic detail will be absent.
As for you, you will rot in the earth,
And it is doubtful if even your manure will be rich
enough

To keep grass
Over your grave.
