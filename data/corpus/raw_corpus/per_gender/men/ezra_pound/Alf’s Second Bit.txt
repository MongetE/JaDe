THE NEO-COMMUNE

Manhood of England,
Dougth of the Shires,
Want Russia to save 'em
And answer their prayers.
Want Russia to save 'em,
Lenin to save 'em, Trotsky to save 'em
(And valets to shave 'em)
The youth of the Shires!

Down there in Cambridge
Between auction and plain bridge,
Romance, revolution 1918!
An idea between 'em
I says! 'ave you seen 'em?
The flower of Cambridge,
The youth of the Shires?
