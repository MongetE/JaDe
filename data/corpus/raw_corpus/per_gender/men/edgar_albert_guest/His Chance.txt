"I WANT a chance to show what I can do,'
He sighed when others seemed to pass him by;
'There are great problems I could master, too,
Somehow, I never get the chance to try.

Give me a chance to show what I can do,'
This was the burden of his daily whine;
'I might achieve success as well as you,
If opportunity were mine.'

One day they bade him fill another's place,
Another's work they offered him to do;
He grumbled and a frown passed o'er his face,
'I am not paid to do the work of two.'
