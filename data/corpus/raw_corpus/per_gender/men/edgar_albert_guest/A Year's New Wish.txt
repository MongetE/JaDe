MAY all your little cares depart
By which your heart is troubled;
May perfect peace supplant the smart,
And all your joys be doubled.
May every wish you have come true,
And every sky above be blue.

May every foe become your friend,
And every wrong be righted;
And may your paths that wind and bend
With sunshine all be lighted.
May love and laughter walk with you,
With ne'er a tear the whole year through.

Good health, good friends, good luck, I pray
That you will always know,
With lips to kiss at close of day,
And eyes with love aglow.
Where 'er you go, a hand clasp true,
This is my New Year's wish for you.
