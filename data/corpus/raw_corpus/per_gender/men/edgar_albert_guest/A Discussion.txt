She put her arms about my neck,
And whispered low to me:
'I'm thinking daddy, dear, how nice
And lovely it would be
If only every little girl
In all this wide world through
Had daddies that were just as nice
And kind and good as you.'

And then I took her in my arms
And held her on my knee
And said: 'A nicer, brighter world
I'm sure that it would be
If only every grown-up man
Beneath the skies of blue
Were daddy to a little girl
As nice and sweet as you.'
