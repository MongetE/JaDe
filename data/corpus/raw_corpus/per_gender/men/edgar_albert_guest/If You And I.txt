IF you would smile a little more
And I would kinder be,
If you would stop to think before
You speak of faults you see.
If I would show more patience, too,
With all with whom I'm hurled,
Then I would help and so would you
To make a better world.

If you would cheer your neighbor more
And I'd encourage mine,
If you would linger at his door
To say his work is fine,
And I would stop to help him when
His lips in frowns are curled,
Both you and I'd be helping then
To make a better world.

But just as long as you keep still
And plod your selfish way,
And I rush on, and heedless kill
The kind words I could say;
While you and I refuse to smile
And keep our gay flags furled,
Someone will grumble all the while
That it's a gloomy world.
