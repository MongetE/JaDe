"BUSINESS is business,' he said to me,
As he gave me short weight in my pound of tea.

'In business there isn't much sentiment,'
Said he, as he charged me the extra cent.

'Once I trusted a friend and he didn't pay,'
The bread that he sold wasn't made that day.

'Business is business,' he said to me,
Of a dozen eggs we could use but three.

O, it seems to me some way, somehow,
There's too much business in business now.
