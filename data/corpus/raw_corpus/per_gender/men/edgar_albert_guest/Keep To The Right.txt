KEEP to the right is the rule of the road,
Keep to the right as you travel along,
Often, for safety, your progress is slowed,
This is the rule for the weak or the strong.
Driving or walking this law all observe,
Now it's adopted for aerial flight,
Get just as far as you can or deserve,
But always remember to keep to the right.

Make this the rule of your life every day,
Follow it out in all things that you do,
Guide of your tongue in all things that you say,
Guide to the goals that you seek and pursue.
Let it come first, though you win or you lose,
Conquer or fail in the thick of the fight,
This be the motto that daily you use,
This is sufficient, just' Keep to the Right.'
