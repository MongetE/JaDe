How pleasant to sit on the beach,
On the beach, on the sand, in the sun,
With ocean galore within reach,
And nothing at all to be done!
o letters to answer,
o bills to be burned,
o work to be shirked,
o cash to be earned,
It is pleasant to sit on the beach
With nothing at all to be done!

How pleasant to look at the ocean,
Democratic and damp; indiscriminate;
It fills me with noble emotion
To think I am able to swim in it.
To lave in the wave,
ajestic and chilly,
omorrow I crave;
ut today it is silly.
It is pleasant to look at the ocean;
Tomorrow, perhaps, I shall swim in it.

How pleasant to gaze at the sailors
As their sailboats they manfully sail
With the vigor of vikings and whalers
In the days of the vikings and whale.
hey sport on the brink
f the shad and the shark;
f it’s windy, they sink;
f it isn’t, they park.
It is pleasant to gaze at the sailors,
To gaze without having to sail.

How pleasant the salt anesthetic
Of the air and the sand and the sun;
Leave the earth to the strong and athletic,
And the sea to adventure upon.
ut the sun and the sand
;No contractor can copy;
e lie in the land
;Of the lotus and poppy;
We vegetate, calm and aesthetic,
On the beach, on the sand, in the sun.
