WHAT you give me, I cheerfully accept,
A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money--these, as I
rendezvous with my poems;
A traveler's lodging and breakfast as I journey through The States--
Why should I be ashamed to own such gifts? Why to advertise for
them?
For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman;
For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of
the universe.
