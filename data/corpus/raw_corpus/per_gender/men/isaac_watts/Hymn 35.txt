Praise to God for creation and redemption.

Let them neglect thy glory, Lord,
Who never knew thy grace;
But our loud songs shall still record
The wonders of thy praise.

We raise our shouts, O God, to thee,
And send them to thy throne;
All glory to th' united Three,
The undivided One.

'Twas he (and we'll adore his name)
That formed us by a word;
'Tis he restores our ruined frame:
Salvation to the Lord!

Hosannah! let the earth and skies
Repeat the joyful sound
Rocks, hills, and vales, reflect the voice
In one eternal round.
