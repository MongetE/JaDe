Hosannah to Christ.

Mt. 21:9; Luke 19:38,40.

Hosannah to the royal Son
Of David's ancient line!
His natures two, his person one,
Mysterious and divine.

The root of David here, we find,
And offspring is the same:
Eternity and time are joined
In our Immanuel's name.

Blest he that comes to wretched men
With peaceful news from heav'n!
Hosannah's of the highest strain
To Christ the Lord be giv'n!

Let mortals ne'er refuse to take
Th' hosannah on their tongues,
Lest rocks and stones should rise and break
Their silence into songs.
