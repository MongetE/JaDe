Christ's kingdom and majesty.

The God Jehovah reigns!
Let all the nations fear;
Let sinners tremble at his throne,
And saints be humble there.

Jesus the Savior reigns!
Let earth adore its Lord;
Bright cherubs his attendants stand,
Swift to fulfil his word.

In Zion is his throne,
His honors are Divine;
His church shall make his wonders known,
For there his glories shine.

How holy is his name!
How terrible his praise!
Justice, and truth, and judgment join
In all his works of grace.
