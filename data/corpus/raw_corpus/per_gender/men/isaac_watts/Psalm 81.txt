v.1,8-
S. M.
The warnings of God to his people.

Sing to the Lord aloud,
And make a joyful noise;
God is our strength, our Savior God;
Let Isr'el hear his voice.

"From vile idolatry
Preserve my worship clean;
I am the Lord, who set thee free
From slavery and sin.

"Stretch thy desires abroad,
And I'll supply them well:
But if ye will refuse your God,
If Isr'el will rebel;

"I'll leave them," saith the Lord,
"To their own lusts a prey,
And let them run the dang'rous road,
'Tis their own chosen way.

"Yet, O! that all my saints
Would hearken to my voice!
Soon I would ease their sore complaints,
And bid their hearts rejoice.

"While I destroy their foes,
I'd richly feed my flock;
And they should taste the stream that flows
From their eternal rock."
