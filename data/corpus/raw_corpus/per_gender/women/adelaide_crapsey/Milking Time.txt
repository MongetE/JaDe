Heard ye the maidens
Went through the meadows,
Early, O, early,
While yet the dew was
Wet on the grass?
Heard ye the milk-maids
Singing and singing?


'Cushy cow bonny let down your milk,
And I will give you a gown of silk,
A gown of silk asnd a silver tee,
If you will let down your milk to me.'

Hear ye the maidens,
Over the meadows,
Where the dew gathers,
Where shadows lengthen,
Hear ye the milk-maids'
Aery, hushed voices
Singing, ah, singing?

'Cushy cow bonny let down your milk,
And I will give you a gown of silk,
A gown of silk asnd a silver tee,
If you will let down your milk to me.'

Morning and evening,
In the green meadows
Hear ye the milk-maids
And their sweet singing?
