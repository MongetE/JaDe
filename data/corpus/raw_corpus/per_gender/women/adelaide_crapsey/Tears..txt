The immemorial grief of all years
Burdes my heart sorely, and the years
Of slow eternal crying stain my cheeks.
Forever and forever my soul speaks
Saying: I am thy self: Look on me -
And weep. Never and never shalt thou be
As I. Weep; for weeping and hard pain
Of loss measure joy of last visioned gain.
