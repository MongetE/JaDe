New England.

1     Alas, dear Mother, fairest Queen and best,
2     With honour, wealth, and peace happy and blest,
3     What ails thee hang thy head, and cross thine arms,
4     And sit i' the dust to sigh these sad alarms?
5     What deluge of new woes thus over-whelm
6     The glories of thy ever famous Realm?
7     What means this wailing tone, this mournful guise?
8     Ah, tell thy Daughter; she may sympathize.

Old England.

9     Art ignorant indeed of these my woes,
10   Or must my forced tongue these griefs disclose,
11   And must my self dissect my tatter'd state,
12   Which Amazed Christendom stands wondering at?
13   And thou a child, a Limb, and dost not feel
14   My weak'ned fainting body now to reel?
15   This physic-purging-potion I have taken
16   Will bring Consumption or an Ague quaking,
17   Unless some Cordial thou fetch from high,
18   Which present help may ease my malady.
19   If I decease, dost think thou shalt survive?
20   Or by my wasting state dost think to thrive?
21   Then weigh our case, if 't be not justly sad.
22   Let me lament alone, while thou art glad.

New England.

23   And thus, alas, your state you much deplore
24   In general terms, but will not say wherefore.
25   What Medicine shall I seek to cure this woe,
26   If th' wound's so dangerous, I may not know?
27   But you, perhaps, would have me guess it out.
28   What, hath some Hengist like that Saxon stout
29   By fraud and force usurp'd thy flow'ring crown,
30   Or by tempestuous Wars thy fields trod down?
31   Or hath Canutus, that brave valiant Dane,
32   The regal peaceful Sceptre from thee ta'en?
33   Or is 't a Norman whose victorious hand
34   With English blood bedews thy conquered Land?
35   Or is 't intestine Wars that thus offend?
36   Do Maud and Stephen for the Crown contend?
37   Do Barons rise and side against their King,
38   And call in Foreign aid to help the thing?
39   Must Edward be depos'd? Or is 't the hour
40   That second Richard must be clapp'd i' th' Tower?
41   Or is it the fatal jar, again begun,
42   That from the red, white pricking Roses sprung?
43   Must Richmond's aid the Nobles now implore
44   To come and break the tushes of the Boar?
45   If none of these, dear Mother, what's your woe?
46   Pray, do not fear Spain's bragging Armado.
47   Doth your Ally, fair France, conspire your wrack,
48   Or doth the Scots play false behind your back?
49   Doth Holland quit you ill for all your love?
50   Whence is this storm, from Earth or Heaven above?
51   Is 't drought, is 't Famine, or is 't Pestilence?
52   Dost feel the smart, or fear the consequence?
53   Your humble Child entreats you shew your grief.
54   Though Arms nor Purse she hath for your relief--
55   Such is her poverty,--yet shall be found
56   A suppliant for your help, as she is bound.

Old England.

57   I must confess some of those Sores you name
58   My beauteous Body at this present maim,
59   But foreign Foe nor feigned friend I fear,
60   For they have work enough, thou knowest, elsewhere.
61   Nor is it Alcie's son and Henry's Daughter
62   Whose proud contention cause this slaughter;
63   Nor Nobles siding to make John no King,
64   French Louis unjustly to the Crown to bring;
65   No Edward, Richard, to lose rule and life,
66   Nor no Lancastrians to renew old strife;
67   No Crook-backt Tyrant now usurps the Seat, 68   Whose tearing tusks did wound, and kill, and threat. 69   No Duke of
York nor Earl of March to soil
70   Their hands in Kindred's blood whom they did foil;
71   No need of Tudor Roses to unite:
72   None knows which is the Red or which the White.
73   Spain's braving Fleet a second time is sunk.
74   France knows how of my fury she hath drunk
75   By Edward third and Henry fifth of fame;
76   Her Lilies in my Arms avouch the same.
77   My Sister Scotland hurts me now no more,
78   Though she hath been injurious heretofore.
79   What Holland is, I am in some suspense,
80   But trust not much unto his Excellence.
81   For wants, sure some I feel, but more I fear;
82   And for the Pestilence, who knows how near?
83   Famine and Plague, two sisters of the Sword,
84   Destruction to a Land doth soon afford.
85   They're for my punishments ordain'd on high,
86   Unless thy tears prevent it speedily.
87   But yet I answer not what you demand
88   To shew the grievance of my troubled Land.
89   Before I tell the effect I'll shew the cause,
90   Which are my sins--the breach of sacred Laws:
91   Idolatry, supplanter of a N ation,
92   With foolish superstitious adoration,
93   Are lik'd and countenanc'd by men of might,
94   The Gospel is trod down and hath no right.
95   Church Offices are sold and bought for gain
96   That Pope had hope to find Rome here again.
97   For Oaths and Blasphemies did ever ear
98   From Beelzebub himself such language hear?
99   What scorning of the Saints of the most high!
100   What injuries did daily on them lie!
101   What false reports, what nick-names did they take,
102   Not for their own, but for their Master's sake!
103   And thou, poor soul, wast jeer'd among the rest;
104   Thy flying for the Truth I made a jest.
105   For Sabbath-breaking and for Drunkenness
106   Did ever Land profaneness more express?
107   From crying bloods yet cleansed am not I,
108   Martyrs and others dying causelessly.
109   How many Princely heads on blocks laid down
110   For nought but title to a fading Crown!
111   'Mongst all the cruelties which I have done,
112   Oh, Edward's Babes, and Clarence's hapless Son,
113   O Jane, why didst thou die in flow'ring prime?--
114   Because of Royal Stem, that was thy crime.
115   For Bribery, Adultery, for Thefts, and Lies
116   Where is the Nation I can't paralyze?
117   With Usury, Extortion, and Oppression,
118   These be the Hydras of my stout transgression;
119   These be the bitter fountains, heads, and roots
120   Whence flow'd the source, the sprigs, the boughs, and fruits.
121   Of more than thou canst hear or I relate,
122   That with high hand I still did perpetrate,
123   For these were threat'ned the woeful day
124   I mocked the Preachers, put it fair away.
125   The Sermons yet upon record do stand
126   That cried destruction to my wicked Land.
127   These Prophets' mouths (all the while) was stopt,
128   Unworthily, some backs whipt, and ears crept;
129   Their reverent cheeks bear the glorious marks
130   Of stinking, stigmatizing Romish Clerks;
131   Some lost their livings, some in prison pent,
132   Some grossly fined, from friends to exile went:
133   Their silent tongues to heaven did vengeance cry,
134   Who heard their cause, and wrongs judg'd righteously,
135   And will repay it sevenfold in my lap.
136   This is fore-runner of my after-clap.
137   Nor took I warning by my neighbors' falls.
138   I saw sad Germany's dismantled walls,
139   I saw her people famish'd, Nobles slain,
140   Her fruitful land a barren heath remain.
141   I saw (unmov'd) her Armies foil'd and fled,
142   Wives forc'd, babes toss'd, her houses calcined.
143   I saw strong Rochelle yield'd to her foe,
144   Thousands of starved Christians there also.
145   I saw poor Ireland bleeding out her last,
146   Such cruelty as all reports have past.
147   Mine heart obdurate stood not yet aghast.
148   Now sip I of that cup, and just 't may be
149   The bottom dregs reserved are for me.

New England.

150   To all you've said, sad mother, I assent.
151   Your fearful sins great cause there 's to lament.
152   My guilty hands (in part) hold up with you,
153   A sharer in your punishment's my due.
154   But all you say amounts to this effect,
155   Not what you feel, but what you do expect.
156   Pray, in plain terms, what is your present grief?
157   Then let's join heads and hands for your relief.

Old England.

158   Well, to the matter, then. There's grown of late
159   'Twixt King and Peers a question of state:
160   Which is the chief, the law, or else the King?
161   One saith, it's he; the other, no such thing.
162   My better part in Court of Parliament
163   To ease my groaning land shew their intent
164   To crush the proud, and right to each man deal,
165   To help the Church, and stay the Common-Weal.
166   So many obstacles comes in their way
167   As puts me to a stand what I should say.
168   Old customs, new Prerogatives stood on.
169   Had they not held law fast, all had been gone,
170   Which by their prudence stood them in such stead
171   They took high Strafford lower by the head,
172   And to their Laud be 't spoke they held 'n th' Tower
173   All England's metropolitan that hour.
174   This done, an Act they would have passed fain
175   No prelate should his Bishopric retain.
176   Here tugg'd they hard indeed, for all men saw
177   This must be done by Gospel, not by law.
178   Next the Militia they urged sore.
179   This was denied, I need not say wherefore.
180   The King, displeased, at York himself absents.
181   They humbly beg return, shew their intents.
182   The writing, printing, posting to and fro,
183   Shews all was done; I'll therefore let it go.
184   But now I come to speak of my disaster.
185   Contention's grown 'twixt Subjects and their Master,
186   They worded it so long they fell to blows,
187   That thousands lay on heaps. Here bleeds my woes.
188   I that no wars so many years have known
189   Am now destroy'd and slaughter'd by mine own.
190   But could the field alone this strife decide,
191   One battle, two, or three I might abide,
192   But these may be beginnings of more woe--
193   Who knows, the worst, the best may overthrow!
194   Religion, Gospel, here lies at the stake,
195   Pray now, dear child, for sacred Zion's sake,
196   Oh, pity me in this sad perturbation,
197   My plundered Towns, my houses' devastation,
198   My ravisht virgins, and my young men slain,
199   My wealthy trading fallen, my dearth of grain.
200   The seedtime's come, but Ploughman hath no hope
201   Because he knows not who shall inn his crop.
202   The poor they want their pay, their children bread,
203   Their woful mothers' tears unpitied.
204   If any pity in thy heart remain,
205   Or any child-like love thou dost retain,
206   For my relief now use thy utmost skill,
207   And recompense me good for all my ill.

New England.

208   Dear mother, cease complaints, and wipe your eyes,
209   Shake off your dust, cheer up, and now arise.
210   You are my mother, nurse, I once your flesh,
211   Your sunken bowels gladly would refresh.
212   Your griefs I pity much but should do wrong,
213   To weep for that we both have pray'd for long,
214   To see these latter days of hop'd-for good,
215   That Right may have its right, though 't be with blood.
216   After dark Popery the day did clear;
217   But now the Sun in's brightness shall appear.
218   Blest be the Nobles of thy Noble Land
219   With (ventur'd lives) for truth's defence that stand.
220   Blest be thy Commons, who for Common good
221   And thy infringed Laws have boldly stood.
222   Blest be thy Counties, who do aid thee still
223   With hearts and states to testify their will.
224   Blest be thy Preachers, who do cheer thee on.
225   Oh, cry: the sword of God and Gideon!
226   And shall I not on them wish Mero's curse
227   That help thee not with prayers, arms, and purse?
228   And for my self, let miseries abound
229   If mindless of thy state I e'er be found.
230   These are the days the Church's foes to crush,
231   To root out Prelates, head, tail, branch, and rush.
232   Let's bring Baal's vestments out, to make a fire,
233   Their Mitres, Surplices, and all their tire,
234   Copes, Rochets, Croziers, and such trash,
235   And let their names consume, but let the flash
236   Light Christendom, and all the world to see
237   We hate Rome's Whore, with all her trumpery.
238   Go on, brave Essex, shew whose son thou art,
239   Not false to King, nor Country in thy heart,
240   But those that hurt his people and his Crown,
241   By force expel, destroy, and tread them down.
242   Let Gaols be fill'd with th' remnant of that pack,
243   And sturdy Tyburn loaded till it crack.
244   And ye brave Nobles, chase away all fear,
245   And to this blessed Cause closely adhere.
246   O mother, can you weep and have such Peers?
247   When they are gone, then drown your self in tears,
248   If now you weep so much, that then no more
249   The briny Ocean will o'erflow your shore.
250   These, these are they (I trust) with Charles our king,
251   Out of all mists such glorious days will bring
252   That dazzled eyes, beholding, much shall wonder
253   At that thy settled Peace, thy wealth, and splendour,
254   Thy Church and Weal establish'd in such manner
255   That all shall joy that thou display'dst thy banner,
256   And discipline erected so, I trust,
257   That nursing Kings shall come and lick thy dust.
258   Then Justice shall in all thy Courts take place
259   Without respect of persons or of case.
260   Then bribes shall cease, and suits shall not stick long,
261   Patience and purse of Clients for to wrong.
262   Then High Commissions shall fall to decay,
263   And Pursuivants and Catchpoles want their pay.
264   So shall thy happy Nation ever flourish,
265   When truth and righteousness they thus shall nourish.
266   When thus in Peace, thine Armies brave send out
267   To sack proud Rome, and all her vassals rout.
268   There let thy name, thy fame, and valour shine,
269   As did thine Ancestors' in Palestine,
270   And let her spoils full pay with int'rest be
271   Of what unjustly once she poll'd from thee.
272   Of all the woes thou canst let her be sped,
273   Execute to th' full the vengeance threatened.
274   Bring forth the beast that rul'd the world with's beck,
275   And tear his flesh, and set your feet on's neck,
276   And make his filthy den so desolate
277   To th' 'stonishment of all that knew his state.
278   This done, with brandish'd swords to Turkey go,--
279   (For then what is it but English blades dare do?)
280   And lay her waste, for so's the sacred doom,
281   And do to Gog as thou hast done to Rome.
282   Oh Abraham's seed, lift up your heads on high,
283   For sure the day of your redemption's nigh.
284   The scales shall fall from your long blinded eyes,
285   And him you shall adore who now despise.
286   Then fullness of the Nations in shall flow,
287   And Jew and Gentile to one worship go.
288   Then follows days of happiness and rest.
289   Whose lot doth fall to live therein is blest.
290   No Canaanite shall then be found 'n th' land,
291   And holiness on horses' bells shall stand.
292   If this make way thereto, then sigh no more,
293   But if at all thou didst not see 't before.
294   Farewell, dear mother; Parliament, prevail,
295   And in a while you'll tell another tale.
