Let us with a gladsome mind
Praise the Lord for he is kind;
For his mercies aye endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Let us blaze his Name abroad,
For of gods he is the God;
For his, &c.
O let us his praises tell,
That doth the wrathful tyrants quell;
For his, &c.
That with his miracles doth make
Amazèd Heaven and Earth to shake;
For his, &c.
That by his wisdom did create
The painted heavens so full of state;
For his, &c.
That did the solid Earth ordain
To rise above the watery plain;
For his, &c.
That by his all-commanding might,
Did fill the new-made world with light;
For his, &c.
And caused the golden-tressèd Sun
All the day long his course to run;
For his, &c.
The hornèd Moon to shine by night
Amongst her spangled sisters bright;
For his, &c.
He, with his thunder-clasping hand,
Smote the first-born of Egypt land;
For his, &c.
And, in despite of Pharao fell,
He brought from thence his Israel;
For his, &c.
The ruddy waves he cleft in twain
Of the Erythræan main;
For his, &c.
The floods stood still, like walls of glass,
While the Hebrew bands did pass;
For his, &c.
But full soon they did devour
The tawny King with all his power;
For his, &c.
His chosen people he did bless
In the wasteful Wilderness;
For his, &c.
In bloody battail he brought down
Kings of prowess and renown;
For his, &c.
He foiled bold Seon and his host,
That ruled the Amorrean coast;
For his, &c.
And large-limbed Og he did subdue,
With all his over-hardy crew;
For his, &c.
And to his servant Israel
He gave their land, therein to dwell;
For his, &c.
He hath, with a piteous eye,
Beheld us in our misery;
For his, &c.
And freed us from the slavery
Of the invading enemy;
For his, &c.
All living creatures he doth feed,
And with full hand supplies their need;
For his, &c.
Let us, therefore, warble forth
His mighty majesty and worth;
For his, &c.
That his mansion hath on high,
Above the reach of mortal eye;
For his, &c.
