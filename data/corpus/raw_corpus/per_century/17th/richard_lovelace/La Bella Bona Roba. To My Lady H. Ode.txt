Tell me, ye subtill judges in loves treasury,
Inform me, which hath most inricht mine eye,
This diamonds greatnes, or its clarity?

Of fires are harder to be found then view'd,
Waite on this star in her first magnitude.

Chrusht with too strong a hand, or soft a touch.

Waits your proud hopes, her looks al-killing charm
Guarded by her as true victorious arme.

V.
Thus with her eyes brave Tamyris spake dread,
Which when the kings dull breast not entered,
Finding she could not looke, she strook him dead.
