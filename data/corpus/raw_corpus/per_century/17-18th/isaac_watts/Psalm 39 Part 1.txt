v.1-3
C. M.
Watchfulness over the tongue.

Thus I resolved before the Lord,-
"Now will I watch my tongue;
Lest I let slip one sinful word,
Or do my neighbor wrong."

And if I'm e'er constrained to stay
With men of lives profane,
I'll set a double guard that day,
Nor let my talk be vain.

I'll scarce allow my lips to speak
The pious thoughts I feel,
Lest scoffers should th' occasion take
To mock my holy zeal.

Yet if some proper hour appear,
I'll not be overawed,
But let the scoffing sinners hear
That I can speak for God.
