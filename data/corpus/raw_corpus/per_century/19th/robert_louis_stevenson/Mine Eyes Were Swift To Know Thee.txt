MINE eyes were swift to know thee, and my heart
As swift to love.  I did become at once
Thine wholly, thine unalterably, thine
In honourable service, pure intent,
Steadfast excess of love and laughing care:
And as she was, so am, and so shall be.
I knew thee helpful, knew thee true, knew thee
And Pity bedfellows: I heard thy talk
With answerable throbbings.  On the stream,
Deep, swift, and clear, the lilies floated; fish
Through the shadows ran.  There, thou and I
Read Kindness in our eyes and closed the match.
