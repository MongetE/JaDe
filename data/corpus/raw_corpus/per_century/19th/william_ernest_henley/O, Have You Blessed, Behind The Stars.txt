O, have you blessed, behind the stars,
The blue sheen of the skies,
When June the roses round her calls? –
Then do you know the light that falls
From her beloved eyes.

And have you felt the sense of peace
That morning meadows give? –
Then do you know the spirit of grace,
The angel abiding in her face,
Who makes it good to live.


She shines before me, hope and dream,
So fair, so still, so wise,
That winning her, I seem to won
Out of the dust and drive and din
A nook of Paradise.
