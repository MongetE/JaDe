Inside the tiny Pantheon
We stood together silently,
Leaving the restless crowsd awhile,
As ships find shelter from the sea.

The ancient centuries came back
To cover us a moment's space,
And through the dome the light was glad
Because it shone upon your face.

Ah, not from Rome but farther still
Beyond sun-smitten Salamis,
The moment took us, till you learned
To find the present with a kiss.
