Through snowy woods and shady
We went to play a tune
To the lonely manor-lady
By the light of the Christmas moon.


We violed till, upward glancing
To where a mirror leaned,
We saw her airily dancing,
Deeming her movements screened;


Dancing alone in the room there,
Thin-draped in her robe of night;
Her postures, glassed in the gloom there,
Were a strange phantasmal sight.


She had learnt (we heard when homing)
That her roving spouse was dead;
Why she had danced in the gloaming
We thought, but never said.
