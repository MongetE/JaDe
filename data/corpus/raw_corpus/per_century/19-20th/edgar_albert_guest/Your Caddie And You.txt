He is with you every minute, in the smooth and in the rough,
And your caddie's quick to sense it if you're made of proper stuff.
If you hear your trials bravely, if you do the best you can,
You will find the little fellow trying hard to be a man.

If you show the proper spirit when you meet misfortune grim,
You'll be making a courageous and a plucky chap of him.
But if you're overbearing and the speech of brutes employ,
You are ruining the morals and the manhood of the boy.

He's a manly little fellow, and he wants to do what's right,
But he's quick to sense injustice and his breast is full of fight.
So remember when he doesn't always do as he should do,
And you find that he is careless, that the fault may lie with you.
