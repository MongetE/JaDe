Foe and friend and foe again,
Turning coat and turning yet,
That's a feat you don't disdain,
De Wet.
England's easy, England's kind,
Quick to pardon and forget.
There's a limit, as you'll find,
De Wet.
Glad to raise a fallen foe,
Ready to erase a debt.
Quick to spare a traitor ? No,
De Wet.
England trusts a solemn vow,
That's her way. We don't regret.
So be it, we know you now,
De Wet.
Treachery will miss its aim,
You'll be learning, never fret.
That it's best to play the game,
De Wet.
