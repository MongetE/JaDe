Musicians O Musicians: Heartsease
Heartsease: an you will have me live play heartsease.


Light wind in the small green leaves
Play, oh play, my sad heart ease;

Birds, shake from your wilding throats
Tune`d charm of happy notes;

Shepherd, shepherd, pipe a shrill
A jocound pipe o'er vale and hill;

For from too much weeping I,
Maid forlorn, am like to die.
