I ha' seen them 'mid the clouds on the heather.
Lo! they pause not for love nor for sorrow,
Yet their eyes are as the eyes of a maid to her lover,
When the white hart breaks his cover
And the white wind breaks the morn.

‘'Tis the white stag, Fame, we're a-hunting,
Bid the world's hounds come to horn!’
