On a certain one's departure

‘Time's bitter flood'! Oh, that's all very well,
But where's the old friend hasn't fallen off,
Or slacked his hand-grip when you first gripped fame?
I know your circle and can fairly tell
What you have kept and what you’ve left behind:
I know my circle and know very well
How many faces I'd have out of mind.
