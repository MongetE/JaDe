Eased eyes open, showed leaves.

Eyes laughing and childish
Ran among flowers of leaves 
And looked at light's bridge
Which led from leaf, upward, and back down to leaf.

Eyes uncertain
Tested each semblance
Light seemed to smile.

Eyes ran to the limit
To the last leaf
To the last vein of the least flower-leaf.

Light smiled,
And smiled and smiled

Eyes 
Darkened
Afraid suddenly
