Back once again in wild, wet Monaghan 
Exiled from thought and feeling, 
A mean brutality reigns: 
It is really a horrible position to be in 
And I equate myself with Dante 
And all who have lived outside civilization. 
It isn't a question of place but of people; 
Wordsworth and Coleridge lived apart from the common man, 
Their friends called on them regularly. 
Swift is in a somewhat different category 
He was a genuine exile and his heavy heart 
Weighed him down in Dublin. 
Yet even he had compensations for in the Deanery 
He received many interesting friends 
And it was the eighteenth century. 

I suppose that having to live 
Among men whose rages 
Are for small wet hills full of stones 
When one man buys a patch and pays a high price for it 
That is not the end of his paying. 
"Go home and have another bastard" shout the children, 
Cousin of the underbidder, to the young wife of the purchaser. 
The first child was born after six months of marriage, 
Desperate people, desperate animals. 
What must happen the poor priest 
Somewhat educated who has to believe that these people have souls 
As bright as a poet's - though I don't, mind, speak for myself.
