Who
Are  you
Who is born
In the next room
So  loud  to  my own
That I can hear the womb
Opening  and  the  dark  run
Over the ghost and the dropped son
Behind the wall thin as a wren's bone?
In the birth  bloody room unknown
To the  burn and  turn of time
And the heart print of man
Bows  no  baptism
But dark  alone
Blessing on
The wild
Child.
