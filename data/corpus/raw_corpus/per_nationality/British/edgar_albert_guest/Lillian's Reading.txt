AIRY, fairy Lillian,
What a naughty thing to do,
By noon had read a Laura
Libbey paper novel through.

By four o'clock another
Tale of love and passion trite
She had devoured, and on the third
Was well along by night.

But in the kitchen, Lillian's
Mother toiled with dish and spoon,
Endeavoring to work, and get
A lunch for dad at noon.

She washed the dishes, scrubbed the floors
And made each bed by four,
And even ironed every waist
That lovely Lillian wore.

Thus every Laura Libbey book
That lovely Lillian reads,
Is built on mushy love affairs
And mother's noble deeds.
