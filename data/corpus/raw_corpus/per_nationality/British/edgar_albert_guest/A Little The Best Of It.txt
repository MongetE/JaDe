A LITTLE the best of it,
Allus he prayed for,
All th' time lookin'
Per more than he paid for,
Had an idee, that's
What bargains are made for.

Whatever he sold,
Folks made up their minds to it,
He got th' best of it,
Everyona knew it,
There warn't any trick
Known, but what he could do it.

Sand in th' sugar,
His thumb on the scales,
Short weight in flour
An' ten-penny nails,
Made his own lard,
An' he weighed in th' pails.
Bet when he dies,

An' he makes a clean breast of it,
Tells good St. Peter
His yarn, with the rest of it,
He'll make a plea
For a little th' best of it.
