I'M for the happy man every time,
The man who smiles as he goes his way,
Whether he's up or whether he's down,
I 'm for the man with a grin, I say.
I 'm for the man who can bear his woes
With never a grumbling word or frown,
Who, smiling, gathers the rue or rose â€”
There is the man that you can't keep down.

I 'm for the cheerful man, heart and soul!
His is the hand that I like to grasp;
Who tunes his voice in a merry key,
Not files it down to a bitter rasp.
I 'm for the man who can take the cards
Just as they 're dealt by the hand of fate,
And, good or bad, play an honest game
With a lifted chin and a smile that's great.
