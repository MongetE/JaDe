JUST to do the little things
And do them well from day to day,
Enough of satisfaction brings
To those who tread the simple way;
To make the striving here worth while
They do not ask for glories great,
They're happy with the rank and file
And are content to work and wait.

They seek their homes at close of day
And there find happiness and rest,
They watch their little children play,
And out of life they draw the best.
All unafraid they view the sun
Sink out of sight and night descend,
They miss the cares when day is done,
The sleepless hours that fame attend.
