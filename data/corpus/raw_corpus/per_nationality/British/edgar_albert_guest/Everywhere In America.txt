Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,
Where snow-crowned mountains hold their heads,
the vales where children play,
Beside the bench and whirring lathe, on every
lake and stream
And in the depths of earth below, men share a
common dreamâ€”
The dream our brave forefathers had of freedom
and of right,
And once again in honor's cause, they rally and
unite.

Not somewhere in America is love of country
found,
But east and west and north and south once
more the bugles sound,
And once again, as one, men stand to break
their brother's chains,
And make the world a better place, where only
justice reigns.
The patriotism that is here, is echoed over there,
The hero at a certain post is on guard everywhere.
O'er humble home and mansion rich the starry
banner flies,
And far and near throughout the land the men
of valor rise.

The flag that flutters o'er your home is fluttering
far away
O'er homes that you have never seen. The same
impulses sway
The souls of men in distant states. The red, the
white and blue
Means to one hundred million strong, just what
it means to you.
The self-same courage resolute you feel and
understand
Is throbbing in the breasts of men throughout
this mighty land.
Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,
For justice and for liberty all free men work
and pray.
