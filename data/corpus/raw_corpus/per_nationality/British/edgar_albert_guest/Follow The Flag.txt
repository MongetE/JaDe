Aye, we will follow the Flag
Wherever she goes,
Into the tropic sun,
Into the northern snows;
Go where the guns ring out
Scattering steel and lead,
Painting the hills with blood,
Strewing the fields with dead.
But in each heart must be,
And back of each bitter gun,
Love for the best in life
After the fighting's done.

Aye, we will follow the Flag
Into benighted lands,
Brave in the faith for which,
Proudly, our banner stands.
Life for her life we'll pay,
Blood for her blood we'll give,
Fighting, but not to kill,
Save that the best shall live.
But, when the cannon's roar
Dies in a hymn of peace,
Justice and truth must reign,
Power of the brute must cease.

Aye, we will follow the Flag,
Gladly her work we'll do,
Banishing wrongs of old,
Founding the truth anew.
What though our guns must speak,
What though brave men must die,
Ages of truth to come
All this shall justify.
Men in the charms of peace,
Basking in Freedom's sun,
Some day shall bless our Flag
After our work is done.

Aye, we will follow the Flag
Wherever she goes,
Into the tropic sun,
Into the northern snows.
Fearlessly, on we'll go
Into the cruel strife,
Gladly the few shall die,
Winning for many, life.
Tyranny's wrongs must cease,
Brutes must no longer brag,
This is our work on earth,
So we will follow the Flag.
