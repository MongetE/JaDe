SHE wanted to be asked again,
And so she wiped the dishes,
She took a knife, and with the men
She helped to clean the fishes;
She made her bed and swept the floor,
She ran for water gayly,
She tackled every menial chore,
And pared potatoes daily.

She wanted to be asked again,
She ran to do the shopping,
She toiled from early morn till ten
And never thought of stopping;
She got the meals and met the boat,
She really was a hummer,
By diligence, I 'd have you note,
She earned a pleasant summer.
