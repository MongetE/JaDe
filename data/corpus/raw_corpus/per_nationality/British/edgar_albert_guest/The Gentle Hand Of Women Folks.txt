The gentle hand of women folks
Keeps this old world in line,
It smooths away our bits of care
And makes the struggle fine.
It turns to blue our skies of gray,
It makes our burdens lighter,
And when we feel its soft caress
Life's gloomy spots grow brighter.

The gentle hand of women folks,
Of sister, wife or mother,
Is what makes honest, sturdy men
Of husband, son or brother.
It keeps man fighting to be good,
It cheers him up in sorrow,
It gives him courage to await
The fortunes of tomorrow.

The gentle hand of women folks,
To kindness ever turning,
Soothing with patient tenderness
The brow with fever burning.
Man's best reward for all the strife,
His richest worldly blessing,
The gentle hand of women folks,
Akin to God's caressing.
