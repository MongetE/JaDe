The baby new to earth and sky
Has never until now
Unto himself the question put
Or asked us if the cow

Is higher in the mental scale
Than men like me and you,
Or if the cow refrains from food
Till she finds work to do.

'The baby new to earth and sky,'
As Tennyson has written,
Just goes ahead and sucks a teat
Like to-day's great men in Britain.
