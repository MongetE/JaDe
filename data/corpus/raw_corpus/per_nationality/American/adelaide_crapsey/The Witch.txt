When I was girl by Nilus stream

I watched the deserts stars arise;

My lover, he who dreamed the Sphinx,

Learned all his dreaming from eyes.


I bore in Greece a burning name,

And I have been in Italy

Madonna to a painter-lad,

And mistress to a Medici.


And have you heard (and I have heard)

Of puzzled men with decorous mien,

Who judged - the wench knew far too much -

And burnt her on the Salem green?
