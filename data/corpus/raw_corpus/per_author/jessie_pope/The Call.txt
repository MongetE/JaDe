Who's for the trench-
Are you, my laddie?
Who'll follow French-
Will you, my laddie?Who's fretting to begin,
Who's going out to win?
And who wants to save his skin-
Do you, my laddie?

Who's for the khaki suit-
Are you, my laddie?
Who longs to charge and shoot-
Do you, my laddie?
Who's keen on getting fit,
Who means to show his grit,
And who'd rather wait a bit-
Would you, my laddie?

Who'll earn the Empire's thanks-
Will you, my laddie?Who'll swell the victor's ranks-
Will you, my laddie?When that procession comes,
Banners and rolling drums-
Who'll stand and bite his thumbs-
Will you, my laddie?
