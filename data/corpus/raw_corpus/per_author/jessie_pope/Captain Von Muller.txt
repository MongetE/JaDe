A Skipper of mark was Von Muller,
The humorous naval leg-puller.
With ubiquitous ease
He raided the seas
And his bag became fuller and fuller.

Though now he is finally done, he
Had a nice little run for his money,
And his victims' distress
He would gently suppress
With words that were sweeter than honey.

The high seas brought hazards to suit him,
His laurels, not one will dispute him,
No Briton could crow
Over such a game foe
And his enemy's flag will salute him.
