DOLE THE BELL! BELL THE DOLE!

Whom can these duds attack?
Soapy Sime? Slipp'ry Mac?
Naught but a shirt is there
Such as the fascists wear,
Never the man inside
Moving a nation-wide
Disgust with hokum.

Plenty to right of 'em,
Plenty to left of 'em,
Yeh! What is left of 'em,
Boozy, uncertain.
See how they take it all, .
Down there in Clerkenwall
Readin' th' pypers!

Syrup and soothing dope,
Sure, they can live on hope,
Ain't yeh got precedent ?
Ten years and twelve years gone,
Ten more and nothing done,
GOD save Britannia!
