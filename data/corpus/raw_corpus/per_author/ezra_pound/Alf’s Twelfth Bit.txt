BALLAD FOR THE TIMES' SPECIAL SILVER NUMBER

Sez the Times a silver lining
Is what has set us pining,
Montague, Montague!
In the season sad and weary
When our minds are very bleary,
Montague, Montague!
There is Sir Hen. Deterding
His phrases interlarding,
Montague, Montague!
With the this and that and what
For putting silver on the spot,
Montague, Montague!
Just drop it in the slot
And it will surely boil the pot,
Montague, Montague!
Gold, of course, is solid too,
But some silver set to stew
Might do, too. Montague!
With a lively wood-pulp ‘ad’.

To cheer the bad and sad,
Montague, Montague!
