My songs to sell, sweet maid!

I pray you buy.

Here's one will win a lady's tears,

Here's one will make her gay,

Here's one will charm your true love true

Forever and a day;

Good sir, I pray you buy!


XOh, no, she will not buy.Y


My songs to sell, sweet maid!

I pray you buy.

This one will teach you Lilith's lore,

And this what Helen knew,

And this will keep your gold hair gold,

And this your blue eyes blue;

Sweet maid, I pray you buy!


Oh, no, she will not buy.


If I'd as much money as I could tell,

I never would cry my songs to sell.
I never would cry my songs to sell.
