As I went, as I went
Over the mountains,
I heard, I heard,
Through cloud-wreath and mist,
A hound that was baying -
Death.. it was death.As I went, as I went
Over the meadows,
I heard, I heard,
From thicket, from shadow,
A hidden bird fluting -
Death.. it was death.As I went, as I went
By rocks and by sand-dunes,
I heard, I heard,
At the sea's bottom
A silver fish swimming -
Death.. it was death.As I went, as I went
In my house, in my house,
I heard, I heard,
A footfall, a footfall
Closely behind me -
Death.. it was death.
