When there's good health In the house, there is laughter everywhere,
And the skies are bright and sunny and the roads are smooth and fair,
For the mother croons her ditties, and the father hums a song.
Although heavy be his burdens, he can carry them along.

When there's good health in the house, there are smiles on every hand,
Luck is dancing down the roadway to the music of a band,
Then the hum of wheels is cheery and the daily tasks are fun.
And the toller smiles at evening at the sum of work he's done.

When there's good health in the house, hearts are light and hands are true
And the poor men count their blessings and the rich are happy, too;
Then the cares which life abounds with seem but trifling things and small
And a man can laugh at dangers and go bravely through them all.

When there's good health in the house, in the house he's left behind,
He is happier than a monarch for he's blest with peace of mind.
For with all he has to struggle he is master of his fears,
For the laughter of his children's sweetly ringing in his ears.
