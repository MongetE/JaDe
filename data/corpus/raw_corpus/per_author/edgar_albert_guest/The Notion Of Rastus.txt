DERE never was a man on earth
So wonderful or clever,
Dat ever found a way t' live
On dis ole world forever.

Dere never was a man so rich,
Dat didn't have t' go
When ole man Death came after him
An' crooked his finger, so.

An' den dere never was a man
So great, when he was gone
But what dis good ole world of ours
Jes' kep' a-waggin' on.

An' since dis ole world never stops
When famous men depart,
I' ve come t' de conclusion dat
We ain't so awful smart.
