IT is Slumberland time, and the storms have passed by,
And the sea is now golden and still,
And the big yellow moon has come up in the sky,
And the Sandman is home from the hill.
The fairy boat waits for my baby to start
For the wonderful harbor of dreams,
Where there's never a care for the dear little heart
And the world is as bright as it seems.

It is Slumberland time, and the sighing is done,
The hurts of the day are all well,
The wee childish troubles all passed with the sun,
Now the Sandman is ringing his bell.
The big yellow moon lights the way with his beams
To the land where my baby shall go,
Where the night time's a round of most wonderful dreams
And there's never a sorrow to know.

It is Slumberland time, and the tears are all dried,
And the dream ship is putting to sea,
My baby must sail o'er the rest-ocean wide
Till the morn brings her safely to me.
Toss gently, O Slumberland breezes, her curls,
Be kind to her, fairies, I pray,
Let never a sad dream be my little girl's
Till the sunbeams shall call her to play.
