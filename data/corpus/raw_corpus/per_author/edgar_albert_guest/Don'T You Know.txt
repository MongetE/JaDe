H'it's h'easy to be 'appy,
Don't you know;
There's no sense in being snappy,
Don't you know;
Wot's the use h'of being grumpy,
H'or a bally rotter mumpy?
Folks don't like a fellow dumpy,
Don't you know.
H'every one h'as fits h'of sadness,
Don't you know;
No ones life h'is wholly gladness,
Don't you know;
H'if todye you taste h'of sorrow,
H'or a shilling 'ave to borrow,
Frowning won't 'elp things tomorrow,
Don't you know.
O, a gloomy cus h'is silly,
Don't you know;
'E's a downright balmy Billy,
Don't you know;
H'instead of h'alwyes moping
With 'is lips h'in downward sloping,
'E should smile h'and keep on 'oping,
Don't you know.
O, my word! H'if I were willing,
Don't you know,
H'every time h'I'd lack a shilling,
Don't you know,
H'in me wye so very 'umble,
H'I could start a dismal mumble,
But h'I larf- -h'I never grumble- -
Don't you know.
Tyke the time the guv'or sacked me,
Don't you know;
good h'old chap!  'E'd alwyes backed me,
Don't you know;
'E got 'ot and sent me flying,
Cut me h'off- -there's no use lying- -
But h'I larffed h'instead of crying,
Don't you know.
H'and h'I'm 'ere on h'earth, still grinning,
Don't you know;
Back once more h'at the beginning,
Don't you know;
Tyking life the wye h'I find it,
Never arskin' wot's be'ind it,
Though h'it's 'ard h'I do not mind it,
Don't you know.
