DOWN the lanes of apple bloom, we are treading once again,
Down the pathways rosy red trip the women-folk and men.
Love and laughter lead us on, light of heart as children gay,
June is smiling on us now, bidding us to romp and play.

Sun-kissed now are maiden's curls, bare of head the children run,
Love and laughter call us home when the long day's
toil is done; All our cares are borne away on the breezes, perfume
sweet, Down the lanes of apple bloom now we dance with flying feet.

Through the open door once more comes the pleasant breath of June,
Through the open windows now lullabies that mothers croon,
Caught upon the evening breeze, reach the toilers homeward bound;
Love and laughter rule the world, happiness once more is found.

Down the lanes of apple bloom gray-tressed age goes walking now
Minding less the weight of years or the wrinkles in its brow.
'Tis the evening hour of life, gloriously calm and sweet
June is dwelling in the heart! June is guiding weary feet.
