Show me the boy who never threw
A stone at someone's cat,
Or never hurled a snowball swift
At someone's high silk hat  —
Who never ran away from school,
To seek the swimming hole,
Or slyly from a neighbor's yard
Green apples never stole  —

Show me the boy who never broke
A pane of window glass,
Who never disobeyed the sign
That says: 'Keep off the grass.'
Who never did a thousand things,
That grieve us sore to tell,
And I'll show you a little boy
Who must be far from well.
