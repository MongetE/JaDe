1. Your words dropped into my heart like pebbles into a pool,
2. Rippling around my breast and leaving it melting cool.

3. Your kisses fell sharp on my flesh like dawn-dews from the limb,
4. Of a fruit-filled lemon tree when the day is young and dim.

5. But a silence vasty-deep, oh deeper than all these ties
6. Now, through the menacing miles, brooding between us lies.

7. And more than the songs I sing, I await your written word,
8. To stir my fluent blood as never your presence stirred.
