1. These are the letters which Endymion wrote
2. To one he loved in secret and apart,
3. And now the brawlers of the auction-mart
4. Bargain and bid for each poor blotted note,
5. Aye! for each separate pulse of passion quote
6. The merchant's price! I think they love not art
7. Who break the crystal of a poet's heart,
8. That small and sickly eyes may glare or gloat.
9. Is it not said, that many years ago,
10. In a far Eastern town some soldiers ran
11. With torches through the midnight, and began
12. To wrangle for mean raiment, and to throw
13. Dice for the garments of a wretched man,
14. Not knowing the God's wonder, or his woe?
