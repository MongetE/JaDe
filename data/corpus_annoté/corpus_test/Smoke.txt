2. Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,
3. Lark without song, and messenger of dawn
4. Circling above the hamlets as they nest;

6. Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;
7. By night star-veiling, and by day
8. Darkening the light and blotting out the sun;
9. Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,
10. And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.
