1. All Things will Die

2. Clearly the blue river chimes in its flowing

3. Under my eye;
4. Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing

5. Over the sky.
6. One after another the white clouds are fleeting;
7. Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating

8. Full merrily;
9. Yet all things must die.
10. The stream will cease to flow;
11. The wind will cease to blow;
12. The clouds will cease to fleet;
13. The heart will cease to beat;
14. For all things must die.All things must die.
15. Spring will come never more.
16. O, vanity!
17. Death waits at the door.
18. See! our friends are all forsaking
19. The wine and the merrymaking.
20. We are call’d–we must go.
21. Laid low, very low,
22. In the dark we must lie.
23. The merry glees are still;
24. The voice of the bird
25. Shall no more be heard,
26. Nor the wind on the hill.
27. O, misery!
28. Hark! death is calling
29. While I speak to ye,
30. The jaw is falling,
31. The red cheek paling,
32. The strong limbs failing;
33. Ice with the warm blood mixing;
34. The eyeballs fixing.
35. Nine times goes the passing bell:
36. Ye merry souls, farewell.
37. The old earth
38. Had a birth,
39. As all men know,
40. Long ago.
41. And the old earth must die.
42. So let the warm winds range,
43. And the blue wave beat the shore;
44. For even and morn
45. Ye will never see
46. Thro’ eternity.
47. All things were born.
48. Ye will come never more,
49. For all things must die.
