1. Hark! the dogs howl! the sleetwinds blow,
2. The church-clocks knoll: the hours haste,
3. I leave the dreaming world below.
4. Blown o'er frore heads of hills I go,
5. Long narrowing friths and stripes of snow ÔÇô
6. Time bears my soul into the waste.
7. I seek the voice I loved ÔÇô ah where
8. Is that dear hand that I should press,
9. Those honoured brows that I would kiss?
10. Lo! the broad Heavens cold and bare,
11. The stars that know not my distress.
12. My sighs are wasted in the air,
13. My tears are dropped into the abyss.
14. Now riseth up a little cloud ÔÇô
15. Divideth like a broken wave ÔÇô
16. Shows Death a drooping youth pale-browed
17. And crowned with daisies of the grave.
18. The vapour labours up the sky,
19. Uncertain forms are darkly moved,
20. Larger than human passes by
21. The shadow of the man I loved.
22. I wind my arms for one embrace ÔÇô
23. Can this be he? is that his face?
24. In my strait throat expires the cry.
25. He bends his eyes reproachfully
26. And clasps his hands, as one that prays.
