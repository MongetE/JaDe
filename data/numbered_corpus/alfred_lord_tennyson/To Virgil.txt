1. Written at the Request of the Mantuans for the Nineteenth Centenary of
2. Virgil's Death


3. Roman Virgil, thou that singest
4. Ilion's lofty temples robed in fire,
5. Ilion falling, Rome arising,
6. wars, and filial faith, and Dido's pyre;

7. Landscape-lover, lord of language
8. more than he that sang the Works and Days,
9. All the chosen coin of fancy
10. flashing out from many a golden phrase;

11. Thou that singest wheat and woodland,
12. tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd;
13. All the charm of all the Muses
14. often flowering in a lonely word;

15. Poet of the happy Tityrus
16. piping underneath his beechen bowers;
17. Poet of the poet-satyr
18. whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers;

19. Chanter of the Pollio, glorying
20. in the blissful years again to be,
21. Summers of the snakeless meadow,
22. unlaborious earth and oarless sea;

23. Thou that seest Universal
24. Nature moved by Universal Mind;
25. Thou majestic in thy sadness
26. at the doubtful doom of human kind;

27. Light among the vanished ages;
28. star that gildest yet this phantom shore;
29. Golden branch amid the shadows,
30. kings and realms that pass to rise no more;

31. Now thy Forum roars no longer,
32. fallen every purple Caesar's dome -
33. Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm
34. sound for ever of Imperial Rome -

35. Now the Rome of slaves hath perished,
36. and the Rome of freemen holds her place,
37. I, from out the Northern Island
38. sundered once from all the human race,

39. I salute thee, Mantovano,
40. I that loved thee since my day began,
41. Wielder of the stateliest measure
42. ever moulded by the lips of man.
