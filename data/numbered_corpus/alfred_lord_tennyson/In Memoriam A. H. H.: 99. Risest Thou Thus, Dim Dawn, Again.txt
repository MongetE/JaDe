1. Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,
2. So loud with voices of the birds,
3. So thick with lowings of the herds,
4. Day, when I lost the flower of men;
5. Who tremblest thro' thy darkling red
6. On yon swoll'n brook that bubbles fast
7. By meadows breathing of the past,
8. And woodlands holy to the dead;
9. Who murmurest in the foliaged eaves
10. A song that slights the coming care,
11. And Autumn laying here and there
12. A fiery finger on the leaves;

13. Who wakenest with thy balmy breath
14. To myriads on the genial earth,
15. Memories of bridal, or of birth,
16. And unto myriads more, of death.

17. O wheresoever those may be,
18. Betwixt the slumber of the poles,
19. To-day they count as kindred souls;
20. They know me not, but mourn with me.
