1. O, were I loved as I desire to be!
2. What is there in the great sphere of the earth,
3. Or range of evil between death and birth,
4. That I should fear, - if I were loved by thee!
5. All the inner, all the outer world of pain,
6. Clear love would pierce and cleave, if thou wert mine;
7. As I have heard that somewhere in the main
8. Fresh-water springs come up through bitter brine.
9. 'I were joy, not fear, clasped hand in hand with thee,
10. To wait for death - mute - careless of all ills,
11. Apart upon a mountain, though the surge
12. Of some new deluge from a thousand hills
13. Flung leagues of roaring foam into the gorge
14. Below us, as far on as eye could see.
