1. Pellam the King, who held and lost with Lot
2. In that first war, and had his realm restored
3. But rendered tributary, failed of late
4. To send his tribute; wherefore Arthur called
5. His treasurer, one of many years, and spake,
6. 'Go thou with him and him and bring it to us,
7. Lest we should set one truer on his throne.
8. Man's word is God in man.'
9. His Baron said
10. 'We go but harken:  there be two strange knights

11. Who sit near Camelot at a fountain-side,
12. A mile beneath the forest, challenging
13. And overthrowing every knight who comes.
14. Wilt thou I undertake them as we pass,
15. And send them to thee?'
16. Arthur laughed upon him.
17. 'Old friend, too old to be so young, depart,
18. Delay not thou for aught, but let them sit,
19. Until they find a lustier than themselves.'

20. So these departed.  Early, one fair dawn,
21. The light-winged spirit of his youth returned
22. On Arthur's heart; he armed himself and went,
23. So coming to the fountain-side beheld
24. Balin and Balan sitting statuelike,
25. Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down,
26. From underneath a plume of lady-fern,
27. Sang, and the sand danced at the bottom of it.
28. And on the right of Balin Balin's horse
29. Was fast beside an alder, on the left
30. Of Balan Balan's near a poplartree.
31. 'Fair Sirs,' said Arthur, 'wherefore sit ye here?'
32. Balin and Balan answered 'For the sake
33. Of glory; we be mightier men than all
34. In Arthur's court; that also have we proved;
35. For whatsoever knight against us came
36. Or I or he have easily overthrown.'
37. 'I too,' said Arthur, 'am of Arthur's hall,
38. But rather proven in his Paynim wars
39. Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not,
40. Whether me likewise ye can overthrow.'
41. And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down,
42. And lightly so returned, and no man knew.

43. Then Balin rose, and Balan, and beside
44. The carolling water set themselves again,
45. And spake no word until the shadow turned;
46. When from the fringe of coppice round them burst
47. A spangled pursuivant, and crying 'Sirs,
48. Rise, follow! ye be sent for by the King,'
49. They followed; whom when Arthur seeing asked
50. 'Tell me your names; why sat ye by the well?'
51. Balin the stillness of a minute broke
52. Saying 'An unmelodious name to thee,
53. Balin, "the Savage"--that addition thine--
54. My brother and my better, this man here,
55. Balan.  I smote upon the naked skull
56. A thrall of thine in open hall, my hand
57. Was gauntleted, half slew him; for I heard
58. He had spoken evil of me; thy just wrath
59. Sent me a three-years' exile from thine eyes.
60. I have not lived my life delightsomely:
61. For I that did that violence to thy thrall,
62. Had often wrought some fury on myself,
63. Saving for Balan:  those three kingless years
64. Have past--were wormwood-bitter to me.  King,
65. Methought that if we sat beside the well,
66. And hurled to ground what knight soever spurred
67. Against us, thou would'st take me gladlier back,
68. And make, as ten-times worthier to be thine
69. Than twenty Balins, Balan knight.  I have said.
70. Not so--not all.  A man of thine today
71. Abashed us both, and brake my boast.  Thy will?'
72. Said Arthur 'Thou hast ever spoken truth;
73. Thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie.
74. Rise, my true knight.  As children learn, be thou
75. Wiser for falling! walk with me, and move
76. To music with thine Order and the King.
77. Thy chair, a grief to all the brethren, stands
78. Vacant, but thou retake it, mine again!'

79. Thereafter, when Sir Balin entered hall,
80. The Lost one Found was greeted as in Heaven
81. With joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth
82. Of leaf, and gayest garlandage of flowers,
83. Along the walls and down the board; they sat,
84. And cup clashed cup; they drank and some one sang,
85. Sweet-voiced, a song of welcome, whereupon
86. Their common shout in chorus, mounting, made
87. Those banners of twelve battles overhead
88. Stir, as they stirred of old, when Arthur's host
89. Proclaimed him Victor, and the day was won.

90. Then Balan added to their Order lived
91. A wealthier life than heretofore with these
92. And Balin, till their embassage returned.

93. 'Sir King' they brought report 'we hardly found,
94. So bushed about it is with gloom, the hall
95. Of him to whom ye sent us, Pellam, once
96. A Christless foe of thine as ever dashed
97. Horse against horse; but seeing that thy realm
98. Hath prospered in the name of Christ, the King
99. Took, as in rival heat, to holy things;
100. And finds himself descended from the Saint
101. Arimathan Joseph; him who first
102. Brought the great faith to Britain over seas;
103. He boasts his life as purer than thine own;
104. Eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat;
105. Hath pushed aside his faithful wife, nor lets
106. Or dame or damsel enter at his gates
107. Lest he should be polluted.  This gray King
108. Showed us a shrine wherein were wonders--yea--
109. Rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom,
110. Thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross,
111. And therewithal (for thus he told us) brought
112. By holy Joseph thither, that same spear
113. Wherewith the Roman pierced the side of Christ.
114. He much amazed us; after, when we sought
115. The tribute, answered "I have quite foregone
116. All matters of this world:  Garlon, mine heir,
117. Of him demand it," which this Garlon gave
118. With much ado, railing at thine and thee.

119. 'But when we left, in those deep woods we found
120. A knight of thine spear-stricken from behind,
121. Dead, whom we buried; more than one of us
122. Cried out on Garlon, but a woodman there
123. Reported of some demon in the woods
124. Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues
125. From all his fellows, lived alone, and came
126. To learn black magic, and to hate his kind
127. With such a hate, that when he died, his soul
128. Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life
129. Was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence,
130. Strikes from behind.  This woodman showed the cave
131. From which he sallies, and wherein he dwelt.
132. We saw the hoof-print of a horse, no more.'

133. Then Arthur, 'Let who goes before me, see
134. He do not fall behind me:  foully slain
135. And villainously! who will hunt for me
136. This demon of the woods?'  Said Balan, 'I'!
137. So claimed the quest and rode away, but first,
138. Embracing Balin, 'Good my brother, hear!
139. Let not thy moods prevail, when I am gone
140. Who used to lay them! hold them outer fiends,
141. Who leap at thee to tear thee; shake them aside,
142. Dreams ruling when wit sleeps! yea, but to dream
143. That any of these would wrong thee, wrongs thyself.
144. Witness their flowery welcome.  Bound are they
145. To speak no evil.  Truly save for fears,
146. My fears for thee, so rich a fellowship
147. Would make me wholly blest:  thou one of them,
148. Be one indeed:  consider them, and all
149. Their bearing in their common bond of love,
150. No more of hatred than in Heaven itself,
151. No more of jealousy than in Paradise.'

152. So Balan warned, and went; Balin remained:
153. Who--for but three brief moons had glanced away
154. From being knighted till he smote the thrall,
155. And faded from the presence into years
156. Of exile--now would strictlier set himself
157. To learn what Arthur meant by courtesy,
158. Manhood, and knighthood; wherefore hovered round
159. Lancelot, but when he marked his high sweet smile
160. In passing, and a transitory word
161. Make knight or churl or child or damsel seem
162. From being smiled at happier in themselves--
163. Sighed, as a boy lame-born beneath a height,
164. That glooms his valley, sighs to see the peak
165. Sun-flushed, or touch at night the northern star;
166. For one from out his village lately climed
167. And brought report of azure lands and fair,
168. Far seen to left and right; and he himself
169. Hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet
170. Up from the base:  so Balin marvelling oft
171. How far beyond him Lancelot seemed to move,
172. Groaned, and at times would mutter, 'These be gifts,
173. Born with the blood, not learnable, divine,
174. Beyond MY reach.  Well had I foughten--well--
175. In those fierce wars, struck hard--and had I crowned
176. With my slain self the heaps of whom I slew--
177. So--better!--But this worship of the Queen,
178. That honour too wherein she holds him--this,
179. This was the sunshine that hath given the man
180. A growth, a name that branches o'er the rest,
181. And strength against all odds, and what the King
182. So prizes--overprizes--gentleness.
183. Her likewise would I worship an I might.
184. I never can be close with her, as he
185. That brought her hither.  Shall I pray the King
186. To let me bear some token of his Queen
187. Whereon to gaze, remembering her--forget
188. My heats and violences? live afresh?
189. What, if the Queen disdained to grant it! nay
190. Being so stately-gentle, would she make
191. My darkness blackness? and with how sweet grace
192. She greeted my return!  Bold will I be--
193. Some goodly cognizance of Guinevere,
194. In lieu of this rough beast upon my shield,
195. Langued gules, and toothed with grinning savagery.'

196. And Arthur, when Sir Balin sought him, said
197. 'What wilt thou bear?' Balin was bold, and asked
198. To bear her own crown-royal upon shield,
199. Whereat she smiled and turned her to the King,
200. Who answered 'Thou shalt put the crown to use.
201. The crown is but the shadow of the King,
202. And this a shadow's shadow, let him have it,
203. So this will help him of his violences!'
204. 'No shadow' said Sir Balin 'O my Queen,
205. But light to me! no shadow, O my King,
206. But golden earnest of a gentler life!'

207. So Balin bare the crown, and all the knights
208. Approved him, and the Queen, and all the world
209. Made music, and he felt his being move
210. In music with his Order, and the King.

211. The nightingale, full-toned in middle May,
212. Hath ever and anon a note so thin
213. It seems another voice in other groves;
214. Thus, after some quick burst of sudden wrath,
215. The music in him seemed to change, and grow
216. Faint and far-off.
217. And once he saw the thrall
218. His passion half had gauntleted to death,
219. That causer of his banishment and shame,
220. Smile at him, as he deemed, presumptuously:
221. His arm half rose to strike again, but fell:
222. The memory of that cognizance on shield
223. Weighted it down, but in himself he moaned:

224. 'Too high this mount of Camelot for me:
225. These high-set courtesies are not for me.
226. Shall I not rather prove the worse for these?
227. Fierier and stormier from restraining, break
228. Into some madness even before the Queen?'

229. Thus, as a hearth lit in a mountain home,
230. And glancing on the window, when the gloom
231. Of twilight deepens round it, seems a flame
232. That rages in the woodland far below,
233. So when his moods were darkened, court and King
234. And all the kindly warmth of Arthur's hall
235. Shadowed an angry distance:  yet he strove
236. To learn the graces of their Table, fought
237. Hard with himself, and seemed at length in peace.

238. Then chanced, one morning, that Sir Balin sat
239. Close-bowered in that garden nigh the hall.
240. A walk of roses ran from door to door;
241. A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:
242. And down that range of roses the great Queen
243. Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;
244. And all in shadow from the counter door
245. Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,
246. As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced
247. The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.
248. Followed the Queen; Sir Balin heard her 'Prince,
249. Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,
250. As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?'
251. To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,
252. 'Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen.'
253. 'Yea so' she said 'but so to pass me by--
254. So loyal scarce is loyal to thyself,
255. Whom all men rate the king of courtesy.
256. Let be:  ye stand, fair lord, as in a dream.'

257. Then Lancelot with his hand among the flowers
258. 'Yea--for a dream.  Last night methought I saw
259. That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand
260. In yonder shrine.  All round her prest the dark,
261. And all the light upon her silver face
262. Flowed from the spiritual lily that she held.
263. Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes--away:
264. For see, how perfect-pure!  As light a flush
265. As hardly tints the blossom of the quince
266. Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood.'

267. 'Sweeter to me' she said 'this garden rose
268. Deep-hued and many-folded! sweeter still
269. The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.
270. Prince, we have ridden before among the flowers
271. In those fair days--not all as cool as these,
272. Though season-earlier.  Art thou sad? or sick?
273. Our noble King will send thee his own leech--
274. Sick? or for any matter angered at me?'

275. Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they dwelt
276. Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall:  her hue
277. Changed at his gaze:  so turning side by side
278. They past, and Balin started from his bower.

279. 'Queen? subject? but I see not what I see.
280. Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.
281. My father hath begotten me in his wrath.
282. I suffer from the things before me, know,
283. Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;
284. A churl, a clown!' and in him gloom on gloom
285. Deepened:  he sharply caught his lance and shield,
286. Nor stayed to crave permission of the King,
287. But, mad for strange adventure, dashed away.

288. He took the selfsame track as Balan, saw
289. The fountain where they sat together, sighed
290. 'Was I not better there with him?' and rode
291. The skyless woods, but under open blue
292. Came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough
293. Wearily hewing.  'Churl, thine axe!' he cried,
294. Descended, and disjointed it at a blow:
295. To whom the woodman uttered wonderingly
296. 'Lord, thou couldst lay the Devil of these woods
297. If arm of flesh could lay him.'  Balin cried
298. 'Him, or the viler devil who plays his part,
299. To lay that devil would lay the Devil in me.'
300. 'Nay' said the churl, 'our devil is a truth,
301. I saw the flash of him but yestereven.
302. And some DO say that our Sir Garlon too
303. Hath learned black magic, and to ride unseen.
304. Look to the cave.'  But Balin answered him
305. 'Old fabler, these be fancies of the churl,
306. Look to thy woodcraft,' and so leaving him,
307. Now with slack rein and careless of himself,
308. Now with dug spur and raving at himself,
309. Now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode;
310. So marked not on his right a cavern-chasm
311. Yawn over darkness, where, nor far within,
312. The whole day died, but, dying, gleamed on rocks
313. Roof-pendent, sharp; and others from the floor,
314. Tusklike, arising, made that mouth of night
315. Whereout the Demon issued up from Hell.
316. He marked not this, but blind and deaf to all
317. Save that chained rage, which ever yelpt within,
318. Past eastward from the falling sun.  At once
319. He felt the hollow-beaten mosses thud
320. And tremble, and then the shadow of a spear,
321. Shot from behind him, ran along the ground.
322. Sideways he started from the path, and saw,
323. With pointed lance as if to pierce, a shape,
324. A light of armour by him flash, and pass
325. And vanish in the woods; and followed this,
326. But all so blind in rage that unawares
327. He burst his lance against a forest bough,
328. Dishorsed himself, and rose again, and fled
329. Far, till the castle of a King, the hall
330. Of Pellam, lichen-bearded, grayly draped
331. With streaming grass, appeared, low-built but strong;
332. The ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss,
333. The battlement overtopt with ivytods,
334. A home of bats, in every tower an owl.
335. Then spake the men of Pellam crying 'Lord,
336. Why wear ye this crown-royal upon shield?'
337. Said Balin 'For the fairest and the best
338. Of ladies living gave me this to bear.'
339. So stalled his horse, and strode across the court,
340. But found the greetings both of knight and King
341. Faint in the low dark hall of banquet:  leaves
342. Laid their green faces flat against the panes,
343. Sprays grated, and the cankered boughs without
344. Whined in the wood; for all was hushed within,
345. Till when at feast Sir Garlon likewise asked
346. 'Why wear ye that crown-royal?' Balin said
347. 'The Queen we worship, Lancelot, I, and all,
348. As fairest, best and purest, granted me
349. To bear it!'  Such a sound (for Arthur's knights
350. Were hated strangers in the hall) as makes
351. The white swan-mother, sitting, when she hears
352. A strange knee rustle through her secret reeds,
353. Made Garlon, hissing; then he sourly smiled.
354. 'Fairest I grant her:  I have seen; but best,
355. Best, purest? THOU from Arthur's hall, and yet
356. So simple! hast thou eyes, or if, are these
357. So far besotted that they fail to see
358. This fair wife-worship cloaks a secret shame?
359. Truly, ye men of Arthur be but babes.'

360. A goblet on the board by Balin, bossed
361. With holy Joseph's legend, on his right
362. Stood, all of massiest bronze:  one side had sea
363. And ship and sail and angels blowing on it:
364. And one was rough with wattling, and the walls
365. Of that low church he built at Glastonbury.
366. This Balin graspt, but while in act to hurl,
367. Through memory of that token on the shield
368. Relaxed his hold:  'I will be gentle' he thought
369. 'And passing gentle' caught his hand away,
370. Then fiercely to Sir Garlon 'Eyes have I
371. That saw today the shadow of a spear,
372. Shot from behind me, run along the ground;
373. Eyes too that long have watched how Lancelot draws
374. From homage to the best and purest, might,
375. Name, manhood, and a grace, but scantly thine,
376. Who, sitting in thine own hall, canst endure
377. To mouth so huge a foulness--to thy guest,
378. Me, me of Arthur's Table.  Felon talk!
379. Let be! no more!'
380. But not the less by night
381. The scorn of Garlon, poisoning all his rest,
382. Stung him in dreams.  At length, and dim through leaves
383. Blinkt the white morn, sprays grated, and old boughs
384. Whined in the wood.  He rose, descended, met
385. The scorner in the castle court, and fain,
386. For hate and loathing, would have past him by;
387. But when Sir Garlon uttered mocking-wise;
388. 'What, wear ye still that same crown-scandalous?'
389. His countenance blackened, and his forehead veins
390. Bloated, and branched; and tearing out of sheath
391. The brand, Sir Balin with a fiery 'Ha!
392. So thou be shadow, here I make thee ghost,'
393. Hard upon helm smote him, and the blade flew
394. Splintering in six, and clinkt upon the stones.
395. Then Garlon, reeling slowly backward, fell,
396. And Balin by the banneret of his helm
397. Dragged him, and struck, but from the castle a cry
398. Sounded across the court, and--men-at-arms,
399. A score with pointed lances, making at him--
400. He dashed the pummel at the foremost face,
401. Beneath a low door dipt, and made his feet
402. Wings through a glimmering gallery, till he marked
403. The portal of King Pellam's chapel wide
404. And inward to the wall; he stept behind;
405. Thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves
406. Howling; but while he stared about the shrine,
407. In which he scarce could spy the Christ for Saints,
408. Beheld before a golden altar lie
409. The longest lance his eyes had ever seen,
410. Point-painted red; and seizing thereupon
411. Pushed through an open casement down, leaned on it,
412. Leapt in a semicircle, and lit on earth;
413. Then hand at ear, and harkening from what side
414. The blindfold rummage buried in the walls
415. Might echo, ran the counter path, and found
416. His charger, mounted on him and away.
417. An arrow whizzed to the right, one to the left,
418. One overhead; and Pellam's feeble cry
419. 'Stay, stay him! he defileth heavenly things
420. With earthly uses'--made him quickly dive
421. Beneath the boughs, and race through many a mile
422. Of dense and open, till his goodly horse,
423. Arising wearily at a fallen oak,
424. Stumbled headlong, and cast him face to ground.

425. Half-wroth he had not ended, but all glad,
426. Knightlike, to find his charger yet unlamed,
427. Sir Balin drew the shield from off his neck,
428. Stared at the priceless cognizance, and thought
429. 'I have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me,
430. Thee will I bear no more,' high on a branch
431. Hung it, and turned aside into the woods,
432. And there in gloom cast himself all along,
433. Moaning 'My violences, my violences!'

434. But now the wholesome music of the wood
435. Was dumbed by one from out the hall of Mark,
436. A damsel-errant, warbling, as she rode
437. The woodland alleys, Vivien, with her Squire.

438. 'The fire of Heaven has killed the barren cold,
439. And kindled all the plain and all the wold.
440. The new leaf ever pushes off the old.
441. The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.

442. 'Old priest, who mumble worship in your quire--
443. Old monk and nun, ye scorn the world's desire,
444. Yet in your frosty cells ye feel the fire!
445. The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.

446. 'The fire of Heaven is on the dusty ways.
447. The wayside blossoms open to the blaze.
448. The whole wood-world is one full peal of praise.
449. The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.

450. 'The fire of Heaven is lord of all things good,
451. And starve not thou this fire within thy blood,
452. But follow Vivien through the fiery flood!
453. The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell!'

454. Then turning to her Squire 'This fire of Heaven,
455. This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,
456. And beat the cross to earth, and break the King
457. And all his Table.'
458. Then they reached a glade,
459. Where under one long lane of cloudless air
460. Before another wood, the royal crown
461. Sparkled, and swaying upon a restless elm
462. Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire;
463. Amazed were these; 'Lo there' she cried--'a crown--
464. Borne by some high lord-prince of Arthur's hall,
465. And there a horse! the rider? where is he?
466. See, yonder lies one dead within the wood.
467. Not dead; he stirs!--but sleeping.  I will speak.
468. Hail, royal knight, we break on thy sweet rest,
469. Not, doubtless, all unearned by noble deeds.
470. But bounden art thou, if from Arthur's hall,
471. To help the weak.  Behold, I fly from shame,
472. A lustful King, who sought to win my love
473. Through evil ways:  the knight, with whom I rode,
474. Hath suffered misadventure, and my squire
475. Hath in him small defence; but thou, Sir Prince,
476. Wilt surely guide me to the warrior King,
477. Arthur the blameless, pure as any maid,
478. To get me shelter for my maidenhood.
479. I charge thee by that crown upon thy shield,
480. And by the great Queen's name, arise and hence.'

481. And Balin rose, 'Thither no more! nor Prince
482. Nor knight am I, but one that hath defamed
483. The cognizance she gave me:  here I dwell
484. Savage among the savage woods, here die--
485. Die:  let the wolves' black maws ensepulchre
486. Their brother beast, whose anger was his lord.
487. O me, that such a name as Guinevere's,
488. Which our high Lancelot hath so lifted up,
489. And been thereby uplifted, should through me,
490. My violence, and my villainy, come to shame.'

491. Thereat she suddenly laughed and shrill, anon
492. Sighed all as suddenly.  Said Balin to her
493. 'Is this thy courtesy--to mock me, ha?
494. Hence, for I will not with thee.'  Again she sighed
495. 'Pardon, sweet lord! we maidens often laugh
496. When sick at heart, when rather we should weep.
497. I knew thee wronged.  I brake upon thy rest,
498. And now full loth am I to break thy dream,
499. But thou art man, and canst abide a truth,
500. Though bitter.  Hither, boy--and mark me well.
501. Dost thou remember at Caerleon once--
502. A year ago--nay, then I love thee not--
503. Ay, thou rememberest well--one summer dawn--
504. By the great tower--Caerleon upon Usk--
505. Nay, truly we were hidden:  this fair lord,
506. The flower of all their vestal knighthood, knelt
507. In amorous homage--knelt--what else?--O ay
508. Knelt, and drew down from out his night-black hair
509. And mumbled that white hand whose ringed caress
510. Had wandered from her own King's golden head,
511. And lost itself in darkness, till she cried--
512. I thought the great tower would crash down on both--
513. "Rise, my sweet King, and kiss me on the lips,
514. Thou art my King."  This lad, whose lightest word
515. Is mere white truth in simple nakedness,
516. Saw them embrace:  he reddens, cannot speak,
517. So bashful, he! but all the maiden Saints,
518. The deathless mother-maidenhood of Heaven,
519. Cry out upon her.  Up then, ride with me!
520. Talk not of shame! thou canst not, an thou would'st,
521. Do these more shame than these have done themselves.'

522. She lied with ease; but horror-stricken he,
523. Remembering that dark bower at Camelot,
524. Breathed in a dismal whisper 'It is truth.'

525. Sunnily she smiled 'And even in this lone wood,
526. Sweet lord, ye do right well to whisper this.
527. Fools prate, and perish traitors.  Woods have tongues,
528. As walls have ears:  but thou shalt go with me,
529. And we will speak at first exceeding low.
530. Meet is it the good King be not deceived.
531. See now, I set thee high on vantage ground,
532. From whence to watch the time, and eagle-like
533. Stoop at thy will on Lancelot and the Queen.'

534. She ceased; his evil spirit upon him leapt,
535. He ground his teeth together, sprang with a yell,
536. Tore from the branch, and cast on earth, the shield,
537. Drove his mailed heel athwart the royal crown,
538. Stampt all into defacement, hurled it from him
539. Among the forest weeds, and cursed the tale,
540. The told-of, and the teller.
541. That weird yell,
542. Unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast,
543. Thrilled through the woods; and Balan lurking there
544. (His quest was unaccomplished) heard and thought
545. 'The scream of that Wood-devil I came to quell!'
546. Then nearing 'Lo! he hath slain some brother-knight,
547. And tramples on the goodly shield to show
548. His loathing of our Order and the Queen.
549. My quest, meseems, is here.  Or devil or man
550. Guard thou thine head.'  Sir Balin spake not word,
551. But snatched a sudden buckler from the Squire,
552. And vaulted on his horse, and so they crashed
553. In onset, and King Pellam's holy spear,
554. Reputed to be red with sinless blood,
555. Redded at once with sinful, for the point
556. Across the maiden shield of Balan pricked
557. The hauberk to the flesh; and Balin's horse
558. Was wearied to the death, and, when they clashed,
559. Rolling back upon Balin, crushed the man
560. Inward, and either fell, and swooned away.

561. Then to her Squire muttered the damsel 'Fools!
562. This fellow hath wrought some foulness with his Queen:
563. Else never had he borne her crown, nor raved
564. And thus foamed over at a rival name:
565. But thou, Sir Chick, that scarce hast broken shell,
566. Art yet half-yolk, not even come to down--
567. Who never sawest Caerleon upon Usk--
568. And yet hast often pleaded for my love--
569. See what I see, be thou where I have been,
570. Or else Sir Chick--dismount and loose their casques
571. I fain would know what manner of men they be.'
572. And when the Squire had loosed them, 'Goodly!--look!
573. They might have cropt the myriad flower of May,
574. And butt each other here, like brainless bulls,
575. Dead for one heifer!
576. Then the gentle Squire
577. 'I hold them happy, so they died for love:
578. And, Vivien, though ye beat me like your dog,
579. I too could die, as now I live, for thee.'

580. 'Live on, Sir Boy,' she cried.  'I better prize
581. The living dog than the dead lion:  away!
582. I cannot brook to gaze upon the dead.'
583. Then leapt her palfrey o'er the fallen oak,
584. And bounding forward 'Leave them to the wolves.'

585. But when their foreheads felt the cooling air,
586. Balin first woke, and seeing that true face,
587. Familiar up from cradle-time, so wan,
588. Crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay,
589. And on his dying brother cast himself
590. Dying; and HE lifted faint eyes; he felt
591. One near him; all at once they found the world,
592. Staring wild-wide; then with a childlike wail
593. And drawing down the dim disastrous brow
594. That o'er him hung, he kissed it, moaned and spake;

595. 'O Balin, Balin, I that fain had died
596. To save thy life, have brought thee to thy death.
597. Why had ye not the shield I knew? and why
598. Trampled ye thus on that which bare the Crown?'

599. Then Balin told him brokenly, and in gasps,
600. All that had chanced, and Balan moaned again.

601. 'Brother, I dwelt a day in Pellam's hall:
602. This Garlon mocked me, but I heeded not.
603. And one said "Eat in peace! a liar is he,
604. And hates thee for the tribute!" this good knight
605. Told me, that twice a wanton damsel came,
606. And sought for Garlon at the castle-gates,
607. Whom Pellam drove away with holy heat.
608. I well believe this damsel, and the one
609. Who stood beside thee even now, the same.
610. "She dwells among the woods" he said "and meets
611. And dallies with him in the Mouth of Hell."
612. Foul are their lives; foul are their lips; they lied.
613. Pure as our own true Mother is our Queen."

614. 'O brother' answered Balin 'woe is me!
615. My madness all thy life has been thy doom,
616. Thy curse, and darkened all thy day; and now
617. The night has come.  I scarce can see thee now.

618. Goodnight! for we shall never bid again
619. Goodmorrow--Dark my doom was here, and dark
620. It will be there.  I see thee now no more.
621. I would not mine again should darken thine,
622. Goodnight, true brother.
623. Balan answered low
624. 'Goodnight, true brother here! goodmorrow there!
625. We two were born together, and we die
626. Together by one doom:' and while he spoke
627. Closed his death-drowsing eyes, and slept the sleep
628. With Balin, either locked in either's arm.
