1. Love is and was my Lord and King,
2. And in his presence I attend
3. To hear the tidings of my friend,
4. Which every hour his couriers bring.
5. Love is and was my King and Lord,
6. And will be, tho' as yet I keep
7. Within his court on earth, and sleep
8. Encompass'd by his faithful guard,
9. And hear at times a sentinel
10. Who moves about from place to place,
11. And whispers to the worlds of space,
12. In the deep night, that all is well.
