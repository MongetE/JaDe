1. I.
2. THOU who stealest fire,
3. From the fountains of the past,
4. To glorify the present, oh, haste,
5. Visit my low desire!
6. Strengthen me, enlighten me!
7. I faint in this obscurity,
8. Thou dewy dawn of memory.
9. II.
10. Come not as thou camest of late,
11. Flinging the gloom of yesternight
12. On the white day, but robed in soften’d light
13. Of orient state.
14. Whilome thou camest with the morning mist,
15. Even as a maid, whose stately brow
16. The dew-impearled winds of dawn have kiss’d,
17. When she, as thou,
18. Stays on her floating locks the lovely freight
19. Of overflowing blooms, and earliest shoots
20. Of orient green, giving safe pledge of fruits,
21. Which in wintertide shall star
22. The black earth with brilliance rare.

23. III.
24. Whilome thou camest with the morning mist,
25. And with the evening cloud,
26. Showering thy gleaned wealth into my open breast;
27. Those peerless flowers which in the rudest wind
28. Never grow sere,
29. When rooted in the garden of the mind,
30. Because they are the earliest of the year.
31. Nor was the night thy shroud.
32. In sweet dreams softer than unbroken rest
33. Thou leddest by the hand thine infant Hope.
34. The eddying of her garments caught from thee
35. The light of thy great presence; and the cope
36. Of the half-attain’d futurity,
37. Tho’ deep not fathomless,
38. Was cloven with the million stars which tremble
39. O’er the deep mind of dauntless infancy.
40. Small thought was there of life’s distress;
41. For sure she deem’d no mist of earth could dull
42. Those spirit-thrilling eyes so keen and beautiful;
43. Sure she was nigher to heaven’s spheres,
44. Listening the lordly music flowing from
45. The illimitable years.
46. O strengthen me, enlighten me!
47. I faint in this obscurity,
48. Thou dewy dawn of memory.
49. IV.
50. Come forth, I charge thee, arise,
51. Thou of the many tongues, the myriad eyes!
52. Thou comest not with shows of flaunting vines
53. Unto mine inner eye,
54. Divinest Memory!
55. Thou wert not nursed by the waterfall
56. Which ever sounds and shines
57. A pillar of white light upon the wall
58. Of purple cliffs, aloof descried:
59. Come from the woods that belt the gray hillside,
60. The seven elms, the poplars four
61. That stand beside my father’s door,
62. And chiefly from the brook that loves
63. To purl o’er matted cress and ribbed sand,
64. Or dimple in the dark of rushy coves,
65. Drawing into his narrow earthen urn,
66. In every elbow and turn,
67. The filter’d tribute of the rough woodland;
68. O! hither lead thy feet!
69. Pour round mine ears the livelong bleat
70. Of the thick-fleeced sheep from wattled folds,
71. Upon the ridged wolds,
72. When the first matin-song hath waken’d loud
73. Over the dark dewy earth forlorn,
74. What time the amber morn
75. Forth gushes from beneath a low-hung cloud.

76. V.
77. Large dowries doth the raptured eye
78. To the young spirit present
79. When first she is wed,
80. And like a bride of old,
81. In triumph led,
82. With music and sweet showers
83. Of festal flowers,
84. Unto the dwelling she must sway.
85. Well hast thou done, great artist Memory.
86. In setting round thy first experiment
87. With royal framework of wrought gold;
88. Needs must thou dearly love thy first essay,
89. And foremost in thy various gallery
90. Place it, where sweetest sunlight falls
91. Upon the storied walls;
92. For the discovery
93. And newness of thine art so pleased thee,
94. That all which thou hast drawn of fairest
95. Or boldest since but lightly weighs
96. With thee unto the love thou bearest
97. The first-born of thy genius. Artist-like,
98. Ever retiring thou dost gaze
99. On the prime labor of thine early days,
100. No matter what the sketch might be:
101. Whether the high field on the bushless pike,
102. Or even a sand-built ridge
103. Of heaped hills that mound the sea,
104. Overblown with murmurs harsh,
105. Or even a lowly cottage whence we see
106. Stretch’d wide and wild the waste enormous marsh,
107. Where from the frequent bridge,
108. Like emblems of infinity,
109. The trenched waters run from sky to sky;
110. Or a garden bower’d close
111. With plaited alleys of the trailing rose,
112. Long alleys falling down to twilight grots,
113. Or opening upon level plots
114. Of crowned lilies, standing near
115. Purple-spiked lavender:
116. Whither in after life retired
117. From brawling storms,
118. From weary wind,
119. With youthful fancy re-inspired,
120. We may hold converse with all forms
121. Of the many-sided mind,
122. And those whom passion hath not blinded,
123. Subtle-thoughted, myriad-minded.
124. My friend, with you to live alone
125. Were how much better than to own
126. A crown, a sceptre, and a throne!

127. O strengthen me, englighten me!
128. I faint in this obscurity,
129. Thou dewy dawn of memory.
