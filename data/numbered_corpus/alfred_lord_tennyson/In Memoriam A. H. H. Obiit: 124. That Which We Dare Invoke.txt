1. That which we dare invoke to bless;
2. Our dearest faith; our ghastliest doubt;
3. He, They, One, All; within, without;
4. The Power in darkness whom we guess;
5. I found Him not in world or sun,
6. Or eagle's wing, or insect's eye;
7. Nor thro' the questions men may try,
8. The petty cobwebs we have spun:
9. If e'er when faith had fall'n asleep,
10. I heard a voice, "Believe no more,"
11. And heard an ever-breaking shore
12. That tumbled in the Godless deep,

13. A warmth within the breast would melt
14. The freezing reason's colder part,
15. And like a man in wrath the heart
16. Stood up and answer'd, "I have felt."

17. No, like a child in doubt and fear:
18. But that blind clamour made me wise;
19. Then was I as a child that cries,
20. But crying, knows his father near;

21. And what I am beheld again
22. What is, and no man understands;
23. And out of darkness came the hands
24. That reach thro' nature, moulding men.
