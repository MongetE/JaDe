1. O maiden, fresher than the first green leaf
2. With which the fearful springtide flecks the lea,
3. Weep not, Almeida, that I said to thee
4. That thou hast half my heart, for bitter grief
5. Doth hold the other half in sovranty.
6. Thou art my heart's sun in love's crystalline:
7. Yet on both sides at once thou canst not shine:
8. Thine is the bright side of my heart, and thine
9. My heart's day, but the shadow of my heart,
10. Issue of its own substance, my heart's night
11. Thou canst not lighten even with thy light,
12. All powerful in beauty as thou art.
13. Almeida, if my heart were substanceless,
14. Then might thy rays pass thro' to the other side,
15. So swiftly, that they nowhere would abide,
16. But lose themselves in utter emptiness.
17. Half-light, half-shadow, let my spirit sleep
18. They never learnt to love who never knew to weep.
