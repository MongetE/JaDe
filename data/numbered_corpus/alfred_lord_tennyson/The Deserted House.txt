1. Life and Thought have gone away
2. Side by side,
3. Leaving door and windows wide.
4. Careless tenants they!

5. All within is dark as night:
6. In the windows is no light;
7. And no murmur at the door,
8. So frequent on its hinge before.

9. Close the door; the shutters close;
10. Or through the windows we shall see
11. The nakedness and vacancy
12. Of the dark deserted house.

13. Come away: no more of mirth
14. Is here or merry-making sound.
15. The house was builded of the earth,
16. And shall fall again to ground.

17. Come away: for Life and Thought
18. Here no longer dwell;
19. But in a city glorious -
20. A great and distant city -have bought
21. A mansion incorruptible.
22. Would they could have stayed with us!
