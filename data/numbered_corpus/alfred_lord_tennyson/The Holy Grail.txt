1. From noiseful arms, and acts of prowess done
2. In tournament or tilt, Sir Percivale,
3. Whom Arthur and his knighthood called The Pure,
4. Had passed into the silent life of prayer,
5. Praise, fast, and alms; and leaving for the cowl
6. The helmet in an abbey far away
7. From Camelot, there, and not long after, died.

8. And one, a fellow-monk among the rest,
9. Ambrosius, loved him much beyond the rest,
10. And honoured him, and wrought into his heart
11. A way by love that wakened love within,
12. To answer that which came:  and as they sat
13. Beneath a world-old yew-tree, darkening half
14. The cloisters, on a gustful April morn
15. That puffed the swaying branches into smoke
16. Above them, ere the summer when he died
17. The monk Ambrosius questioned Percivale:

18. `O brother, I have seen this yew-tree smoke,
19. Spring after spring, for half a hundred years:
20. For never have I known the world without,
21. Nor ever strayed beyond the pale:  but thee,
22. When first thou camest--such a courtesy
23. Spake through the limbs and in the voice--I knew
24. For one of those who eat in Arthur's hall;
25. For good ye are and bad, and like to coins,
26. Some true, some light, but every one of you
27. Stamped with the image of the King; and now
28. Tell me, what drove thee from the Table Round,
29. My brother? was it earthly passion crost?'

30. `Nay,' said the knight; `for no such passion mine.
31. But the sweet vision of the Holy Grail
32. Drove me from all vainglories, rivalries,
33. And earthly heats that spring and sparkle out
34. Among us in the jousts, while women watch
35. Who wins, who falls; and waste the spiritual strength
36. Within us, better offered up to Heaven.'

37. To whom the monk:  `The Holy Grail!--I trust
38. We are green in Heaven's eyes; but here too much
39. We moulder--as to things without I mean--
40. Yet one of your own knights, a guest of ours,
41. Told us of this in our refectory,
42. But spake with such a sadness and so low
43. We heard not half of what he said.  What is it?
44. The phantom of a cup that comes and goes?'

45. `Nay, monk! what phantom?' answered Percivale.
46. `The cup, the cup itself, from which our Lord
47. Drank at the last sad supper with his own.
48. This, from the blessd land of Aromat--
49. After the day of darkness, when the dead
50. Went wandering o'er Moriah--the good saint
51. Arimathan Joseph, journeying brought
52. To Glastonbury, where the winter thorn
53. Blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord.
54. And there awhile it bode; and if a man
55. Could touch or see it, he was healed at once,
56. By faith, of all his ills.  But then the times
57. Grew to such evil that the holy cup
58. Was caught away to Heaven, and disappeared.'

59. To whom the monk:  `From our old books I know
60. That Joseph came of old to Glastonbury,
61. And there the heathen Prince, Arviragus,
62. Gave him an isle of marsh whereon to build;
63. And there he built with wattles from the marsh
64. A little lonely church in days of yore,
65. For so they say, these books of ours, but seem
66. Mute of this miracle, far as I have read.
67. But who first saw the holy thing today?'

68. `A woman,' answered Percivale, `a nun,
69. And one no further off in blood from me
70. Than sister; and if ever holy maid
71. With knees of adoration wore the stone,
72. A holy maid; though never maiden glowed,
73. But that was in her earlier maidenhood,
74. With such a fervent flame of human love,
75. Which being rudely blunted, glanced and shot
76. Only to holy things; to prayer and praise
77. She gave herself, to fast and alms.  And yet,
78. Nun as she was, the scandal of the Court,
79. Sin against Arthur and the Table Round,
80. And the strange sound of an adulterous race,
81. Across the iron grating of her cell
82. Beat, and she prayed and fasted all the more.

83. `And he to whom she told her sins, or what
84. Her all but utter whiteness held for sin,
85. A man wellnigh a hundred winters old,
86. Spake often with her of the Holy Grail,
87. A legend handed down through five or six,
88. And each of these a hundred winters old,
89. From our Lord's time.  And when King Arthur made
90. His Table Round, and all men's hearts became
91. Clean for a season, surely he had thought
92. That now the Holy Grail would come again;
93. But sin broke out.  Ah, Christ, that it would come,
94. And heal the world of all their wickedness!
95. "O Father!" asked the maiden, "might it come
96. To me by prayer and fasting?"  "Nay," said he,
97. "I know not, for thy heart is pure as snow."
98. And so she prayed and fasted, till the sun
99. Shone, and the wind blew, through her, and I thought
100. She might have risen and floated when I saw her.

101. `For on a day she sent to speak with me.
102. And when she came to speak, behold her eyes
103. Beyond my knowing of them, beautiful,
104. Beyond all knowing of them, wonderful,
105. Beautiful in the light of holiness.
106. And "O my brother Percivale," she said,
107. "Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail:
108. For, waked at dead of night, I heard a sound
109. As of a silver horn from o'er the hills
110. Blown, and I thought, `It is not Arthur's use
111. To hunt by moonlight;' and the slender sound
112. As from a distance beyond distance grew
113. Coming upon me--O never harp nor horn,
114. Nor aught we blow with breath, or touch with hand,
115. Was like that music as it came; and then
116. Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam,
117. And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,
118. Rose-red with beatings in it, as if alive,
119. Till all the white walls of my cell were dyed
120. With rosy colours leaping on the wall;
121. And then the music faded, and the Grail
122. Past, and the beam decayed, and from the walls
123. The rosy quiverings died into the night.
124. So now the Holy Thing is here again
125. Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray,
126. And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray,
127. That so perchance the vision may be seen
128. By thee and those, and all the world be healed."

129. `Then leaving the pale nun, I spake of this
130. To all men; and myself fasted and prayed
131. Always, and many among us many a week
132. Fasted and prayed even to the uttermost,
133. Expectant of the wonder that would be.

134. `And one there was among us, ever moved
135. Among us in white armour, Galahad.
136. "God make thee good as thou art beautiful,"
137. Said Arthur, when he dubbed him knight; and none,
138. In so young youth, was ever made a knight
139. Till Galahad; and this Galahad, when he heard
140. My sister's vision, filled me with amaze;
141. His eyes became so like her own, they seemed
142. Hers, and himself her brother more than I.

143. `Sister or brother none had he; but some
144. Called him a son of Lancelot, and some said
145. Begotten by enchantment--chatterers they,
146. Like birds of passage piping up and down,
147. That gape for flies--we know not whence they come;
148. For when was Lancelot wanderingly lewd?

149. `But she, the wan sweet maiden, shore away
150. Clean from her forehead all that wealth of hair
151. Which made a silken mat-work for her feet;
152. And out of this she plaited broad and long
153. A strong sword-belt, and wove with silver thread
154. And crimson in the belt a strange device,
155. A crimson grail within a silver beam;
156. And saw the bright boy-knight, and bound it on him,
157. Saying, "My knight, my love, my knight of heaven,
158. O thou, my love, whose love is one with mine,
159. I, maiden, round thee, maiden, bind my belt.
160. Go forth, for thou shalt see what I have seen,
161. And break through all, till one will crown thee king
162. Far in the spiritual city:" and as she spake
163. She sent the deathless passion in her eyes
164. Through him, and made him hers, and laid her mind
165. On him, and he believed in her belief.

166. `Then came a year of miracle:  O brother,
167. In our great hall there stood a vacant chair,
168. Fashioned by Merlin ere he past away,
169. And carven with strange figures; and in and out
170. The figures, like a serpent, ran a scroll
171. Of letters in a tongue no man could read.
172. And Merlin called it "The Siege perilous,"
173. Perilous for good and ill; "for there," he said,
174. "No man could sit but he should lose himself:"
175. And once by misadvertence Merlin sat
176. In his own chair, and so was lost; but he,
177. Galahad, when he heard of Merlin's doom,
178. Cried, "If I lose myself, I save myself!"

179. `Then on a summer night it came to pass,
180. While the great banquet lay along the hall,
181. That Galahad would sit down in Merlin's chair.

182. `And all at once, as there we sat, we heard
183. A cracking and a riving of the roofs,
184. And rending, and a blast, and overhead
185. Thunder, and in the thunder was a cry.
186. And in the blast there smote along the hall
187. A beam of light seven times more clear than day:
188. And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail
189. All over covered with a luminous cloud.
190. And none might see who bare it, and it past.
191. But every knight beheld his fellow's face
192. As in a glory, and all the knights arose,
193. And staring each at other like dumb men
194. Stood, till I found a voice and sware a vow.

195. `I sware a vow before them all, that I,
196. Because I had not seen the Grail, would ride
197. A twelvemonth and a day in quest of it,
198. Until I found and saw it, as the nun
199. My sister saw it; and Galahad sware the vow,
200. And good Sir Bors, our Lancelot's cousin, sware,
201. And Lancelot sware, and many among the knights,
202. And Gawain sware, and louder than the rest.'

203. Then spake the monk Ambrosius, asking him,
204. `What said the King?  Did Arthur take the vow?'

205. `Nay, for my lord,' said Percivale, `the King,
206. Was not in hall:  for early that same day,
207. Scaped through a cavern from a bandit hold,
208. An outraged maiden sprang into the hall
209. Crying on help:  for all her shining hair
210. Was smeared with earth, and either milky arm
211. Red-rent with hooks of bramble, and all she wore
212. Torn as a sail that leaves the rope is torn
213. In tempest:  so the King arose and went
214. To smoke the scandalous hive of those wild bees
215. That made such honey in his realm.  Howbeit
216. Some little of this marvel he too saw,
217. Returning o'er the plain that then began
218. To darken under Camelot; whence the King
219. Looked up, calling aloud, "Lo, there! the roofs
220. Of our great hall are rolled in thunder-smoke!
221. Pray Heaven, they be not smitten by the bolt."
222. For dear to Arthur was that hall of ours,
223. As having there so oft with all his knights
224. Feasted, and as the stateliest under heaven.

225. `O brother, had you known our mighty hall,
226. Which Merlin built for Arthur long ago!
227. For all the sacred mount of Camelot,
228. And all the dim rich city, roof by roof,
229. Tower after tower, spire beyond spire,
230. By grove, and garden-lawn, and rushing brook,
231. Climbs to the mighty hall that Merlin built.
232. And four great zones of sculpture, set betwixt
233. With many a mystic symbol, gird the hall:
234. And in the lowest beasts are slaying men,
235. And in the second men are slaying beasts,
236. And on the third are warriors, perfect men,
237. And on the fourth are men with growing wings,
238. And over all one statue in the mould
239. Of Arthur, made by Merlin, with a crown,
240. And peaked wings pointed to the Northern Star.
241. And eastward fronts the statue, and the crown
242. And both the wings are made of gold, and flame
243. At sunrise till the people in far fields,
244. Wasted so often by the heathen hordes,
245. Behold it, crying, "We have still a King."

246. `And, brother, had you known our hall within,
247. Broader and higher than any in all the lands!
248. Where twelve great windows blazon Arthur's wars,
249. And all the light that falls upon the board
250. Streams through the twelve great battles of our King.
251. Nay, one there is, and at the eastern end,
252. Wealthy with wandering lines of mount and mere,
253. Where Arthur finds the brand Excalibur.
254. And also one to the west, and counter to it,
255. And blank:  and who shall blazon it? when and how?--
256. O there, perchance, when all our wars are done,
257. The brand Excalibur will be cast away.

258. `So to this hall full quickly rode the King,
259. In horror lest the work by Merlin wrought,
260. Dreamlike, should on the sudden vanish, wrapt
261. In unremorseful folds of rolling fire.
262. And in he rode, and up I glanced, and saw
263. The golden dragon sparkling over all:
264. And many of those who burnt the hold, their arms
265. Hacked, and their foreheads grimed with smoke, and seared,
266. Followed, and in among bright faces, ours,
267. Full of the vision, prest:  and then the King
268. Spake to me, being nearest, "Percivale,"
269. (Because the hall was all in tumult--some
270. Vowing, and some protesting), "what is this?"

271. `O brother, when I told him what had chanced,
272. My sister's vision, and the rest, his face
273. Darkened, as I have seen it more than once,
274. When some brave deed seemed to be done in vain,
275. Darken; and "Woe is me, my knights," he cried,
276. "Had I been here, ye had not sworn the vow."
277. Bold was mine answer, "Had thyself been here,
278. My King, thou wouldst have sworn."  "Yea, yea," said he,
279. "Art thou so bold and hast not seen the Grail?"

280. `"Nay, lord, I heard the sound, I saw the light,
281. But since I did not see the Holy Thing,
282. I sware a vow to follow it till I saw."

283. `Then when he asked us, knight by knight, if any
284. Had seen it, all their answers were as one:
285. "Nay, lord, and therefore have we sworn our vows."

286. `"Lo now," said Arthur, "have ye seen a cloud?
287. What go ye into the wilderness to see?"

288. `Then Galahad on the sudden, and in a voice
289. Shrilling along the hall to Arthur, called,
290. "But I, Sir Arthur, saw the Holy Grail,
291. I saw the Holy Grail and heard a cry--
292. `O Galahad, and O Galahad, follow me.'"

293. `"Ah, Galahad, Galahad," said the King, "for such
294. As thou art is the vision, not for these.
295. Thy holy nun and thou have seen a sign--
296. Holier is none, my Percivale, than she--
297. A sign to maim this Order which I made.
298. But ye, that follow but the leader's bell"
299. (Brother, the King was hard upon his knights)
300. "Taliessin is our fullest throat of song,
301. And one hath sung and all the dumb will sing.
302. Lancelot is Lancelot, and hath overborne
303. Five knights at once, and every younger knight,
304. Unproven, holds himself as Lancelot,
305. Till overborne by one, he learns--and ye,
306. What are ye? Galahads?--no, nor Percivales"
307. (For thus it pleased the King to range me close
308. After Sir Galahad); "nay," said he, "but men
309. With strength and will to right the wronged, of power
310. To lay the sudden heads of violence flat,
311. Knights that in twelve great battles splashed and dyed
312. The strong White Horse in his own heathen blood--
313. But one hath seen, and all the blind will see.
314. Go, since your vows are sacred, being made:
315. Yet--for ye know the cries of all my realm
316. Pass through this hall--how often, O my knights,
317. Your places being vacant at my side,
318. This chance of noble deeds will come and go
319. Unchallenged, while ye follow wandering fires
320. Lost in the quagmire!  Many of you, yea most,
321. Return no more:  ye think I show myself
322. Too dark a prophet:  come now, let us meet
323. The morrow morn once more in one full field
324. Of gracious pastime, that once more the King,
325. Before ye leave him for this Quest, may count
326. The yet-unbroken strength of all his knights,
327. Rejoicing in that Order which he made."

328. `So when the sun broke next from under ground,
329. All the great table of our Arthur closed
330. And clashed in such a tourney and so full,
331. So many lances broken--never yet
332. Had Camelot seen the like, since Arthur came;
333. And I myself and Galahad, for a strength
334. Was in us from this vision, overthrew
335. So many knights that all the people cried,
336. And almost burst the barriers in their heat,
337. Shouting, "Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale!"

338. `But when the next day brake from under ground--
339. O brother, had you known our Camelot,
340. Built by old kings, age after age, so old
341. The King himself had fears that it would fall,
342. So strange, and rich, and dim; for where the roofs
343. Tottered toward each other in the sky,
344. Met foreheads all along the street of those
345. Who watched us pass; and lower, and where the long
346. Rich galleries, lady-laden, weighed the necks
347. Of dragons clinging to the crazy walls,
348. Thicker than drops from thunder, showers of flowers
349. Fell as we past; and men and boys astride
350. On wyvern, lion, dragon, griffin, swan,
351. At all the corners, named us each by name,
352. Calling, "God speed!" but in the ways below
353. The knights and ladies wept, and rich and poor
354. Wept, and the King himself could hardly speak
355. For grief, and all in middle street the Queen,
356. Who rode by Lancelot, wailed and shrieked aloud,
357. "This madness has come on us for our sins."
358. So to the Gate of the three Queens we came,
359. Where Arthur's wars are rendered mystically,
360. And thence departed every one his way.

361. `And I was lifted up in heart, and thought
362. Of all my late-shown prowess in the lists,
363. How my strong lance had beaten down the knights,
364. So many and famous names; and never yet
365. Had heaven appeared so blue, nor earth so green,
366. For all my blood danced in me, and I knew
367. That I should light upon the Holy Grail.

368. `Thereafter, the dark warning of our King,
369. That most of us would follow wandering fires,
370. Came like a driving gloom across my mind.
371. Then every evil word I had spoken once,
372. And every evil thought I had thought of old,
373. And every evil deed I ever did,
374. Awoke and cried, "This Quest is not for thee."
375. And lifting up mine eyes, I found myself
376. Alone, and in a land of sand and thorns,
377. And I was thirsty even unto death;
378. And I, too, cried, "This Quest is not for thee."

379. `And on I rode, and when I thought my thirst
380. Would slay me, saw deep lawns, and then a brook,
381. With one sharp rapid, where the crisping white
382. Played ever back upon the sloping wave,
383. And took both ear and eye; and o'er the brook
384. Were apple-trees, and apples by the brook
385. Fallen, and on the lawns.  "I will rest here,"
386. I said, "I am not worthy of the Quest;"
387. But even while I drank the brook, and ate
388. The goodly apples, all these things at once
389. Fell into dust, and I was left alone,
390. And thirsting, in a land of sand and thorns.

391. `And then behold a woman at a door
392. Spinning; and fair the house whereby she sat,
393. And kind the woman's eyes and innocent,
394. And all her bearing gracious; and she rose
395. Opening her arms to meet me, as who should say,
396. "Rest here;" but when I touched her, lo! she, too,
397. Fell into dust and nothing, and the house
398. Became no better than a broken shed,
399. And in it a dead babe; and also this
400. Fell into dust, and I was left alone.

401. `And on I rode, and greater was my thirst.
402. Then flashed a yellow gleam across the world,
403. And where it smote the plowshare in the field,
404. The plowman left his plowing, and fell down
405. Before it; where it glittered on her pail,
406. The milkmaid left her milking, and fell down
407. Before it, and I knew not why, but thought
408. "The sun is rising," though the sun had risen.
409. Then was I ware of one that on me moved
410. In golden armour with a crown of gold
411. About a casque all jewels; and his horse
412. In golden armour jewelled everywhere:
413. And on the splendour came, flashing me blind;
414. And seemed to me the Lord of all the world,
415. Being so huge.  But when I thought he meant
416. To crush me, moving on me, lo! he, too,
417. Opened his arms to embrace me as he came,
418. And up I went and touched him, and he, too,
419. Fell into dust, and I was left alone
420. And wearying in a land of sand and thorns.

421. `And I rode on and found a mighty hill,
422. And on the top, a city walled:  the spires
423. Pricked with incredible pinnacles into heaven.
424. And by the gateway stirred a crowd; and these
425. Cried to me climbing, "Welcome, Percivale!
426. Thou mightiest and thou purest among men!"
427. And glad was I and clomb, but found at top
428. No man, nor any voice.  And thence I past
429. Far through a ruinous city, and I saw
430. That man had once dwelt there; but there I found
431. Only one man of an exceeding age.
432. "Where is that goodly company," said I,
433. "That so cried out upon me?" and he had
434. Scarce any voice to answer, and yet gasped,
435. "Whence and what art thou?" and even as he spoke
436. Fell into dust, and disappeared, and I
437. Was left alone once more, and cried in grief,
438. "Lo, if I find the Holy Grail itself
439. And touch it, it will crumble into dust."

440. `And thence I dropt into a lowly vale,
441. Low as the hill was high, and where the vale
442. Was lowest, found a chapel, and thereby
443. A holy hermit in a hermitage,
444. To whom I told my phantoms, and he said:

445. `"O son, thou hast not true humility,
446. The highest virtue, mother of them all;
447. For when the Lord of all things made Himself
448. Naked of glory for His mortal change,
449. `Take thou my robe,' she said, `for all is thine,'
450. And all her form shone forth with sudden light
451. So that the angels were amazed, and she
452. Followed Him down, and like a flying star
453. Led on the gray-haired wisdom of the east;
454. But her thou hast not known:  for what is this
455. Thou thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins?
456. Thou hast not lost thyself to save thyself
457. As Galahad."  When the hermit made an end,
458. In silver armour suddenly Galahad shone
459. Before us, and against the chapel door
460. Laid lance, and entered, and we knelt in prayer.
461. And there the hermit slaked my burning thirst,
462. And at the sacring of the mass I saw
463. The holy elements alone; but he,
464. "Saw ye no more?  I, Galahad, saw the Grail,
465. The Holy Grail, descend upon the shrine:
466. I saw the fiery face as of a child
467. That smote itself into the bread, and went;
468. And hither am I come; and never yet
469. Hath what thy sister taught me first to see,
470. This Holy Thing, failed from my side, nor come
471. Covered, but moving with me night and day,
472. Fainter by day, but always in the night
473. Blood-red, and sliding down the blackened marsh
474. Blood-red, and on the naked mountain top
475. Blood-red, and in the sleeping mere below
476. Blood-red.  And in the strength of this I rode,
477. Shattering all evil customs everywhere,
478. And past through Pagan realms, and made them mine,
479. And clashed with Pagan hordes, and bore them down,
480. And broke through all, and in the strength of this
481. Come victor.  But my time is hard at hand,
482. And hence I go; and one will crown me king
483. Far in the spiritual city; and come thou, too,
484. For thou shalt see the vision when I go."

485. `While thus he spake, his eye, dwelling on mine,
486. Drew me, with power upon me, till I grew
487. One with him, to believe as he believed.
488. Then, when the day began to wane, we went.

489. `There rose a hill that none but man could climb,
490. Scarred with a hundred wintry water-courses--
491. Storm at the top, and when we gained it, storm
492. Round us and death; for every moment glanced
493. His silver arms and gloomed:  so quick and thick
494. The lightnings here and there to left and right
495. Struck, till the dry old trunks about us, dead,
496. Yea, rotten with a hundred years of death,
497. Sprang into fire:  and at the base we found
498. On either hand, as far as eye could see,
499. A great black swamp and of an evil smell,
500. Part black, part whitened with the bones of men,
501. Not to be crost, save that some ancient king
502. Had built a way, where, linked with many a bridge,
503. A thousand piers ran into the great Sea.
504. And Galahad fled along them bridge by bridge,
505. And every bridge as quickly as he crost
506. Sprang into fire and vanished, though I yearned
507. To follow; and thrice above him all the heavens
508. Opened and blazed with thunder such as seemed
509. Shoutings of all the sons of God:  and first
510. At once I saw him far on the great Sea,
511. In silver-shining armour starry-clear;
512. And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung
513. Clothed in white samite or a luminous cloud.
514. And with exceeding swiftness ran the boat,
515. If boat it were--I saw not whence it came.
516. And when the heavens opened and blazed again
517. Roaring, I saw him like a silver star--
518. And had he set the sail, or had the boat
519. Become a living creature clad with wings?
520. And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung
521. Redder than any rose, a joy to me,
522. For now I knew the veil had been withdrawn.
523. Then in a moment when they blazed again
524. Opening, I saw the least of little stars
525. Down on the waste, and straight beyond the star
526. I saw the spiritual city and all her spires
527. And gateways in a glory like one pearl--
528. No larger, though the goal of all the saints--
529. Strike from the sea; and from the star there shot
530. A rose-red sparkle to the city, and there
531. Dwelt, and I knew it was the Holy Grail,
532. Which never eyes on earth again shall see.
533. Then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep.
534. And how my feet recrost the deathful ridge
535. No memory in me lives; but that I touched
536. The chapel-doors at dawn I know; and thence
537. Taking my war-horse from the holy man,
538. Glad that no phantom vext me more, returned
539. To whence I came, the gate of Arthur's wars.'

540. `O brother,' asked Ambrosius,--`for in sooth
541. These ancient books--and they would win thee--teem,
542. Only I find not there this Holy Grail,
543. With miracles and marvels like to these,
544. Not all unlike; which oftentime I read,
545. Who read but on my breviary with ease,
546. Till my head swims; and then go forth and pass
547. Down to the little thorpe that lies so close,
548. And almost plastered like a martin's nest
549. To these old walls--and mingle with our folk;
550. And knowing every honest face of theirs
551. As well as ever shepherd knew his sheep,
552. And every homely secret in their hearts,
553. Delight myself with gossip and old wives,
554. And ills and aches, and teethings, lyings-in,
555. And mirthful sayings, children of the place,
556. That have no meaning half a league away:
557. Or lulling random squabbles when they rise,
558. Chafferings and chatterings at the market-cross,
559. Rejoice, small man, in this small world of mine,
560. Yea, even in their hens and in their eggs--
561. O brother, saving this Sir Galahad,
562. Came ye on none but phantoms in your quest,
563. No man, no woman?'

564. Then Sir Percivale:
565. `All men, to one so bound by such a vow,
566. And women were as phantoms.  O, my brother,
567. Why wilt thou shame me to confess to thee
568. How far I faltered from my quest and vow?
569. For after I had lain so many nights
570. A bedmate of the snail and eft and snake,
571. In grass and burdock, I was changed to wan
572. And meagre, and the vision had not come;
573. And then I chanced upon a goodly town
574. With one great dwelling in the middle of it;
575. Thither I made, and there was I disarmed
576. By maidens each as fair as any flower:
577. But when they led me into hall, behold,
578. The Princess of that castle was the one,
579. Brother, and that one only, who had ever
580. Made my heart leap; for when I moved of old
581. A slender page about her father's hall,
582. And she a slender maiden, all my heart
583. Went after her with longing:  yet we twain
584. Had never kissed a kiss, or vowed a vow.
585. And now I came upon her once again,
586. And one had wedded her, and he was dead,
587. And all his land and wealth and state were hers.
588. And while I tarried, every day she set
589. A banquet richer than the day before
590. By me; for all her longing and her will
591. Was toward me as of old; till one fair morn,
592. I walking to and fro beside a stream
593. That flashed across her orchard underneath
594. Her castle-walls, she stole upon my walk,
595. And calling me the greatest of all knights,
596. Embraced me, and so kissed me the first time,
597. And gave herself and all her wealth to me.
598. Then I remembered Arthur's warning word,
599. That most of us would follow wandering fires,
600. And the Quest faded in my heart.  Anon,
601. The heads of all her people drew to me,
602. With supplication both of knees and tongue:
603. "We have heard of thee:  thou art our greatest knight,
604. Our Lady says it, and we well believe:
605. Wed thou our Lady, and rule over us,
606. And thou shalt be as Arthur in our land."
607. O me, my brother! but one night my vow
608. Burnt me within, so that I rose and fled,
609. But wailed and wept, and hated mine own self,
610. And even the Holy Quest, and all but her;
611. Then after I was joined with Galahad
612. Cared not for her, nor anything upon earth.'

613. Then said the monk, `Poor men, when yule is cold,
614. Must be content to sit by little fires.
615. And this am I, so that ye care for me
616. Ever so little; yea, and blest be Heaven
617. That brought thee here to this poor house of ours
618. Where all the brethren are so hard, to warm
619. My cold heart with a friend:  but O the pity
620. To find thine own first love once more--to hold,
621. Hold her a wealthy bride within thine arms,
622. Or all but hold, and then--cast her aside,
623. Foregoing all her sweetness, like a weed.
624. For we that want the warmth of double life,
625. We that are plagued with dreams of something sweet
626. Beyond all sweetness in a life so rich,--
627. Ah, blessd Lord, I speak too earthlywise,
628. Seeing I never strayed beyond the cell,
629. But live like an old badger in his earth,
630. With earth about him everywhere, despite
631. All fast and penance.  Saw ye none beside,
632. None of your knights?'

633. `Yea so,' said Percivale:
634. `One night my pathway swerving east, I saw
635. The pelican on the casque of our Sir Bors
636. All in the middle of the rising moon:
637. And toward him spurred, and hailed him, and he me,
638. And each made joy of either; then he asked,
639. "Where is he? hast thou seen him--Lancelot?--Once,"
640. Said good Sir Bors, "he dashed across me--mad,
641. And maddening what he rode:  and when I cried,
642. `Ridest thou then so hotly on a quest
643. So holy,' Lancelot shouted, `Stay me not!
644. I have been the sluggard, and I ride apace,
645. For now there is a lion in the way.'
646. So vanished."

647. `Then Sir Bors had ridden on
648. Softly, and sorrowing for our Lancelot,
649. Because his former madness, once the talk
650. And scandal of our table, had returned;
651. For Lancelot's kith and kin so worship him
652. That ill to him is ill to them; to Bors
653. Beyond the rest:  he well had been content
654. Not to have seen, so Lancelot might have seen,
655. The Holy Cup of healing; and, indeed,
656. Being so clouded with his grief and love,
657. Small heart was his after the Holy Quest:
658. If God would send the vision, well:  if not,
659. The Quest and he were in the hands of Heaven.

660. `And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors
661. Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm,
662. And found a people there among their crags,
663. Our race and blood, a remnant that were left
664. Paynim amid their circles, and the stones
665. They pitch up straight to heaven:  and their wise men
666. Were strong in that old magic which can trace
667. The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him
668. And this high Quest as at a simple thing:
669. Told him he followed--almost Arthur's words--
670. A mocking fire:  "what other fire than he,
671. Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows,
672. And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?"
673. And when his answer chafed them, the rough crowd,
674. Hearing he had a difference with their priests,
675. Seized him, and bound and plunged him into a cell
676. Of great piled stones; and lying bounden there
677. In darkness through innumerable hours
678. He heard the hollow-ringing heavens sweep
679. Over him till by miracle--what else?--
680. Heavy as it was, a great stone slipt and fell,
681. Such as no wind could move:  and through the gap
682. Glimmered the streaming scud:  then came a night
683. Still as the day was loud; and through the gap
684. The seven clear stars of Arthur's Table Round--
685. For, brother, so one night, because they roll
686. Through such a round in heaven, we named the stars,
687. Rejoicing in ourselves and in our King--
688. And these, like bright eyes of familiar friends,
689. In on him shone:  "And then to me, to me,"
690. Said good Sir Bors, "beyond all hopes of mine,
691. Who scarce had prayed or asked it for myself--
692. Across the seven clear stars--O grace to me--
693. In colour like the fingers of a hand
694. Before a burning taper, the sweet Grail
695. Glided and past, and close upon it pealed
696. A sharp quick thunder."  Afterwards, a maid,
697. Who kept our holy faith among her kin
698. In secret, entering, loosed and let him go.'

699. To whom the monk:  `And I remember now
700. That pelican on the casque:  Sir Bors it was
701. Who spake so low and sadly at our board;
702. And mighty reverent at our grace was he:
703. A square-set man and honest; and his eyes,
704. An out-door sign of all the warmth within,
705. Smiled with his lips--a smile beneath a cloud,
706. But heaven had meant it for a sunny one:
707. Ay, ay, Sir Bors, who else?  But when ye reached
708. The city, found ye all your knights returned,
709. Or was there sooth in Arthur's prophecy,
710. Tell me, and what said each, and what the King?'

711. Then answered Percivale:  `And that can I,
712. Brother, and truly; since the living words
713. Of so great men as Lancelot and our King
714. Pass not from door to door and out again,
715. But sit within the house.  O, when we reached
716. The city, our horses stumbling as they trode
717. On heaps of ruin, hornless unicorns,
718. Cracked basilisks, and splintered cockatrices,
719. And shattered talbots, which had left the stones
720. Raw, that they fell from, brought us to the hall.

721. `And there sat Arthur on the das-throne,
722. And those that had gone out upon the Quest,
723. Wasted and worn, and but a tithe of them,
724. And those that had not, stood before the King,
725. Who, when he saw me, rose, and bad me hail,
726. Saying, "A welfare in thine eye reproves
727. Our fear of some disastrous chance for thee
728. On hill, or plain, at sea, or flooding ford.
729. So fierce a gale made havoc here of late
730. Among the strange devices of our kings;
731. Yea, shook this newer, stronger hall of ours,
732. And from the statue Merlin moulded for us
733. Half-wrenched a golden wing; but now--the Quest,
734. This vision--hast thou seen the Holy Cup,
735. That Joseph brought of old to Glastonbury?"

736. `So when I told him all thyself hast heard,
737. Ambrosius, and my fresh but fixt resolve
738. To pass away into the quiet life,
739. He answered not, but, sharply turning, asked
740. Of Gawain, "Gawain, was this Quest for thee?"

741. `"Nay, lord," said Gawain, "not for such as I.
742. Therefore I communed with a saintly man,
743. Who made me sure the Quest was not for me;
744. For I was much awearied of the Quest:
745. But found a silk pavilion in a field,
746. And merry maidens in it; and then this gale
747. Tore my pavilion from the tenting-pin,
748. And blew my merry maidens all about
749. With all discomfort; yea, and but for this,
750. My twelvemonth and a day were pleasant to me."

751. `He ceased; and Arthur turned to whom at first
752. He saw not, for Sir Bors, on entering, pushed
753. Athwart the throng to Lancelot, caught his hand,
754. Held it, and there, half-hidden by him, stood,
755. Until the King espied him, saying to him,
756. "Hail, Bors! if ever loyal man and true
757. Could see it, thou hast seen the Grail;" and Bors,
758. "Ask me not, for I may not speak of it:
759. I saw it;" and the tears were in his eyes.

760. `Then there remained but Lancelot, for the rest
761. Spake but of sundry perils in the storm;
762. Perhaps, like him of Cana in Holy Writ,
763. Our Arthur kept his best until the last;
764. "Thou, too, my Lancelot," asked the king, "my friend,
765. Our mightiest, hath this Quest availed for thee?"

766. `"Our mightiest!" answered Lancelot, with a groan;
767. "O King!"--and when he paused, methought I spied
768. A dying fire of madness in his eyes--
769. "O King, my friend, if friend of thine I be,
770. Happier are those that welter in their sin,
771. Swine in the mud, that cannot see for slime,
772. Slime of the ditch:  but in me lived a sin
773. So strange, of such a kind, that all of pure,
774. Noble, and knightly in me twined and clung
775. Round that one sin, until the wholesome flower
776. And poisonous grew together, each as each,
777. Not to be plucked asunder; and when thy knights
778. Sware, I sware with them only in the hope
779. That could I touch or see the Holy Grail
780. They might be plucked asunder.  Then I spake
781. To one most holy saint, who wept and said,
782. That save they could be plucked asunder, all
783. My quest were but in vain; to whom I vowed
784. That I would work according as he willed.
785. And forth I went, and while I yearned and strove
786. To tear the twain asunder in my heart,
787. My madness came upon me as of old,
788. And whipt me into waste fields far away;
789. There was I beaten down by little men,
790. Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword
791. And shadow of my spear had been enow
792. To scare them from me once; and then I came
793. All in my folly to the naked shore,
794. Wide flats, where nothing but coarse grasses grew;
795. But such a blast, my King, began to blow,
796. So loud a blast along the shore and sea,
797. Ye could not hear the waters for the blast,
798. Though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea
799. Drove like a cataract, and all the sand
800. Swept like a river, and the clouded heavens
801. Were shaken with the motion and the sound.
802. And blackening in the sea-foam swayed a boat,
803. Half-swallowed in it, anchored with a chain;
804. And in my madness to myself I said,
805. `I will embark and I will lose myself,
806. And in the great sea wash away my sin.'
807. I burst the chain, I sprang into the boat.
808. Seven days I drove along the dreary deep,
809. And with me drove the moon and all the stars;
810. And the wind fell, and on the seventh night
811. I heard the shingle grinding in the surge,
812. And felt the boat shock earth, and looking up,
813. Behold, the enchanted towers of Carbonek,
814. A castle like a rock upon a rock,
815. With chasm-like portals open to the sea,
816. And steps that met the breaker! there was none
817. Stood near it but a lion on each side
818. That kept the entry, and the moon was full.
819. Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs.
820. There drew my sword.  With sudden-flaring manes
821. Those two great beasts rose upright like a man,
822. Each gript a shoulder, and I stood between;
823. And, when I would have smitten them, heard a voice,
824. `Doubt not, go forward; if thou doubt, the beasts
825. Will tear thee piecemeal.'  Then with violence
826. The sword was dashed from out my hand, and fell.
827. And up into the sounding hall I past;
828. But nothing in the sounding hall I saw,
829. No bench nor table, painting on the wall
830. Or shield of knight; only the rounded moon
831. Through the tall oriel on the rolling sea.
832. But always in the quiet house I heard,
833. Clear as a lark, high o'er me as a lark,
834. A sweet voice singing in the topmost tower
835. To the eastward:  up I climbed a thousand steps
836. With pain:  as in a dream I seemed to climb
837. For ever:  at the last I reached a door,
838. A light was in the crannies, and I heard,
839. `Glory and joy and honour to our Lord
840. And to the Holy Vessel of the Grail.'
841. Then in my madness I essayed the door;
842. It gave; and through a stormy glare, a heat
843. As from a seventimes-heated furnace, I,
844. Blasted and burnt, and blinded as I was,
845. With such a fierceness that I swooned away--
846. O, yet methought I saw the Holy Grail,
847. All palled in crimson samite, and around
848. Great angels, awful shapes, and wings and eyes.
849. And but for all my madness and my sin,
850. And then my swooning, I had sworn I saw
851. That which I saw; but what I saw was veiled
852. And covered; and this Quest was not for me."

853. `So speaking, and here ceasing, Lancelot left
854. The hall long silent, till Sir Gawain--nay,
855. Brother, I need not tell thee foolish words,--
856. A reckless and irreverent knight was he,
857. Now boldened by the silence of his King,--
858. Well, I will tell thee:  "O King, my liege," he said,
859. "Hath Gawain failed in any quest of thine?
860. When have I stinted stroke in foughten field?
861. But as for thine, my good friend Percivale,
862. Thy holy nun and thou have driven men mad,
863. Yea, made our mightiest madder than our least.
864. But by mine eyes and by mine ears I swear,
865. I will be deafer than the blue-eyed cat,
866. And thrice as blind as any noonday owl,
867. To holy virgins in their ecstasies,
868. Henceforward."

869. `"Deafer," said the blameless King,
870. "Gawain, and blinder unto holy things
871. Hope not to make thyself by idle vows,
872. Being too blind to have desire to see.
873. But if indeed there came a sign from heaven,
874. Blessd are Bors, Lancelot and Percivale,
875. For these have seen according to their sight.
876. For every fiery prophet in old times,
877. And all the sacred madness of the bard,
878. When God made music through them, could but speak
879. His music by the framework and the chord;
880. And as ye saw it ye have spoken truth.

881. `"Nay--but thou errest, Lancelot:  never yet
882. Could all of true and noble in knight and man
883. Twine round one sin, whatever it might be,
884. With such a closeness, but apart there grew,
885. Save that he were the swine thou spakest of,
886. Some root of knighthood and pure nobleness;
887. Whereto see thou, that it may bear its flower.

888. `"And spake I not too truly, O my knights?
889. Was I too dark a prophet when I said
890. To those who went upon the Holy Quest,
891. That most of them would follow wandering fires,
892. Lost in the quagmire?--lost to me and gone,
893. And left me gazing at a barren board,
894. And a lean Order--scarce returned a tithe--
895. And out of those to whom the vision came
896. My greatest hardly will believe he saw;
897. Another hath beheld it afar off,
898. And leaving human wrongs to right themselves,
899. Cares but to pass into the silent life.
900. And one hath had the vision face to face,
901. And now his chair desires him here in vain,
902. However they may crown him otherwhere.

903. `"And some among you held, that if the King
904. Had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow:
905. Not easily, seeing that the King must guard
906. That which he rules, and is but as the hind
907. To whom a space of land is given to plow.
908. Who may not wander from the allotted field
909. Before his work be done; but, being done,
910. Let visions of the night or of the day
911. Come, as they will; and many a time they come,
912. Until this earth he walks on seems not earth,
913. This light that strikes his eyeball is not light,
914. This air that smites his forehead is not air
915. But vision--yea, his very hand and foot--
916. In moments when he feels he cannot die,
917. And knows himself no vision to himself,
918. Nor the high God a vision, nor that One
919. Who rose again:  ye have seen what ye have seen."

920. `So spake the King:  I knew not all he meant.'
