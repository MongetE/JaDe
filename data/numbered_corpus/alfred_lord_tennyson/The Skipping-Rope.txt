1. SURE never yet was antelope
2. Could skip so lightly by.
3. Stand off, or else my skipping-rope
4. Will hit you in the eye.
5. How lightly Whirls the skipping-rope !
6. How fairy-like you fly !
7. Go, get you gone, you muse and mope -
8. I hate that silly sigh.
9. Nay, dearest, teach me how to hope,
10. Or tell me how to die.
11. There, take it, take my skipping-rope,
12. And hang yourself thereby.
