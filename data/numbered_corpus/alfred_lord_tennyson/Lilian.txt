1. I
2. Airy, Fairy Lilian,
3. Flitting, fairy Lilian,
4. When I ask her if she love me,
5. Claps her tiny hands above me,
6. Laughing all she can;
7. She 'll not tell me if she love me,
8. Cruel little Lilian.


9. II
10. When my passion seeks
11. Pleasance in love-sighs,
12. She, looking thro' and thro' me
13. Thoroughly to undo me,
14. Smiling, never speaks:
15. So innocent-arch, so cunning-simple,
16. From beneath her gathered wimple
17. Glancing with black-bearded eyes,
18. Till the lightning laughters dimple
19. The baby-roses in her cheeks;
20. Then away she flies.


21. III
22. Prythee weep, May Lilian!
23. Gaiety without eclipse
24. Whearieth me, May Lilian;
25. Thro' my every heart it thrilleth
26. When from crimson-threaded lips
27. Silver-treble laughter trilleth:
28. Prythee weep, May Lilian!


29. IV
30. Praying all I can,
31. If prayers will not hush thee,
32. Airy Lilian,
33. Like a rose-leaf I will crush thee,
34. Fairy Lilian.
