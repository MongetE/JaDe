1. I come from haunts of coot and hern,
2. I make a sudden sally
3. And sparkle out among the fern,
4. To bicker down a valley.

5. By thirty hills I hurry down,
6. Or slip between the ridges,
7. By twenty thorpes, a little town,
8. And half a hundred bridges.

9. Till last by Philip's farm I flow
10. To join the brimming river,
11. For men may come and men may go,
12. But I go on for ever.
13. I chatter over stony ways,
14. In little sharps and trebles,
15. I bubble into eddying bays,
16. I babble on the pebbles.

17. With many a curve my banks I fret
18. By many a field and fallow,
19. And many a fairy foreland set
20. With willow-weed and mallow.

21. I chatter, chatter, as I flow
22. To join the brimming river,
23. For men may come and men may go,
24. But I go on for ever.
25. I wind about, and in and out,
26. With here a blossom sailing,
27. And here and there a lusty trout,
28. And here and there a grayling,

29. And here and there a foamy flake
30. Upon me, as I travel
31. With many a silvery waterbreak
32. Above the golden gravel,

33. And draw them all along, and flow
34. To join the brimming river
35. For men may come and men may go,
36. But I go on for ever.
37. I steal by lawns and grassy plots,
38. I slide by hazel covers;
39. I move the sweet forget-me-nots
40. That grow for happy lovers.

41. I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,
42. Among my skimming swallows;
43. I make the netted sunbeam dance
44. Against my sandy shallows.

45. I murmur under moon and stars
46. In brambly wildernesses;
47. I linger by my shingly bars;
48. I loiter round my cresses;

49. And out again I curve and flow
50. To join the brimming river,
51. For men may come and men may go,
52. But I go on for ever.
