1. The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court,
2. A tributary prince of Devon, one
3. Of that great Order of the Table Round,
4. Had married Enid, Yniol's only child,
5. And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.
6. And as the light of Heaven varies, now
7. At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night
8. With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint
9. To make her beauty vary day by day,
10. In crimsons and in purples and in gems.
11. And Enid, but to please her husband's eye,
12. Who first had found and loved her in a state
13. Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him
14. In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,
15. Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,
16. Loved her, and often with her own white hands
17. Arrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,
18. Next after her own self, in all the court.
19. And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart
20. Adored her, as the stateliest and the best
21. And loveliest of all women upon earth.
22. And seeing them so tender and so close,
23. Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.
24. But when a rumour rose about the Queen,
25. Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,
26. Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard
27. The world's loud whisper breaking into storm,
28. Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell
29. A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,
30. Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,
31. Had suffered, or should suffer any taint
32. In nature:  wherefore going to the King,
33. He made this pretext, that his princedom lay
34. Close on the borders of a territory,
35. Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,
36. Assassins, and all flyers from the hand
37. Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:
38. And therefore, till the King himself should please
39. To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,
40. He craved a fair permission to depart,
41. And there defend his marches; and the King
42. Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,
43. Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,
44. And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores
45. Of Severn, and they past to their own land;
46. Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife
47. True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,
48. He compassed her with sweet observances
49. And worship, never leaving her, and grew
50. Forgetful of his promise to the King,
51. Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,
52. Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,
53. Forgetful of his glory and his name,
54. Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.
55. And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.
56. And by and by the people, when they met
57. In twos and threes, or fuller companies,
58. Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him
59. As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,
60. And molten down in mere uxoriousness.
61. And this she gathered from the people's eyes:
62. This too the women who attired her head,
63. To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,
64. Told Enid, and they saddened her the more:
65. And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,
66. But could not out of bashful delicacy;
67. While he that watched her sadden, was the more
68. Suspicious that her nature had a taint.

69. At last, it chanced that on a summer morn
70. (They sleeping each by either) the new sun
71. Beat through the blindless casement of the room,
72. And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;
73. Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,
74. And bared the knotted column of his throat,
75. The massive square of his heroic breast,
76. And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,
77. As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,
78. Running too vehemently to break upon it.
79. And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,
80. Admiring him, and thought within herself,
81. Was ever man so grandly made as he?
82. Then, like a shadow, past the people's talk
83. And accusation of uxoriousness
84. Across her mind, and bowing over him,
85. Low to her own heart piteously she said:

86. 'O noble breast and all-puissant arms,
87. Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men
88. Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?
89. I AM the cause, because I dare not speak
90. And tell him what I think and what they say.
91. And yet I hate that he should linger here;
92. I cannot love my lord and not his name.
93. Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,
94. And ride with him to battle and stand by,
95. And watch his mightful hand striking great blows
96. At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.
97. Far better were I laid in the dark earth,
98. Not hearing any more his noble voice,
99. Not to be folded more in these dear arms,
100. And darkened from the high light in his eyes,
101. Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.
102. Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,
103. And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,
104. And maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,
105. And yet not dare to tell him what I think,
106. And how men slur him, saying all his force
107. Is melted into mere effeminacy?
108. O me, I fear that I am no true wife.'

109. Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,
110. And the strong passion in her made her weep
111. True tears upon his broad and naked breast,
112. And these awoke him, and by great mischance
113. He heard but fragments of her later words,
114. And that she feared she was not a true wife.
115. And then he thought, 'In spite of all my care,
116. For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,
117. She is not faithful to me, and I see her
118. Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur's hall.'
119. Then though he loved and reverenced her too much
120. To dream she could be guilty of foul act,
121. Right through his manful breast darted the pang
122. That makes a man, in the sweet face of her
123. Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.
124. At this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,
125. And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,
126. 'My charger and her palfrey;' then to her,
127. 'I will ride forth into the wilderness;
128. For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,
129. I have not fallen so low as some would wish.
130. And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress
131. And ride with me.'  And Enid asked, amazed,
132. 'If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.'
133. But he, 'I charge thee, ask not, but obey.'
134. Then she bethought her of a faded silk,
135. A faded mantle and a faded veil,
136. And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,
137. Wherein she kept them folded reverently
138. With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,
139. She took them, and arrayed herself therein,
140. Remembering when first he came on her
141. Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,
142. And all her foolish fears about the dress,
143. And all his journey to her, as himself
144. Had told her, and their coming to the court.

145. For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before
146. Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.
147. There on a day, he sitting high in hall,
148. Before him came a forester of Dean,
149. Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart
150. Taller than all his fellows, milky-white,
151. First seen that day:  these things he told the King.
152. Then the good King gave order to let blow
153. His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.
154. And when the King petitioned for his leave
155. To see the hunt, allowed it easily.
156. So with the morning all the court were gone.
157. But Guinevere lay late into the morn,
158. Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love
159. For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;
160. But rose at last, a single maiden with her,
161. Took horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;
162. There, on a little knoll beside it, stayed
163. Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead
164. A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,
165. Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress
166. Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,
167. Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford
168. Behind them, and so galloped up the knoll.
169. A purple scarf, at either end whereof
170. There swung an apple of the purest gold,
171. Swayed round about him, as he galloped up
172. To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly
173. In summer suit and silks of holiday.
174. Low bowed the tributary Prince, and she,
175. Sweet and statelily, and with all grace
176. Of womanhood and queenhood, answered him:
177. 'Late, late, Sir Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'
178. 'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late
179. That I but come like you to see the hunt,
180. Not join it.'  'Therefore wait with me,' she said;
181. 'For on this little knoll, if anywhere,
182. There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:
183. Here often they break covert at our feet.'

184. And while they listened for the distant hunt,
185. And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,
186. King Arthur's hound of deepest mouth, there rode
187. Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;
188. Whereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight
189. Had vizor up, and showed a youthful face,
190. Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.
191. And Guinevere, not mindful of his face
192. In the King's hall, desired his name, and sent
193. Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;
194. Who being vicious, old and irritable,
195. And doubling all his master's vice of pride,
196. Made answer sharply that she should not know.
197. 'Then will I ask it of himself,' she said.
198. 'Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,' cried the dwarf;
199. 'Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;'
200. And when she put her horse toward the knight,
201. Struck at her with his whip, and she returned
202. Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint
203. Exclaiming, 'Surely I will learn the name,'
204. Made sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,
205. Who answered as before; and when the Prince
206. Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,
207. Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.
208. The Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,
209. Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand
210. Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:
211. But he, from his exceeding manfulness
212. And pure nobility of temperament,
213. Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained
214. From even a word, and so returning said:

215. 'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,
216. Done in your maiden's person to yourself:
217. And I will track this vermin to their earths:
218. For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt
219. To find, at some place I shall come at, arms
220. On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,
221. Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,
222. And on the third day will again be here,
223. So that I be not fallen in fight.  Farewell.'

224. 'Farewell, fair Prince,' answered the stately Queen.
225. 'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;
226. And may you light on all things that you love,
227. And live to wed with her whom first you love:
228. But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,
229. And I, were she the daughter of a king,
230. Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,
231. Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.'

232. And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard
233. The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,
234. A little vext at losing of the hunt,
235. A little at the vile occasion, rode,
236. By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade
237. And valley, with fixt eye following the three.
238. At last they issued from the world of wood,
239. And climbed upon a fair and even ridge,
240. And showed themselves against the sky, and sank.
241. And thither there came Geraint, and underneath
242. Beheld the long street of a little town
243. In a long valley, on one side whereof,
244. White from the mason's hand, a fortress rose;
245. And on one side a castle in decay,
246. Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:
247. And out of town and valley came a noise
248. As of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed
249. Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks
250. At distance, ere they settle for the night.

251. And onward to the fortress rode the three,
252. And entered, and were lost behind the walls.
253. 'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'
254. And down the long street riding wearily,
255. Found every hostel full, and everywhere
256. Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss
257. And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured
258. His master's armour; and of such a one
259. He asked, 'What means the tumult in the town?'
260. Who told him, scouring still, 'The sparrow-hawk!'
261. Then riding close behind an ancient churl,
262. Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,
263. Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,
264. Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?
265. Who answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'
266. Then riding further past an armourer's,
267. Who, with back turned, and bowed above his work,
268. Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,
269. He put the self-same query, but the man
270. Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:
271. 'Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk
272. Has little time for idle questioners.'
273. Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:
274. 'A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!
275. Tits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!
276. Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg
277. The murmur of the world!  What is it to me?
278. O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,
279. Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!
280. Speak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,
281. Where can I get me harbourage for the night?
282. And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy?  Speak!'
283. Whereat the armourer turning all amazed
284. And seeing one so gay in purple silks,
285. Came forward with the helmet yet in hand
286. And answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;
287. We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,
288. And there is scantly time for half the work.
289. Arms? truth! I know not:  all are wanted here.
290. Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,
291. It may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er the bridge
292. Yonder.'  He spoke and fell to work again.

293. Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,
294. Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.
295. There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,
296. (His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,
297. Once fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:
298. 'Whither, fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,
299. 'O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.'
300. Then Yniol, 'Enter therefore and partake
301. The slender entertainment of a house
302. Once rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.'
303. 'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;
304. 'So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks
305. For supper, I will enter, I will eat
306. With all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'
307. Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,
308. And answered, 'Graver cause than yours is mine
309. To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:
310. But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,
311. We will not touch upon him even in jest.'

312. Then rode Geraint into the castle court,
313. His charger trampling many a prickly star
314. Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.
315. He looked and saw that all was ruinous.
316. Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;
317. And here had fallen a great part of a tower,
318. Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,
319. And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:
320. And high above a piece of turret stair,
321. Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound
322. Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems
323. Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,
324. And sucked the joining of the stones, and looked
325. A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.

326. And while he waited in the castle court,
327. The voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang
328. Clear through the open casement of the hall,
329. Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,
330. Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,
331. Moves him to think what kind of bird it is
332. That sings so delicately clear, and make
333. Conjecture of the plumage and the form;
334. So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;
335. And made him like a man abroad at morn
336. When first the liquid note beloved of men
337. Comes flying over many a windy wave
338. To Britain, and in April suddenly
339. Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,
340. And he suspends his converse with a friend,
341. Or it may be the labour of his hands,
342. To think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'
343. So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,
344. 'Here, by God's grace, is the one voice for me.'

345. It chanced the song that Enid sang was one
346. Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:

347. 'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;
348. Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;
349. Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.

350. 'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;
351. With that wild wheel we go not up or down;
352. Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.

353. 'Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;
354. Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;
355. For man is man and master of his fate.

356. 'Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;
357. Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;
358. Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.'

359. 'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the nest,'
360. Said Yniol; 'enter quickly.'  Entering then,
361. Right o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones,
362. The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,
363. He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;
364. And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,
365. That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,
366. Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,
367. Her daughter.  In a moment thought Geraint,
368. 'Here by God's rood is the one maid for me.'
369. But none spake word except the hoary Earl:
370. 'Enid, the good knight's horse stands in the court;
371. Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then
372. Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;
373. And we will make us merry as we may.
374. Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.'

375. He spake:  the Prince, as Enid past him, fain
376. To follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught
377. His purple scarf, and held, and said, 'Forbear!
378. Rest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,
379. Endures not that her guest should serve himself.'
380. And reverencing the custom of the house
381. Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.

382. So Enid took his charger to the stall;
383. And after went her way across the bridge,
384. And reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl
385. Yet spoke together, came again with one,
386. A youth, that following with a costrel bore
387. The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.
388. And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,
389. And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.
390. And then, because their hall must also serve
391. For kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,
392. And stood behind, and waited on the three.
393. And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,
394. Geraint had longing in him evermore
395. To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,
396. That crost the trencher as she laid it down:
397. But after all had eaten, then Geraint,
398. For now the wine made summer in his veins,
399. Let his eye rove in following, or rest
400. On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,
401. Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;
402. Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:

403. 'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;
404. This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.
405. His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:
406. For if he be the knight whom late I saw
407. Ride into that new fortress by your town,
408. White from the mason's hand, then have I sworn
409. From his own lips to have it--I am Geraint
410. Of Devon--for this morning when the Queen
411. Sent her own maiden to demand the name,
412. His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,
413. Struck at her with his whip, and she returned
414. Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore
415. That I would track this caitiff to his hold,
416. And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.
417. And all unarmed I rode, and thought to find
418. Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;
419. They take the rustic murmur of their bourg
420. For the great wave that echoes round the world;
421. They would not hear me speak:  but if ye know
422. Where I can light on arms, or if yourself
423. Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn
424. That I will break his pride and learn his name,
425. Avenging this great insult done the Queen.'

426. Then cried Earl Yniol, 'Art thou he indeed,
427. Geraint, a name far-sounded among men
428. For noble deeds? and truly I, when first
429. I saw you moving by me on the bridge,
430. Felt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state
431. And presence might have guessed you one of those
432. That eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.
433. Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;
434. For this dear child hath often heard me praise
435. Your feats of arms, and often when I paused
436. Hath asked again, and ever loved to hear;
437. So grateful is the noise of noble deeds
438. To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:
439. O never yet had woman such a pair
440. Of suitors as this maiden:  first Limours,
441. A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,
442. Drunk even when he wooed; and be he dead
443. I know not, but he past to the wild land.
444. The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,
445. My curse, my nephew--I will not let his name
446. Slip from my lips if I can help it--he,
447. When that I knew him fierce and turbulent
448. Refused her to him, then his pride awoke;
449. And since the proud man often is the mean,
450. He sowed a slander in the common ear,
451. Affirming that his father left him gold,
452. And in my charge, which was not rendered to him;
453. Bribed with large promises the men who served
454. About my person, the more easily
455. Because my means were somewhat broken into
456. Through open doors and hospitality;
457. Raised my own town against me in the night
458. Before my Enid's birthday, sacked my house;
459. From mine own earldom foully ousted me;
460. Built that new fort to overawe my friends,
461. For truly there are those who love me yet;
462. And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,
463. Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,
464. But that his pride too much despises me:
465. And I myself sometimes despise myself;
466. For I have let men be, and have their way;
467. Am much too gentle, have not used my power:
468. Nor know I whether I be very base
469. Or very manful, whether very wise
470. Or very foolish; only this I know,
471. That whatsoever evil happen to me,
472. I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,
473. But can endure it all most patiently.'

474. 'Well said, true heart,' replied Geraint, 'but arms,
475. That if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight
476. In next day's tourney I may break his pride.'

477. And Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old
478. And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,
479. Are mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.
480. But in this tournament can no man tilt,
481. Except the lady he loves best be there.
482. Two forks are fixt into the meadow ground,
483. And over these is placed a silver wand,
484. And over that a golden sparrow-hawk,
485. The prize of beauty for the fairest there.
486. And this, what knight soever be in field
487. Lays claim to for the lady at his side,
488. And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,
489. Who being apt at arms and big of bone
490. Has ever won it for the lady with him,
491. And toppling over all antagonism
492. Has earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'
493. But thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.'

494. To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,
495. Leaning a little toward him, 'Thy leave!
496. Let ME lay lance in rest, O noble host,
497. For this dear child, because I never saw,
498. Though having seen all beauties of our time,
499. Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.
500. And if I fall her name will yet remain
501. Untarnished as before; but if I live,
502. So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,
503. As I will make her truly my true wife.'

504. Then, howsoever patient, Yniol's heart
505. Danced in his bosom, seeing better days,
506. And looking round he saw not Enid there,
507. (Who hearing her own name had stolen away)
508. But that old dame, to whom full tenderly
509. And folding all her hand in his he said,
510. 'Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,
511. And best by her that bore her understood.
512. Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest
513. Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.'

514. So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she
515. With frequent smile and nod departing found,
516. Half disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;
517. Whom first she kissed on either cheek, and then
518. On either shining shoulder laid a hand,
519. And kept her off and gazed upon her face,
520. And told them all their converse in the hall,
521. Proving her heart:  but never light and shade
522. Coursed one another more on open ground
523. Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale
524. Across the face of Enid hearing her;
525. While slowly falling as a scale that falls,
526. When weight is added only grain by grain,
527. Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;
528. Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,
529. Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;
530. So moving without answer to her rest
531. She found no rest, and ever failed to draw
532. The quiet night into her blood, but lay
533. Contemplating her own unworthiness;
534. And when the pale and bloodless east began
535. To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised
536. Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved
537. Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,
538. And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.

539. And thither came the twain, and when Geraint
540. Beheld her first in field, awaiting him,
541. He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,
542. Himself beyond the rest pushing could move
543. The chair of Idris.  Yniol's rusted arms
544. Were on his princely person, but through these
545. Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights
546. And ladies came, and by and by the town
547. Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists.
548. And there they fixt the forks into the ground,
549. And over these they placed the silver wand,
550. And over that the golden sparrow-hawk.
551. Then Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown,
552. Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed,
553. 'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,
554. What I these two years past have won for thee,
555. The prize of beauty.'  Loudly spake the Prince,
556. 'Forbear:  there is a worthier,' and the knight
557. With some surprise and thrice as much disdain
558. Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face
559. Glowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,
560. So burnt he was with passion, crying out,
561. 'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice
562. They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.
563. Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each
564. So often and with such blows, that all the crowd
565. Wondered, and now and then from distant walls
566. There came a clapping as of phantom hands.
567. So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still
568. The dew of their great labour, and the blood
569. Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.
570. But either's force was matched till Yniol's cry,
571. 'Remember that great insult done the Queen,'
572. Increased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,
573. And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,
574. And felled him, and set foot upon his breast,
575. And said, 'Thy name?'  To whom the fallen man
576. Made answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd!
577. Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.
578. My pride is broken:  men have seen my fall.'
579. 'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,
580. 'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.
581. First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,
582. Shalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there,
583. Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,
584. And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,
585. Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.
586. These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'
587. And Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do,
588. For I have never yet been overthrown,
589. And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride
590. Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!'
591. And rising up, he rode to Arthur's court,
592. And there the Queen forgave him easily.
593. And being young, he changed and came to loathe
594. His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself
595. Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last
596. In the great battle fighting for the King.

597. But when the third day from the hunting-morn
598. Made a low splendour in the world, and wings
599. Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay
600. With her fair head in the dim-yellow light,
601. Among the dancing shadows of the birds,
602. Woke and bethought her of her promise given
603. No later than last eve to Prince Geraint--
604. So bent he seemed on going the third day,
605. He would not leave her, till her promise given--
606. To ride with him this morning to the court,
607. And there be made known to the stately Queen,
608. And there be wedded with all ceremony.
609. At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,
610. And thought it never yet had looked so mean.
611. For as a leaf in mid-November is
612. To what it is in mid-October, seemed
613. The dress that now she looked on to the dress
614. She looked on ere the coming of Geraint.
615. And still she looked, and still the terror grew
616. Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,
617. All staring at her in her faded silk:
618. And softly to her own sweet heart she said:

619. 'This noble prince who won our earldom back,
620. So splendid in his acts and his attire,
621. Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!
622. Would he could tarry with us here awhile,
623. But being so beholden to the Prince,
624. It were but little grace in any of us,
625. Bent as he seemed on going this third day,
626. To seek a second favour at his hands.
627. Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,
628. Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,
629. Far liefer than so much discredit him.'

630. And Enid fell in longing for a dress
631. All branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift
632. Of her good mother, given her on the night
633. Before her birthday, three sad years ago,
634. That night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,
635. And scattered all they had to all the winds:
636. For while the mother showed it, and the two
637. Were turning and admiring it, the work
638. To both appeared so costly, rose a cry
639. That Edyrn's men were on them, and they fled
640. With little save the jewels they had on,
641. Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:
642. And Edyrn's men had caught them in their flight,
643. And placed them in this ruin; and she wished
644. The Prince had found her in her ancient home;
645. Then let her fancy flit across the past,
646. And roam the goodly places that she knew;
647. And last bethought her how she used to watch,
648. Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;
649. And one was patched and blurred and lustreless
650. Among his burnished brethren of the pool;
651. And half asleep she made comparison
652. Of that and these to her own faded self
653. And the gay court, and fell asleep again;
654. And dreamt herself was such a faded form
655. Among her burnished sisters of the pool;
656. But this was in the garden of a king;
657. And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew
658. That all was bright; that all about were birds
659. Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;
660. That all the turf was rich in plots that looked
661. Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;
662. And lords and ladies of the high court went
663. In silver tissue talking things of state;
664. And children of the King in cloth of gold
665. Glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;
666. And while she thought 'They will not see me,' came
667. A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,
668. And all the children in their cloth of gold
669. Ran to her, crying, 'If we have fish at all
670. Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now
671. To pick the faded creature from the pool,
672. And cast it on the mixen that it die.'
673. And therewithal one came and seized on her,
674. And Enid started waking, with her heart
675. All overshadowed by the foolish dream,
676. And lo! it was her mother grasping her
677. To get her well awake; and in her hand
678. A suit of bright apparel, which she laid
679. Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:

680. 'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,
681. How fast they hold like colours of a shell
682. That keeps the wear and polish of the wave.
683. Why not?  It never yet was worn, I trow:
684. Look on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.'

685. And Enid looked, but all confused at first,
686. Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream:
687. Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,
688. And answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,
689. So sadly lost on that unhappy night;
690. Your own good gift!'  'Yea, surely,' said the dame,
691. 'And gladly given again this happy morn.
692. For when the jousts were ended yesterday,
693. Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere
694. He found the sack and plunder of our house
695. All scattered through the houses of the town;
696. And gave command that all which once was ours
697. Should now be ours again:  and yester-eve,
698. While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,
699. Came one with this and laid it in my hand,
700. For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,
701. Because we have our earldom back again.
702. And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,
703. But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.
704. Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?
705. For I myself unwillingly have worn
706. My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,
707. And howsoever patient, Yniol his.
708. Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,
709. With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,
710. And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,
711. And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all
712. That appertains to noble maintenance.
713. Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;
714. But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,
715. And all through that young traitor, cruel need
716. Constrained us, but a better time has come;
717. So clothe yourself in this, that better fits
718. Our mended fortunes and a Prince's bride:
719. For though ye won the prize of fairest fair,
720. And though I heard him call you fairest fair,
721. Let never maiden think, however fair,
722. She is not fairer in new clothes than old.
723. And should some great court-lady say, the Prince
724. Hath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,
725. And like a madman brought her to the court,
726. Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince
727. To whom we are beholden; but I know,
728. That when my dear child is set forth at her best,
729. That neither court nor country, though they sought
730. Through all the provinces like those of old
731. That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'

732. Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;
733. And Enid listened brightening as she lay;
734. Then, as the white and glittering star of morn
735. Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by
736. Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,
737. And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,
738. Helped by the mother's careful hand and eye,
739. Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;
740. Who, after, turned her daughter round, and said,
741. She never yet had seen her half so fair;
742. And called her like that maiden in the tale,
743. Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers
744. And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,
745. Flur, for whose love the Roman Csar first
746. Invaded Britain, 'But we beat him back,
747. As this great Prince invaded us, and we,
748. Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy
749. And I can scarcely ride with you to court,
750. For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;
751. But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream
752. I see my princess as I see her now,
753. Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.'

754. But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint
755. Woke where he slept in the high hall, and called
756. For Enid, and when Yniol made report
757. Of that good mother making Enid gay
758. In such apparel as might well beseem
759. His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,
760. He answered:  'Earl, entreat her by my love,
761. Albeit I give no reason but my wish,
762. That she ride with me in her faded silk.'
763. Yniol with that hard message went; it fell
764. Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:
765. For Enid, all abashed she knew not why,
766. Dared not to glance at her good mother's face,
767. But silently, in all obedience,
768. Her mother silent too, nor helping her,
769. Laid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,
770. And robed them in her ancient suit again,
771. And so descended.  Never man rejoiced
772. More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;
773. And glancing all at once as keenly at her
774. As careful robins eye the delver's toil,
775. Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,
776. But rested with her sweet face satisfied;
777. Then seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,
778. Her by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,

779. 'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved
780. At thy new son, for my petition to her.
781. When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,
782. In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,
783. Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,
784. Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.
785. Thereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,
786. Beholding one so bright in dark estate,
787. I vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,
788. No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst
789. Sunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,
790. That service done so graciously would bind
791. The two together; fain I would the two
792. Should love each other:  how can Enid find
793. A nobler friend?  Another thought was mine;
794. I came among you here so suddenly,
795. That though her gentle presence at the lists
796. Might well have served for proof that I was loved,
797. I doubted whether daughter's tenderness,
798. Or easy nature, might not let itself
799. Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;
800. Or whether some false sense in her own self
801. Of my contrasting brightness, overbore
802. Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;
803. And such a sense might make her long for court
804. And all its perilous glories:  and I thought,
805. That could I someway prove such force in her
806. Linked with such love for me, that at a word
807. (No reason given her) she could cast aside
808. A splendour dear to women, new to her,
809. And therefore dearer; or if not so new,
810. Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power
811. Of intermitted usage; then I felt
812. That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,
813. Fixt on her faith.  Now, therefore, I do rest,
814. A prophet certain of my prophecy,
815. That never shadow of mistrust can cross
816. Between us.  Grant me pardon for my thoughts:
817. And for my strange petition I will make
818. Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,
819. When your fair child shall wear your costly gift
820. Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,
821. Who knows? another gift of the high God,
822. Which, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.'

823. He spoke:  the mother smiled, but half in tears,
824. Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,
825. And claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.

826. Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed
827. The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,
828. Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,
829. And white sails flying on the yellow sea;
830. But not to goodly hill or yellow sea
831. Looked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,
832. By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;
833. And then descending met them at the gates,
834. Embraced her with all welcome as a friend,
835. And did her honour as the Prince's bride,
836. And clothed her for her bridals like the sun;
837. And all that week was old Caerleon gay,
838. For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,
839. They twain were wedded with all ceremony.

840. And this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.
841. But Enid ever kept the faded silk,
842. Remembering how first he came on her,
843. Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,
844. And all her foolish fears about the dress,
845. And all his journey toward her, as himself
846. Had told her, and their coming to the court.

847. And now this morning when he said to her,
848. 'Put on your worst and meanest dress,' she found
849. And took it, and arrayed herself therein.
