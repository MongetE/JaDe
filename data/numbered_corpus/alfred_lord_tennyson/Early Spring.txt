1. Once more the Heavenly Power
2. Makes all things new,
3. And domes the red-plowed hills
4. With loving blue;
5. The blackbirds have their wills,
6. The throstles too.

7. Opens a door in Heaven;
8. From skies of glass
9. A Jacob's ladder falls
10. On greening grass,
11. And o'er the mountain-walls
12. Young angels pass.

13. Before them fleets the shower,
14. And burst the buds,
15. And shine the level lands,
16. And flash the floods;
17. The stars are from their hands
18. Flung through the woods,

19. The woods with living airs
20. How softly fanned,
21. Light airs from where the deep,
22. All down the sand,
23. Is breathing in his sleep,
24. Heard by the land.

25. O, follow, leaping blood,
26. The season's lure!
27. O heart, look down and up,
28. Serene, secure,
29. Warm as the crocus cup,
30. Like snow-drops, pure!

31. Past, Future glimpse and fade
32. Through some slight spell,
33. A gleam from yonder vale,
34. Some far blue fell;
35. And sympathies, how frail,
36. In sound and smell!

37. Till at thy chuckled note,
38. Thou twinkling bird,
39. The fairy fancies range,
40. And, lightly stirred,
41. Ring little bells of change
42. From word to word.

43. For now the Heavenly Power
44. Makes all things new,
45. And thaws the cold, and fills
46. The flower with dew;
47. The blackbirds have their wills,
48. The poets too.
