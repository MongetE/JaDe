1. I envy not in any moods
2. The captive void of noble rage,
3. The linnet born within the cage,
4. That never knew the summer woods:
5. I envy not the beast that takes
6. His license in the field of time,
7. Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,
8. To whom a conscience never wakes;
9. Nor, what may count itself as blest,
10. The heart that never plighted troth
11. But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;
12. Nor any want-begotten rest.

13. I hold it true, whate'er befall;
14. I feel it, when I sorrow most;
15. 'Tis better to have loved and lost
16. Than never to have loved at all.
