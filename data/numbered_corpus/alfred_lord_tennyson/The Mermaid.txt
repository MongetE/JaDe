1. I

2. Who would be
3. A mermaid fair,
4. Singing alone,
5. Combing her hair
6. Under the sea,
7. In a golden curl
8. With a comb of pearl,
9. On a throne?

10. II

11. I would be a mermaid fair;
12. I would sing to myself the whole of the day;
13. With a comb of pearl I would comb my hair;
14. And still as I comb'd I would sing and say,
15. 'Who is it loves me? who loves not me?'
16. I would comb my hair till my ringlets would fall
17. Low adown, low adown,
18. From under my starry sea-bud crown
19. Low adown and around,
20. And I should look like a fountain of gold
21. Springing alone
22. With a shrill inner sound
23. Over the throne
24. In the midst of the hall;
25. Till that great sea-snake under the sea
26. From his coiled sleeps in the central deeps
27. Would slowly trail himself sevenfold
28. Round the hall where I sate, and look in at the gate
29. With his large calm eyes for the love of me.
30. And all the mermen under the sea
31. Would feel their immortality
32. Die in their hearts for the love of me.

33. III

34. But at night I would wander away, away,
35. I would fling on each side my low-flowing locks,
36. And lightly vault from the throne and play
37. With the mermen in and out of the rocks;
38. We would run to and fro, and hide and seek,
39. On the broad sea-wolds in the crimson shells,
40. Whose silvery spikes are nighest the sea.
41. But if any came near I would call and shriek,
42. And adown the steep like a wave I would leap
43. From the diamond-ledges that jut from the dells;
44. For I would not be kiss'd by all who would list
45. Of the bold merry mermen under the sea.
46. They would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me,
47. In the purple twilights under the sea;
48. But the king of them all would carry me,
49. Woo me, and win me, and marry me,
50. In the branching jaspers under the sea.
51. Then all the dry-pied things that be
52. In the hueless mosses under the sea
53. Would curl round my silver feet silently,
54. All looking up for the love of me.
55. And if I should carol aloud, from aloft
56. All things that are forked, and horned, and soft
57. Would lean out from the hollow sphere of the sea,
58. All looking down for the love of me.
