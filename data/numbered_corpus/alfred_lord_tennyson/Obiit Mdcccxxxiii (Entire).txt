1. Strong Son of God, immortal Love,
2. Whom we, that have not seen thy face,
3. By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
4. Believing where we cannot prove;
5. Thine are these orbs of light and shade;
6. Thou madest Life in man and brute;
7. Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot
8. Is on the skull which thou hast made.

9. Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:
10. Thou madest man, he knows not why,
11. He thinks he was not made to die;
12. And thou hast made him: thou art just.

13. Thou seemest human and divine,
14. The highest, holiest manhood, thou:
15. Our wills are ours, we know not how;
16. Our wills are ours, to make them thine.

17. Our little systems have their day;
18. They have their day and cease to be:
19. They are but broken lights of thee,
20. And thou, O Lord, art more than they.

21. We have but faith: we cannot know;
22. For knowledge is of things we see;
23. And yet we trust it comes from thee,
24. A beam in darkness: let it grow.

25. Let knowledge grow from more to more,
26. But more of reverence in us dwell;
27. That mind and soul, according well,
28. May make one music as before,

29. But vaster. We are fools and slight;
30. We mock thee when we do not fear:
31. But help thy foolish ones to bear;
32. Help thy vain worlds to bear thy light.

33. Forgive what seem’d my sin in me;
34. What seem’d my worth since I began;
35. For merit lives from man to man,
36. And not from man, O Lord, to thee.

37. Forgive my grief for one removed,
38. Thy creature, whom I found so fair.
39. I trust he lives in thee, and there
40. I find him worthier to be loved.

41. Forgive these wild and wandering cries,
42. Confusions of a wasted youth;
43. Forgive them where they fail in truth,
44. And in thy wisdom make me wise.



45. I.

46. I held it truth, with him who sings
47. To one clear harp in divers tones,
48. That men may rise on stepping-stones
49. Of their dead selves to higher things.
50. But who shall so forecast the years
51. And find in loss a gain to match?
52. Or reach a hand thro’ time to catch
53. The far-off interest of tears?

54. Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown’d,
55. Let darkness keep her raven gloss:
56. Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss,
57. To dance with death, to beat the ground,

58. Than that the victor Hours should scorn
59. The long result of love, and boast,
60. ‘Behold the man that loved and lost,
61. But all he was is overworn.’



62. II.

63. Old Yew, which graspest at the stones
64. That name the under-lying dead,
65. Thy fibres net the dreamless head,
66. Thy roots are wrapt about the bones.
67. The seasons bring the flower again,
68. And bring the firstling to the flock;
69. And in the dusk of thee, the clock
70. Beats out the little lives of men.

71. O not for thee the glow, the bloom,
72. Who changest not in any gale,
73. Nor branding summer suns avail
74. To touch thy thousand years of gloom:

75. And gazing on thee, sullen tree,
76. Sick for thy stubborn hardihood,
77. I seem to fail from out my blood
78. And grow incorporate into thee.



79. III.


80. O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,
81. O Priestess in the vaults of Death,
82. O sweet and bitter in a breath,
83. What whispers from thy lying lip?
84. ‘The stars,’ she whispers, ‘blindly run;
85. A web is wov’n across the sky;
86. From out waste places comes a cry,
87. And murmurs from the dying sun:

88. ‘And all the phantom, Nature, stands–
89. With all the music in her tone,
90. A hollow echo of my own,–
91. A hollow form with empty hands.’

92. And shall I take a thing so blind,
93. Embrace her as my natural good;
94. Or crush her, like a vice of blood,
95. Upon the threshold of the mind?



96. IV.

97. To Sleep I give my powers away;
98. My will is bondsman to the dark;
99. I sit within a helmless bark,
100. And with my heart I muse and say:
101. O heart, how fares it with thee now,
102. That thou should’st fail from thy desire,
103. Who scarcely darest to inquire,
104. ‘What is it makes me beat so low?’

105. Something it is which thou hast lost,
106. Some pleasure from thine early years.
107. Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears,
108. That grief hath shaken into frost!

109. Such clouds of nameless trouble cross
110. All night below the darken’d eyes;
111. With morning wakes the will, and cries,
112. ‘Thou shalt not be the fool of loss.’



113. V.

114. I sometimes hold it half a sin
115. To put in words the grief I feel;
116. For words, like Nature, half reveal
117. And half conceal the Soul within.
118. But, for the unquiet heart and brain,
119. A use in measured language lies;
120. The sad mechanic exercise,
121. Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.

122. In words, like weeds, I’ll wrap me o’er,
123. Like coarsest clothes against the cold:
124. But that large grief which these enfold
125. Is given in outline and no more.



126. VI.

127. One writes, that ‘Other friends remain,’
128. That ‘Loss is common to the race’–
129. And common is the commonplace,
130. And vacant chaff well meant for grain.
131. That loss is common would not make
132. My own less bitter, rather more:
133. Too common! Never morning wore
134. To evening, but some heart did break.

135. O father, wheresoe’er thou be,
136. Who pledgest now thy gallant son;
137. A shot, ere half thy draught be done,
138. Hath still’d the life that beat from thee.

139. O mother, praying God will save
140. Thy sailor,–while thy head is bow’d,
141. His heavy-shotted hammock-shroud
142. Drops in his vast and wandering grave.

143. Ye know no more than I who wrought
144. At that last hour to please him well;
145. Who mused on all I had to tell,
146. And something written, something thought;

147. Expecting still his advent home;
148. And ever met him on his way
149. With wishes, thinking, ‘here to-day,’
150. Or ‘here to-morrow will he come.’

151. O somewhere, meek, unconscious dove,
152. That sittest ranging golden hair;
153. And glad to find thyself so fair,
154. Poor child, that waitest for thy love!

155. For now her father’s chimney glows
156. In expectation of a guest;
157. And thinking ‘this will please him best,’
158. She takes a riband or a rose;

159. For he will see them on to-night;
160. And with the thought her colour burns;
161. And, having left the glass, she turns
162. Once more to set a ringlet right;

163. And, even when she turn’d, the curse
164. Had fallen, and her future Lord
165. Was drown’d in passing thro’ the ford,
166. Or kill’d in falling from his horse.

167. O what to her shall be the end?
168. And what to me remains of good?
169. To her, perpetual maidenhood,
170. And unto me no second friend.



171. VII.

172. Dark house, by which once more I stand
173. Here in the long unlovely street,
174. Doors, where my heart was used to beat
175. So quickly, waiting for a hand,
176. A hand that can be clasp’d no more–
177. Behold me, for I cannot sleep,
178. And like a guilty thing I creep
179. At earliest morning to the door.

180. He is not here; but far away
181. The noise of life begins again,
182. And ghastly thro’ the drizzling rain
183. On the bald street breaks the blank day.



184. VIII.

185. A happy lover who has come
186. To look on her that loves him well,
187. Who ’lights and rings the gateway bell,
188. And learns her gone and far from home;
189. He saddens, all the magic light
190. Dies off at once from bower and hall,
191. And all the place is dark, and all
192. The chambers emptied of delight:

193. So find I every pleasant spot
194. In which we two were wont to meet,
195. The field, the chamber and the street,
196. For all is dark where thou art not.

197. Yet as that other, wandering there
198. In those deserted walks, may find
199. A flower beat with rain and wind,
200. Which once she foster'd up with care;

201. So seems it in my deep regret,
202. O my forsaken heart, with thee
203. And this poor flower of poesy
204. Which little cared for fades not yet.

205. But since it pleased a vanish’d eye,
206. I go to plant it on his tomb,
207. That if it can it there may bloom,
208. Or dying, there at least may die.



209. IX.

210. Fair ship, that from the Italian shore
211. Sailest the placid ocean-plains
212. With my lost Arthur’s loved remains,
213. Spread thy full wings, and waft him o’er.
214. So draw him home to those that mourn
215. In vain; a favourable speed
216. Ruffle thy mirror’d mast, and lead
217. Thro’ prosperous floods his holy urn.

218. All night no ruder air perplex
219. Thy sliding keel, till Phosphor, bright
220. As our pure love, thro’ early light
221. Shall glimmer on the dewy decks.

222. Sphere all your lights around, above;
223. Sleep, gentle heavens, before the prow;
224. Sleep, gentle winds, as he sleeps now,
225. My friend, the brother of my love;

226. My Arthur, whom I shall not see
227. Till all my widow’d race be run;
228. Dear as the mother to the son,
229. More than my brothers are to me.



230. X.

231. I hear the noise about thy keel;
232. I hear the bell struck in the night:
233. I see the cabin-window bright;
234. I see the sailor at the wheel.
235. Thou bring’st the sailor to his wife,
236. And travell’d men from foreign lands;
237. And letters unto trembling hands;
238. And, thy dark freight, a vanish’d life.

239. So bring him: we have idle dreams:
240. This look of quiet flatters thus
241. Our home-bred fancies: O to us,
242. The fools of habit, sweeter seems

243. To rest beneath the clover sod,
244. That takes the sunshine and the rains,
245. Or where the kneeling hamlet drains
246. The chalice of the grapes of God;

247. Than if with thee the roaring wells
248. Should gulf him fathom-deep in brine;
249. And hands so often clasp’d in mine,
250. Should toss with tangle and with shells.



251. XI.

252. Calm is the morn without a sound,
253. Calm as to suit a calmer grief,
254. And only thro’ the faded leaf
255. The chestnut pattering to the ground:
256. Calm and deep peace on this high wold,
257. And on these dews that drench the furze,
258. And all the silvery gossamers
259. That twinkle into green and gold:

260. Calm and still light on yon great plain
261. That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,
262. And crowded farms and lessening towers,
263. To mingle with the bounding main:

264. Calm and deep peace in this wide air,
265. These leaves that redden to the fall;
266. And in my heart, if calm at all,
267. If any calm, a calm despair:

268. Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,
269. And waves that sway themselves in rest,
270. And dead calm in that noble breast
271. Which heaves but with the heaving deep.



272. XII.

273. Lo, as a dove when up she springs
274. To bear thro’ Heaven a tale of woe,
275. Some dolorous message knit below
276. The wild pulsation of her wings;
277. Like her I go; I cannot stay;
278. I leave this mortal ark behind,
279. A weight of nerves without a mind,
280. And leave the cliffs, and haste away

281. O’er ocean-mirrors rounded large,
282. And reach the glow of southern skies,
283. And see the sails at distance rise,
284. And linger weeping on the marge,

285. And saying; ‘Comes he thus, my friend?
286. Is this the end of all my care?’
287. And circle moaning in the air:
288. ‘Is this the end? Is this the end?’

289. And forward dart again, and play
290. About the prow, and back return
291. To where the body sits, and learn
292. That I have been an hour away.



293. XIII.

294. Tears of the widower, when he sees
295. A late-lost form that sleep reveals,
296. And moves his doubtful arms, and feels
297. Her place is empty, fall like these;
298. Which weep a loss for ever new,
299. A void where heart on heart reposed;
300. And, where warm hands have prest and closed,
301. Silence, till I be silent too.

302. Which weeps the comrade of my choice,
303. An awful thought, a life removed,
304. The human-hearted man I loved,
305. A Spirit, not a breathing voice.

306. Come Time, and teach me, many years,
307. I do not suffer in a dream;
308. For now so strange do these things seem,
309. Mine eyes have leisure for their tears;

310. My fancies time to rise on wing,
311. And glance about the approaching sails,
312. As tho’ they brought but merchants’ bales,
313. And not the burthen that they bring.



314. XIV.

315. If one should bring me this report,
316. That thou hadst touch’d the land to-day,
317. And I went down unto the quay,
318. And found thee lying in the port;
319. And standing, muffled round with woe,
320. Should see thy passengers in rank
321. Come stepping lightly down the plank,
322. And beckoning unto those they know;

323. And if along with these should come
324. The man I held as half-divine;
325. Should strike a sudden hand in mine,
326. And ask a thousand things of home;

327. And I should tell him all my pain,
328. And how my life had droop’d of late,
329. And he should sorrow o’er my state
330. And marvel what possess’d my brain;

331. And I perceived no touch of change,
332. No hint of death in all his frame,
333. But found him all in all the same,
334. I should not feel it to be strange.



335. XV.

336. To-night the winds begin to rise
337. And roar from yonder dropping day:
338. The last red leaf is whirl’d away,
339. The rooks are blown about the skies;
340. The forest crack’d, the waters curl’d,
341. The cattle huddled on the lea;
342. And wildly dash’d on tower and tree
343. The sunbeam strikes along the world:

344. And but for fancies, which aver
345. That all thy motions gently pass
346. Athwart a plane of molten glass,
347. I scarce could brook the strain and stir

348. That makes the barren branches loud;
349. And but for fear it is not so,
350. The wild unrest that lives in woe
351. Would dote and pore on yonder cloud

352. That rises upward always higher,
353. And onward drags a labouring breast,
354. And topples round the dreary west,
355. A looming bastion fringed with fire.



356. XVI.

357. What words are these have fall’n from me?
358. Can calm despair and wild unrest
359. Be tenants of a single breast,
360. Or sorrow such a changeling be?
361. Or doth she only seem to take
362. The touch of change in calm or storm;
363. But knows no more of transient form
364. In her deep self, than some dead lake

365. That holds the shadow of a lark
366. Hung in the shadow of a heaven?
367. Or has the shock, so harshly given,
368. Confused me like the unhappy bark

369. That strikes by night a craggy shelf,
370. And staggers blindly ere she sink?
371. And stunn’d me from my power to think
372. And all my knowledge of myself;

373. And made me that delirious man
374. Whose fancy fuses old and new,
375. And flashes into false and true,
376. And mingles all without a plan?



377. XVII.

378. Thou comest, much wept for: such a breeze
379. Compell’d thy canvas, and my prayer
380. Was as the whisper of an air
381. To breathe thee over lonely seas.
382. For I in spirit saw thee move
383. Thro’ circles of the bounding sky,
384. Week after week: the days go by:
385. Come quick, thou bringest all I love.

386. Henceforth, wherever thou may’st roam,
387. My blessing, like a line of light,
388. Is on the waters day and night,
389. And like a beacon guards thee home.

390. So may whatever tempest mars
391. Mid-ocean, spare thee, sacred bark;
392. And balmy drops in summer dark
393. Slide from the bosom of the stars.

394. So kind an office hath been done,
395. Such precious relics brought by thee;
396. The dust of him I shall not see
397. Till all my widow’d race be run.



398. XVIII.

399. ’Tis well; ’tis something; we may stand
400. Where he in English earth is laid,
401. And from his ashes may be made
402. The violet of his native land.
403. ’Tis little; but it looks in truth
404. As if the quiet bones were blest
405. Among familiar names to rest
406. And in the places of his youth.

407. Come then, pure hands, and bear the head
408. That sleeps or wears the mask of sleep,
409. And come, whatever loves to weep,
410. And hear the ritual of the dead.

411. Ah yet, ev’n yet, if this might be,
412. I, falling on his faithful heart,
413. Would breathing thro’ his lips impart
414. The life that almost dies in me;

415. That dies not, but endures with pain,
416. And slowly forms the the firmer mind,
417. Treasuring the look it cannot find,
418. The words that are not heard again.



419. XIX.

420. The Danube to the Severn gave
421. The darken’d heart that beat no more;
422. They laid him by the pleasant shore,
423. And in the hearing of the wave.
424. There twice a day the Severn fills;
425. That salt sea-water passes by,
426. And hushes half the babbling Wye,
427. And makes a silence in the hills.

428. The Wye is hush’d nor moved along,
429. And hush’d my deepest grief of all,
430. When fill’d with tears that cannot fall,
431. I brim with sorrow drowning song.

432. The tide flows down, the wave again
433. Is vocal in its wooded walls;
434. My deeper anguish also falls,
435. And I can speak a little then.



436. XX.

437. The lesser griefs that may be said,
438. That breathe a thousand tender vows,
439. Are but as servants in a house
440. Where lies the master newly dead;
441. Who speak their feeling as it is,
442. And weep the fulness from the mind:
443. ‘It will be hard,’ they say, ‘to find
444. Another service such as this.’

445. My lighter moods are like to these,
446. That out of words a comfort win;
447. But there are other griefs within,
448. And tears that at their fountain freeze;

449. For by the hearth the children sit
450. Cold in that atmosphere of Death,
451. And scarce endure to draw the breath,
452. Or like to noiseless phantoms flit:

453. But open converse is there none,
454. So much the vital spirits sink
455. To see the vacant chair, and think,
456. ‘How good! how kind! and he is gone.’



457. XXI.

458. I sing to him that rests below,
459. And, since the grasses round me wave,
460. I take the grasses of the grave,
461. And make them pipes whereon to blow.
462. The traveller hears me now and then,
463. And sometimes harshly will he speak:
464. ‘This fellow would make weakness weak,
465. And melt the waxen hearts of men.’

466. Another answers, ‘Let him be,
467. He loves to make parade of pain,
468. That with his piping he may gain
469. The praise that comes to constancy.’

470. A third is wroth: ‘Is this an hour
471. For private sorrow’s barren song,
472. When more and more the people throng
473. The chairs and thrones of civil power?

474. ‘A time to sicken and to swoon,
475. When Science reaches forth her arms
476. To feel from world to world, and charms
477. Her secret from the latest moon?’

478. Behold, ye speak an idle thing:
479. Ye never knew the sacred dust:
480. I do but sing because I must,
481. And pipe but as the linnets sing:

482. And one is glad; her note is gay,
483. For now her little ones have ranged;
484. And one is sad; her note is changed,
485. Because her brood is stol’n away.



486. XXII.

487. The path by which we twain did go,
488. Which led by tracts that pleased us well,
489. Thro’ four sweet years arose and fell,
490. From flower to flower, from snow to snow:
491. And we with singing cheer’d the way,
492. And, crown’d with all the season lent,
493. From April on to April went,
494. And glad at heart from May to May:

495. But where the path we walk’d began
496. To slant the fifth autumnal slope,
497. As we descended following Hope,
498. There sat the Shadow fear’d of man;

499. Who broke our fair companionship,
500. And spread his mantle dark and cold,
501. And wrapt thee formless in the fold,
502. And dull’d the murmur on thy lip,

503. And bore thee where I could not see
504. Nor follow, tho’ I walk in haste,
505. And think, that somewhere in the waste
506. The Shadow sits and waits for me.



507. XXIII.

508. Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut,
509. Or breaking into song by fits,
510. Alone, alone, to where he sits,
511. The Shadow cloak’d from head to foot,
512. Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,
513. I wander, often falling lame,
514. And looking back to whence I came,
515. Or on to where the pathway leads;

516. And crying, How changed from where it ran
517. Thro’ lands where not a leaf was dumb;
518. But all the lavish hills would hum
519. The murmur of a happy Pan:

520. When each by turns was guide to each,
521. And Fancy light from Fancy caught,
522. And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought
523. Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech;

524. And all we met was fair and good,
525. And all was good that Time could bring,
526. And all the secret of the Spring
527. Moved in the chambers of the blood;

528. And many an old philosophy
529. On Argive heights divinely sang,
530. And round us all the thicket rang
531. To many a flute of Arcady.



532. XXIV.

533. And was the day of my delight
534. As pure and perfect as I say?
535. The very source and fount of Day
536. Is dash’d with wandering isles of night.
537. If all was good and fair we met,
538. This earth had been the Paradise
539. It never look’d to human eyes
540. Since our first Sun arose and set.

541. And is it that the haze of grief
542. Makes former gladness loom so great?
543. The lowness of the present state,
544. That sets the past in this relief?

545. Or that the past will always win
546. A glory from its being far;
547. And orb into the perfect star
548. We saw not, when we moved therein?



549. XXV.

550. I know that this was Life,–the track
551. Whereon with equal feet we fared;
552. And then, as now, the day prepared
553. The daily burden for the back.
554. But this it was that made me move
555. As light as carrier-birds in air;
556. I loved the weight I had to bear,
557. Because it needed help of Love:

558. Nor could I weary, heart or limb,
559. When mighty Love would cleave in twain
560. The lading of a single pain,
561. And part it, giving half to him.



562. XXVI.

563. Still onward winds the dreary way;
564. I with it; for I long to prove
565. No lapse of moons can canker Love,
566. Whatever fickle tongues may say.
567. And if that eye which watches guilt
568. And goodness, and hath power to see
569. Within the green the moulder’d tree,
570. And towers fall’n as soon as built–

571. Oh, if indeed that eye foresee
572. Or see (in Him is no before)
573. In more of life true life no more
574. And Love the indifference to be,

575. Then might I find, ere yet the morn
576. Breaks hither over Indian seas,
577. That Shadow waiting with the keys,
578. To shroud me from my proper scorn.



579. XXVII.

580. I envy not in any moods
581. The captive void of noble rage,
582. The linnet born within the cage,
583. That never knew the summer woods:
584. I envy not the beast that takes
585. His license in the field of time,
586. Unfetter’d by the sense of crime,
587. To whom a conscience never wakes;

588. Nor, what may count itself as blest,
589. The heart that never plighted troth
590. But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;
591. Nor any want-begotten rest.

592. I hold it true, whate’er befall;
593. I feel it, when I sorrow most;
594. ’Tis better to have loved and lost
595. Than never to have loved at all.



596. XXVIII.

597. The time draws near the birth of Christ:
598. The moon is hid; the night is still;
599. The Christmas bells from hill to hill
600. Answer each other in the mist.
601. Four voices of four hamlets round,
602. From far and near, on mead and moor,
603. Swell out and fail, as if a door
604. Were shut between me and the sound:

605. Each voice four changes on the wind,
606. That now dilate, and now decrease,
607. Peace and goodwill, goodwill and peace,
608. Peace and goodwill, to all mankind.

609. This year I slept and woke with pain,
610. I almost wish’d no more to wake,
611. And that my hold on life would break
612. Before I heard those bells again:

613. But they my troubled spirit rule,
614. For they controll’d me when a boy;
615. They bring me sorrow touch’d with joy,
616. The merry merry bells of Yule.



617. XXIX.

618. With such compelling cause to grieve
619. As daily vexes household peace,
620. And chains regret to his decease,
621. How dare we keep our Christmas-eve;
622. Which brings no more a welcome guest
623. To enrich the threshold of the night
624. With shower’d largess of delight
625. In dance and song and game and jest?

626. Yet go, and while the holly boughs
627. Entwine the cold baptismal font,
628. Make one wreath more for Use and Wont,
629. That guard the portals of the house;

630. Old sisters of a day gone by,
631. Gray nurses, loving nothing new;
632. Why should they miss their yearly due
633. Before their time? They too will die.



634. XXX.

635. With trembling fingers did we weave
636. The holly round the Christmas hearth;
637. A rainy cloud possess’d the earth,
638. And sadly fell our Christmas-eve.
639. At our old pastimes in the hall
640. We gambol’d, making vain pretence
641. Of gladness, with an awful sense
642. Of one mute Shadow watching all.

643. We paused: the winds were in the beech:
644. We heard them sweep the winter land;
645. And in a circle hand-in-hand
646. Sat silent, looking each at each.

647. Then echo-like our voices rang;
648. We sung, tho’ every eye was dim,
649. A merry song we sang with him
650. Last year: impetuously we sang:

651. We ceased: a gentler feeling crept
652. Upon us: surely rest is meet:
653. ‘They rest,’ we said, ‘their sleep is sweet,’
654. And silence follow’d, and we wept.

655. Our voices took a higher range;
656. Once more we sang: ‘They do not die
657. Nor lose their mortal sympathy,
658. Nor change to us, although they change;

659. ‘Rapt from the fickle and the frail
660. With gather’d power, yet the same,
661. Pierces the keen seraphic flame
662. From orb to orb, from veil to veil.’

663. Rise, happy morn, rise, holy morn,
664. Draw forth the cheerful day from night:
665. O Father, touch the east, and light
666. The light that shone when Hope was born.



667. XXXI.

668. When Lazarus left his charnel-cave,
669. And home to Mary’s house return’d,
670. Was this demanded–if he yearn’d
671. To hear her weeping by his grave?
672. ‘Where wert thou, brother, those four days?’
673. There lives no record of reply,
674. Which telling what it is to die
675. Had surely added praise to praise.

676. From every house the neighbours met,
677. The streets were fill’d with joyful sound,
678. A solemn gladness even crown’d
679. The purple brows of Olivet.

680. Behold a man raised up by Christ!
681. The rest remaineth unreveal’d;
682. He told it not; or something seal’d
683. The lips of that Evangelist.



684. XXXII.

685. Her eyes are homes of silent prayer,
686. Nor other thought her mind admits
687. But, he was dead, and there he sits,
688. And he that brought him back is there.
689. Then one deep love doth supersede
690. All other, when her ardent gaze
691. Roves from the living brother’s face,
692. And rests upon the Life indeed.

693. All subtle thought, all curious fears,
694. Borne down by gladness so complete,
695. She bows, she bathes the Saviour’s feet
696. With costly spikenard and with tears.

697. Thrice blest whose lives are faithful prayers,
698. Whose loves in higher love endure;
699. What souls possess themselves so pure,
700. Or is there blessedness like theirs?



701. XXXIII.

702. O thou that after toil and storm
703. Mayst seem to have reach’d a purer air,
704. Whose faith has centre everywhere,
705. Nor cares to fix itself to form,
706. Leave thou thy sister when she prays,
707. Her early Heaven, her happy views;
708. Nor thou with shadow’d hint confuse
709. A life that leads melodious days.

710. Her faith thro’ form is pure as thine,
711. Her hands are quicker unto good:
712. Oh, sacred be the flesh and blood
713. To which she links a truth divine!

714. See thou, that countest reason ripe
715. In holding by the law within,
716. Thou fail not in a world of sin,
717. And ev’n for want of such a type.



718. XXXIV.

719. My own dim life should teach me this,
720. That life shall live for evermore,
721. Else earth is darkness at the core,
722. And dust and ashes all that is;
723. This round of green, this orb of flame,
724. Fantastic beauty; such as lurks
725. In some wild Poet, when he works
726. Without a conscience or an aim.

727. What then were God to such as I?
728. ’Twere hardly worth my while to choose
729. Of things all mortal, or to use
730. A little patience ere I die;

731. ’Twere best at once to sink to peace,
732. Like birds the charming serpent draws,
733. To drop head-foremost in the jaws
734. Of vacant darkness and to cease.



735. XXXV.

736. Yet if some voice that man could trust
737. Should murmur from the narrow house,
738. ‘The cheeks drop in; the body bows;
739. Man dies: nor is there hope in dust:’
740. Might I not say? ‘Yet even here,
741. But for one hour, O Love, I strive
742. To keep so sweet a thing alive:’
743. But I should turn mine ears and hear

744. The moanings of the homeless sea,
745. The sound of streams that swift or slow
746. Draw down Æonian hills, and sow
747. The dust of continents to be;

748. And Love would answer with a sigh,
749. ‘The sound of that forgetful shore
750. Will change my sweetness more and more,
751. Half-dead to know that I shall die.’

752. O me, what profits it to put
753. And idle case? If Death were seen
754. At first as Death, Love had not been,
755. Or been in narrowest working shut,

756. Mere fellowship of sluggish moods,
757. Or in his coarsest Satyr-shape
758. Had bruised the herb and crush’d the grape,
759. And bask’d and batten’d in the woods.



760. XXXVI.

761. Tho’ truths in manhood darkly join,
762. Deep-seated in our mystic frame,
763. We yield all blessing to the name
764. Of Him that made them current coin;
765. For Wisdom dealt with mortal powers,
766. Where truth in closest words shall fail,
767. When truth embodied in a tale
768. Shall enter in at lowly doors.

769. And so the Word had breath, and wrought
770. With human hands the creed of creeds
771. In loveliness of perfect deeds,
772. More strong than all poetic thought;

773. Which he may read that binds the sheaf,
774. Or builds the house, or digs the grave,
775. And those wild eyes that watch the wave
776. In roarings round the coral reef.



777. XXXVII.

778. Urania speaks with darken’d brow:
779. ‘Thou pratest here where thou art least;
780. This faith has many a purer priest,
781. And many an abler voice than thou.
782. ‘Go down beside thy native rill,
783. On thy Parnassus set thy feet,
784. And hear thy laurel whisper sweet
785. About the ledges of the hill.’

786. And my Melpomene replies,
787. A touch of shame upon her cheek:
788. ‘I am not worthy ev’n to speak
789. Of thy prevailing mysteries;

790. ‘For I am but an earthly Muse,
791. And owning but a little art
792. To lull with song an aching heart,
793. And render human love his dues;

794. ‘But brooding on the dear one dead,
795. And all he said of things divine,
796. (And dear to me as sacred wine
797. To dying lips is all he said),

798. ‘I murmur’d, as I came along,
799. Of comfort clasp’d in truth reveal’d;
800. And loiter’d in the master’s field,
801. And darken’d sanctities with song.’



802. XXXVIII.

803. With weary steps I loiter on,
804. Tho’ always under alter’d skies
805. The purple from the distance dies,
806. My prospect and horizon gone.
807. No joy the blowing season gives,
808. The herald melodies of spring,
809. But in the songs I love to sing
810. A doubtful gleam of solace lives.

811. If any care for what is here
812. Survive in spirits render’d free,
813. Then are these songs I sing of thee
814. Not all ungrateful to thine ear.



815. XXXIX.

816. Old warder of these buried bones,
817. And answering now my random stroke
818. With fruitful cloud and living smoke,
819. Dark yew, that graspest at the stones
820. And dippest toward the dreamless head,
821. To thee too comes the golden hour
822. When flower is feeling after flower;
823. But Sorrow–fixt upon the dead,

824. And darkening the dark graves of men,–
825. What whisper’d from her lying lips?
826. Thy gloom is kindled at the tips,
827. And passes into gloom again.



828. XL.

829. Could we forget the widow’d hour
830. And look on Spirits breathed away,
831. As on a maiden in the day
832. When first she wears her orange-flower!
833. When crown’d with blessing she doth rise
834. To take her latest leave of home,
835. And hopes and light regrets that come
836. Make April of her tender eyes;

837. And doubtful joys the father move,
838. And tears are on the mother’s face,
839. As parting with a long embrace
840. She enters other realms of love;

841. Her office there to rear, to teach,
842. Becoming as is meet and fit
843. A link among the days, to knit
844. The generations each with each;

845. And, doubtless, unto thee is given
846. A life that bears immortal fruit
847. In those great offices that suit
848. The full-grown energies of heaven.

849. Ay me, the difference I discern!
850. How often shall her old fireside
851. Be cheer’d with tidings of the bride,
852. How often she herself return,

853. And tell them all they would have told,
854. And bring her babe, and make her boast,
855. Till even those that miss’d her most
856. Shall count new things as dear as old:

857. But thou and I have shaken hands,
858. Till growing winters lay me low;
859. My paths are in the fields I know,
860. And thine in undiscover’d lands.



861. XLI.

862. The spirit ere our fatal loss
863. Did ever rise from high to higher;
864. As mounts the heavenward altar-fire,
865. As flies the lighter thro’ the gross.
866. But thou art turn’d to something strange,
867. And I have lost the links that bound
868. Thy changes; here upon the ground,
869. No more partaker of thy change.

870. Deep folly! yet that this could be–
871. That I could wing my will with might
872. To leap the grades of life and light,
873. And flash at once, my friend, to thee.

874. For tho’ my nature rarely yields
875. To that vague fear implied in death;
876. Nor shudders at the gulfs beneath,
877. The howlings from forgotten fields;

878. Yet oft when sundown skirts the moor
879. An inner trouble I behold,
880. A spectral doubt which makes me cold,
881. That I shall be thy mate no more,

882. Tho’ following with an upward mind
883. The wonders that have come to thee,
884. Thro’ all the secular to-be,
885. But evermore a life behind.



886. XLII.

887. I vex my heart with fancies dim:
888. He still outstript me in the race;
889. It was but unity of place
890. That made me dream I rank’d with him.
891. And so may Place retain us still,
892. And he the much-beloved again,
893. A lord of large experience, train
894. To riper growth the mind and will:

895. And what delights can equal those
896. That stir the spirit’s inner deeps,
897. When one that loves but knows not, reaps
898. A truth from one that loves and knows?



899. XLIII.

900. If Sleep and Death be truly one,
901. And every spirit’s folded bloom
902. Thro’ all its intervital gloom
903. In some long trance should slumber on;
904. Unconscious of the sliding hour,
905. Bare of the body, might it last,
906. And silent traces of the past
907. Be all the colour of the flower:

908. So then were nothing lost to man;
909. So that still garden of the souls
910. In many a figured leaf enrolls
911. The total world since life began;

912. And love will last as pure and whole
913. As when he loved me here in Time,
914. And at the spiritual prime
915. Rewaken with the dawning soul.



916. XLIV.

917. How fares it with the happy dead?
918. For here the man is more and more;
919. But he forgets the days before
920. God shut the doorways of his head.
921. The days have vanish’d, tone and tint,
922. And yet perhaps the hoarding sense
923. Gives out at times (he knows not whence)
924. A little flash, a mystic hint;

925. And in the long harmonious years
926. (If Death so taste Lethean springs),
927. May some dim touch of earthly things
928. Surprise thee ranging with thy peers.

929. If such a dreamy touch should fall,
930. O turn thee round, resolve the doubt;
931. My guardian angel will speak out
932. In that high place, and tell thee all.



933. XLV.

934. The baby new to earth and sky,
935. What time his tender palm is prest
936. Against the circle of the breast,
937. Has never thought that ‘this is I:’
938. But as he grows he gathers much,
939. And learns the use of ‘I,’ and ‘me,’
940. And finds ‘I am not what I see,
941. And other than the things I touch.’

942. So rounds he to a separate mind
943. From whence clear memory may begin,
944. As thro’ the frame that binds him in
945. His isolation grows defined.

946. This use may lie in blood and breath,
947. Which else were fruitless of their due,
948. Had man to learn himself anew
949. Beyond the second birth of Death.



950. XLVI.

951. We ranging down this lower track,
952. The path we came by, thorn and flower,
953. Is shadow’d by the growing hour,
954. Lest life should fail in looking back.
955. So be it: there no shade can last
956. In that deep dawn behind the tomb,
957. But clear from marge to marge shall bloom
958. The eternal landscape of the past;

959. A lifelong tract of time reveal’d;
960. The fruitful hours of still increase;
961. Days order’d in a wealthy peace,
962. And those five years its richest field.

963. O Love, thy province were not large,
964. A bounded field, nor stretching far;
965. Look also, Love, a brooding star,
966. A rosy warmth from marge to marge.



967. XLVII.

968. That each, who seems a separate whole,
969. Should move his rounds, and fusing all
970. The skirts of self again, should fall
971. Remerging in the general Soul,
972. Is faith as vague as all unsweet:
973. Eternal form shall still divide
974. The eternal soul from all beside;
975. And I shall know him when we meet:

976. And we shall sit at endless feast,
977. Enjoying each the other’s good:
978. What vaster dream can hit the mood
979. Of Love on earth? He seeks at least

980. Upon the last and sharpest height,
981. Before the spirits fade away,
982. Some landing-place, to clasp and say,
983. ‘Farewell! We lose ourselves in light.’



984. XLVIII.

985. If these brief lays, of Sorrow born,
986. Were taken to be such as closed
987. Grave doubts and answers here proposed,
988. Then these were such as men might scorn:
989. Her care is not to part and prove;
990. She takes, when harsher moods remit,
991. What slender shade of doubt may flit,
992. And makes it vassal unto love:

993. And hence, indeed, she sports with words,
994. But better serves a wholesome law,
995. And holds it sin and shame to draw
996. The deepest measure from the chords:

997. Nor dare she trust a larger lay,
998. But rather loosens from the lip
999. Short swallow-flights of song, that dip
1000. Their wings in tears, and skim away.



1001. XLIX.

1002. From art, from nature, from the schools,
1003. Let random influences glance,
1004. Like light in many a shiver’d lance
1005. That breaks about the dappled pools:
1006. The lightest wave of thought shall lisp,
1007. The fancy’s tenderest eddy wreathe,
1008. The slightest air of song shall breathe
1009. To make the sullen surface crisp.

1010. And look thy look, and go thy way,
1011. But blame not thou the winds that make
1012. The seeming-wanton ripple break,
1013. The tender-pencil’d shadow play.

1014. Beneath all fancied hopes and fears
1015. Ay me, the sorrow deepens down,
1016. Whose muffled motions blindly drown
1017. The bases of my life in tears.



1018. L.

1019. Be near me when my light is low,
1020. When the blood creeps, and the nerves prick
1021. And tingle; and the heart is sick,
1022. And all the wheels of Being slow.
1023. Be near me when the sensuous frame
1024. Is rack’d with pangs that conquer trust;
1025. And Time, a maniac scattering dust,
1026. And Life, a Fury slinging flame.

1027. Be near me when my faith is dry,
1028. And men the flies of latter spring,
1029. That lay their eggs, and sting and sing
1030. And weave their petty cells and die.

1031. Be near me when I fade away,
1032. To point the term of human strife,
1033. And on the low dark verge of life
1034. The twilight of eternal day.



1035. LI.

1036. Do we indeed desire the dead
1037. Should still be near us at our side?
1038. Is there no baseness we would hide?
1039. No inner vileness that we dread?
1040. Shall he for whose applause I strove,
1041. I had such reverence for his blame,
1042. See with clear eye some hidden shame
1043. And I be lessen’d in his love?

1044. I wrong the grave with fears untrue:
1045. Shall love be blamed for want of faith?
1046. There must be wisdom with great Death:
1047. The dead shall look me thro’ and thro’.

1048. Be near us when we climb or fall:
1049. Ye watch, like God, the rolling hours
1050. With larger other eyes than ours,
1051. To make allowance for us all.



1052. LII.

1053. I cannot love thee as I ought,
1054. For love reflects the thing beloved;
1055. My words are only words, and moved
1056. Upon the topmost froth of thought.
1057. ‘Yet blame not thou thy plaintive song,’
1058. The Spirit of true love replied;
1059. ‘Thou canst not move me from thy side,
1060. Nor human frailty do me wrong.

1061. ‘What keeps a spirit wholly true
1062. To that ideal which he bears?
1063. What record? not the sinless years
1064. That breathed beneath the Syrian blue:

1065. ‘So fret not, like an idle girl,
1066. That life is dash’d with flecks of sin.
1067. Abide: thy wealth is gather’d in,
1068. When Time hath sunder’d shell from pearl.’



1069. LIII.

1070. How many a father have I seen,
1071. A sober man, among his boys,
1072. Whose youth was full of foolish noise,
1073. Who wears his manhood hale and green:
1074. And dare we to this fancy give,
1075. That had the wild oat not been sown,
1076. The soil, left barren, scarce had grown
1077. The grain by which a man may live?

1078. Or, if we held the doctrine sound
1079. For life outliving heats of youth,
1080. Yet who would preach it as a truth
1081. To those that eddy round and round?

1082. Hold thou the good: define it well:
1083. For fear divine Philosophy
1084. Should push beyond her mark, and be
1085. Procuress to the Lords of Hell.



1086. LIV.

1087. Oh yet we trust that somehow good
1088. Will be the final goal of ill,
1089. To pangs of nature, sins of will,
1090. Defects of doubt, and taints of blood;
1091. That nothing walks with aimless feet;
1092. That not one life shall be destroy’d,
1093. Or cast as rubbish to the void,
1094. When God hath made the pile complete;

1095. That not a worm is cloven in vain;
1096. That not a moth with vain desire
1097. Is shrivell’d in a fruitless fire,
1098. Or but subserves another’s gain.

1099. Behold, we know not anything;
1100. I can but trust that good shall fall
1101. At last–far off–at last, to all,
1102. And every winter change to spring.

1103. So runs my dream: but what am I?
1104. An infant crying in the night:
1105. An infant crying for the light:
1106. And with no language but a cry.



1107. LV.

1108. The wish, that of the living whole
1109. No life may fail beyond the grave,
1110. Derives it not from what we have
1111. The likest God within the soul?
1112. Are God and Nature then at strife,
1113. That Nature lends such evil dreams?
1114. So careful of the type she seems,
1115. So careless of the single life;

1116. That I, considering everywhere
1117. Her secret meaning in her deeds,
1118. And finding that of fifty seeds
1119. She often brings but one to bear,

1120. I falter where I firmly trod,
1121. And falling with my weight of cares
1122. Upon the great world’s altar-stairs
1123. That slope thro’ darkness up to God,

1124. I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,
1125. And gather dust and chaff, and call
1126. To what I feel is Lord of all,
1127. And faintly trust the larger hope.



1128. LVI.

1129. ‘So careful of the type?’ but no.
1130. From scarped cliff and quarried stone
1131. She cries, ‘A thousand types are gone:
1132. I care for nothing, all shall go.
1133. ‘Thou makest thine appeal to me:
1134. I bring to life, I bring to death:
1135. The spirit does but mean the breath:
1136. I know no more.’ And he, shall he,

1137. Man, her last work, who seem’d so fair,
1138. Such splendid purpose in his eyes,
1139. Who roll’d the psalm to wintry skies,
1140. Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,

1141. Who trusted God was love indeed
1142. And love Creation’s final law–
1143. Tho’ Nature, red in tooth and claw
1144. With ravine, shriek’d against his creed–

1145. Who loved, who suffer’d countless ills,
1146. Who battled for the True, the Just,
1147. Be blown about the desert dust,
1148. Or seal’d within the iron hills?

1149. No more? A monster then, a dream,
1150. A discord. Dragons of the prime,
1151. That tare each other in their slime,
1152. Were mellow music match’d with him.

1153. O life as futile, then, as frail!
1154. O for thy voice to soothe and bless!
1155. What hope of answer, or redress?
1156. Behind the veil, behind the veil.



1157. LVII.

1158. Peace; come away: the song of woe
1159. Is after all an earthly song:
1160. Peace; come away: we do him wrong
1161. To sing so wildly: let us go.
1162. Come; let us go: your cheeks are pale;
1163. But half my life I leave behind:
1164. Methinks my friend is richly shrined;
1165. But I shall pass; my work will fail.

1166. Yet in these ears, till hearing dies,
1167. One set slow bell will seem to toll
1168. The passing of the sweetest soul
1169. That ever look’d with human eyes.

1170. I hear it now, and o’er and o’er,
1171. Eternal greetings to the dead;
1172. And ‘Ave, Ave, Ave,’ said,
1173. ‘Adieu, adieu’ for evermore.



1174. LVIII.

1175. In those sad words I took farewell:
1176. Like echoes in sepulchral halls,
1177. As drop by drop the water falls
1178. In vaults and catacombs, they fell;
1179. And, falling, idly broke the peace
1180. Of hearts that beat from day to day,
1181. Half-conscious of their dying clay,
1182. And those cold crypts where they shall cease.

1183. The high Muse answer’d: ‘Wherefore grieve
1184. Thy brethren with a fruitless tear?
1185. Abide a little longer here,
1186. And thou shalt take a nobler leave.’



1187. LIX.

1188. O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me
1189. No casual mistress, but a wife,
1190. My bosom-friend and half of life;
1191. As I confess it needs must be;
1192. O Sorrow, wilt thou rule my blood,
1193. Be sometimes lovely like a bride,
1194. And put thy harsher moods aside,
1195. If thou wilt have me wise and good.

1196. My centred passion cannot move,
1197. Nor will it lessen from to-day;
1198. But I’ll have leave at times to play
1199. As with the creature of my love;

1200. And set thee forth, for thou art mine,
1201. With so much hope for years to come,
1202. That, howsoe’er I know thee, some
1203. Could hardly tell what name were thine.



1204. LX.

1205. He past; a soul of nobler tone:
1206. My spirit loved and loves him yet,
1207. Like some poor girl whose heart is set
1208. On one whose rank exceeds her own.
1209. He mixing with his proper sphere,
1210. She finds the baseness of her lot,
1211. Half jealous of she knows not what,
1212. And envying all that meet him there.

1213. The little village looks forlorn;
1214. She sighs amid her narrow days,
1215. Moving about the household ways,
1216. In that dark house where she was born.

1217. The foolish neighbours come and go,
1218. And tease her till the day draws by:
1219. At night she weeps, ‘How vain am I!
1220. How should he love a thing so low?’



1221. LXI.

1222. If, in thy second state sublime,
1223. Thy ransom’d reason change replies
1224. With all the circle of the wise,
1225. The perfect flower of human time;
1226. And if thou cast thine eyes below,
1227. How dimly character’d and slight,
1228. How dwarf’d a growth of cold and night,
1229. How blanch'd with darkness must I grow!

1230. Yet turn thee to the doubtful shore,
1231. Where thy first form was made a man:
1232. I loved thee, Spirit, and love, nor can
1233. The soul of Shakespeare love thee more.



1234. LXII.

1235. Tho’ if an eye that’s downward cast
1236. Could make thee somewhat blench or fail,
1237. Then be my love an idle tale,
1238. And fading legend of the past;
1239. And thou, as one that once declined,
1240. When he was little more than boy,
1241. On some unworthy heart with joy,
1242. But lives to wed an equal mind;

1243. And breathes a novel world, the while
1244. His other passion wholly dies,
1245. Or in the light of deeper eyes
1246. Is matter for a flying smile.



1247. LXIII.

1248. Yet pity for a horse o’er-driven,
1249. And love in which my hound has part,
1250. Can hang no weight upon my heart
1251. In its assumptions up to heaven;
1252. And I am so much more than these,
1253. As thou, perchance, art more than I,
1254. And yet I spare them sympathy,
1255. And I would set their pains at ease.

1256. So mayst thou watch me where I weep,
1257. As, unto vaster motions bound,
1258. The circuits of thine orbit round
1259. A higher height, a deeper deep.



1260. LXIV.

1261. Dost thou look back on what hath been,
1262. As some divinely gifted man,
1263. Whose life in low estate began
1264. And on a simple village green;
1265. Who breaks his birth’s invidious bar,
1266. And grasps the skirts of happy chance,
1267. And breasts the blows of circumstance,
1268. And grapples with his evil star;

1269. Who makes by force his merit known
1270. And lives to clutch the golden keys,
1271. To mould a mighty state’s decrees,
1272. And shape the whisper of the throne;

1273. And moving up from high to higher,
1274. Becomes on Fortune’s crowning slope
1275. The pillar of a people’s hope,
1276. The centre of a world’s desire;

1277. Yet feels, as in a pensive dream,
1278. When all his active powers are still,
1279. A distant dearness in the hill,
1280. A secret sweetness in the stream,

1281. The limit of his narrower fate,
1282. While yet beside its vocal springs
1283. He play’d at counsellors and kings,
1284. With one that was his earliest mate;

1285. Who ploughs with pain his native lea
1286. And reaps the labour of his hands,
1287. Or in the furrow musing stands;
1288. ‘Does my old friend remember me?’



1289. LXV.

1290. Sweet soul, do with me as thou wilt;
1291. I lull a fancy trouble-tost
1292. With ‘Love’s too precious to be lost,
1293. A little grain shall not be spilt.’
1294. And in that solace can I sing,
1295. Till out of painful phases wrought
1296. There flutters up a happy thought,
1297. Self-balanced on a lightsome wing:

1298. Since we deserved the name of friends,
1299. And thine effect so lives in me,
1300. A part of mine may live in thee
1301. And move thee on to noble ends.



1302. LXVI.

1303. You thought my heart too far diseased;
1304. You wonder when my fancies play
1305. To find me gay among the gay,
1306. Like one with any trifle pleased.
1307. The shade by which my life was crost,
1308. Which makes a desert in the mind,
1309. Has made me kindly with my kind,
1310. And like to him whose sight is lost;

1311. Whose feet are guided thro’ the land,
1312. Whose jest among his friends is free,
1313. Who takes the children on his knee,
1314. And winds their curls about his hand:

1315. He plays with threads, he beats his chair
1316. For pastime, dreaming of the sky;
1317. His inner day can never die,
1318. His night of loss is always there.



1319. LXVII.

1320. When on my bed the moonlight falls,
1321. I know that in thy place of rest
1322. By that broad water of the west,
1323. There comes a glory on the walls:
1324. Thy marble bright in dark appears,
1325. As slowly steals a silver flame
1326. Along the letters of thy name,
1327. And o’er the number of thy years.

1328. The mystic glory swims away;
1329. From off my bed the moonlight dies;
1330. And closing eaves of wearied eyes
1331. I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray:

1332. And then I know the mist is drawn
1333. A lucid veil from coast to coast,
1334. And in the dark church like a ghost
1335. Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn.



1336. LXVIII.

1337. When in the down I sink my head,
1338. Sleep, Death’s twin-brother, times my breath;
1339. Sleep, Death’s twin-brother, knows not Death,
1340. Nor can I dream of thee as dead:
1341. I walk as ere I walk’d forlorn,
1342. When all our path was fresh with dew,
1343. And all the bugle breezes blew
1344. Reveillée to the breaking morn.

1345. But what is this? I turn about,
1346. I find a trouble in thine eye,
1347. Which makes me sad I know not why,
1348. Nor can my dream resolve the doubt:

1349. But ere the lark hath left the lea
1350. I wake, and I discern the truth;
1351. It is the trouble of my youth
1352. That foolish sleep transfers to thee.



1353. LXIX.

1354. I dream’d there would be Spring no more,
1355. That Nature’s ancient power was lost:
1356. The streets were black with smoke and frost,
1357. They chatter’d trifles at the door:
1358. I wander’d from the noisy town,
1359. I found a wood with thorny boughs:
1360. I took the thorns to bind my brows,
1361. I wore them like a civic crown:

1362. I met with scoffs, I met with scorns
1363. From youth and babe and hoary hairs:
1364. They call’d me in the public squares
1365. The fool that wears a crown of thorns:

1366. They call’d me fool, they call’d me child:
1367. I found an angel of the night;
1368. The voice was low, the look was bright;
1369. He look’d upon my crown and smiled:

1370. He reach’d the glory of a hand,
1371. That seem’d to touch it into leaf:
1372. The voice was not the voice of grief,
1373. The words were hard to understand.



1374. LXX.

1375. I cannot see the features right,
1376. When on the gloom I strive to paint
1377. The face I know; the hues are faint
1378. And mix with hollow masks of night;
1379. Cloud-towers by ghostly masons wrought,
1380. A gulf that ever shuts and gapes,
1381. A hand that points, and palled shapes
1382. In shadowy thoroughfares of thought;

1383. And crowds that stream from yawning doors,
1384. And shoals of pucker’d faces drive;
1385. Dark bulks that tumble half alive,
1386. And lazy lengths on boundless shores;

1387. Till all at once beyond the will
1388. I hear a wizard music roll,
1389. And thro’ a lattice on the soul
1390. Looks thy fair face and makes it still.



1391. LXXI.

1392. Sleep, kinsman thou to death and trance
1393. And madness, thou hast forged at last
1394. A night-long Present of the Past
1395. In which we went thro’ summer France.
1396. Hadst thou such credit with the soul?
1397. Then bring an opiate trebly strong,
1398. Drug down the blindfold sense of wrong
1399. That so my pleasure may be whole;

1400. While now we talk as once we talk’d
1401. Of men and minds, the dust of change,
1402. The days that grow to something strange,
1403. In walking as of old we walk’d

1404. Beside the river’s wooded reach,
1405. The fortress, and the mountain ridge,
1406. The cataract flashing from the bridge,
1407. The breaker breaking on the beach.



1408. LXXII.

1409. Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,
1410. And howlest, issuing out of night,
1411. With blasts that blow the poplar white,
1412. And lash with storm the streaming pane?
1413. Day, when my crown’d estate begun
1414. To pine in that reverse of doom,
1415. Which sicken’d every living bloom,
1416. And blurr’d the splendour of the sun;

1417. Who usherest in the dolorous hour
1418. With thy quick tears that make the rose
1419. Pull sideways, and the daisy close
1420. Her crimson fringes to the shower;

1421. Who might’st have heaved a windless flame
1422. Up the deep East, or, whispering, play’d
1423. A chequer-work of beam and shade
1424. Along the hills, yet look’d the same.

1425. As wan, as chill, as wild as now;
1426. Day, mark’d as with some hideous crime,
1427. When the dark hand struck down thro’ time,
1428. And cancell’d nature’s best: but thou,

1429. Lift as thou may’st thy burthen’d brows
1430. Thro’ clouds that drench the morning star,
1431. And whirl the ungarner’d sheaf afar,
1432. And sow the sky with flying boughs,

1433. And up thy vault with roaring sound
1434. Climb thy thick noon, disastrous day;
1435. Touch thy dull goal of joyless gray,
1436. And hide thy shame beneath the ground.



1437. LXXIII.

1438. So many worlds, so much to do,
1439. So little done, such things to be,
1440. How know I what had need of thee,
1441. For thou wert strong as thou wert true?
1442. The fame is quench’d that I foresaw,
1443. The head hath miss’d an earthly wreath:
1444. I curse not nature, no, nor death;
1445. For nothing is that errs from law.

1446. We pass; the path that each man trod
1447. Is dim, or will be dim, with weeds:
1448. What fame is left for human deeds
1449. In endless age? It rests with God.

1450. O hollow wraith of dying fame,
1451. Fade wholly, while the soul exults,
1452. And self-infolds the large results
1453. Of force that would have forged a name.



1454. LXXIV.

1455. As sometimes in a dead man’s face,
1456. To those that watch it more and more,
1457. A likeness, hardly seen before,
1458. Comes out–to some one of his race:
1459. So, dearest, now thy brows are cold,
1460. I see thee what thou art, and know
1461. Thy likeness to the wise below,
1462. Thy kindred with the great of old.

1463. But there is more than I can see,
1464. And what I see I leave unsaid,
1465. Nor speak it, knowing Death has made
1466. His darkness beautiful with thee.



1467. LXXV.

1468. I leave thy praises unexpress’d
1469. In verse that brings myself relief,
1470. And by the measure of my grief
1471. I leave thy greatness to be guess’d;
1472. What practice howsoe’er expert
1473. In fitting aptest words to things,
1474. Or voice the richest-toned that sings,
1475. Hath power to give thee as thou wert?

1476. I care not in these fading days
1477. To raise a cry that lasts not long,
1478. And round thee with the breeze of song
1479. To stir a little dust of praise.

1480. Thy leaf has perish’d in the green,
1481. And, while we breathe beneath the sun,
1482. The world which credits what is done
1483. Is cold to all that might have been.

1484. So here shall silence guard thy fame;
1485. But somewhere, out of human view,
1486. Whate’er thy hands are set to do
1487. Is wrought with tumult of acclaim.



1488. LXXVI.

1489. Take wings of fancy, and ascend,
1490. And in a moment set thy face
1491. Where all the starry heavens of space
1492. Are sharpen’d to a needle’s end;
1493. Take wings of foresight; lighten thro’
1494. The secular abyss to come,
1495. And lo, thy deepest lays are dumb
1496. Before the mouldering of a yew;

1497. And if the matin songs, that woke
1498. The darkness of our planet, last,
1499. Thine own shall wither in the vast,
1500. Ere half the lifetime of an oak.

1501. Ere these have clothed their branchy bowers
1502. With fifty Mays, thy songs are vain;
1503. And what are they when these remain
1504. The ruin’d shells of hollow towers?



1505. LXXVII.

1506. What hope is here for modern rhyme
1507. To him, who turns a musing eye
1508. On songs, and deeds, and lives, that lie
1509. Foreshorten’d in the tract of time?
1510. These mortal lullabies of pain
1511. May bind a book, may line a box,
1512. May serve to curl a maiden’s locks;
1513. Or when a thousand moons shall wane

1514. A man upon a stall may find,
1515. And, passing, turn the page that tells
1516. A grief, then changed to something else,
1517. Sung by a long-forgotten mind.

1518. But what of that? My darken’d ways
1519. Shall ring with music all the same;
1520. To breathe my loss is more than fame,
1521. To utter love more sweet than praise.



1522. LXXVIII.

1523. Again at Christmas did we weave
1524. The holly round the Christmas hearth;
1525. The silent snow possess’d the earth,
1526. And calmly fell our Christmas-eve:
1527. The yule-clog sparkled keen with frost,
1528. No wing of wind the region swept,
1529. But over all things brooding slept
1530. The quiet sense of something lost.

1531. As in the winters left behind,
1532. Again our ancient games had place,
1533. The mimic picture’s breathing grace,
1534. And dance and song and hoodman-blind.

1535. Who show’d a token of distress?
1536. No single tear, no mark of pain:
1537. O sorrow, then can sorrow wane?
1538. O grief, can grief be changed to less?

1539. O last regret, regret can die!
1540. No–mixt with all this mystic frame,
1541. Her deep relations are the same,
1542. But with long use her tears are dry.



1543. LXXIX.

1544. ‘More than my brothers are to me,’–
1545. Let this not vex thee, noble heart!
1546. I know thee of what force thou art
1547. To hold the costliest love in fee.
1548. But thou and I are one in kind,
1549. As moulded like in Nature’s mint;
1550. And hill and wood and field did print
1551. The same sweet forms in either mind.

1552. For us the same cold streamlet curl’d
1553. Thro’ all his eddying coves; the same
1554. All winds that roam the twilight came
1555. In whispers of the beauteous world.

1556. At one dear knee we proffer’d vows,
1557. One lesson from one book we learn’d,
1558. Ere childhood’s flaxen ringlet turn’d
1559. To black and brown on kindred brows.

1560. And so my wealth resembles thine,
1561. But he was rich where I was poor,
1562. And he supplied my want the more
1563. As his unlikeness fitted mine.



1564. LXXX.

1565. If any vague desire should rise,
1566. That holy Death ere Arthur died
1567. Had moved me kindly from his side,
1568. And dropt the dust on tearless eyes;
1569. Then fancy shapes, as fancy can,
1570. The grief my loss in him had wrought,
1571. A grief as deep as life or thought,
1572. But stay’d in peace with God and man.

1573. I make a picture in the brain;
1574. I hear the sentence that he speaks;
1575. He bears the burthen of the weeks
1576. But turns his burthen into gain.

1577. His credit thus shall set me free;
1578. And, influence-rich to soothe and save,
1579. Unused example from the grave
1580. Reach out dead hands to comfort me.



1581. LXXXI.

1582. Could I have said while he was here,
1583. ‘My love shall now no further range;
1584. There cannot come a mellower change,
1585. For now is love mature in ear.’
1586. Love, then, had hope of richer store:
1587. What end is here to my complaint?
1588. This haunting whisper makes me faint,
1589. ‘More years had made me love thee more.’

1590. But Death returns an answer sweet:
1591. ‘My sudden frost was sudden gain,
1592. And gave all ripeness to the grain,
1593. It might have drawn from after-heat.’



1594. LXXXII.

1595. I wage not any feud with Death
1596. For changes wrought on form and face;
1597. No lower life that earth’s embrace
1598. May breed with him, can fright my faith.
1599. Eternal process moving on,
1600. From state to state the spirit walks;
1601. And these are but the shatter’d stalks,
1602. Or ruin’d chrysalis of one.

1603. Nor blame I Death, because he bare
1604. The use of virtue out of earth:
1605. I know transplanted human worth
1606. Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.

1607. For this alone on Death I wreak
1608. The wrath that garners in my heart;
1609. He put our lives so far apart
1610. We cannot hear each other speak.



1611. LXXXIII.

1612. Dip down upon the northern shore,
1613. O sweet new-year delaying long;
1614. Thou doest expectant nature wrong;
1615. Delaying long, delay no more.
1616. What stays thee from the clouded noons,
1617. Thy sweetness from its proper place?
1618. Can trouble live with April days,
1619. Or sadness in the summer moons?

1620. Bring orchis, bring the foxglove spire,
1621. The little speedwell’s darling blue,
1622. Deep tulips dash’d with fiery dew,
1623. Laburnums, dropping-wells of fire.

1624. O thou, new-year, delaying long,
1625. Delayest the sorrow in my blood,
1626. That longs to burst a frozen bud
1627. And flood a fresher throat with song.



1628. LXXXIV.

1629. When I contemplate all alone
1630. The life that had been thine below,
1631. And fix my thoughts on all the glow
1632. To which thy crescent would have grown;
1633. I see thee sitting crown’d with good,
1634. A central warmth diffusing bliss
1635. In glance and smile, and clasp and kiss,
1636. On all the branches of thy blood;

1637. Thy blood, my friend, and partly mine;
1638. For now the day was drawing on,
1639. When thou should’st link thy life with one
1640. Of mine own house, and boys of thine

1641. Had babbled ‘Uncle’ on my knee;
1642. But that remorseless iron hour
1643. Made cypress of her orange flower,
1644. Despair of Hope, and earth of thee.

1645. I seem to meet their least desire,
1646. To clap their cheeks, to call them mine.
1647. I see their unborn faces shine
1648. Beside the never-lighted fire.

1649. I see myself an honour’d guest,
1650. Thy partner in the flowery walk
1651. Of letters, genial table-talk,
1652. Or deep dispute, and graceful jest;

1653. While now thy prosperous labour fills
1654. The lips of men with honest praise,
1655. And sun by sun the happy days
1656. Descend below the golden hills

1657. With promise of a morn as fair;
1658. And all the train of bounteous hours
1659. Conduct by paths of growing powers,
1660. To reverence and the silver hair;

1661. Till slowly worn her earthly robe,
1662. Her lavish mission richly wrought,
1663. Leaving great legacies of thought,
1664. Thy spirit should fail from off the globe;

1665. What time mine own might also flee,
1666. As link’d with thine in love and fate,
1667. And, hovering o’er the dolorous strait
1668. To the other shore, involved in thee,

1669. Arrive at last the blessed goal,
1670. And He that died in Holy Land
1671. Would reach us out the shining hand,
1672. And take us as a single soul.

1673. What reed was that on which I leant?
1674. Ah, backward fancy, wherefore wake
1675. The old bitterness again, and break
1676. The low beginnings of content.



1677. LXXXV.

1678. This truth came borne with bier and pall,
1679. I felt it, when I sorrow’d most,
1680. ’Tis better to have loved and lost,
1681. Than never to have loved at all–
1682. O true in word, and tried in deed,
1683. Demanding, so to bring relief
1684. To this which is our common grief,
1685. What kind of life is that I lead;

1686. And whether trust in things above
1687. Be dimm’d of sorrow, or sustain’d;
1688. And whether love for him have drain’d
1689. My capabilities of love;

1690. Your words have virtue such as draws
1691. A faithful answer from the breast,
1692. Thro’ light reproaches, half exprest,
1693. And loyal unto kindly laws.

1694. My blood an even tenor kept,
1695. Till on mine ear this message falls,
1696. That in Vienna’s fatal walls
1697. God’s finger touch’d him, and he slept.

1698. The great Intelligences fair
1699. That range above our mortal state,
1700. In circle round the blessed gate,
1701. Received and gave him welcome there;

1702. And led him thro’ the blissful climes,
1703. And show'd him in the fountain fresh
1704. All knowledge that the sons of flesh
1705. Shall gather in the cycled times.

1706. But I remained, whose hopes were dim,
1707. Whose life, whose thoughts were little worth,
1708. To wander on a darkened earth,
1709. Where all things round me breathed of him.

1710. O friendship, equal poised control,
1711. O heart, with kindliest motion warm,
1712. O sacred essence, other form,
1713. O solemn ghost, O crowned soul!

1714. Yet none could better know than I,
1715. How much of act at human hands
1716. The sense of human will demands
1717. By which we dare to live or die.

1718. Whatever way my days decline,
1719. I felt and feel, tho’ left alone,
1720. His being working in mine own,
1721. The footsteps of his life in mine;

1722. A life that all the Muses decked
1723. With gifts of grace, that might express
1724. All comprehensive tenderness,
1725. All-subtilising intellect:

1726. And so my passion hath not swerved
1727. To works of weakness, but I find
1728. An image comforting the mind,
1729. And in my grief a strength reserved.

1730. Likewise the imaginative woe,
1731. That loved to handle spiritual strife,
1732. Diffused the shock thro’ all my life,
1733. But in the present broke the blow.

1734. My pulses therefore beat again
1735. For other friends that once I met;
1736. Nor can it suit me to forget
1737. The mighty hopes that make us men.

1738. I woo your love: I count it crime
1739. To mourn for any overmuch;
1740. I, the divided half of such
1741. A friendship as had master’d Time;

1742. Which masters Time indeed, and is
1743. Eternal, separate from fears:
1744. The all-assuming months and years
1745. Can take no part away from this:

1746. But Summer on the steaming floods,
1747. And Spring that swells the narrow brooks,
1748. And Autumn, with a noise of rooks,
1749. That gather in the waning woods,

1750. And every pulse of wind and wave
1751. Recalls, in change of light or gloom,
1752. My old affection of the tomb,
1753. And my prime passion in the grave:

1754. My old affection of the tomb,
1755. A part of stillness, yearns to speak:
1756. ‘Arise, and get thee forth and seek
1757. A friendship for the years to come.

1758. ‘I watch thee from the quiet shore;
1759. Thy spirit up to mine can reach;
1760. But in dear words of human speech
1761. We two communicate no more.’

1762. And I, ‘Can clouds of nature stain
1763. The starry clearness of the free?
1764. How is it? Canst thou feel for me
1765. Some painless sympathy with pain?’

1766. And lightly does the whisper fall;
1767. ‘’Tis hard for thee to fathom this;
1768. I triumph in conclusive bliss,
1769. And that serene result of all.’

1770. So hold I commerce with the dead;
1771. Or so methinks the dead would say;
1772. Or so shall grief with symbols play
1773. And pining life be fancy-fed.

1774. Now looking to some settled end,
1775. That these things pass, and I shall prove
1776. A meeting somewhere, love with love,
1777. I crave your pardon, O my friend;

1778. If not so fresh, with love as true,
1779. I, clasping brother-hands aver
1780. I could not, if I would, transfer
1781. The whole I felt for him to you.

1782. For which be they that hold apart
1783. The promise of the golden hours?
1784. First love, first friendship, equal powers,
1785. That marry with the virgin heart.

1786. Still mine, that cannot but deplore,
1787. That beats within a lonely place,
1788. That yet remembers his embrace,
1789. But at his footstep leaps no more,

1790. My heart, tho’ widow’d, may not rest
1791. Quite in the love of what is gone,
1792. But seeks to beat in time with one
1793. That warms another living breast.

1794. Ah, take the imperfect gift I bring,
1795. Knowing the primrose yet is dear,
1796. The primrose of the later year,
1797. As not unlike to that of Spring.



1798. LXXXVI.

1799. Sweet after showers, ambrosial air,
1800. That rollest from the gorgeous gloom
1801. Of evening over brake and bloom
1802. And meadow, slowly breathing bare
1803. The round of space, and rapt below
1804. Thro’ all the dewy-tassell’d wood,
1805. And shadowing down the horned flood
1806. In ripples, fan my brows and blow

1807. The fever from my cheek, and sigh
1808. The full new life that feeds thy breath
1809. Throughout my frame, till Doubt and Death,
1810. Ill brethren, let the fancy fly

1811. From belt to belt of crimson seas
1812. On leagues of odour streaming far,
1813. To where in yonder orient star
1814. A hundred spirits whisper ‘Peace.’



1815. LXXXVII.

1816. I past beside the reverend walls
1817. In which of old I wore the gown;
1818. I roved at random thro’ the town,
1819. And saw the tumult of the halls;
1820. And heard one more in college fanes
1821. The storm their high-built organs make,
1822. And thunder-music, rolling, shake
1823. The prophet blazon’d on the panes;

1824. And caught one more the distant shout,
1825. The measured pulse of racing oars
1826. Among the willows; paced the shores
1827. And many a bridge, and all about

1828. The same gray flats again, and felt
1829. The same, but not the same; and last
1830. Up that long walk of limes I past
1831. To see the rooms in which he dwelt.

1832. Another name was on the door:
1833. I linger’d; all within was noise
1834. Of songs, and clapping hands, and boys
1835. That crash’d the glass and beat the floor;

1836. Where once we held debate, a band
1837. Of youthful friends, on mind and art,
1838. And labour, and the changing mart,
1839. And all the framework of the land;

1840. When one would aim an arrow fair,
1841. But send it slackly from the string;
1842. And one would pierce an outer ring,
1843. And one an inner, here and there;

1844. And last the master-bowman, he,
1845. Would cleave the mark. A willing ear
1846. We lent him. Who, but hung to hear
1847. The rapt oration flowing free

1848. From point to point, with power and grace
1849. And music in the bounds of law,
1850. To those conclusions when we saw
1851. The God within him light his face,

1852. And seem to lift the form, and glow
1853. In azure orbits heavenly wise;
1854. And over those ethereal eyes
1855. The bar of Michael Angelo.



1856. LXXXVIII.

1857. Wild bird, whose warble, liquid sweet,
1858. Rings Eden thro’ the budded quicks,
1859. O tell me where the senses mix,
1860. O tell me where the passions meet,
1861. Whence radiate: fierce extremes employ
1862. Thy spirits in the darkening leaf,
1863. And in the midmost heart of grief
1864. Thy passion clasps a secret joy:

1865. And I–my harp would prelude woe–
1866. I cannot all command the strings;
1867. The glory of the sum of things
1868. Will flash along the chords and go.



1869. LXXXIX.

1870. Witch-elms that counterchange the floor
1871. Of this flat lawn with dusk and bright;
1872. And thou, with all thy breadth and height
1873. Of foliage, towering sycamore;
1874. How often, hither wandering down,
1875. My Arthur found your shadows fair,
1876. And shook to all the liberal air
1877. The dust and din and steam of town:

1878. He brought an eye for all he saw;
1879. He mixt in all our simple sports;
1880. They pleased him, fresh from brawling courts
1881. And dusty purlieus of the law.

1882. O joy to him in this retreat,
1883. Immantled in ambrosial dark,
1884. To drink the cooler air, and mark
1885. The landscape winking thro’ the heat:

1886. O sound to rout the brood of cares,
1887. The sweep of scythe in morning dew,
1888. The gust that round the garden flew,
1889. And tumbled half the mellowing pears!

1890. O bliss, when all in circle drawn
1891. About him, heart and ear were fed
1892. To hear him, as he lay and read
1893. The Tuscan poets on the lawn:

1894. Or in the all-golden afternoon
1895. A guest, or happy sister, sung,
1896. Or here she brought the harp and flung
1897. A ballad to the brightening moon:

1898. Nor less it pleased in livelier moods,
1899. Beyond the bounding hill to stray,
1900. And break the livelong summer day
1901. With banquet in the distant woods;

1902. Whereat we glanced from theme to theme,
1903. Discuss’d the books to love or hate,
1904. Or touch’d the changes of the state,
1905. Or threaded some Socratic dream;

1906. But if I praised the busy town,
1907. He loved to rail against it still,
1908. For ‘ground in yonder social mill
1909. We rub each other’s angles down,

1910. ‘And merge’ he said ‘in form and gloss
1911. The picturesque of man and man.’
1912. We talk’d: the stream beneath us ran,
1913. The wine-flask lying couch’d in moss,

1914. Or cool’d within the glooming wave;
1915. And last, returning from afar,
1916. Before the crimson-circled star
1917. Had fall’n into her father’s grave,

1918. And brushing ankle-deep in flowers,
1919. We heard behind the woodbine veil
1920. The milk that bubbled in the pail,
1921. And buzzings of the honied hours.



1922. XC.

1923. He tasted love with half his mind,
1924. Nor ever drank the inviolate spring
1925. Where nighest heaven, who first could fling
1926. This bitter seed among mankind;
1927. That could the dead, whose dying eyes
1928. Were closed with wail, resume their life,
1929. They would but find in child and wife
1930. An iron welcome when they rise:

1931. ’Twas well, indeed, when warm with wine,
1932. To pledge them with a kindly tear,
1933. To talk them o’er, to wish them here,
1934. To count their memories half divine;

1935. But if they came who past away,
1936. Behold their brides in other hands;
1937. The hard heir strides about their lands,
1938. And will not yield them for a day.

1939. Yea, tho’ their sons were none of these,
1940. Not less the yet-loved sire would make
1941. Confusion worse than death, and shake
1942. The pillars of domestic peace.

1943. Ah dear, but come thou back to me:
1944. Whatever change the years have wrought,
1945. I find not yet one lonely thought
1946. That cries against my wish for thee.



1947. XCI.

1948. When rosy plumelets tuft the larch,
1949. And rarely pipes the mounted thrush;
1950. Or underneath the barren bush
1951. Flits by the sea-blue bird of March;
1952. Come, wear the form by which I know
1953. Thy spirit in time among thy peers;
1954. The hope of unaccomplish’d years
1955. Be large and lucid round thy brow.

1956. When summer’s hourly-mellowing change
1957. May breathe, with many roses sweet,
1958. Upon the thousand waves of wheat,
1959. That ripple round the lonely grange;

1960. Come: not in watches of the night,
1961. But where the sunbeam broodeth warm,
1962. Come, beauteous in thine after form,
1963. And like a finer light in light.



1964. XCII.

1965. If any vision should reveal
1966. Thy likeness, I might count it vain
1967. As but the canker of the brain;
1968. Yea, tho’ it spake and made appeal
1969. To chances where our lots were cast
1970. Together in the days behind,
1971. I might but say, I hear a wind
1972. Of memory murmuring the past.

1973. Yea, tho’ it spake and bared to view
1974. A fact within the coming year;
1975. And tho’ the months, revolving near,
1976. Should prove the phantom-warning true,

1977. They might not seem thy prophecies,
1978. But spiritual presentiments,
1979. And such refraction of events
1980. As often rises ere they rise.



1981. XCIII.

1982. I shall not see thee. Dare I say
1983. No spirit ever brake the band
1984. That stays him from the native land
1985. Where first he walk’d when claspt in clay?
1986. No visual shade of some one lost,
1987. But he, the Spirit himself, may come
1988. Where all the nerve of sense is numb;
1989. Spirit to Spirit, Ghost to Ghost.

1990. O, therefore from thy sightless range
1991. With gods in unconjectured bliss,
1992. O, from the distance of the abyss
1993. Of tenfold-complicated change,

1994. Descend, and touch, and enter; hear
1995. The wish too strong for words to name;
1996. That in this blindness of the frame
1997. My Ghost may feel that thine is near.



1998. XCIV.

1999. How pure at heart and sound in head,
2000. With what divine affections bold
2001. Should be the man whose thought would hold
2002. An hour’s communion with the dead.
2003. In vain shalt thou, or any, call
2004. The spirits from their golden day,
2005. Except, like them, thou too canst say,
2006. My spirit is at peace with all.

2007. They haunt the silence of the breast,
2008. Imaginations calm and fair,
2009. The memory like a cloudless air,
2010. The conscience as a sea at rest:

2011. But when the heart is full of din,
2012. And doubt beside the portal waits,
2013. They can but listen at the gates,
2014. And hear the household jar within.



2015. XCV.

2016. By night we linger’d on the lawn,
2017. For underfoot the herb was dry;
2018. And genial warmth; and o’er the sky
2019. The silvery haze of summer drawn;
2020. And calm that let the tapers burn
2021. Unwavering: not a cricket chirr’d:
2022. The brook alone far-off was heard,
2023. And on the board the fluttering urn:

2024. And bats went round in fragrant skies,
2025. And wheel’d or lit the filmy shapes
2026. That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes
2027. And woolly breasts and beaded eyes;

2028. While now we sang old songs that peal’d
2029. From knoll to knoll, where, couch’d at ease,
2030. The white kine glimmer’d, and the trees
2031. Laid their dark arms about the field.

2032. But when those others, one by one,
2033. Withdrew themselves from me and night,
2034. And in the house light after light
2035. Went out, and I was all alone,

2036. A hunger seized my heart; I read
2037. Of that glad year which once had been,
2038. In those fall’n leaves which kept their green,
2039. The noble letters of the dead:

2040. And strangely on the silence broke
2041. The silent-speaking words, and strange
2042. Was love’s dumb cry defying change
2043. To test his worth; and strangely spoke

2044. The faith, the vigour, bold to dwell
2045. On doubts that drive the coward back,
2046. And keen thro’ wordy snares to track
2047. Suggestion to her inmost cell.

2048. So word by word, and line by line,
2049. The dead man touch’d me from the past,
2050. And all at once it seem’d at last
2051. The living soul was flash’d on mine,

2052. And mine in this was wound, and whirl’d
2053. About empyreal heights of thought,
2054. And came on that which is, and caught
2055. The deep pulsations of the world,

2056. Æonian music measuring out
2057. The steps of Time–the shocks of Chance–
2058. The blows of Death. At length my trance
2059. Was cancell’d, stricken thro’ with doubt.

2060. Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame
2061. In matter-moulded forms of speech,
2062. Or ev’n for intellect to reach
2063. Thro’ memory that which I became:

2064. Till now the doubtful dusk reveal’d
2065. The knolls once more where, couch’d at ease,
2066. The white kine glimmer’d, and the trees
2067. Laid their dark arms about the field:

2068. And suck’d from out the distant gloom
2069. A breeze began to tremble o’er
2070. The large leaves of the sycamore,
2071. And fluctuate all the still perfume,

2072. And gathering freshlier overhead,
2073. Rock’d the full-foliaged elms, and swung
2074. The heavy-folded rose, and flung
2075. The lilies to and fro, and said

2076. ‘The dawn, the dawn,’ and died away;
2077. And East and West, without a breath,
2078. Mixt their dim lights, like life and death,
2079. To broaden into boundless day.



2080. XCVI.

2081. You say, but with no touch of scorn,
2082. Sweet-hearted, you, whose light-blue eyes
2083. Are tender over drowning flies,
2084. You tell me, doubt is Devil-born.
2085. I know not: one indeed I knew
2086. In many a subtle question versed,
2087. Who touch’d a jarring lyre at first,
2088. But ever strove to make it true:

2089. Perplext in faith, but pure in deeds,
2090. At last he beat his music out.
2091. There lives more faith in honest doubt,
2092. Believe me, than in half the creeds.

2093. He fought his doubts and gather’d strength,
2094. He would not make his judgment blind,
2095. He faced the spectres of the mind
2096. And laid them: thus he came at length

2097. To find a stronger faith his own;
2098. And Power was with him in the night,
2099. Which makes the darkness and the light,
2100. And dwells not in the light alone,

2101. But in the darkness and the cloud,
2102. As over Sinaï’s peaks of old,
2103. While Israel made their gods of gold,
2104. Altho’ the trumpet blew so loud.



2105. XCVII.

2106. My love has talk’d with rocks and trees;
2107. He finds on misty mountain-ground
2108. His own vast shadow glory-crown’d;
2109. He sees himself in all he sees.
2110. Two partners of a married life–
2111. I look’d on these and thought of thee
2112. In vastness and in mystery,
2113. And of my spirit as of a wife.

2114. These two–they dwelt with eye on eye,
2115. Their hearts of old have beat in tune,
2116. Their meetings made December June,
2117. Their every parting was to die.

2118. Their love has never past away;
2119. The days she never can forget
2120. Are earnest that he loves her yet,
2121. Whate’er the faithless people say.

2122. Her life is lone, he sits apart,
2123. He loves her yet, she will not weep,
2124. Tho’ rapt in matters dark and deep
2125. He seems to slight her simple heart.

2126. He thrids the labyrinth of the mind,
2127. He reads the secret of the star,
2128. He seems so near and yet so far,
2129. He looks so cold: she thinks him kind.

2130. She keeps the gift of years before,
2131. A wither’d violet is her bliss:
2132. She knows not what his greatness is,
2133. For that, for all, she loves him more.

2134. For him she plays, to him she sings
2135. Of early faith and plighted vows;
2136. She knows but matters of the house,
2137. And he, he knows a thousand things.

2138. Her faith is fixt and cannot move,
2139. She darkly feels him great and wise,
2140. She dwells on him with faithful eyes,
2141. ‘I cannot understand: I love.’



2142. XCVIII.

2143. You leave us: you will see the Rhine,
2144. And those fair hills I sail’d below,
2145. When I was there with him; and go
2146. By summer belts of wheat and vine
2147. To where he breathed his latest breath,
2148. That City. All her splendour seems
2149. No livelier than the wisp that gleams
2150. On Lethe in the eyes of Death.

2151. Let her great Danube rolling fair
2152. Enwind her isles, unmark’d of me:
2153. I have not seen, I will not see
2154. Vienna; rather dream that there,

2155. A treble darkness, Evil haunts
2156. The birth, the bridal; friend from friend
2157. Is oftener parted, fathers bend
2158. Above more graves, a thousand wants

2159. Gnarr at the heels of men, and prey
2160. By each cold hearth, and sadness flings
2161. Her shadow on the blaze of kings:
2162. And yet myself have heard him say,

2163. That not in any mother town
2164. With statelier progress to and fro
2165. The double tides of chariots flow
2166. By park and suburb under brown

2167. Of lustier leaves; nor more content,
2168. He told me, lives in any crowd,
2169. When all is gay with lamps, and loud
2170. With sport and song, in booth and tent,

2171. Imperial halls, or open plain;
2172. And wheels the circled dance, and breaks
2173. The rocket molten into flakes
2174. Of crimson or in emerald rain.



2175. XCIX.

2176. Risest thou thus, dim dawn, again,
2177. So loud with voices of the birds,
2178. So thick with lowings of the herds,
2179. Day, when I lost the flower of men;
2180. Who tremblest thro’ thy darkling red
2181. On yon swoll’n brook that bubbles fast
2182. By meadows breathing of the past,
2183. And woodlands holy to the dead;

2184. Who murmurest in the foliaged eaves
2185. A song that slights the coming care,
2186. And Autumn laying here and there
2187. A fiery finger on the leaves;

2188. Who wakenest with thy balmy breath
2189. To myriads on the genial earth,
2190. Memories of bridal, or of birth,
2191. And unto myriads more, of death.

2192. O wheresoever those may be,
2193. Betwixt the slumber of the poles,
2194. To-day they count as kindred souls;
2195. They know me not, but mourn with me.



2196. C.

2197. I climb the hill: from end to end
2198. Of all the landscape underneath,
2199. I find no place that does not breathe
2200. Some gracious memory of my friend;
2201. No gray old grange, or lonely fold,
2202. Or low morass and whispering reed,
2203. Or simple stile from mead to mead,
2204. Or sheepwalk up the windy wold;

2205. Nor hoary knoll of ash and haw
2206. That hears the latest linnet trill,
2207. Nor quarry trench’d along the hill
2208. And haunted by the wrangling daw;

2209. Nor runlet tinkling from the rock;
2210. Nor pastoral rivulet that swerves
2211. To left and right thro’ meadowy curves,
2212. That feed the mothers of the flock;

2213. But each has pleased a kindred eye,
2214. And each reflects a kindlier day;
2215. And, leaving these, to pass away,
2216. I think once more he seems to die.



2217. CI.

2218. Unwatch’d, the garden bough shall sway,
2219. The tender blossom flutter down,
2220. Unloved, that beech will gather brown,
2221. This maple burn itself away;
2222. Unloved, the sun-flower, shining fair,
2223. Ray round with flames her disk of seed,
2224. And many a rose-carnation feed
2225. With summer spice the humming air;

2226. Unloved, by many a sandy bar,
2227. The brook shall babble down the plain,
2228. At noon or when the lesser wain
2229. Is twisting round the polar star;

2230. Uncared for, gird the windy grove,
2231. And flood the haunts of hern and crake;
2232. Or into silver arrows break
2233. The sailing moon in creek and cove;

2234. Till from the garden and the wild
2235. A fresh association blow,
2236. And year by year the landscape grow
2237. Familiar to the stranger’s child;

2238. As year by year the labourer tills
2239. His wonted glebe, or lops the glades;
2240. And year by year our memory fades
2241. From all the circle of the hills.



2242. CII.

2243. We leave the well-beloved place
2244. Where first we gazed upon the sky;
2245. The roofs, that heard our earliest cry,
2246. Will shelter one of stranger race.
2247. We go, but ere we go from home,
2248. As down the garden-walks I move,
2249. Two spirits of a diverse love
2250. Contend for loving masterdom.

2251. One whispers, ‘Here thy boyhood sung
2252. Long since its matin song, and heard
2253. The low love-language of the bird
2254. In native hazels tassel-hung.’

2255. The other answers, ‘Yea, but here
2256. Thy feet have stray’d in after hours
2257. With thy lost friend among the bowers,
2258. And this hath made them trebly dear.’

2259. These two have striven half the day,
2260. And each prefers his separate claim,
2261. Poor rivals in a losing game,
2262. That will not yield each other way.

2263. I turn to go: my feet are set
2264. To leave the pleasant fields and farms;
2265. They mix in one another’s arms
2266. To one pure image of regret.



2267. CIII.

2268. On that last night before we went
2269. From out the doors where I was bred,
2270. I dream’d a vision of the dead,
2271. Which left my after-morn content.
2272. Methought I dwelt within a hall,
2273. And maidens with me: distant hills
2274. From hidden summits fed with rills
2275. A river sliding by the wall.

2276. The hall with harp and carol rang.
2277. They sang of what is wise and good
2278. And graceful. In the centre stood
2279. A statue veil’d, to which they sang;

2280. And which, tho’ veil’d, was known to me,
2281. The shape of him I loved, and love
2282. For ever: then flew in a dove
2283. And brought a summons from the sea:

2284. And when they learnt that I must go
2285. They wept and wail’d, but led the way
2286. To where a little shallop lay
2287. At anchor in the flood below;

2288. And on by many a level mead,
2289. And shadowing bluff that made the banks,
2290. We glided winding under ranks
2291. Of iris, and the golden reed;

2292. And still as vaster grew the shore
2293. And roll’d the floods in grander space,
2294. The maidens gather’d strength and grace
2295. And presence, lordlier than before;

2296. And I myself, who sat apart
2297. And watch’d them, wax’d in every limb;
2298. I felt the thews of Anakim,
2299. The pulses of a Titan’s heart;

2300. As one would sing the death of war,
2301. And one would chant the history
2302. Of that great race, which is to be,
2303. And one the shaping of a star;

2304. Until the forward-creeping tides
2305. Began to foam, and we to draw
2306. From deep to deep, to where we saw
2307. A great ship lift her shining sides.

2308. The man we loved was there on deck,
2309. But thrice as large as man he bent
2310. To greet us. Up the side I went,
2311. And fell in silence on his neck:

2312. Whereat those maidens with one mind
2313. Bewail’d their lot; I did them wrong:
2314. ‘We served thee here’ they said, ‘so long,
2315. And wilt thou leave us now behind?’

2316. So rapt I was, they could not win
2317. An answer from my lips, but he
2318. Replying, ‘Enter likewise ye
2319. And go with us:’ they enter’d in.

2320. And while the wind began to sweep
2321. A music out of sheet and shroud,
2322. We steer’d her toward a crimson cloud
2323. That landlike slept along the deep.



2324. CIV.

2325. The time draws near the birth of Christ;
2326. The moon is hid, the night is still;
2327. A single church below the hill
2328. Is pealing, folded in the mist.
2329. A single peal of bells below,
2330. That wakens at this hour of rest
2331. A single murmur in the breast,
2332. That these are not the bells I know.

2333. Like strangers’ voices here they sound,
2334. In lands where not a memory strays,
2335. Nor landmark breathes of other days,
2336. But all is new unhallow’d ground.



2337. CV.

2338. To-night ungather’d let us leave
2339. This laurel, let this holly stand:
2340. We live within the stranger’s land,
2341. And strangely falls our Christmas-eve.
2342. Our father’s dust is left alone
2343. And silent under other snows:
2344. There in due time the woodbine blows,
2345. The violet comes, but we are gone.

2346. No more shall wayward grief abuse
2347. The genial hour with mask and mime;
2348. For change of place, like growth of time,
2349. Has broke the bond of dying use.

2350. Let cares that petty shadows cast,
2351. By which our lives are chiefly proved,
2352. A little spare the night I loved,
2353. And hold it solemn to the past.

2354. But let no footstep beat the floor,
2355. Nor bowl of wassail mantle warm;
2356. For who would keep an ancient form
2357. Thro’ which the spirit breathes no more?

2358. Be neither song, nor game, nor feast;
2359. Nor harp be touch’d, nor flute be blown;
2360. No dance, no motion, save alone
2361. What lightens in the lucid east

2362. Of rising worlds by yonder wood.
2363. Long sleeps the summer in the seed;
2364. Run out your measured arcs, and lead
2365. The closing cycle rich in good.



2366. CVI.

2367. Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
2368. The flying cloud, the frosty light:
2369. The year is dying in the night;
2370. Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
2371. Ring out the old, ring in the new,
2372. Ring, happy bells, across the snow:
2373. The year is going, let him go;
2374. Ring out the false, ring in the true.

2375. Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
2376. For those that here we see no more;
2377. Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
2378. Ring in redress to all mankind.

2379. Ring out a slowly dying cause,
2380. And ancient forms of party strife;
2381. Ring in the nobler modes of life,
2382. With sweeter manners, purer laws.

2383. Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
2384. The faithless coldness of the times;
2385. Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
2386. But ring the fuller minstrel in.

2387. Ring out false pride in place and blood,
2388. The civic slander and the spite;
2389. Ring in the love of truth and right,
2390. Ring in the common love of good.

2391. Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
2392. Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
2393. Ring out the thousand wars of old,
2394. Ring in the thousand years of peace.

2395. Ring in the valiant man and free,
2396. The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
2397. Ring out the darkness of the land,
2398. Ring in the Christ that is to be.



2399. CVII.

2400. It is the day when he was born,
2401. A bitter day that early sank
2402. Behind a purple-frosty bank
2403. Of vapour, leaving night forlorn.
2404. The time admits not flowers or leaves
2405. To deck the banquet. Fiercely flies
2406. The blast of North and East, and ice
2407. Makes daggers at the sharpen’d eaves,

2408. And bristles all the brakes and thorns
2409. To yon hard crescent, as she hangs
2410. Above the wood which grides and clangs
2411. Its leafless ribs and iron horns

2412. Together, in the drifts that pass
2413. To darken on the rolling brine
2414. That breaks the coast. But fetch the wine,
2415. Arrange the board and brim the glass;

2416. Bring in great logs and let them lie,
2417. To make a solid core of heat;
2418. Be cheerful-minded, talk and treat
2419. Of all things ev’n as he were by;

2420. We keep the day. With festal cheer,
2421. With books and music, surely we
2422. Will drink to him, whate’er he be,
2423. And sing the songs he loved to hear.



2424. CVIII.

2425. I will not shut me from my kind,
2426. And, lest I stiffen into stone,
2427. I will not eat my heart alone,
2428. Nor feed with sighs a passing wind:
2429. What profit lies in barren faith,
2430. And vacant yearning, tho’ with might
2431. To scale the heaven’s highest height,
2432. Or dive below the wells of Death?

2433. What find I in the highest place,
2434. But mine own phantom chanting hymns?
2435. And on the depths of death there swims
2436. The reflex of a human face.

2437. I'll rather take what fruit may be
2438. Of sorrow under human skies:
2439. ’Tis held that sorrow makes us wise,
2440. Whatever wisdom sleep with thee.



2441. CIX.

2442. Heart-affluence in discursive talk
2443. From household fountains never dry;
2444. The critic clearness of an eye,
2445. That saw thro’ all the Muses’ walk;
2446. Seraphic intellect and force
2447. To seize and throw the doubts of man;
2448. Impassion’d logic, which outran
2449. The hearer in its fiery course;

2450. High nature amorous of the good,
2451. But touch’d with no ascetic gloom;
2452. And passion pure in snowy bloom
2453. Thro’ all the years of April blood;

2454. A love of freedom rarely felt,
2455. Of freedom in her regal seat
2456. Of England; not the schoolboy heat,
2457. The blind hysterics of the Celt;

2458. And manhood fused with female grace
2459. In such a sort, the child would twine
2460. A trustful hand, unask’d, in thine,
2461. And find his comfort in thy face;

2462. All these have been, and thee mine eyes
2463. Have look’d on: if they look’d in vain,
2464. My shame is greater who remain,
2465. Nor let thy wisdom make me wise.



2466. CX.

2467. Thy converse drew us with delight,
2468. The men of rathe and riper years:
2469. The feeble soul, a haunt of fears,
2470. Forgot his weakness in thy sight.
2471. On thee the loyal-hearted hung,
2472. The proud was half disarm’d of pride,
2473. Nor cared the serpent at thy side
2474. To flicker with his double tongue.

2475. The stern were mild when thou wert by,
2476. The flippant put himself to school
2477. And heard thee, and the brazen fool
2478. Was soften’d, and he knew not why;

2479. While I, thy nearest, sat apart,
2480. And felt thy triumph was as mine;
2481. And loved them more, that they were thine,
2482. The graceful tact, the Christian art;

2483. Nor mine the sweetness or the skill,
2484. But mine the love that will not tire,
2485. And, born of love, the vague desire
2486. That spurs an imitative will.



2487. CXI.

2488. The churl in spirit, up or down
2489. Along the scale of ranks, thro’ all,
2490. To him who grasps a golden ball,
2491. By blood a king, at heart a clown;
2492. The churl in spirit, howe’er he veil
2493. His want in forms for fashion’s sake,
2494. Will let his coltish nature break
2495. At seasons thro’ the gilded pale:

2496. For who can always act? but he,
2497. To whom a thousand memories call,
2498. Not being less but more than all
2499. The gentleness he seem’d to be,

2500. Best seem’d the thing he was, and join’d
2501. Each office of the social hour
2502. To noble manners, as the flower
2503. And native growth of noble mind;

2504. Nor ever narrowness or spite,
2505. Or villain fancy fleeting by,
2506. Drew in the expression of an eye,
2507. Where God and Nature met in light;

2508. And thus he bore without abuse
2509. The grand old name of gentleman,
2510. Defamed by every charlatan,
2511. And soil’d with all ignoble use.



2512. CXII.

2513. High wisdom holds my wisdom less,
2514. That I, who gaze with temperate eyes
2515. On glorious insufficiencies,
2516. Set light by narrower perfectness.
2517. But thou, that fillest all the room
2518. Of all my love, art reason why
2519. I seem to cast a careless eye
2520. On souls, the lesser lords of doom.

2521. For what wert thou? some novel power
2522. Sprang up for ever at a touch,
2523. And hope could never hope too much,
2524. In watching thee from hour to hour,

2525. Large elements in order brought,
2526. And tracts of calm from tempest made,
2527. And world-wide fluctuation sway’d
2528. In vassal tides that follow’d thought.



2529. CXIII.

2530. ’Tis held that sorrow makes us wise;
2531. Yet how much wisdom sleeps with thee
2532. Which not alone had guided me,
2533. But served the seasons that may rise;
2534. For can I doubt, who knew thee keen
2535. In intellect, with force and skill
2536. To strive, to fashion, to fulfil–
2537. I doubt not what thou wouldst have been:

2538. A life in civic action warm,
2539. A soul on highest mission sent,
2540. A potent voice of Parliament,
2541. A pillar steadfast in the storm,

2542. Should licensed boldness gather force,
2543. Becoming, when the time has birth,
2544. A lever to uplift the earth
2545. And roll it in another course,

2546. With thousand shocks that come and go,
2547. With agonies, with energies,
2548. With overthrowings, and with cries,
2549. And undulations to and fro.



2550. CXIV.

2551. Who loves not Knowledge? Who shall rail
2552. Against her beauty? May she mix
2553. With men and prosper! Who shall fix
2554. Her pillars? Let her work prevail.
2555. But on her forehead sits a fire:
2556. She sets her forward countenance
2557. And leaps into the future chance,
2558. Submitting all things to desire.

2559. Half-grown as yet, a child, and vain–
2560. She cannot fight the fear of death.
2561. What is she, cut from love and faith,
2562. But some wild Pallas from the brain

2563. Of Demons? fiery-hot to burst
2564. All barriers in her onward race
2565. For power. Let her know her place;
2566. She is the second, not the first.

2567. A higher hand must make her mild,
2568. If all be not in vain; and guide
2569. Her footsteps, moving side by side
2570. With wisdom, like the younger child:

2571. For she is earthly of the mind,
2572. But Wisdom heavenly of the soul.
2573. O, friend, who camest to thy goal
2574. So early, leaving me behind,

2575. I would the great world grew like thee,
2576. Who grewest not alone in power
2577. And knowledge, but by year and hour
2578. In reverence and in charity.



2579. CXV.

2580. Now fades the last long streak of snow,
2581. Now burgeons every maze of quick
2582. About the flowering squares, and thick
2583. By ashen roots the violets blow.
2584. Now rings the woodland loud and long,
2585. The distance takes a lovelier hue,
2586. And drown’d in yonder living blue
2587. The lark becomes a sightless song.

2588. Now dance the lights on lawn and lea,
2589. The flocks are whiter down the vale,
2590. And milkier every milky sail
2591. On winding stream or distant sea;

2592. Where now the seamew pipes, or dives
2593. In yonder greening gleam, and fly
2594. The happy birds, that change their sky
2595. To build and brood; that live their lives

2596. From land to land; and in my breast
2597. Spring wakens too; and my regret
2598. Becomes an April violet,
2599. And buds and blossoms like the rest.



2600. CXVI.

2601. Is it, then, regret for buried time
2602. That keenlier in sweet April wakes,
2603. And meets the year, and gives and takes
2604. The colours of the crescent prime?
2605. Not all: the songs, the stirring air,
2606. The life re-orient out of dust,
2607. Cry thro’ the sense to hearten trust
2608. In that which made the world so fair.

2609. Not all regret: the face will shine
2610. Upon me, while I muse alone;
2611. And that dear voice, I once have known,
2612. Still speak to me of me and mine:

2613. Yet less of sorrow lives in me
2614. For days of happy commune dead;
2615. Less yearning for the friendship fled,
2616. Than some strong bond which is to be.



2617. CXVII.

2618. O days and hours, your work is this
2619. To hold me from my proper place,
2620. A little while from his embrace
2621. For fuller gain of after bliss:
2622. That out of distance might ensue
2623. Desire of nearness doubly sweet;
2624. And unto meeting when we meet,
2625. Delight a hundredfold accrue,

2626. For every grain of sand that runs,
2627. And every span of shade that steals,
2628. And every kiss of toothed wheels,
2629. And all the courses of the suns.



2630. CXVIII.

2631. Contemplate all this work of Time,
2632. The giant labouring in his youth;
2633. Nor dream of human love and truth,
2634. As dying Nature’s earth and lime;
2635. But trust that those we call the dead
2636. Are breathers of an ampler day
2637. For ever nobler ends. They say,
2638. The solid earth whereon we tread

2639. In tracts of fluent heat began,
2640. And grew to seeming-random forms,
2641. The seeming prey of cyclic storms,
2642. Till at the last arose the man;

2643. Who throve and branch’d from clime to clime,
2644. The herald of a higher race,
2645. And of himself in higher place,
2646. If so he type this work of time

2647. Within himself, from more to more;
2648. Or, crown’d with attributes of woe
2649. Like glories, move his course, and show
2650. That life is not as idle ore,

2651. But iron dug from central gloom,
2652. And heated hot with burning fears,
2653. And dipt in baths of hissing tears,
2654. And batter’d with the shocks of doom

2655. To shape and use. Arise and fly
2656. The reeling Faun, the sensual feast;
2657. Move upward, working out the beast,
2658. And let the ape and tiger die.



2659. CXIX.

2660. Doors, where my heart was used to beat
2661. So quickly, not as one that weeps
2662. I come once more; the city sleeps;
2663. I smell the meadow in the street;
2664. I hear a chirp of birds; I see
2665. Betwixt the black fronts long-withdrawn
2666. A light-blue lane of early dawn,
2667. And think of early days and thee,

2668. And bless thee, for thy lips are bland,
2669. And bright the friendship of thine eye;
2670. And in my thoughts with scarce a sigh
2671. I take the pressure of thine hand.



2672. CXX.

2673. I trust I have not wasted breath:
2674. I think we are not wholly brain,
2675. Magnetic mockeries; not in vain,
2676. Like Paul with beasts, I fought with Death;
2677. Not only cunning casts in clay:
2678. Let Science prove we are, and then
2679. What matters Science unto men,
2680. At least to me? I would not stay.

2681. Let him, the wiser man who springs
2682. Hereafter, up from childhood shape
2683. His action like the greater ape,
2684. But I was born to other things.



2685. CXXI.

2686. Sad Hesper o’er the buried sun
2687. And ready, thou, to die with him,
2688. Thou watchest all things ever dim
2689. And dimmer, and a glory done:
2690. The team is loosen’d from the wain,
2691. The boat is drawn upon the shore;
2692. Thou listenest to the closing door,
2693. And life is darken’d in the brain.

2694. Bright Phosphor, fresher for the night,
2695. By thee the world’s great work is heard
2696. Beginning, and the wakeful bird;
2697. Behind thee comes the greater light:

2698. The market boat is on the stream,
2699. And voices hail it from the brink;
2700. Thou hear’st the village hammer clink,
2701. And see’st the moving of the team.

2702. Sweet Hesper-Phosphor, double name
2703. For what is one, the first, the last,
2704. Thou, like my present and my past,
2705. Thy place is changed; thou art the same.



2706. CXXII.

2707. Oh, wast thou with me, dearest, then,
2708. While I rose up against my doom,
2709. And yearn’d to burst the folded gloom,
2710. To bare the eternal Heavens again,
2711. To feel once more, in placid awe,
2712. The strong imagination roll
2713. A sphere of stars about my soul,
2714. In all her motion one with law;

2715. If thou wert with me, and the grave
2716. Divide us not, be with me now,
2717. And enter in at breast and brow,
2718. Till all my blood, a fuller wave,

2719. Be quicken’d with a livelier breath,
2720. And like an inconsiderate boy,
2721. As in the former flash of joy,
2722. I slip the thoughts of life and death;

2723. And all the breeze of Fancy blows,
2724. And every dew-drop paints a bow,
2725. The wizard lightnings deeply glow,
2726. And every thought breaks out a rose.



2727. CXXIII.

2728. There rolls the deep where grew the tree.
2729. O earth, what changes hast thou seen!
2730. There where the long street roars, hath been
2731. The stillness of the central sea.
2732. The hills are shadows, and they flow
2733. From form to form, and nothing stands;
2734. They melt like mist, the solid lands,
2735. Like clouds they shape themselves and go.

2736. But in my spirit will I dwell,
2737. And dream my dream, and hold it true;
2738. For tho’ my lips may breathe adieu,
2739. I cannot think the thing farewell.



2740. CXXIV.

2741. That which we dare invoke to bless;
2742. Our dearest faith; our ghastliest doubt;
2743. He, They, One, All; within, without;
2744. The Power in darkness whom we guess;
2745. I found Him not in world or sun,
2746. Or eagle’s wing, or insect’s eye;
2747. Nor thro’ the questions men may try,
2748. The petty cobwebs we have spun:

2749. If e’er when faith had fall’n asleep,
2750. I heard a voice ‘believe no more’
2751. And heard an ever-breaking shore
2752. That tumbled in the Godless deep;

2753. A warmth within the breast would melt
2754. The freezing reason’s colder part,
2755. And like a man in wrath the heart
2756. Stood up and answer’d ‘I have felt.’

2757. No, like a child in doubt and fear:
2758. But that blind clamour made me wise;
2759. Then was I as a child that cries,
2760. But, crying, knows his father near;

2761. And what I am beheld again
2762. What is, and no man understands;
2763. And out of darkness came the hands
2764. That reach thro’ nature, moulding men.



2765. CXXV.

2766. Whatever I have said or sung,
2767. Some bitter notes my harp would give,
2768. Yea, tho’ there often seem’d to live
2769. A contradiction on the tongue,
2770. Yet Hope had never lost her youth;
2771. She did but look through dimmer eyes;
2772. Or Love but play’d with gracious lies,
2773. Because he felt so fix’d in truth:

2774. And if the song were full of care,
2775. He breathed the spirit of the song;
2776. And if the words were sweet and strong
2777. He set his royal signet there;

2778. Abiding with me till I sail
2779. To seek thee on the mystic deeps,
2780. And this electric force, that keeps
2781. A thousand pulses dancing, fail.



2782. CXXVI.

2783. Love is and was my Lord and King,
2784. And in his presence I attend
2785. To hear the tidings of my friend,
2786. Which every hour his couriers bring.
2787. Love is and was my King and Lord,
2788. And will be, tho’ as yet I keep
2789. Within his court on earth, and sleep
2790. Encompass’d by his faithful guard,

2791. And hear at times a sentinel
2792. Who moves about from place to place,
2793. And whispers to the worlds of space,
2794. In the deep night, that all is well.



2795. CXXVII.

2796. And all is well, tho’ faith and form
2797. Be sunder’d in the night of fear;
2798. Well roars the storm to those that hear
2799. A deeper voice across the storm,
2800. Proclaiming social truth shall spread,
2801. And justice, ev’n tho’ thrice again
2802. The red fool-fury of the Seine
2803. Should pile her barricades with dead.

2804. But ill for him that wears a crown,
2805. And him, the lazar, in his rags:
2806. They tremble, the sustaining crags;
2807. The spires of ice are toppled down,

2808. And molten up, and roar in flood;
2809. The fortress crashes from on high,
2810. The brute earth lightens to the sky,
2811. And the great Æon sinks in blood,

2812. And compass’d by the fires of Hell;
2813. While thou, dear spirit, happy star,
2814. O’erlook’st the tumult from afar,
2815. And smilest, knowing all is well.



2816. CXXVIII.

2817. The love that rose on stronger wings,
2818. Unpalsied when he met with Death,
2819. Is comrade of the lesser faith
2820. That sees the course of human things.
2821. No doubt vast eddies in the flood
2822. Of onward time shall yet be made,
2823. And throned races may degrade;
2824. Yet O ye mysteries of good,

2825. Wild Hours that fly with Hope and Fear,
2826. If all your office had to do
2827. With old results that look like new;
2828. If this were all your mission here,

2829. To draw, to sheathe a useless sword,
2830. To fool the crowd with glorious lies,
2831. To cleave a creed in sects and cries,
2832. To change the bearing of a word,

2833. To shift an arbitrary power,
2834. To cramp the student at his desk,
2835. To make old bareness picturesque
2836. And tuft with grass a feudal tower;

2837. Why then my scorn might well descend
2838. On you and yours. I see in part
2839. That all, as in some piece of art,
2840. Is toil coöperant to an end.



2841. CXXIX.

2842. Dear friend, far off, my lost desire,
2843. So far, so near in woe and weal;
2844. O loved the most, when most I feel
2845. There is a lower and a higher;
2846. Known and unknown; human, divine;
2847. Sweet human hand and lips and eye;
2848. Dear heavenly friend that canst not die,
2849. Mine, mine, for ever, ever mine;

2850. Strange friend, past, present, and to be;
2851. Loved deeplier, darklier understood;
2852. Behold, I dream a dream of good,
2853. And mingle all the world with thee.



2854. CXXX.

2855. Thy voice is on the rolling air;
2856. I hear thee where the waters run;
2857. Thou standest in the rising sun,
2858. And in the setting thou art fair.
2859. What art thou then? I cannot guess;
2860. But tho’ I seem in star and flower
2861. To feel thee some diffusive power,
2862. I do not therefore love thee less:

2863. My love involves the love before;
2864. My love is vaster passion now;
2865. Tho’ mix’d with God and Nature thou,
2866. I seem to love thee more and more.

2867. Far off thou art, but ever nigh;
2868. I have thee still, and I rejoice;
2869. I prosper, circled with thy voice;
2870. I shall not lose thee tho’ I die.



2871. CXXXI.

2872. O living will that shalt endure
2873. When all that seems shall suffer shock,
2874. Rise in the spiritual rock,
2875. Flow thro’ our deeds and make them pure,
2876. That we may lift from out of dust
2877. A voice as unto him that hears,
2878. A cry above the conquer’d years
2879. To one that with us works, and trust,

2880. With faith that comes of self-control,
2881. The truths that never can be proved
2882. Until we close with all we loved,
2883. And all we flow from, soul in soul.

2884. _________

2885. O true and tried, so well and long,
2886. Demand not thou a marriage lay;
2887. In that it is thy marriage day
2888. Is music more than any song.

2889. Nor have I felt so much of bliss
2890. Since first he told me that he loved
2891. A daughter of our house; nor proved
2892. Since that dark day a day like this;

2893. Tho’ I since then have number’d o’er
2894. Some thrice three years: they went and came,
2895. Remade the blood and changed the frame,
2896. And yet is love not less, but more;

2897. No longer caring to embalm
2898. In dying songs a dead regret,
2899. But like a statue solid-set,
2900. And moulded in colossal calm.

2901. Regret is dead, but love is more
2902. Than in the summers that are flown,
2903. For I myself with these have grown
2904. To something greater than before;

2905. Which makes appear the songs I made
2906. As echoes out of weaker times,
2907. As half but idle brawling rhymes,
2908. The sport of random sun and shade.

2909. But where is she, the bridal flower,
2910. That must he made a wife ere noon?
2911. She enters, glowing like the moon
2912. Of Eden on its bridal bower:

2913. On me she bends her blissful eyes
2914. And then on thee; they meet thy look
2915. And brighten like the star that shook
2916. Betwixt the palms of paradise.

2917. O when her life was yet in bud,
2918. He too foretold the perfect rose.
2919. For thee she grew, for thee she grows
2920. For ever, and as fair as good.

2921. And thou art worthy; full of power;
2922. As gentle; liberal-minded, great,
2923. Consistent; wearing all that weight
2924. Of learning lightly like a flower.

2925. But now set out: the noon is near,
2926. And I must give away the bride;
2927. She fears not, or with thee beside
2928. And me behind her, will not fear.

2929. For I that danced her on my knee,
2930. That watch’d her on her nurse’s arm,
2931. That shielded all her life from harm
2932. At last must part with her to thee;

2933. Now waiting to be made a wife,
2934. Her feet, my darling, on the dead;
2935. Their pensive tablets round her head,
2936. And the most living words of life

2937. Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,
2938. The ‘wilt thou’ answer’d, and again
2939. The ‘wilt thou’ ask’d, till out of twain
2940. Her sweet ‘I will’ has made you one.

2941. Now sign your names, which shall be read,
2942. Mute symbols of a joyful morn,
2943. By village eyes as yet unborn;
2944. The names are sign’d, and overhead

2945. Begins the clash and clang that tells
2946. The joy to every wandering breeze;
2947. The blind wall rocks, and on the trees
2948. The dead leaf trembles to the bells.

2949. O happy hour, and happier hours
2950. Await them. Many a merry face
2951. Salutes them–maidens of the place,
2952. That pelt us in the porch with flowers.

2953. O happy hour, behold the bride
2954. With him to whom her hand I gave.
2955. They leave the porch, they pass the grave
2956. That has to-day its sunny side.

2957. To-day the grave is bright for me,
2958. For them the light of life increased,
2959. Who stay to share the morning feast,
2960. Who rest to-night beside the sea.

2961. Let all my genial spirits advance
2962. To meet and greet a whiter sun;
2963. My drooping memory will not shun
2964. The foaming grape of eastern France.

2965. It circles round, and fancy plays,
2966. And hearts are warm’d and faces bloom,
2967. As drinking health to bride and groom
2968. We wish them store of happy days.

2969. Nor count me all to blame if I
2970. Conjecture of a stiller guest,
2971. Perchance, perchance, among the rest,
2972. And, tho’ in silence, wishing joy.

2973. But they must go, the time draws on,
2974. And those white-favour’d horses wait;
2975. They rise, but linger; it is late;
2976. Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.

2977. A shade falls on us like the dark
2978. From little cloudlets on the grass,
2979. But sweeps away as out we pass
2980. To range the woods, to roam the park,

2981. Discussing how their courtship grew,
2982. And talk of others that are wed,
2983. And how she look’d, and what he said,
2984. And back we come at fall of dew.

2985. Again the feast, the speech, the glee,
2986. The shade of passing thought, the wealth
2987. Of words and wit, the double health,
2988. The crowning cup, the three-times-three,

2989. And last the dance;–till I retire:
2990. Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,
2991. And high in heaven the streaming cloud,
2992. And on the downs a rising fire:

2993. And rise, O moon, from yonder down,
2994. Till over down and over dale
2995. All night the shining vapour sail
2996. And pass the silent-lighted town,

2997. The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,
2998. And catch at every mountain head,
2999. And o’er the friths that branch and spread
3000. Their sleeping silver thro’ the hills;

3001. And touch with shade the bridal doors,
3002. With tender gloom the roof, the wall;
3003. And breaking let the splendour fall
3004. To spangle all the happy shores

3005. By which they rest, and ocean sounds,
3006. And, star and system rolling past,
3007. A soul shall draw from out the vast
3008. And strike his being into bounds,

3009. And, moved thro’ life of lower phase,
3010. Result in man, be born and think,
3011. And act and love, a closer link
3012. Betwixt us and the crowning race

3013. Of those that, eye to eye, shall look
3014. On knowledge; under whose command
3015. Is Earth and Earth’s, and in their hand
3016. Is Nature like an open book;

3017. No longer half-akin to brute,
3018. For all we thought and loved and did,
3019. And hoped, and suffer’d, is but seed
3020. Of what in them is flower and fruit;

3021. Whereof the man, that with me trod
3022. This planet, was a noble type
3023. Appearing ere the times were ripe,
3024. That friend of mine who lives in God,

3025. That God, which ever lives and loves,
3026. One God, one law, one element,
3027. And one far-off divine event,
3028. To which the whole creation moves.
