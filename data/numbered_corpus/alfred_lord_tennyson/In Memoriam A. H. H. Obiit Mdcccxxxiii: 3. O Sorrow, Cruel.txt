1. O Sorrow, cruel fellowship,
2. O Priestess in the vaults of Death,
3. O sweet and bitter in a breath,
4. What whispers from thy lying lip?
5. "The stars," she whispers, "blindly run;
6. A web is wov'n across the sky;
7. From out waste places comes a cry,
8. And murmurs from the dying sun:
9. "And all the phantom, Nature, stands--
10. With all the music in her tone,
11. A hollow echo of my own,--
12. A hollow form with empty hands."

13. And shall I take a thing so blind,
14. Embrace her as my natural good;
15. Or crush her, like a vice of blood,
16. Upon the threshold of the mind?
