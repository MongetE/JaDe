1. Illyrian woodlands, echoing falls
2. Of water, sheets of summer glass,
3. The long divine Peneian pass,
4. The vast Akrokeraunian walls,

5. Tomohrit, Athos, all things fair,
6. With such a pencil, such a pen,
7. You shadow forth to distant men,
8. I read and felt that I was there:

9. And trust me while I turn'd the page,
10. And track'd you still on classic ground,
11. I grew in gladness till I found
12. My spirits in the golden age.

13. For me the torrent ever pour'd
14. And glisten'd -- here and there alone
15. The broad-limb'd gods at random thrown
16. By fountain urns; -- and Naiads oar'd

17. A glimmering shoulder under gloom
18. Of cavern pillars; on the swell
19. The silver lily heaved and fell;
20. And many a slope was rich in bloom

21. From him that on the mountain lea
22. By dancing rivulets fed his flocks,
23. To him who sat upon the rocks,
24. And fluted to the morning sea.
