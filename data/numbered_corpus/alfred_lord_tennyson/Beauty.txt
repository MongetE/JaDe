1. Oh, Beauty, passing beauty! sweetest Sweet!
2. How canst thou let me waste my youth in sighs;
3. I only ask to sit beside thy feet.
4. Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes,
5. Might I but kiss thy hand! I dare not fold
6. My arms about thee—scarcely dare to speak.
7. And nothing seems to me so wild and bold,
8. As with one kiss to touch thy blessèd cheek.
9. Methinks if I should kiss thee, no control
10. Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat
11. The subtle spirit. Even while I spoke,
12. The bare word KISS hath made my inner soul
13. To tremble like a lutestring, ere the note
14. Hath melted in the silence that it broke.
