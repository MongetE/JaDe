1. Excerpt from "Maud"

2. She is coming, my own, my sweet;
3. Were it ever so airy a tread,
4. My heart would hear her and beat,
5. Were it earth in an earthy bed;
6. My dust would hear her and beat,
7. Had I lain for a century dead,
8. Would start and tremble under her feet,
9. And blossom in purple and red.
