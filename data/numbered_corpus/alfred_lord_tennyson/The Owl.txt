1. When cats run home and light is come,
2. And dew is cold upon the ground,
3. And the far-off stream is dumb,
4. And the whirring sail goes round,
5. And the whirring sail goes round;
6. Alone and warming his five wits,
7. The white owl in the belfry sits.
8. When merry milkmaids click the latch,
9. And rarely smells the new-mown hay,
10. And the cock hath sung beneath the thatch
11. Twice or thrice his roundelay,
12. Twice or thrice his roundelay;
13. Alone and warming his five wits,
14. The white owl in the belfry sits.
