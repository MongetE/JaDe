1. Leodogran, the King of Cameliard,
2. Had one fair daughter, and none other child;
3. And she was the fairest of all flesh on earth,
4. Guinevere, and in her his one delight.

5. For many a petty king ere Arthur came
6. Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war
7. Each upon other, wasted all the land;
8. And still from time to time the heathen host
9. Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.
10. And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,
11. Wherein the beast was ever more and more,
12. But man was less and less, till Arthur came.
13. For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,
14. And after him King Uther fought and died,
15. But either failed to make the kingdom one.
16. And after these King Arthur for a space,
17. And through the puissance of his Table Round,
18. Drew all their petty princedoms under him.
19. Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned.

20. And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,
21. Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,
22. And none or few to scare or chase the beast;
23. So that wild dog, and wolf and boar and bear
24. Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,
25. And wallowed in the gardens of the King.
26. And ever and anon the wolf would steal
27. The children and devour, but now and then,
28. Her own brood lost or dead, lent her fierce teat
29. To human sucklings; and the children, housed
30. In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,
31. And mock their foster mother on four feet,
32. Till, straightened, they grew up to wolf-like men,
33. Worse than the wolves.  And King Leodogran
34. Groaned for the Roman legions here again,
35. And Csar's eagle:  then his brother king,
36. Urien, assailed him:  last a heathen horde,
37. Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,
38. And on the spike that split the mother's heart
39. Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,
40. He knew not whither he should turn for aid.

41. But--for he heard of Arthur newly crowned,
42. Though not without an uproar made by those
43. Who cried, `He is not Uther's son'--the King
44. Sent to him, saying, `Arise, and help us thou!
45. For here between the man and beast we die.'

46. And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms,
47. But heard the call, and came:  and Guinevere
48. Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass;
49. But since he neither wore on helm or shield
50. The golden symbol of his kinglihood,
51. But rode a simple knight among his knights,
52. And many of these in richer arms than he,
53. She saw him not, or marked not, if she saw,
54. One among many, though his face was bare.
55. But Arthur, looking downward as he past,
56. Felt the light of her eyes into his life
57. Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitched
58. His tents beside the forest.  Then he drave
59. The heathen; after, slew the beast, and felled
60. The forest, letting in the sun, and made
61. Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight
62. And so returned.

63. For while he lingered there,
64. A doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts
65. Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm
66. Flashed forth and into war:  for most of these,
67. Colleaguing with a score of petty kings,
68. Made head against him, crying, `Who is he
69. That he should rule us? who hath proven him
70. King Uther's son? for lo! we look at him,
71. And find nor face nor bearing, limbs nor voice,
72. Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.
73. This is the son of Gorlos, not the King;
74. This is the son of Anton, not the King.'

75. And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt
76. Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,
77. Desiring to be joined with Guinevere;
78. And thinking as he rode, `Her father said
79. That there between the man and beast they die.
80. Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts
81. Up to my throne, and side by side with me?
82. What happiness to reign a lonely king,
83. Vext--O ye stars that shudder over me,
84. O earth that soundest hollow under me,
85. Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be joined
86. To her that is the fairest under heaven,
87. I seem as nothing in the mighty world,
88. And cannot will my will, nor work my work
89. Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm
90. Victor and lord.  But were I joined with her,
91. Then might we live together as one life,
92. And reigning with one will in everything
93. Have power on this dark land to lighten it,
94. And power on this dead world to make it live.'

95. Thereafter--as he speaks who tells the tale--
96. When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright
97. With pitched pavilions of his foe, the world
98. Was all so clear about him, that he saw
99. The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,
100. And even in high day the morning star.
101. So when the King had set his banner broad,
102. At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,
103. And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,
104. The long-lanced battle let their horses run.
105. And now the Barons and the kings prevailed,
106. And now the King, as here and there that war
107. Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world
108. Made lightnings and great thunders over him,
109. And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might,
110. And mightier of his hands with every blow,
111. And leading all his knighthood threw the kings
112. Cardos, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,
113. Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,
114. The King Brandagoras of Latangor,
115. With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,
116. And Lot of Orkney.  Then, before a voice
117. As dreadful as the shout of one who sees
118. To one who sins, and deems himself alone
119. And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake
120. Flying, and Arthur called to stay the brands
121. That hacked among the flyers, `Ho! they yield!'
122. So like a painted battle the war stood
123. Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,
124. And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.
125. He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved
126. And honoured most.  `Thou dost not doubt me King,
127. So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.'
128. `Sir and my liege,' he cried, `the fire of God
129. Descends upon thee in the battle-field:
130. I know thee for my King!'  Whereat the two,
131. For each had warded either in the fight,
132. Sware on the field of death a deathless love.
133. And Arthur said, `Man's word is God in man:
134. Let chance what will, I trust thee to the death.'

135. Then quickly from the foughten field he sent
136. Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,
137. His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,
138. Saying, `If I in aught have served thee well,
139. Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.'

140. Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart
141. Debating--`How should I that am a king,
142. However much he holp me at my need,
143. Give my one daughter saving to a king,
144. And a king's son?'--lifted his voice, and called
145. A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom
146. He trusted all things, and of him required
147. His counsel:  `Knowest thou aught of Arthur's birth?'

148. Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,
149. `Sir King, there be but two old men that know:
150. And each is twice as old as I; and one
151. Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served
152. King Uther through his magic art; and one
153. Is Merlin's master (so they call him) Bleys,
154. Who taught him magic, but the scholar ran
155. Before the master, and so far, that Bleys,
156. Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote
157. All things and whatsoever Merlin did
158. In one great annal-book, where after-years
159. Will learn the secret of our Arthur's birth.'

160. To whom the King Leodogran replied,
161. `O friend, had I been holpen half as well
162. By this King Arthur as by thee today,
163. Then beast and man had had their share of me:
164. But summon here before us yet once more
165. Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.'

166. Then, when they came before him, the King said,
167. `I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,
168. And reason in the chase:  but wherefore now
169. Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,
170. Some calling Arthur born of Gorlos,
171. Others of Anton?  Tell me, ye yourselves,
172. Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther's son?'

173. And Ulfius and Brastias answered, `Ay.'
174. Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights
175. Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake--
176. For bold in heart and act and word was he,
177. Whenever slander breathed against the King--

178. `Sir, there be many rumours on this head:
179. For there be those who hate him in their hearts,
180. Call him baseborn, and since his ways are sweet,
181. And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:
182. And there be those who deem him more than man,
183. And dream he dropt from heaven:  but my belief
184. In all this matter--so ye care to learn--
185. Sir, for ye know that in King Uther's time
186. The prince and warrior Gorlos, he that held
187. Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,
188. Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:
189. And daughters had she borne him,--one whereof,
190. Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,
191. Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved
192. To Arthur,--but a son she had not borne.
193. And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:
194. But she, a stainless wife to Gorlos,
195. So loathed the bright dishonour of his love,
196. That Gorlos and King Uther went to war:
197. And overthrown was Gorlos and slain.
198. Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged
199. Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,
200. Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,
201. Left her and fled, and Uther entered in,
202. And there was none to call to but himself.
203. So, compassed by the power of the King,
204. Enforced was she to wed him in her tears,
205. And with a shameful swiftness:  afterward,
206. Not many moons, King Uther died himself,
207. Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule
208. After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.
209. And that same night, the night of the new year,
210. By reason of the bitterness and grief
211. That vext his mother, all before his time
212. Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born
213. Delivered at a secret postern-gate
214. To Merlin, to be holden far apart
215. Until his hour should come; because the lords
216. Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,
217. Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child
218. Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each
219. But sought to rule for his own self and hand,
220. And many hated Uther for the sake
221. Of Gorlos.  Wherefore Merlin took the child,
222. And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight
223. And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife
224. Nursed the young prince, and reared him with her own;
225. And no man knew.  And ever since the lords
226. Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,
227. So that the realm has gone to wrack:  but now,
228. This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)
229. Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,
230. Proclaiming, "Here is Uther's heir, your king,"
231. A hundred voices cried, "Away with him!
232. No king of ours! a son of Gorlos he,
233. Or else the child of Anton, and no king,
234. Or else baseborn."  Yet Merlin through his craft,
235. And while the people clamoured for a king,
236. Had Arthur crowned; but after, the great lords
237. Banded, and so brake out in open war.'

238. Then while the King debated with himself
239. If Arthur were the child of shamefulness,
240. Or born the son of Gorlos, after death,
241. Or Uther's son, and born before his time,
242. Or whether there were truth in anything
243. Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,
244. With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,
245. Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;
246. Whom as he could, not as he would, the King
247. Made feast for, saying, as they sat at meat,

248. `A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.
249. Ye come from Arthur's court.  Victor his men
250. Report him!  Yea, but ye--think ye this king--
251. So many those that hate him, and so strong,
252. So few his knights, however brave they be--
253. Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?'

254. `O King,' she cried, `and I will tell thee:  few,
255. Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;
256. For I was near him when the savage yells
257. Of Uther's peerage died, and Arthur sat
258. Crowned on the das, and his warriors cried,
259. "Be thou the king, and we will work thy will
260. Who love thee."  Then the King in low deep tones,
261. And simple words of great authority,
262. Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,
263. That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some
264. Were pale as at the passing of a ghost,
265. Some flushed, and others dazed, as one who wakes
266. Half-blinded at the coming of a light.

267. `But when he spake and cheered his Table Round
268. With large, divine, and comfortable words,
269. Beyond my tongue to tell thee--I beheld
270. From eye to eye through all their Order flash
271. A momentary likeness of the King:
272. And ere it left their faces, through the cross
273. And those around it and the Crucified,
274. Down from the casement over Arthur, smote
275. Flame-colour, vert and azure, in three rays,
276. One falling upon each of three fair queens,
277. Who stood in silence near his throne, the friends
278. Of Arthur, gazing on him, tall, with bright
279. Sweet faces, who will help him at his need.

280. `And there I saw mage Merlin, whose vast wit
281. And hundred winters are but as the hands
282. Of loyal vassals toiling for their liege.

283. `And near him stood the Lady of the Lake,
284. Who knows a subtler magic than his own--
285. Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.
286. She gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword,
287. Whereby to drive the heathen out:  a mist
288. Of incense curled about her, and her face
289. Wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom;
290. But there was heard among the holy hymns
291. A voice as of the waters, for she dwells
292. Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms
293. May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,
294. Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.

295. `There likewise I beheld Excalibur
296. Before him at his crowning borne, the sword
297. That rose from out the bosom of the lake,
298. And Arthur rowed across and took it--rich
299. With jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt,
300. Bewildering heart and eye--the blade so bright
301. That men are blinded by it--on one side,
302. Graven in the oldest tongue of all this world,
303. "Take me," but turn the blade and ye shall see,
304. And written in the speech ye speak yourself,
305. "Cast me away!"  And sad was Arthur's face
306. Taking it, but old Merlin counselled him,
307. "Take thou and strike! the time to cast away
308. Is yet far-off."  So this great brand the king
309. Took, and by this will beat his foemen down.'

310. Thereat Leodogran rejoiced, but thought
311. To sift his doubtings to the last, and asked,
312. Fixing full eyes of question on her face,
313. `The swallow and the swift are near akin,
314. But thou art closer to this noble prince,
315. Being his own dear sister;' and she said,
316. `Daughter of Gorlos and Ygerne am I;'
317. `And therefore Arthur's sister?' asked the King.
318. She answered, `These be secret things,' and signed
319. To those two sons to pass, and let them be.
320. And Gawain went, and breaking into song
321. Sprang out, and followed by his flying hair
322. Ran like a colt, and leapt at all he saw:
323. But Modred laid his ear beside the doors,
324. And there half-heard; the same that afterward
325. Struck for the throne, and striking found his doom.

326. And then the Queen made answer, `What know I?
327. For dark my mother was in eyes and hair,
328. And dark in hair and eyes am I; and dark
329. Was Gorlos, yea and dark was Uther too,
330. Wellnigh to blackness; but this King is fair
331. Beyond the race of Britons and of men.
332. Moreover, always in my mind I hear
333. A cry from out the dawning of my life,
334. A mother weeping, and I hear her say,
335. "O that ye had some brother, pretty one,
336. To guard thee on the rough ways of the world."'

337. `Ay,' said the King, `and hear ye such a cry?
338. But when did Arthur chance upon thee first?'

339. `O King!' she cried, `and I will tell thee true:
340. He found me first when yet a little maid:
341. Beaten I had been for a little fault
342. Whereof I was not guilty; and out I ran
343. And flung myself down on a bank of heath,
344. And hated this fair world and all therein,
345. And wept, and wished that I were dead; and he--
346. I know not whether of himself he came,
347. Or brought by Merlin, who, they say, can walk
348. Unseen at pleasure--he was at my side,
349. And spake sweet words, and comforted my heart,
350. And dried my tears, being a child with me.
351. And many a time he came, and evermore
352. As I grew greater grew with me; and sad
353. At times he seemed, and sad with him was I,
354. Stern too at times, and then I loved him not,
355. But sweet again, and then I loved him well.
356. And now of late I see him less and less,
357. But those first days had golden hours for me,
358. For then I surely thought he would be king.

359. `But let me tell thee now another tale:
360. For Bleys, our Merlin's master, as they say,
361. Died but of late, and sent his cry to me,
362. To hear him speak before he left his life.
363. Shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage;
364. And when I entered told me that himself
365. And Merlin ever served about the King,
366. Uther, before he died; and on the night
367. When Uther in Tintagil past away
368. Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two
369. Left the still King, and passing forth to breathe,
370. Then from the castle gateway by the chasm
371. Descending through the dismal night--a night
372. In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost--
373. Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps
374. It seemed in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof
375. A dragon winged, and all from stern to stern
376. Bright with a shining people on the decks,
377. And gone as soon as seen.  And then the two
378. Dropt to the cove, and watched the great sea fall,
379. Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,
380. Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep
381. And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged
382. Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:
383. And down the wave and in the flame was borne
384. A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feet,
385. Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried "The King!
386. Here is an heir for Uther!"  And the fringe
387. Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,
388. Lashed at the wizard as he spake the word,
389. And all at once all round him rose in fire,
390. So that the child and he were clothed in fire.
391. And presently thereafter followed calm,
392. Free sky and stars:  "And this the same child," he said,
393. "Is he who reigns; nor could I part in peace
394. Till this were told."  And saying this the seer
395. Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death,
396. Not ever to be questioned any more
397. Save on the further side; but when I met
398. Merlin, and asked him if these things were truth--
399. The shining dragon and the naked child
400. Descending in the glory of the seas--
401. He laughed as is his wont, and answered me
402. In riddling triplets of old time, and said:

403. `"Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!
404. A young man will be wiser by and by;
405. An old man's wit may wander ere he die.
406. Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!
407. And truth is this to me, and that to thee;
408. And truth or clothed or naked let it be.
409. Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows:
410. Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?
411. From the great deep to the great deep he goes."

412. `So Merlin riddling angered me; but thou
413. Fear not to give this King thy only child,
414. Guinevere:  so great bards of him will sing
415. Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old
416. Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,
417. And echoed by old folk beside their fires
418. For comfort after their wage-work is done,
419. Speak of the King; and Merlin in our time
420. Hath spoken also, not in jest, and sworn
421. Though men may wound him that he will not die,
422. But pass, again to come; and then or now
423. Utterly smite the heathen underfoot,
424. Till these and all men hail him for their king.'

425. She spake and King Leodogran rejoiced,
426. But musing, `Shall I answer yea or nay?'
427. Doubted, and drowsed, nodded and slept, and saw,
428. Dreaming, a slope of land that ever grew,
429. Field after field, up to a height, the peak
430. Haze-hidden, and thereon a phantom king,
431. Now looming, and now lost; and on the slope
432. The sword rose, the hind fell, the herd was driven,
433. Fire glimpsed; and all the land from roof and rick,
434. In drifts of smoke before a rolling wind,
435. Streamed to the peak, and mingled with the haze
436. And made it thicker; while the phantom king
437. Sent out at times a voice; and here or there
438. Stood one who pointed toward the voice, the rest
439. Slew on and burnt, crying, `No king of ours,
440. No son of Uther, and no king of ours;'
441. Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze
442. Descended, and the solid earth became
443. As nothing, but the King stood out in heaven,
444. Crowned.  And Leodogran awoke, and sent
445. Ulfius, and Brastias and Bedivere,
446. Back to the court of Arthur answering yea.

447. Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved
448. And honoured most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth
449. And bring the Queen;--and watched him from the gates:
450. And Lancelot past away among the flowers,
451. (For then was latter April) and returned
452. Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.
453. To whom arrived, by Dubric the high saint,
454. Chief of the church in Britain, and before
455. The stateliest of her altar-shrines, the King
456. That morn was married, while in stainless white,
457. The fair beginners of a nobler time,
458. And glorying in their vows and him, his knights
459. Stood around him, and rejoicing in his joy.
460. Far shone the fields of May through open door,
461. The sacred altar blossomed white with May,
462. The Sun of May descended on their King,
463. They gazed on all earth's beauty in their Queen,
464. Rolled incense, and there past along the hymns
465. A voice as of the waters, while the two
466. Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:
467. And Arthur said, `Behold, thy doom is mine.
468. Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!'
469. To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,
470. `King and my lord, I love thee to the death!'
471. And holy Dubric spread his hands and spake,
472. `Reign ye, and live and love, and make the world
473. Other, and may thy Queen be one with thee,
474. And all this Order of thy Table Round
475. Fulfil the boundless purpose of their King!'

476. So Dubric said; but when they left the shrine
477. Great Lords from Rome before the portal stood,
478. In scornful stillness gazing as they past;
479. Then while they paced a city all on fire
480. With sun and cloth of gold, the trumpets blew,
481. And Arthur's knighthood sang before the King:--

482. `Blow, trumpet, for the world is white with May;
483. Blow trumpet, the long night hath rolled away!
484. Blow through the living world--"Let the King reign."

485. `Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur's realm?
486. Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm,
487. Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.

488. `Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard
489. That God hath told the King a secret word.
490. Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.

491. `Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust.
492. Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust!
493. Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.

494. `Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest,
495. The King is King, and ever wills the highest.
496. Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.

497. `Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May!
498. Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day!
499. Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.

500. `The King will follow Christ, and we the King
501. In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.
502. Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.'

503. So sang the knighthood, moving to their hall.
504. There at the banquet those great Lords from Rome,
505. The slowly-fading mistress of the world,
506. Strode in, and claimed their tribute as of yore.
507. But Arthur spake, `Behold, for these have sworn
508. To wage my wars, and worship me their King;
509. The old order changeth, yielding place to new;
510. And we that fight for our fair father Christ,
511. Seeing that ye be grown too weak and old
512. To drive the heathen from your Roman wall,
513. No tribute will we pay:' so those great lords
514. Drew back in wrath, and Arthur strove with Rome.

515. And Arthur and his knighthood for a space
516. Were all one will, and through that strength the King
517. Drew in the petty princedoms under him,
518. Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame
519. The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned.
