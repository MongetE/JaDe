1. The wish, that of the living whole
2. No life may fail beyond the grave,
3. Derives it not from what we have
4. The likest God within the soul?
5. Are God and Nature then at strife,
6. That Nature lends such evil dreams?
7. So careful of the type she seems,
8. So careless of the single life;
9. That I, considering everywhere
10. Her secret meaning in her deeds,
11. And finding that of fifty seeds
12. She often brings but one to bear,

13. I falter where I firmly trod,
14. And falling with my weight of cares
15. Upon the great world's altar-stairs
16. That slope thro' darkness up to God,

17. I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,
18. And gather dust and chaff, and call
19. To what I feel is Lord of all,
20. And faintly trust the larger hope.
