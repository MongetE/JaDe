1. Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,
2. Thy tribute wave deliver:
3. No more by thee my steps shall be,
4. For ever and for ever.
5. Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,
6. A rivulet then a river:
7. Nowhere by thee my steps shall be
8. For ever and for ever.
9. But here will sigh thine alder tree
10. And here thine aspen shiver;
11. And here by thee will hum the bee,
12. For ever and for ever.
13. A thousand suns will stream on thee,
14. A thousand moons will quiver;
15. But not by thee my steps shall be,
16. For ever and for ever.
