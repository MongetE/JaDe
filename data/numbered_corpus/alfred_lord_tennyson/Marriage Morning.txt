1. Light, so low upon earth,
2. You send a flash to the sun.
3. Here is the golden close of love,
4. All my wooing is done.
5. Oh, the woods and the meadows,
6. Woods where we hid from the wet,
7. Stiles where we stay'd to be kind,
8. Meadows in which we met!

9. Light, so low in the vale
10. You flash and lighten afar,
11. For this is the golden morning of love,
12. And you are his morning start.
13. Flash, I am coming, I come,
14. By meadow and stile and wood,
15. Oh, lighten into my eyes and heart,
16. Into my heart and my blood!

17. Heart, are you great enough
18. For a love that never tires?
19. O' heart, are you great enough for love?
20. I have heard of thorns and briers,
21. Over the meadow and stiles,
22. Over the world to the end of it
23. Flash for a million miles.
