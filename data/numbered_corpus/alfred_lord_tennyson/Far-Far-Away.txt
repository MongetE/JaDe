1. (For Music)

2. What sight so lured him thro' the fields he knew
3. As where earth's green stole into heaven's own hue,
4. Far-far-away?
5. What sound was dearest in his native dells?
6. The mellow lin-lan-lone of evening bells
7. Far-far-away.

8. What vague world-whisper, mystic pain or joy,
9. Thro' those three words would haunt him when a boy,
10. Far-far-away?
11. A whisper from his dawn of life? a breath
12. From some fair dawn beyond the doors of death
13. Far-far-away?
14. Far, far, how far? from o'er the gates of birth,
15. The faint horizons, all the bounds of earth,
16. Far-far-away?
17. What charm in words, a charm no words could give?
18. O dying words, can Music make you live
19. Far-far-away?
