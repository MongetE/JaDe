1. Where Claribel low-lieth
2. The breezes pause and die,
3. Letting the rose-leaves fall:
4. But the solemn oak-tree sigheth,
5. Thick-leaved, ambrosial,
6. With an ancient melody
7. Of an inward agony,
8. Where Claribel low-lieth.
9. At eve the beetle boometh
10. Athwart the thicket lone:
11. At noon the wild bee hummeth
12. About the moss'd headstone:
13. At midnight the moon cometh,
14. And looketh down alone.
15. Her song the lintwhite swelleth,
16. The clear-voiced mavis dwelleth,
17. The callow throstle lispeth,
18. The slumbrous wave outwelleth,
19. The babbling runnel crispeth,
20. The hollow grot replieth
21. Where Claribel low-lieth.
