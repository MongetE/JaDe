1. Ask me no more: the moon may draw the sea;
2. The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape,
3. With fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;
4. But O too fond, when have I answer'd thee?
5. Ask me no more.Ask me no more: what answer should I give?
6. I love not hollow cheek or faded eye:
7. Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!
8. Ask me no more, lest I should bid thee live;
9. Ask me no more.
10. Ask me no more: thy fate and mine are seal'd:
11. I strove against the stream and all in vain:
12. Let the great river take me to the main:
13. No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;
14. Ask me no more.
