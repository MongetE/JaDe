1. Oh, yet we trust that somehow good
2. Will be the final end of ill,
3. To pangs of nature, sins of will,
4. Defects of doubt, and taints of blood;
5. That nothing walks with aimless feet;
6. That not one life shall be destroy'd,
7. Or cast as rubbish to the void,
8. When God hath made the pile complete;
9. That not a worm is cloven in vain;
10. That not a moth with vain desire
11. I shrivell'd in a fruitless fire,
12. Or but subserves another's gain.

13. Behold, we know not anything;
14. I can but trust that good shall fall
15. At last--far off--at last, to all,
16. And every winter change to spring.

17. So runs my dream: but what am I?
18. An infant crying in the night:
19. An infant crying for the light:
20. And with no language but a cry.
