1. The wind, that beats the mountain, blows
2. More softly round the open wold,
3. And gently comes the world to those
4. That are cast in gentle mould.
5. And me this knowledge bolder made,
6. Or else I had not dare to flow
7. In these words toward you, and invade
8. Even with a verse your holy woe.
9. 'Tis strange that those we lean on most,
10. Those in whose laps our limbs are nursed,
11. Fall into shadow, soonest lost:
12. Those we love first are taken first.

13. God gives us love. Something to love
14. He lends us; but, when love is grown
15. To ripeness, that on which it throve
16. Falls off, and love is left alone.

17. This is the curse of time. Alas!
18. In grief I am not all unlearn'd;
19. Once thro' mine own doors Death did pass;
20. One went, who never hath return'd.

21. He will not smile--not speak to me
22. Once more. Two years his chair is seen
23. Empty before us. That was he
24. Without whose life I had not been.

25. Your loss is rarer; for this star
26. Rose with you thro' a little arc
27. Of heaven, nor having wander'd far
28. Shot on the sudden into dark.

29. I knew your brother: his mute dust
30. I honour and his living worth:
31. A man more pure and bold and just
32. Was never born into the earth.

33. I have not look'd upon you nigh,
34. Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep.
35. Great nature is more wise than I:
36. I will not tell you not to weep.

37. And tho' mine own eyes fill with dew,
38. Drawn from the spirit thro' the brain,
39. I will not even preach to you,
40. "Weep, weeping dulls the inward pain."

41. Let Grief be her own mistress still.
42. She loveth her own anguish deep
43. More than much pleasure. Let her will
44. Be done--to weep or not to weep.

45. I will not say "God's ordinance
46. Of death is blown in every wind;"
47. For that is not a common chance
48. That takes away a noble mind.

49. His memory long will live alone
50. In all our hearts, as mournful light
51. That broods above the fallen sun,
52. And dwells in heaven half the night.

53. Vain solace! Memory standing near
54. Cast down her eyes, and in her throat
55. Her voice seem'd distant, and a tear
56. Dropt on the letters as I wrote.

57. I wrote I know not what. In truth,
58. How should I soothe you anyway,
59. Who miss the brother of your youth?
60. Yet something I did wish to say:

61. For he too was a friend to me:
62. Both are my friends, and my true breast
63. Bleedeth for both: yet it may be
64. That only silence suiteth best.

65. Words weaker than your grief would make
66. Grief more. 'Twere better I should cease;
67. Although myself could almost take
68. The place of him that sleeps in peace.

69. Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace;
70. Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,
71. While the stars burn, the moons increase,
72. And the great ages onward roll.

73. Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet.
74. Nothing comes to thee new or strange,
75. Sleep full of rest from head to feet:
76. Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.
