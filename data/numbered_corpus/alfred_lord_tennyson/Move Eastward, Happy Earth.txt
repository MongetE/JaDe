1. Move eastward, happy earth, and leave
2. Yon orange sunset waning slow:
3. From fringes of the faded eve,
4. O, happy planet, eastward go:
5. Till over thy dark shoulder glow
6. Thy silver sister world, and rise
7. To glass herself in dewey eyes
8. That watch me from the glen below.

9. Ah, bear me with thee, lightly borne,
10. Dip forward under starry light,
11. And move me to my marriage-morn,
12. And round again to happy night.
