1. Dedication
2. These to His Memory--since he held them dear,
3. Perchance as finding there unconsciously
4. Some image of himself--I dedicate,
5. I dedicate, I consecrate with tears--
6. These Idylls.

7. And indeed He seems to me
8. Scarce other than my king's ideal knight,
9. `Who reverenced his conscience as his king;
10. Whose glory was, redressing human wrong;
11. Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it;
12. Who loved one only and who clave to her--'
13. Her--over all whose realms to their last isle,
14. Commingled with the gloom of imminent war,
15. The shadow of His loss drew like eclipse,
16. Darkening the world.  We have lost him:  he is gone:
17. We know him now:  all narrow jealousies
18. Are silent; and we see him as he moved,
19. How modest, kindly, all-accomplished, wise,
20. With what sublime repression of himself,
21. And in what limits, and how tenderly;
22. Not swaying to this faction or to that;
23. Not making his high place the lawless perch
24. Of winged ambitions, nor a vantage-ground
25. For pleasure; but through all this tract of years
26. Wearing the white flower of a blameless life,
27. Before a thousand peering littlenesses,
28. In that fierce light which beats upon a throne,
29. And blackens every blot:  for where is he,
30. Who dares foreshadow for an only son
31. A lovelier life, a more unstained, than his?
32. Or how should England dreaming of HIS sons
33. Hope more for these than some inheritance
34. Of such a life, a heart, a mind as thine,
35. Thou noble Father of her Kings to be,
36. Laborious for her people and her poor--
37. Voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day--
38. Far-sighted summoner of War and Waste
39. To fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace--
40. Sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam
41. Of letters, dear to Science, dear to Art,
42. Dear to thy land and ours, a Prince indeed,
43. Beyond all titles, and a household name,
44. Hereafter, through all times, Albert the Good.

45. Break not, O woman's-heart, but still endure;
46. Break not, for thou art Royal, but endure,
47. Remembering all the beauty of that star
48. Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made
49. One light together, but has past and leaves
50. The Crown a lonely splendour.

51. May all love,
52. His love, unseen but felt, o'ershadow Thee,
53. The love of all Thy sons encompass Thee,
54. The love of all Thy daughters cherish Thee,
55. The love of all Thy people comfort Thee,
56. Till God's love set Thee at his side again!
