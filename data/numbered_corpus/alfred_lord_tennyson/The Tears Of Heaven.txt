1. Heaven weeps above the earth all night till morn,
2. In darkness weeps, as all ashamed to weep,
3. Because the earth hath made her state forlorn
4. With selfwrought evils of unnumbered years,
5. And doth the fruit of her dishonour reap.
6. And all the day heaven gathers back her tears
7. Into her own blue eyes so clear and deep,
8. And showering down the glory of lightsome day,
9. Smiles on the earth's worn brow to win her if she may.
