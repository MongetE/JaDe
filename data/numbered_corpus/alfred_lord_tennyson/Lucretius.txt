1. Lucilla, wedded to Lucretius, found
2. Her master cold; for when the morning flush
3. Of passion and the first embrace had died
4. Between them, tho' he loved her none the less,
5. Yet often when the woman heard his foot
6. Return from pacings in the field, and ran
7. To greet him with a kiss, the master took
8. Small notice, or austerely, for his mind
9. Half buried in some weightier argument,
10. Or fancy-borne perhaps upon the rise
11. And long roll of the hexameter -- he past
12. To turn and ponder those three hundred scrolls
13. Left by the Teacher, whom he held divine.
14. She brook'd it not, but wrathful, petulant
15. Dreaming some rival, sought and found a witch
16. Who brew'd the philtre which had power, they said
17. To lead an errant passion home again.
18. And this, at times, she mingled with his drink,
19. And this destroy'd him; for the wicked broth
20. Confused the chemic labor of the blood,
21. And tickling the brute brain within the man's
22. Made havoc among those tender cells, and check'd
23. His power to shape. He loathed himself, and once
24. After a tempest woke upon a morn
25. That mock'd him with returning calm, and cried:

26. "Storm in the night! for thrice I heard the rain
27. Rushing; and once the flash of a thunderbolt --
28. Methought I never saw so fierce a fork --
29. Struck out the streaming mountain-side, and show'd
30. A riotous confluence of watercourses
31. Blanching and billowing in a hollow of it,
32. Where all but yester-eve was dusty-dry.

33. "Storm, and what dreams, ye holy Gods, what dreams!
34. For thrice I waken'd after dreams. Perchance
35. We do but recollect the dreams that come
36. Just ere the waking. Terrible: for it seem'd
37. A void was made in Nature, all her bonds
38. Crack'd; and I saw the flaring atom-streams
39. And torrents of her myriad universe,
40. Ruining along the illimitable inane,
41. Fly on to clash together again, and make
42. Another and another frame of things
43. For ever. That was mine, my dream, I knew it --
44. Of and belonging to me, as the dog
45. With inward yelp and restless forefoot plies
46. His function of the woodland; but the next!
47. I thought that all the blood by Sylla shed
48. Came driving rainlike down again on earth,
49. And where it dash'd the reddening meadow, sprang
50. No dragon warriors from Cadmean teeth,
51. For these I thought my dream would show to me,
52. But girls, Hetairai, curious in their art,
53. Hired animalisms, vile as those that made
54. The mulberry-faced Dictator's orgies worse
55. Than aught they fable of the quiet Gods.
56. And hands they mixt, and yell'd and round me drove
57. In narrowing circles till I yell'd again
58. Half-suffocated, and sprang up, and saw --
59. Was it the first beam of my latest day?

60. "Then, then, from utter gloom stood out the
61. The breasts of Helen, and hoveringly a sword
62. Now over and now under, now direct,
63. Pointed itself to pierce, but sank down shamed
64. At all that beauty; and as I stared, a fire,
65. The fire that left a roofless Ilion,
66. Shot out of them, and scorch'd me that I woke.

67. "Is this thy vengeance, holy Venus, thine,
68. Because I would not one of thine own doves,
69. Not even a rose, were offered to thee? thine,
70. Forgetful how my rich proemion makes
71. Thy glory fly along the Italian field,
72. In lays that will outlast thy deity?

73. "Deity? nay, thy worshippers. My tongue
74. Trips, or I speak profanely. Which of these
75. Angers thee most, or angers thee at all?
76. Not if thou be'st of those who, far aloof
77. From envy, hate and pity, and spite and scorn,
78. Live the great life which all our greatest fain
79. Would follow, centred in eternal calm.

80. "Nay, if thou canst,
81. Goddess, like ourselves
82. Touch, and be touch'd, then would I cry to thee
83. To kiss thy Mavors, roll thy tender arms
84. Round him, and keep him from the lust of blood
85. That makes a steaming slaughter-house of Rome.

86. "Ay, but I meant not thee; I meant riot her
87. Whom all the pines of Ida shook to see
88. Slide from that quiet heaven of hers, and tempt
89. The Trojan, while his neatherds were abroad
90. Nor her that o'er her wounded hunter wept
91. Her deity false in human-amorous tears;
92. Nor whom her beardless apple-arbiter
93. Decided fairest. Rather, O ye Gods,
94. Poet-like, as the great Sicilian called
95. Calliope to grace his golden verse --
96. Ay, and this Kypris also -- did I take
97. That popular name of thine to shadow forth
98. The all-generating powers and genial heat
99. Of Nature, when she strikes thro' the thick blood
100. Of cattle, and light is large, and lambs are glad
101. Nosing the mother's udder, and the bird
102. Makes his heart voice amid the blaze of flowers;
103. Which things appear the work of mighty Gods.

104. "The Gods! and if I go my work is left
105. Unfinish'd -- if I go. The Gods, who haunt
106. The lucid interspace of world and world,
107. Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,
108. Nor ever falls the least white star of mow
109. Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,
110. Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar
111. Their sacred everlasting calm! and such,
112. Not all so fine, nor so divine a calm
113. Not such, nor all unlike it, man may gain
114. Letting his own life go. The Gods, the Godsl
115. If all be atoms, how then should the Gods
116. Being atomic not be dissoluble,
117. Not follow the great law? My master held
118. That Gods there are, for all men so believe.
119. I prest my footsteps into his, and meant
120. Surely to lead my Memmius in a train
121. Of fiowery clauses onward to the proof
122. That Gods there are, and deathless. Meant? I meant?
123. I have forgotten what I meant, my mind
124. Stumbles, and all my faculties are lamed.

125. "Look where another of our Gods, the Sun
126. Apollo, Delius, or of older use
127. All-seeing Hyperion -- what you will --
128. Has mounted yonder; since he never sware,
129. Except his wrath were wreak'd on wretched man,
130. That he would only shine among the dead
131. Hereafter -- tales! for never yet on earth
132. Could dead flesh creep, or bits of roasting ox
133. Moan round the spit -- nor knows he what he sees;
134. King of the East altho' he seem, and girt
135. With song and flame and fragrance, slowly lifts
136. His golden feet on those empurpled stairs
137. That climb into the windy halls of heaven
138. And here he glances on an eye new-born,
139. And gets for greeting but a wail of pain;
140. And here he stays upon a freezing orb
141. That fain would gaze upon him to the last;
142. And here upon a yellow eyelid fallen
143. And closed by those who mourn a friend in vain,
144. Not thankful that his troubles are no more.
145. And me, altho' his fire is on my face
146. Blinding, he sees not, nor at all can tell
147. Whether I mean this day to end myself.
148. Or lend an ear to Plato where he says,
149. That men like soldiers may not quit the post
150. Allotted by the Gods. But he that holds
151. The Gods are careless, wherefore need he care
152. Greatly for them, nor rather plunge at once,
153. Being troubled, wholly out of sight, and sink
154. Past earthquake -- ay, and gout and stone, that break
155. Body toward death, and palsy, death-in-life,
156. And wretched age -- and worst disease of all,
157. These prodigies of myriad nakednesses,
158. And twisted shapes of lust, unspeakable,
159. Abominable, strangers at my hearth
160. Not welcome, harpies miring every dish,
161. The phantom husks of something foully done,
162. And fleeting thro' the boundless universe,
163. And blasting the long quiet of my breast
164. With animal heat and dire insanity?

165. "How should the mind, except it loved them, clasp
166. These idols to herself? or do they fly
167. Now thinner, and now thicker, like the flakes
168. In a fall of snow, and so press in, perforce
169. Of multitude, as crowds that in an hour
170. Of civic tumult jam the doors, and bear
171. The keepers down, and throng, their rags and the
172. The basest, far into that council-hall
173. Where sit the best and stateliest of the land?

174. Â³Can I not fling this horror off me again,
175. Seeing with how great ease Nature can smile
176. Balmier and nobler from her bath of storm,
177. At random ravage? and how easily
178. The mountain there has cast his cloudy slough,
179. Now towering o'er him in serenest air,
180. A mountain o'er a mountain, -- ay, and within
181. All hollow as the hopes and fears of men?

182. "But who was he that in the garden snared
183. Picus and Faunus, rustic Gods? a tale
184. To laugh at -- more to laugh at in myself --
185. For look! what is it? there? yon arbutus
186. Totters; a noiseless riot underneath
187. Strikes through the wood, sets all the tops quivering -- ;
188. The mountain quickens into Nymph and Faun,
189. And here an Oread -- how the sun delights
190. To glance and shift about her slippery sides,
191. And rosy knees and supple roundedness,
192. And budded bosom-peaks -- who this way runs
193. Before the rest! -- a satyr, a satyr, see,
194. Follows; but him I proved impossible
195. Twy-natured is no nature. Yet he draws
196. Nearer and nearer, and I scan him now
197. Beastlier than any phantom of his kind
198. That ever butted his rough brother-brute
199. For lust or lusty blood or provender.
200. I hate, abhor, spit, sicken at him; and she
201. Loathes him as well; such a precipitate heel,
202. Fledged as it were with Mercury's ankle-wing,
203. Whirls her to me -- ;but will she fling herself
204. Shameless upon me? Catch her, goatfoot! nay,
205. Hide, hide them, million-myrtled wilderness,

206. And cavern-shadowing laurels, hide! do I wish --
207. What? -- ;that the bush were leafless? or to whelm
208. All of them in one massacre? O ye Gods
209. I know you careless, yet, behold, to you
210. From childly wont and ancient use I call --
211. I thought I lived securely as yourselves --
212. No lewdness, narrowing envy, monkey-spite,
213. No madness of ambition, avarice, none;
214. No larger feast than under plane or pine
215. With neighbors laid along the grass, to take
216. Only such cups as left us friendly-warm,
217. Affirming each his own philosophy
218. Nothing to mar the sober majesties
219. Of settled, sweet, Epicurean life.
220. But now it seems some unseen monster lays
221. His vast and filthy hands upon my will,
222. Wrenching it backward into his, and spoils
223. My bliss in being; and it was not great,
224. For save when shutting reasons up in rhythm,
225. Or Heliconian honey in living words,
226. To make a truth less harsh, I often grew
227. Tired of so much within our little life
228. Or of so little in our little life --
229. Poor little life that toddles half an hour
230. Crown'd with a flower or two, and there an end --
231. And since the nobler pleasure seems to fade,
232. Why should I, beastlike as I find myself,
233. Not manlike end myself? -- our privilege -- ;
234. What beast has heart to do it? And what man
235. What Roman would be dragg'd in triumph thus?
236. Not I; not he, who bears one name with her
237. Whose death-blow struck the dateless doom of kings,
238. When, brooking not the Tarquin in her veins,
239. She made her blood in sight of Collatine
240. And all his peers, flushing the guiltless air,
241. Spout from the maiden fountain in her heart.
242. And from it sprang the Commonwealth, which breaks
243. As I am breaking now!

244. "And therefore now
245. Let her, that is the womb and tomb of all
246. Great Nature, take, and forcing far apart
247. Those blind beginnings that have made me man,
248. Dash them anew together at her will
249. Thro' all her cycles -- into man once more,
250. Or beast or bird or fish, or opulent flower.
251. But till this cosmic order everywhere
252. Shatter'd into one earthquake m one day
253. Cracks all to pieces, -- and that hour perhaps
254. Is not so far when momentary man
255. Shall seem no more a something to himself,
256. But he, his hopes and hates, his homes and fanes
257. And even his bones long laid within the grave,
258. The very sides of the grave itself shall pass,
259. Vanishing, atom and void, atom and void,
260. Into the unseen for ever, -- till that hour,
261. My golden work in which I told a truth
262. That stays the rolling Ixionian wheel,
263. And numbs the Fury's ringlet-snake, and plucks
264. The mortal soul from out immortal hell
265. Shall stand. Ay, surely; then it fails at last
266. And perishes as I must, for O Thou
267. Passionless bride, divine Tranquillity,
268. Yearn'd after by the wisest of the wise
269. Who fail to find thee, being as thou art
270. Without one pleasure and without one pain,
271. Howbeit I know thou surely must be mine
272. Or soon or late, yet out of season, thus
273. I woo thee roughly, for thou carest not
274. How roughly men may woo thee so they win -- ;
275. Thus -- thus -- the soul flies out and dies in the air

276. With that he drove the knife into his side.
277. She heard him raging, heard him fall, ran in,
278. Beat breast, tore hair, cried out upon herself
279. As having fail'd in duty to him, shriek'd
280. That she but meant to win him back, fell on him
281. Clasp'd, kiss'd him, wail'd. He answer'd, "Care not thou!
282. Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well!"
