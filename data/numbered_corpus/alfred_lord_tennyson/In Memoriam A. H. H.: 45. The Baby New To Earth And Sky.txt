1. The baby new to earth and sky,
2. What time his tender palm is prest
3. Against the circle of the breast,
4. Has never thought that "this is I":
5. But as he grows he gathers much,
6. And learns the use of "I," and "me,"
7. And finds "I am not what I see,
8. And other than the things I touch."
9. So rounds he to a separate mind
10. From whence clear memory may begin,
11. As thro' the frame that binds him in
12. His isolation grows defined.

13. This use may lie in blood and breath
14. Which else were fruitless of their due,
15. Had man to learn himself anew
16. Beyond the second birth of Death.
