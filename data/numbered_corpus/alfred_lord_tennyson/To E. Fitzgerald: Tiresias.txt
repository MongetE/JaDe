1. OLD FITZ, who from your suburb grange,
2. Where once I tarried for a while,
3. Glance at the wheeling orb of change,
4. And greet it with a kindly smile;
5. Whom yet I see as there you sit
6. Beneath your sheltering garden-tree,
7. And watch your doves about you flit,
8. And plant on shoulder, hand, and knee,
9. Or on your head their rosy feet,
10. As if they knew your diet spares
11. Whatever moved in that full sheet
12. Let down to Peter at his prayers;
13. Who live on milk and meal and grass;
14. And once for ten long weeks I tried
15. Your table of Pythagoras,
16. - And seem'd at first "a thing enskied,"
17. As Shakespeare has it, airy-light
18. To float above the ways of men,
19. Then fell from that half-spiritual height
20. Chill'd, till I tasted flesh again
21. One night when earth was winter-b]ack,
22. And all the heavens flash'd in frost;
23. And on me, half-asleep, came back
24. That wholesome heat the blood had lost,
25. And set me climbing icy capes
26. And glaciers, over which there roll'd
27. To meet me long-arm'd vines with grapes
28. Of Eshcol hugeness- for the cold
29. Without, and warmth within me, wrought
30. To mould the dream; but none can say
31. That Lenten fare makes Lenten thought
32. Who reads your golden Eastern lay,
33. Than which I know no version done
34. In English more divinely well;
35. A planet equal to the sun
36. Which cast it, that large infidel
37. Your Omar, and your Omar drew
38. Full-handed plaudits from our best
39. In modern letters, and from two,
40. Old friends outvaluing all the rest,
41. Two voices heard on earth no more;
42. But we old friends are still alive,
43. And I am nearing seventy-four,
44. While you have touch'd at seventy-five,
45. And so I send a birthday line
46. Of greeting; and my son, who dipt
47. In some forgotten book of mine
48. With sallow scraps of manuscript,
49. And dating many a year ago,
50. Has hit on this, which you will take,
51. My Fitz, and welcome, as I know,
52. Less for its own than for the sake
53. Of one recalling gracious times,
54. When, in our younger London days,
55. You found some merit in my rhymes,
56. And I more pleasure in your praise.

57. TIRESIAS

58. I WISH I were as in the years of old
59. While yet the blessed daylight made itself
60. Ruddy thro' both the roofs of sight, and woke
61. These eyes, now dull, but then so keen to seek
62. The meanings ambush'd under all they saw,
63. The flight of birds, the flame of sacrifice,
64. What omens may foreshadow fate to man
65. And woman, and the secret of the Gods.
66. My son, the Gods, despite of human prayer,
67. Are slower to forgive than human kings.
68. The great God Ares burns in anger still

69. Against the guiltless heirs of him from Tyre
70. Our Cadmus, out of whom thou art, who found
71. Beside the springs of Dirce, smote, and still'd
72. Thro' all its folds the multitudinous beast
73. The dragon, which our trembling fathers call'd
74. The God's own son.
75. A tale, that told to me,
76. When but thine age, by age as winter-white
77. As mine is now, amazed, but made me yearn
78. For larger glimpses of that more than man
79. Which rolls the heavens, and lifts and lays the deep,
80. Yet loves and hates with mortal hates and loves,
81. And moves unseen among the ways of men.
82. Then, in my wanderings all the lands that lie
83. Subjected to the Heliconian ridge
84. Have heard this footstep fall, altho' my wont
85. Was more to scale the highest of the heights
86. With some strange hope to see the nearer God.
87. One naked peak‹the sister of the Sun
88. Would climb from out the dark, and linger there


89. To silver all the valleys with her shafts‹
90. There once, but long ago, five-fold thy term
91. Of years, I lay; the winds were dead for heat-
92. The noonday crag made the hand burn; and sick
93. For shadow‹not one bush was near‹I rose
94. Following a torrent till its myriad falls
95. Found silence in the hollows underneath.
96. There in a secret olive-glade I saw
97. Pallas Athene climbing from the bath
98. In anger; yet one glittering foot disturb'd
99. The lucid well; one snowy knee was prest
100. Against the margin flowers; a dreadful light
101. Came from her golden hair, her golden helm
102. And all her golden armor on the grass,
103. And from her virgin breast, and virgin eyes
104. Remaining fixt on mine, till mine grew dark
105. For ever, and I heard a voice that said
106. "Henceforth be blind, for thou hast seen too much,
107. And speak the truth that no man may believe."
108. Son, in the hidden world of sight that lives
109. Behind this darkness, I behold her still
110. Beyond all work of those who carve the stone
111. Beyond all dreams of Godlike womanhood,
112. Ineffable beauty, out of whom, at a glance
113. And as it were, perforce, upon me flash'd
114. The power of prophesying‹but to me
115. No power so chain'd and coupled with the curse
116. Of blindness and their unbelief who heard
117. And heard not, when I spake of famine, plague
118. Shrine-shattering earthquake, fire, flood, thunderbolt,
119. And angers of the Gods for evil done
120. And expiation lack'd‹no power on Fate
121. Theirs, or mine own! for when the crowd would roar
122. For blood, for war, whose issue was their doom,
123. To cast wise words among the multitude
124. Was fiinging fruit to lions; nor, in hours
125. Of civil outbreak, when I knew the twain
126. Would each waste each, and bring on both the yoke
127. Of stronger states, was mine the voice to curb
128. The madness of our cities and their kings.
129. Who ever turn'd upon his heel to hear
130. My warning that the tyranny of one
131. Was prelude to the tyranny of all?
132. My counsel that the tyranny of all
133. Led backward to the tyranny of one?
134. This power hath work'd no good to aught that lives
135. And these blind hands were useless in their wars.
136. O. therefore, that the unfulfill'd desire,
137. The grief for ever born from griefs to be
138. The boundless yearning of the prophet's heart‹
139. Could that stand forth, and like a statue, rear'd
140. To some great citizen, wim all praise from all
141. Who past it, saying, "That was he!"
142. In vain!
143. Virtue must shape itself im deed, and those
144. Whom weakness or necessity have cramp'd
145. Withm themselves, immerging, each, his urn
146. In his own well, draws solace as he may.
147. Menceceus, thou hast eyes, and I can hear
148. Too plainly what full tides of onset sap
149. Our seven high gates, and what a weight of war
150. Rides on those ringing axlesl jingle of bits,
151. Shouts, arrows, tramp of the horn-footed horse
152. That grind the glebe to powder! Stony showers
153. Of that ear-stunning hail of Ares crash
154. Along the sounding walls. Above, below
155. Shock after shock, the song-built towers and gates
156. Reel, bruised and butted with the shuddering
157. War-thunder of iron rams; and from within
158. The city comes a murmur void of joy,
159. Lest she be taken captive‹maidens, wives,
160. And mothers with their babblers of the dawn,
161. And oldest age in shadow from the night,
162. Falling about their shrines before their Gods,
163. And wailing, "Save us."

164. And they wail to thee!
165. These eyeless eyes, that cannot see thine own,
166. See this, that only in thy virtue lies
167. The saving of our Thebes; for, yesternight,
168. To me, the great God Ares, whose one bliss
169. Is war and human sacrifice‹himself
170. Blood-red from battle, spear and helmet tipt
171. With stormy light as on a mast at sea,
172. Stood out before a darkness, crying, "Thebes,
173. Thy Thebes shall fall and perish, for I loathe
174. The seed of Cadmus‹yet if one of these
175. By his own hand‹if one of these‹"
176. My son, No sound is breathed so potent to coerce,
177. And to conciliate, as their names who dare
178. For that sweet mother land which gave them birth
179. Nobly to do, nobly to die. Their names,
180. Graven on memorial columns, are a song
181. Heard in the future; few, but more than wall
182. And rampart, their examples reach a hand
183. Far thro' all years, and everywhere they meet
184. And kindle generous purpose, and the strength
185. To mould it into action pure as theirs.
186. Fairer thy fate than mine, if life's best end
187. Be to end well! and thou refusing this,
188. Unvenerable will thy memory be
189. While men shall move the lips; but if thou dare‹
190. Thou, one of these, the race of Cadmus‹then
191. No stone is fitted in yon marble girth
192. Whose echo shall not tongue thy glorious doom,
193. Nor in this pavement but shall ring thy name
194. To every hoof that clangs it, and the springs
195. Of Dirce laving yonder battle-plain,
196. Heard from the roofs by night, will murmur thee
197. To thine own Thebes, while Thebes thro' thee shall stand
198. Firm-based with all her Gods.
199. The Dragon's cave
200. Half hid, they tell me, now in flowing vines‹
201. Where once he dwelt and whence he roll'd himself
202. At dead of night‹thou knowest, and that smooth rock
203. Before it, altar-fashion'd, where of late
204. The woman-breasted Sphinx, with wings drawn back
205. Folded her lion paws, and look'd to Thebes.
206. There blanch the bones of whom she slew, and these
207. Mixt with her own, because the fierce beast found
208. A wiser than herself, and dash'd herself
209. Dead in her rage; but thou art wise enough
210. Tho' young, to love thy wiser, blunt the curse
211. Of Pallas, bear, and tho' I speak the truth
212. Believe I speak it, let thine own hand strike
213. Thy youthful pulses into rest and quench
214. The red God's anger, fearing not to plunge
215. Thy torch of life in darkness, rather thou
216. Rejoicing that the sun, the moon, the stars
217. Send no such light upon the ways of men
218. As one great deed.
219. Thither, my son, and there
220. Thou, that hast never known the embrace of love
221. Offer thy maiden life.
222. This useless hand!
223. I felt one warm tear fall upon it. Gone!
224. He will achieve his greatness.
225. But for me I would that I were gather'd to my rest,
226. And mingled with the famous kings of old
227. On whom about their ocean-islets flash
228. The faces of the Gods‹the wise man's word
229. Here trampled by the populace underfoot
230. There crown'd with worship and these eyes will find
231. The men I knew, and watch the chariot whirl
232. About the goal again, and hunters race
233. The shadowy lion, and the warrior-kings
234. In height and prowess more than human, strive
235. Again for glory, while the golden lyre
236. Is ever sounding in heroic ears
237. Heroic hymns, and every way the vales
238. Wind, clouded with the grateful incense-fume
239. Of those who mix all odor to the Gods
240. On one far height in one far-shining fire.

241. -------------------------

242. "One height and one far-shining fire!"
243. And while I fancied that my friend
244. For this brief idyll would require
245. A less diffuse and opulent end,
246. And would defend his judgment well,
247. If I should deem it over nice‹
248. The tolling of his funeral bell
249. Broke on my Pagan Paradise,
250. And mixt the dream of classic times,
251. And all the phantoms of the dream,
252. With present grief, and made the rhymes,
253. That miss'd his living welcome, seem
254. Like would-be guests an hour too late,
255. Who down the highway moving on
256. With easy laughter find the gate
257. Is bolted, and the master gone.
258. Gone onto darkness, that full light
259. Of friendship! past, in sleep, away
260. By night, into the deeper night!
261. The deeper night? A clearer day
262. Than our poor twilight dawn on earth‹
263. If night, what barren toil to be!
264. What life, so maim'd by night, were worth
265. Our living out? Not mine to me
266. Remembering all the golden hours
267. Now silent, and so many dead,
268. And him the last; and laying flowers,
269. This wreath, above his honor'd head,
270. And praying that, when I from hence
271. Shall fade with him into the unknown,
272. My close of earth's experience
273. May prove as peaceful as his own.
