1. First pledge our Queen this solemn night,
2. Then drink to England, every guest;
3. That man’s the best Cosmopolite
4. Who loves his native country best.
5. May freedom’s oak for ever live
6. With stronger life from day to day;
7. That man’s the true Conservative
8. Who lops the moulder’d branch away.
9. Hands all round!
10. God the traitor’s hope confound!
11. To this great cause of Freedom drink, my friends,
12. And the great name of England, round and round.
13. To all the loyal hearts who long
14. To keep our English Empire whole!
15. To all our noble sons, the strong
16. New England of the Southern Pole!
17. To England under Indian skies,
18. To those dark millions of her realm!
19. To Canada whom we love and prize,
20. Whatever statesman hold the helm.
21. Hands all round!
22. God the traitor’s hope confound!
23. To this great name of England drink, my friends,
24. And all her glorious empire, round and round.

25. To all our statesmen so they be
26. True leaders of the land’s desire!
27. To both our Houses, may they see
28. Beyond the borough and the shire!
29. We sail’d wherever ship could sail,
30. We founded many a mighty state;
31. Pray God our greatness may not fail
32. Thro’ craven fears of being great.
33. Hands all round!
34. God the traitor’s hope confound!
35. To this great cause of Freedom drink my friends,
36. And the great name of England, round and round.
