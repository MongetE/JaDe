1. O mighty-mouth'd inventor of harmonies,
2. O skill'd to sing of Time or Eternity,
3. God-gifted organ-voice of England,
4. Milton, a name to resound for ages;
5. Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel,
6. Starr'd from Jehovah's gorgeous armouries,
7. Tower, as the deep-domed empyrean
8. Rings to the roar of an angel onset--
9. Me rather all that bowery loneliness,
10. The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring,
11. And bloom profuse and cedar arches
12. Charm, as a wanderer out in ocean,
13. Where some refulgent sunset of India
14. Streams o'er a rich ambrosial ocean isle,
15. And crimson-hued the stately palm-woods
16. Whisper in odorous heights of even.
