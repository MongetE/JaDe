1. Below the thunders of the upper deep,
2. Far far beneath in the abysmal sea,
3. His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep
4. The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee
5. About his shadowy sides: above him swell
6. Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;
7. And far away into the sickly light,
8. From many a wondrous grot and secret cell
9. Unnumbered and enormous polypi
10. Winnow with giant fins the slumbering green.
11. There hath he lain for ages and will lie
12. Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,
13. Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;
14. Then once by men and angels to be seen,
15. In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.
