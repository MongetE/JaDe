1. Now fades the last long streak of snow,
2. Now burgeons every maze of quick
3. About the flowering squares, and thick
4. By ashen roots the violets blow.

5. Now rings the woodland loud and long,
6. The distance takes a lovelier hue,
7. And drowned in yonder living blue
8. The lark becomes a sightless song.

9. Now dance the lights on lawn and lea,
10. The flocks are whiter down the vale,
11. And milkier every milky sail,
12. On winding stream or distant sea;

13. Where now the seamew pipes, or dives
14. In yonder greening gleam, and fly
15. The happy birds, that change their sky
16. To build and brood, that live their lives

17. From land to land; and in my breast
18. Spring wakens too: and my regret
19. Become an April violet,
20. And buds and blossoms like the rest.
