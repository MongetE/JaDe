1. Calm is the morn without a sound,
2. Calm as to suit a calmer grief,
3. And only thro' the faded leaf
4. The chestnut pattering to the ground:
5. Calm and deep peace on this high wold,
6. And on these dews that drench the furze.
7. And all the silvery gossamers
8. That twinkle into green and gold:
9. Calm and still light on yon great plain
10. That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,
11. And crowded farms and lessening towers,
12. To mingle with the bounding main:

13. Calm and deep peace in this wide air,
14. These leaves that redden to the fall;
15. And in my heart, if calm at all,
16. If any calm, a calm despair:

17. Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,
18. And waves that sway themselves in rest,
19. And dead calm in that noble breast
20. Which heaves but with the heaving deep.
