1. O true and tried, so well and long,
2. Demand not thou a marriage lay;
3. In that it is thy marriage day
4. Is music more than any song.
5. Nor have I felt so much of bliss
6. Since first he told me that he loved
7. A daughter of our house; nor proved
8. Since that dark day a day like this;

9. Tho’ I since then have number’d o’er
10. Some thrice three years: they went and came,
11. Remade the blood and changed the frame,
12. And yet is love not less, but more;

13. No longer caring to embalm
14. In dying songs a dead regret,
15. But like a statue solid-set,
16. And moulded in colossal calm.

17. Regret is dead, but love is more
18. Than in the summers that are flown,
19. For I myself with these have grown
20. To something greater than before;

21. Which makes appear the songs I made
22. As echoes out of weaker times,
23. As half but idle brawling rhymes,
24. The sport of random sun and shade.

25. But where is she, the bridal flower,
26. That must he made a wife ere noon?
27. She enters, glowing like the moon
28. Of Eden on its bridal bower:

29. On me she bends her blissful eyes
30. And then on thee; they meet thy look
31. And brighten like the star that shook
32. Betwixt the palms of paradise.

33. O when her life was yet in bud,
34. He too foretold the perfect rose.
35. For thee she grew, for thee she grows
36. For ever, and as fair as good.

37. And thou art worthy; full of power;
38. As gentle; liberal-minded, great,
39. Consistent; wearing all that weight
40. Of learning lightly like a flower.

41. But now set out: the noon is near,
42. And I must give away the bride;
43. She fears not, or with thee beside
44. And me behind her, will not fear.

45. For I that danced her on my knee,
46. That watch’d her on her nurse’s arm,
47. That shielded all her life from harm
48. At last must part with her to thee;

49. Now waiting to be made a wife,
50. Her feet, my darling, on the dead;
51. Their pensive tablets round her head,
52. And the most living words of life

53. Breathed in her ear. The ring is on,
54. The ‘wilt thou’ answer’d, and again
55. The ‘wilt thou’ ask’d, till out of twain
56. Her sweet ‘I will’ has made you one.

57. Now sign your names, which shall be read,
58. Mute symbols of a joyful morn,
59. By village eyes as yet unborn;
60. The names are sign’d, and overhead

61. Begins the clash and clang that tells
62. The joy to every wandering breeze;
63. The blind wall rocks, and on the trees
64. The dead leaf trembles to the bells.

65. O happy hour, and happier hours
66. Await them. Many a merry face
67. Salutes them–maidens of the place,
68. That pelt us in the porch with flowers.

69. O happy hour, behold the bride
70. With him to whom her hand I gave.
71. They leave the porch, they pass the grave
72. That has to-day its sunny side.

73. To-day the grave is bright for me,
74. For them the light of life increased,
75. Who stay to share the morning feast,
76. Who rest to-night beside the sea.

77. Let all my genial spirits advance
78. To meet and greet a whiter sun;
79. My drooping memory will not shun
80. The foaming grape of eastern France.

81. It circles round, and fancy plays,
82. And hearts are warm’d and faces bloom,
83. As drinking health to bride and groom
84. We wish them store of happy days.

85. Nor count me all to blame if I
86. Conjecture of a stiller guest,
87. Perchance, perchance, among the rest,
88. And, tho’ in silence, wishing joy.

89. But they must go, the time draws on,
90. And those white-favour’d horses wait;
91. They rise, but linger; it is late;
92. Farewell, we kiss, and they are gone.

93. A shade falls on us like the dark
94. From little cloudlets on the grass,
95. But sweeps away as out we pass
96. To range the woods, to roam the park,

97. Discussing how their courtship grew,
98. And talk of others that are wed,
99. And how she look’d, and what he said,
100. And back we come at fall of dew.

101. Again the feast, the speech, the glee,
102. The shade of passing thought, the wealth
103. Of words and wit, the double health,
104. The crowning cup, the three-times-three,

105. And last the dance;–till I retire:
106. Dumb is that tower which spake so loud,
107. And high in heaven the streaming cloud,
108. And on the downs a rising fire:

109. And rise, O moon, from yonder down,
110. Till over down and over dale
111. All night the shining vapour sail
112. And pass the silent-lighted town,

113. The white-faced halls, the glancing rills,
114. And catch at every mountain head,
115. And o’er the friths that branch and spread
116. Their sleeping silver thro’ the hills;

117. And touch with shade the bridal doors,
118. With tender gloom the roof, the wall;
119. And breaking let the splendour fall
120. To spangle all the happy shores

121. By which they rest, and ocean sounds,
122. And, star and system rolling past,
123. A soul shall draw from out the vast
124. And strike his being into bounds,

125. And, moved thro’ life of lower phase,
126. Result in man, be born and think,
127. And act and love, a closer link
128. Betwixt us and the crowning race

129. Of those that, eye to eye, shall look
130. On knowledge; under whose command
131. Is Earth and Earth’s, and in their hand
132. Is Nature like an open book;

133. No longer half-akin to brute,
134. For all we thought and loved and did,
135. And hoped, and suffer’d, is but seed
136. Of what in them is flower and fruit;

137. Whereof the man, that with me trod
138. This planet, was a noble type
139. Appearing ere the times were ripe,
140. That friend of mine who lives in God,

141. That God, which ever lives and loves,
142. One God, one law, one element,
143. And one far-off divine event,
144. To which the whole creation moves.
