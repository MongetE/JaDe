1. Is it, then, regret for buried time
2. That keenlier in sweet April wakes,
3. And meets the year, and gives and takes
4. The colours of the crescent prime?
5. Not all: the songs, the stirring air,
6. The life re-orient out of dust,
7. Cry thro' the sense to hearten trust
8. In that which made the world so fair.
9. Not all regret: the face will shine
10. Upon me, while I muse alone;
11. And that dear voice, I once have known,
12. Still speak to me of me and mine:

13. Yet less of sorrow lives in me
14. For days of happy commune dead;
15. Less yearning for the friendship fled,
16. Than some strong bond which is to be.
