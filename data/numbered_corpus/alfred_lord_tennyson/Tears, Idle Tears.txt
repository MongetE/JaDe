1. Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
2. Tears from the depth of some divine despair
3. Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
4. In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,
5. And thinking of the days that are no more.

6. Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
7. That brings our friends up from the underworld,
8. Sad as the last which reddens over one
9. That sinks with all we love below the verge;
10. So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

11. Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
12. The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds
13. To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
14. The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
15. So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

16. Dear as remembered kisses after death,
17. And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned
18. On lips that are for others; deep as love,
19. Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
20. O Death in Life, the days that are no more!
