1. I sometimes hold it half a sin
2. To put in words the grief I feel;
3. For words, like Nature, half reveal
4. And half conceal the Soul within.
5. But, for the unquiet heart and brain,
6. A use in  measured language lies;
7. The sad mechanic exercise,
8. Like dull narcotics, numbing pain.
9. In words, like weeds, I'll wrap me o'er,
10. Like coarsest clothes against the cold;
11. But that large grief which these enfold
12. Is given in outline and no more.
