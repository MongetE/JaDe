1. Who would be
2. A merman bold,
3. Sitting alone,
4. Singing alone
5. Under the sea,
6. With a crown of gold,
7. On a throne?

8. I would be a merman bold,
9. I would sit and sing the whole of the day;
10. I would fill the sea-halls with a voice of power;
11. But at night I would roam abroad and play
12. With the mermaids in and out of the rocks,
13. Dressing their hair with the white sea-flower;
14. And holding them back by their flowing locks
15. I would kiss them often under the sea,
16. And kiss them again till they kiss'd me
17. Laughingly, laughingly;
18. And then we would wander away, away,
19. To the pale-green sea-groves straight and high,
20. Chasing each other merrily.

21. There would be neither moon nor star;
22. But the wave would make music above us afar —
23. Low thunder and light in the magic night —
24. Neither moon nor star.
25. We would call aloud in the dreamy dells,
26. Call to each other and whoop and cry
27. All night, merrily, merrily;
28. They would pelt me with starry spangles and shells,
29. Laughing and clapping their hands between,
30. All night, merrily, merrily,
31. But I would throw to them back in mine
32. Turkis and agate and almondine;
33. Then leaping out upon them unseen
34. I would kiss them often under the sea,
35. And kiss them again till they kiss'd me
36. Laughingly, laughingly.
37. Oh! what a happy life were mine
38. Under the hollow-hung ocean green!
39. Soft are the moss-beds under the sea;
40. We would live merrily, merrily.
