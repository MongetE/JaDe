1. Now, scarce three paces measured from the mound,
2. We stumbled on a stationary voice,
3. And 'Stand, who goes?'  'Two from the palace' I.
4. 'The second two:  they wait,' he said, 'pass on;
5. His Highness wakes:' and one, that clashed in arms,
6. By glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led
7. Threading the soldier-city, till we heard
8. The drowsy folds of our great ensign shake
9. From blazoned lions o'er the imperial tent
10. Whispers of war.
11. Entering, the sudden light
12. Dazed me half-blind:  I stood and seemed to hear,
13. As in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes
14. A lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies,
15. Each hissing in his neighbour's ear; and then
16. A strangled titter, out of which there brake
17. On all sides, clamouring etiquette to death,
18. Unmeasured mirth; while now the two old kings
19. Began to wag their baldness up and down,
20. The fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth,
21. The huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew,
22. And slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire.

23. At length my Sire, his rough cheek wet with tears,
24. Panted from weary sides 'King, you are free!
25. We did but keep you surety for our son,
26. If this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou,
27. That tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge:'
28. For I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers,
29. More crumpled than a poppy from the sheath,
30. And all one rag, disprinced from head to heel.
31. Then some one sent beneath his vaulted palm
32. A whispered jest to some one near him, 'Look,
33. He has been among his shadows.'  'Satan take
34. The old women and their shadows! (thus the King
35. Roared) make yourself a man to fight with men.
36. Go:  Cyril told us all.'
37. As boys that slink
38. From ferule and the trespass-chiding eye,
39. Away we stole, and transient in a trice
40. From what was left of faded woman-slough
41. To sheathing splendours and the golden scale
42. Of harness, issued in the sun, that now
43. Leapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth,
44. And hit the Northern hills.  Here Cyril met us.
45. A little shy at first, but by and by
46. We twain, with mutual pardon asked and given
47. For stroke and song, resoldered peace, whereon
48. Followed his tale.  Amazed he fled away
49. Through the dark land, and later in the night
50. Had come on Psyche weeping:  'then we fell
51. Into your father's hand, and there she lies,
52. But will not speak, or stir.'
53. He showed a tent
54. A stone-shot off:  we entered in, and there
55. Among piled arms and rough accoutrements,
56. Pitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier's cloak,
57. Like some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot,
58. And pushed by rude hands from its pedestal,
59. All her fair length upon the ground she lay:
60. And at her head a follower of the camp,
61. A charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood,
62. Sat watching like the watcher by the dead.

63. Then Florian knelt, and 'Come' he whispered to her,
64. 'Lift up your head, sweet sister:  lie not thus.
65. What have you done but right? you could not slay
66. Me, nor your prince:  look up:  be comforted:
67. Sweet is it to have done the thing one ought,
68. When fallen in darker ways.'  And likewise I:
69. 'Be comforted:  have I not lost her too,
70. In whose least act abides the nameless charm
71. That none has else for me?'  She heard, she moved,
72. She moaned, a folded voice; and up she sat,
73. And raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth
74. As those that mourn half-shrouded over death
75. In deathless marble.  'Her,' she said, 'my friend--
76. Parted from her--betrayed her cause and mine--
77. Where shall I breathe? why kept ye not your faith?
78. O base and bad! what comfort? none for me!'
79. To whom remorseful Cyril, 'Yet I pray
80. Take comfort:  live, dear lady, for your child!'
81. At which she lifted up her voice and cried.

82. 'Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah, my child,
83. My one sweet child, whom I shall see no more!
84. For now will cruel Ida keep her back;
85. And either she will die from want of care,
86. Or sicken with ill-usage, when they say
87. The child is hers--for every little fault,
88. The child is hers; and they will beat my girl
89. Remembering her mother:  O my flower!
90. Or they will take her, they will make her hard,
91. And she will pass me by in after-life
92. With some cold reverence worse than were she dead.
93. Ill mother that I was to leave her there,
94. To lag behind, scared by the cry they made,
95. The horror of the shame among them all:
96. But I will go and sit beside the doors,
97. And make a wild petition night and day,
98. Until they hate to hear me like a wind
99. Wailing for ever, till they open to me,
100. And lay my little blossom at my feet,
101. My babe, my sweet Agla√Øa, my one child:
102. And I will take her up and go my way,
103. And satisfy my soul with kissing her:
104. Ah! what might that man not deserve of me
105. Who gave me back my child?'  'Be comforted,'
106. Said Cyril, 'you shall have it:' but again
107. She veiled her brows, and prone she sank, and so
108. Like tender things that being caught feign death,
109. Spoke not, nor stirred.
110. By this a murmur ran
111. Through all the camp and inward raced the scouts
112. With rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand.
113. We left her by the woman, and without
114. Found the gray kings at parle:  and 'Look you' cried
115. My father 'that our compact be fulfilled:
116. You have spoilt this child; she laughs at you and man:
117. She wrongs herself, her sex, and me, and him:
118. But red-faced war has rods of steel and fire;
119. She yields, or war.'
120. Then Gama turned to me:
121. 'We fear, indeed, you spent a stormy time
122. With our strange girl:  and yet they say that still
123. You love her.  Give us, then, your mind at large:
124. How say you, war or not?'
125. 'Not war, if possible,
126. O king,' I said, 'lest from the abuse of war,
127. The desecrated shrine, the trampled year,
128. The smouldering homestead, and the household flower
129. Torn from the lintel--all the common wrong--
130. A smoke go up through which I loom to her
131. Three times a monster:  now she lightens scorn
132. At him that mars her plan, but then would hate
133. (And every voice she talked with ratify it,
134. And every face she looked on justify it)
135. The general foe.  More soluble is this knot,
136. By gentleness than war.  I want her love.
137. What were I nigher this although we dashed
138. Your cities into shards with catapults,
139. She would not love;--or brought her chained, a slave,
140. The lifting of whose eyelash is my lord,
141. Not ever would she love; but brooding turn
142. The book of scorn, till all my flitting chance
143. Were caught within the record of her wrongs,
144. And crushed to death:  and rather, Sire, than this
145. I would the old God of war himself were dead,
146. Forgotten, rusting on his iron hills,
147. Rotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck,
148. Or like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice,
149. Not to be molten out.'
150. And roughly spake
151. My father, 'Tut, you know them not, the girls.
152. Boy, when I hear you prate I almost think
153. That idiot legend credible.  Look you, Sir!
154. Man is the hunter; woman is his game:
155. The sleek and shining creatures of the chase,
156. We hunt them for the beauty of their skins;
157. They love us for it, and we ride them down.
158. Wheedling and siding with them!  Out! for shame!
159. Boy, there's no rose that's half so dear to them
160. As he that does the thing they dare not do,
161. Breathing and sounding beauteous battle, comes
162. With the air of the trumpet round him, and leaps in
163. Among the women, snares them by the score
164. Flattered and flustered, wins, though dashed with death
165. He reddens what he kisses:  thus I won
166. You mother, a good mother, a good wife,
167. Worth winning; but this firebrand--gentleness
168. To such as her! if Cyril spake her true,
169. To catch a dragon in a cherry net,
170. To trip a tigress with a gossamer
171. Were wisdom to it.'
172. 'Yea but Sire,' I cried,
173. 'Wild natures need wise curbs.  The soldier?  No:
174. What dares not Ida do that she should prize
175. The soldier?  I beheld her, when she rose
176. The yesternight, and storming in extremes,
177. Stood for her cause, and flung defiance down
178. Gagelike to man, and had not shunned the death,
179. No, not the soldier's:  yet I hold her, king,
180. True woman:  you clash them all in one,
181. That have as many differences as we.
182. The violet varies from the lily as far
183. As oak from elm:  one loves the soldier, one
184. The silken priest of peace, one this, one that,
185. And some unworthily; their sinless faith,
186. A maiden moon that sparkles on a sty,
187. Glorifying clown and satyr; whence they need
188. More breadth of culture:  is not Ida right?
189. They worth it? truer to the law within?
190. Severer in the logic of a life?
191. Twice as magnetic to sweet influences
192. Of earth and heaven? and she of whom you speak,
193. My mother, looks as whole as some serene
194. Creation minted in the golden moods
195. Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch,
196. But pure as lines of green that streak the white
197. Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves; I say,
198. Not like the piebald miscellany, man,
199. Bursts of great heart and slips in sensual mire,
200. But whole and one:  and take them all-in-all,
201. Were we ourselves but half as good, as kind,
202. As truthful, much that Ida claims as right
203. Had ne'er been mooted, but as frankly theirs
204. As dues of Nature.  To our point:  not war:
205. Lest I lose all.'
206. 'Nay, nay, you spake but sense'
207. Said Gama.  'We remember love ourself
208. In our sweet youth; we did not rate him then
209. This red-hot iron to be shaped with blows.
210. You talk almost like Ida:  ~she~ can talk;
211. And there is something in it as you say:
212. But you talk kindlier:  we esteem you for it.--
213. He seems a gracious and a gallant Prince,
214. I would he had our daughter:  for the rest,
215. Our own detention, why, the causes weighed,
216. Fatherly fears--you used us courteously--
217. We would do much to gratify your Prince--
218. We pardon it; and for your ingress here
219. Upon the skirt and fringe of our fair land,
220. you did but come as goblins in the night,
221. Nor in the furrow broke the ploughman's head,
222. Nor burnt the grange, nor bussed the milking-maid,
223. Nor robbed the farmer of his bowl of cream:
224. But let your Prince (our royal word upon it,
225. He comes back safe) ride with us to our lines,
226. And speak with Arac:  Arac's word is thrice
227. As ours with Ida:  something may be done--
228. I know not what--and ours shall see us friends.
229. You, likewise, our late guests, if so you will,
230. Follow us:  who knows? we four may build some plan
231. Foursquare to opposition.'
232. Here he reached
233. White hands of farewell to my sire, who growled
234. An answer which, half-muffled in his beard,
235. Let so much out as gave us leave to go.

236. Then rode we with the old king across the lawns
237. Beneath huge trees, a thousand rings of Spring
238. In every bole, a song on every spray
239. Of birds that piped their Valentines, and woke
240. Desire in me to infuse my tale of love
241. In the old king's ears, who promised help, and oozed
242. All o'er with honeyed answer as we rode
243. And blossom-fragrant slipt the heavy dews
244. Gathered by night and peace, with each light air
245. On our mailed heads:  but other thoughts than Peace
246. Burnt in us, when we saw the embattled squares,
247. And squadrons of the Prince, trampling the flowers
248. With clamour:  for among them rose a cry
249. As if to greet the king; they made a halt;
250. The horses yelled; they clashed their arms; the drum
251. Beat; merrily-blowing shrilled the martial fife;
252. And in the blast and bray of the long horn
253. And serpent-throated bugle, undulated
254. The banner:  anon to meet us lightly pranced
255. Three captains out; nor ever had I seen
256. Such thews of men:  the midmost and the highest
257. Was Arac:  all about his motion clung
258. The shadow of his sister, as the beam
259. Of the East, that played upon them, made them glance
260. Like those three stars of the airy Giant's zone,
261. That glitter burnished by the frosty dark;
262. And as the fiery Sirius alters hue,
263. And bickers into red and emerald, shone
264. Their morions, washed with morning, as they came.

265. And I that prated peace, when first I heard
266. War-music, felt the blind wildbeast of force,
267. Whose home is in the sinews of a man,
268. Stir in me as to strike:  then took the king
269. His three broad sons; with now a wandering hand
270. And now a pointed finger, told them all:
271. A common light of smiles at our disguise
272. Broke from their lips, and, ere the windy jest
273. Had laboured down within his ample lungs,
274. The genial giant, Arac, rolled himself
275. Thrice in the saddle, then burst out in words.

276. 'Our land invaded, 'sdeath! and he himself
277. Your captive, yet my father wills not war:
278. And, 'sdeath! myself, what care I, war or no?
279. but then this question of your troth remains:
280. And there's a downright honest meaning in her;
281. She flies too high, she flies too high! and yet
282. She asked but space and fairplay for her scheme;
283. She prest and prest it on me--I myself,
284. What know I of these things? but, life and soul!
285. I thought her half-right talking of her wrongs;
286. I say she flies too high, 'sdeath! what of that?
287. I take her for the flower of womankind,
288. And so I often told her, right or wrong,
289. And, Prince, she can be sweet to those she loves,
290. And, right or wrong, I care not:  this is all,
291. I stand upon her side:  she made me swear it--
292. 'Sdeath--and with solemn rites by candle-light--
293. Swear by St something--I forget her name--
294. Her that talked down the fifty wisest men;
295. ~She~ was a princess too; and so I swore.
296. Come, this is all; she will not:  waive your claim:
297. If not, the foughten field, what else, at once
298. Decides it, 'sdeath! against my father's will.'

299. I lagged in answer loth to render up
300. My precontract, and loth by brainless war
301. To cleave the rift of difference deeper yet;
302. Till one of those two brothers, half aside
303. And fingering at the hair about his lip,
304. To prick us on to combat 'Like to like!
305. The woman's garment hid the woman's heart.'
306. A taunt that clenched his purpose like a blow!
307. For fiery-short was Cyril's counter-scoff,
308. And sharp I answered, touched upon the point
309. Where idle boys are cowards to their shame,
310. 'Decide it here:  why not? we are three to three.'

311. Then spake the third 'But three to three? no more?
312. No more, and in our noble sister's cause?
313. More, more, for honour:  every captain waits
314. Hungry for honour, angry for his king.
315. More, more some fifty on a side, that each
316. May breathe himself, and quick! by overthrow
317. Of these or those, the question settled die.'

318. 'Yea,' answered I, 'for this wreath of air,
319. This flake of rainbow flying on the highest
320. Foam of men's deeds--this honour, if ye will.
321. It needs must be for honour if at all:
322. Since, what decision? if we fail, we fail,
323. And if we win, we fail:  she would not keep
324. Her compact.'  ''Sdeath! but we will send to her,'
325. Said Arac, 'worthy reasons why she should
326. Bide by this issue:  let our missive through,
327. And you shall have her answer by the word.'

328. 'Boys!' shrieked the old king, but vainlier than a hen
329. To her false daughters in the pool; for none
330. Regarded; neither seemed there more to say:
331. Back rode we to my father's camp, and found
332. He thrice had sent a herald to the gates,
333. To learn if Ida yet would cede our claim,
334. Or by denial flush her babbling wells
335. With her own people's life:  three times he went:
336. The first, he blew and blew, but none appeared:
337. He battered at the doors; none came:  the next,
338. An awful voice within had warned him thence:
339. The third, and those eight daughters of the plough
340. Came sallying through the gates, and caught his hair,
341. And so belaboured him on rib and cheek
342. They made him wild:  not less one glance he caught
343. Through open doors of Ida stationed there
344. Unshaken, clinging to her purpose, firm
345. Though compassed by two armies and the noise
346. Of arms; and standing like a stately Pine
347. Set in a cataract on an island-crag,
348. When storm is on the heights, and right and left
349. Sucked from the dark heart of the long hills roll
350. The torrents, dashed to the vale:  and yet her will
351. Bred will in me to overcome it or fall.

352. But when I told the king that I was pledged
353. To fight in tourney for my bride, he clashed
354. His iron palms together with a cry;
355. Himself would tilt it out among the lads:
356. But overborne by all his bearded lords
357. With reasons drawn from age and state, perforce
358. He yielded, wroth and red, with fierce demur:
359. And many a bold knight started up in heat,
360. And sware to combat for my claim till death.

361. All on this side the palace ran the field
362. Flat to the garden-wall:  and likewise here,
363. Above the garden's glowing blossom-belts,
364. A columned entry shone and marble stairs,
365. And great bronze valves, embossed with Tomyris
366. And what she did to Cyrus after fight,
367. But now fast barred:  so here upon the flat
368. All that long morn the lists were hammered up,
369. And all that morn the heralds to and fro,
370. With message and defiance, went and came;
371. Last, Ida's answer, in a royal hand,
372. But shaken here and there, and rolling words
373. Oration-like.  I kissed it and I read.

374. 'O brother, you have known the pangs we felt,
375. What heats of indignation when we heard
376. Of those that iron-cramped their women's feet;
377. Of lands in which at the altar the poor bride
378. Gives her harsh groom for bridal-gift a scourge;
379. Of living hearts that crack within the fire
380. Where smoulder their dead despots; and of those,--
381. Mothers,--that, with all prophetic pity, fling
382. Their pretty maids in the running flood, and swoops
383. The vulture, beak and talon, at the heart
384. Made for all noble motion:  and I saw
385. That equal baseness lived in sleeker times
386. With smoother men:  the old leaven leavened all:
387. Millions of throats would bawl for civil rights,
388. No woman named:  therefore I set my face
389. Against all men, and lived but for mine own.
390. Far off from men I built a fold for them:
391. I stored it full of rich memorial:
392. I fenced it round with gallant institutes,
393. And biting laws to scare the beasts of prey
394. And prospered; till a rout of saucy boys
395. Brake on us at our books, and marred our peace,
396. Masked like our maids, blustering I know not what
397. Of insolence and love, some pretext held
398. Of baby troth, invalid, since my will
399. Sealed not the bond--the striplings! for their sport!--
400. I tamed my leopards:  shall I not tame these?
401. Or you? or I? for since you think me touched
402. In honour--what, I would not aught of false--
403. Is not our case pure? and whereas I know
404. Your prowess, Arac, and what mother's blood
405. You draw from, fight; you failing, I abide
406. What end soever:  fail you will not.  Still
407. Take not his life:  he risked it for my own;
408. His mother lives:  yet whatsoe'er you do,
409. Fight and fight well; strike and strike him.  O dear
410. Brothers, the woman's Angel guards you, you
411. The sole men to be mingled with our cause,
412. The sole men we shall prize in the after-time,
413. Your very armour hallowed, and your statues
414. Reared, sung to, when, this gad-fly brushed aside,
415. We plant a solid foot into the Time,
416. And mould a generation strong to move
417. With claim on claim from right to right, till she
418. Whose name is yoked with children's, know herself;
419. And Knowledge in our own land make her free,
420. And, ever following those two crown√®d twins,
421. Commerce and conquest, shower the fiery grain
422. Of freedom broadcast over all the orbs
423. Between the Northern and the Southern morn.'

424. Then came a postscript dashed across the rest.
425. See that there be no traitors in your camp:
426. We seem a nest of traitors--none to trust
427. Since our arms failed--this Egypt-plague of men!
428. Almost our maids were better at their homes,
429. Than thus man-girdled here:  indeed I think
430. Our chiefest comfort is the little child
431. Of one unworthy mother; which she left:
432. She shall not have it back:  the child shall grow
433. To prize the authentic mother of her mind.
434. I took it for an hour in mine own bed
435. This morning:  there the tender orphan hands
436. Felt at my heart, and seemed to charm from thence
437. The wrath I nursed against the world:  farewell.'

438. I ceased; he said, 'Stubborn, but she may sit
439. Upon a king's right hand in thunder-storms,
440. And breed up warriors!  See now, though yourself
441. Be dazzled by the wildfire Love to sloughs
442. That swallow common sense, the spindling king,
443. This Gama swamped in lazy tolerance.
444. When the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,
445. And topples down the scales; but this is fixt
446. As are the roots of earth and base of all;
447. Man for the field and woman for the hearth:
448. Man for the sword and for the needle she:
449. Man with the head and woman with the heart:
450. Man to command and woman to obey;
451. All else confusion.  Look you! the gray mare
452. Is ill to live with, when her whinny shrills
453. From tile to scullery, and her small goodman
454. Shrinks in his arm-chair while the fires of Hell
455. Mix with his hearth:  but you--she's yet a colt--
456. Take, break her:  strongly groomed and straitly curbed
457. She might not rank with those detestable
458. That let the bantling scald at home, and brawl
459. Their rights and wrongs like potherbs in the street.
460. They say she's comely; there's the fairer chance:
461. ~I~ like her none the less for rating at her!
462. Besides, the woman wed is not as we,
463. But suffers change of frame.  A lusty brace
464. Of twins may weed her of her folly.  Boy,
465. The bearing and the training of a child
466. Is woman's wisdom.'
467. Thus the hard old king:
468. I took my leave, for it was nearly noon:
469. I pored upon her letter which I held,
470. And on the little clause 'take not his life:'
471. I mused on that wild morning in the woods,
472. And on the 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win:'
473. I thought on all the wrathful king had said,
474. And how the strange betrothment was to end:
475. Then I remembered that burnt sorcerer's curse
476. That one should fight with shadows and should fall;
477. And like a flash the weird affection came:
478. King, camp and college turned to hollow shows;
479. I seemed to move in old memorial tilts,
480. And doing battle with forgotten ghosts,
481. To dream myself the shadow of a dream:
482. And ere I woke it was the point of noon,
483. The lists were ready.  Empanoplied and plumed
484. We entered in, and waited, fifty there
485. Opposed to fifty, till the trumpet blared
486. At the barrier like a wild horn in a land
487. Of echoes, and a moment, and once more
488. The trumpet, and again:  at which the storm
489. Of galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears
490. And riders front to front, until they closed
491. In conflict with the crash of shivering points,
492. And thunder.  Yet it seemed a dream, I dreamed
493. Of fighting.  On his haunches rose the steed,
494. And into fiery splinters leapt the lance,
495. And out of stricken helmets sprang the fire.
496. Part sat like rocks:  part reeled but kept their seats:
497. Part rolled on the earth and rose again and drew:
498. Part stumbled mixt with floundering horses.  Down
499. From those two bulks at Arac's side, and down
500. From Arac's arm, as from a giant's flail,
501. The large blows rained, as here and everywhere
502. He rode the mellay, lord of the ringing lists,
503. And all the plain,--brand, mace, and shaft, and shield--
504. Shocked, like an iron-clanging anvil banged
505. With hammers; till I thought, can this be he
506. From Gama's dwarfish loins? if this be so,
507. The mother makes us most--and in my dream
508. I glanced aside, and saw the palace-front
509. Alive with fluttering scarfs and ladies' eyes,
510. And highest, among the statues, statuelike,
511. Between a cymballed Miriam and a Jael,
512. With Psyche's babe, was Ida watching us,
513. A single band of gold about her hair,
514. Like a Saint's glory up in heaven:  but she
515. No saint--inexorable--no tenderness--
516. Too hard, too cruel:  yet she sees me fight,
517. Yea, let her see me fall! and with that I drave
518. Among the thickest and bore down a Prince,
519. And Cyril, one.  Yea, let me make my dream
520. All that I would.  But that large-moulded man,
521. His visage all agrin as at a wake,
522. Made at me through the press, and, staggering back
523. With stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came
524. As comes a pillar of electric cloud,
525. Flaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,
526. And shadowing down the champaign till it strikes
527. On a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,
528. And twists the grain with such a roar that Earth
529. Reels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything
530. Game way before him:  only Florian, he
531. That loved me closer than his own right eye,
532. Thrust in between; but Arac rode him down:
533. And Cyril seeing it, pushed against the Prince,
534. With Psyche's colour round his helmet, tough,
535. Strong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;
536. But tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote
537. And threw him:  last I spurred; I felt my veins
538. Stretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,
539. And sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,
540. Till I struck out and shouted; the blade glanced,
541. I did but shear a feather, and dream and truth
542. Flowed from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.


543. Home they brought her warrior dead:
544. She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:
545. All her maidens, watching, said,
546. 'She must weep or she will die.'

547. Then they praised him, soft and low,
548. Called him worthy to be loved,
549. Truest friend and noblest foe;
550. Yet she neither spoke nor moved.

551. Stole a maiden from her place,
552. Lightly to the warrior stept,
553. Took the face-cloth from the face;
554. Yet she neither moved nor wept.

555. Rose a nurse of ninety years,
556. Set his child upon her knee--
557. Like summer tempest came her tears--
558. 'Sweet my child, I live for thee.'
