1. A storm was coming, but the winds were still,
2. And in the wild woods of Broceliande,
3. Before an oak, so hollow, huge and old
4. It looked a tower of ivied masonwork,
5. At Merlin's feet the wily Vivien lay.

6. For he that always bare in bitter grudge
7. The slights of Arthur and his Table, Mark
8. The Cornish King, had heard a wandering voice,
9. A minstrel of Caerlon by strong storm
10. Blown into shelter at Tintagil, say
11. That out of naked knightlike purity
12. Sir Lancelot worshipt no unmarried girl
13. But the great Queen herself, fought in her name,
14. Sware by her--vows like theirs, that high in heaven
15. Love most, but neither marry, nor are given
16. In marriage, angels of our Lord's report.

17. He ceased, and then--for Vivien sweetly said
18. (She sat beside the banquet nearest Mark),
19. 'And is the fair example followed, Sir,
20. In Arthur's household?'--answered innocently:

21. 'Ay, by some few--ay, truly--youths that hold
22. It more beseems the perfect virgin knight
23. To worship woman as true wife beyond
24. All hopes of gaining, than as maiden girl.
25. They place their pride in Lancelot and the Queen.
26. So passionate for an utter purity
27. Beyond the limit of their bond, are these,
28. For Arthur bound them not to singleness.
29. Brave hearts and clean! and yet--God guide them--young.'

30. Then Mark was half in heart to hurl his cup
31. Straight at the speaker, but forbore:  he rose
32. To leave the hall, and, Vivien following him,
33. Turned to her:  'Here are snakes within the grass;
34. And you methinks, O Vivien, save ye fear
35. The monkish manhood, and the mask of pure
36. Worn by this court, can stir them till they sting.'

37. And Vivien answered, smiling scornfully,
38. 'Why fear? because that fostered at THY court
39. I savour of thy--virtues? fear them? no.
40. As Love, if Love is perfect, casts out fear,
41. So Hate, if Hate is perfect, casts out fear.
42. My father died in battle against the King,
43. My mother on his corpse in open field;
44. She bore me there, for born from death was I
45. Among the dead and sown upon the wind--
46. And then on thee! and shown the truth betimes,
47. That old true filth, and bottom of the well
48. Where Truth is hidden.  Gracious lessons thine
49. And maxims of the mud!  "This Arthur pure!
50. Great Nature through the flesh herself hath made
51. Gives him the lie!  There is no being pure,
52. My cherub; saith not Holy Writ the same?"--
53. If I were Arthur, I would have thy blood.
54. Thy blessing, stainless King!  I bring thee back,
55. When I have ferreted out their burrowings,
56. The hearts of all this Order in mine hand--
57. Ay--so that fate and craft and folly close,
58. Perchance, one curl of Arthur's golden beard.
59. To me this narrow grizzled fork of thine
60. Is cleaner-fashioned--Well, I loved thee first,
61. That warps the wit.'

62. Loud laughed the graceless Mark,
63. But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged
64. Low in the city, and on a festal day
65. When Guinevere was crossing the great hall
66. Cast herself down, knelt to the Queen, and wailed.

67. 'Why kneel ye there?  What evil hath ye wrought?
68. Rise!' and the damsel bidden rise arose
69. And stood with folded hands and downward eyes
70. Of glancing corner, and all meekly said,
71. 'None wrought, but suffered much, an orphan maid!
72. My father died in battle for thy King,
73. My mother on his corpse--in open field,
74. The sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonnesse--
75. Poor wretch--no friend!--and now by Mark the King
76. For that small charm of feature mine, pursued--
77. If any such be mine--I fly to thee.
78. Save, save me thou--Woman of women--thine
79. The wreath of beauty, thine the crown of power,
80. Be thine the balm of pity, O Heaven's own white
81. Earth-angel, stainless bride of stainless King--
82. Help, for he follows! take me to thyself!
83. O yield me shelter for mine innocency
84. Among thy maidens!

85. Here her slow sweet eyes
86. Fear-tremulous, but humbly hopeful, rose
87. Fixt on her hearer's, while the Queen who stood
88. All glittering like May sunshine on May leaves
89. In green and gold, and plumed with green replied,
90. 'Peace, child! of overpraise and overblame
91. We choose the last.  Our noble Arthur, him
92. Ye scarce can overpraise, will hear and know.
93. Nay--we believe all evil of thy Mark--
94. Well, we shall test thee farther; but this hour
95. We ride a-hawking with Sir Lancelot.
96. He hath given us a fair falcon which he trained;
97. We go to prove it.  Bide ye here the while.'

98. She past; and Vivien murmured after 'Go!
99. I bide the while.'  Then through the portal-arch
100. Peering askance, and muttering broken-wise,
101. As one that labours with an evil dream,
102. Beheld the Queen and Lancelot get to horse.

103. 'Is that the Lancelot? goodly--ay, but gaunt:
104. Courteous--amends for gauntness--takes her hand--
105. That glance of theirs, but for the street, had been
106. A clinging kiss--how hand lingers in hand!
107. Let go at last!--they ride away--to hawk
108. For waterfowl.  Royaller game is mine.
109. For such a supersensual sensual bond
110. As that gray cricket chirpt of at our hearth--
111. Touch flax with flame--a glance will serve--the liars!
112. Ah little rat that borest in the dyke
113. Thy hole by night to let the boundless deep
114. Down upon far-off cities while they dance--
115. Or dream--of thee they dreamed not--nor of me
116. These--ay, but each of either:  ride, and dream
117. The mortal dream that never yet was mine--
118. Ride, ride and dream until ye wake--to me!
119. Then, narrow court and lubber King, farewell!
120. For Lancelot will be gracious to the rat,
121. And our wise Queen, if knowing that I know,
122. Will hate, loathe, fear--but honour me the more.'

123. Yet while they rode together down the plain,
124. Their talk was all of training, terms of art,
125. Diet and seeling, jesses, leash and lure.
126. 'She is too noble' he said 'to check at pies,
127. Nor will she rake:  there is no baseness in her.'
128. Here when the Queen demanded as by chance
129. 'Know ye the stranger woman?'  'Let her be,'
130. Said Lancelot and unhooded casting off
131. The goodly falcon free; she towered; her bells,
132. Tone under tone, shrilled; and they lifted up
133. Their eager faces, wondering at the strength,
134. Boldness and royal knighthood of the bird
135. Who pounced her quarry and slew it.  Many a time
136. As once--of old--among the flowers--they rode.

137. But Vivien half-forgotten of the Queen
138. Among her damsels broidering sat, heard, watched
139. And whispered:  through the peaceful court she crept
140. And whispered:  then as Arthur in the highest
141. Leavened the world, so Vivien in the lowest,
142. Arriving at a time of golden rest,
143. And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear,
144. While all the heathen lay at Arthur's feet,
145. And no quest came, but all was joust and play,
146. Leavened his hall.  They heard and let her be.

147. Thereafter as an enemy that has left
148. Death in the living waters, and withdrawn,
149. The wily Vivien stole from Arthur's court.

150. She hated all the knights, and heard in thought
151. Their lavish comment when her name was named.
152. For once, when Arthur walking all alone,
153. Vext at a rumour issued from herself
154. Of some corruption crept among his knights,
155. Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,
156. Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood
157. With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,
158. And fluttered adoration, and at last
159. With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more
160. Than who should prize him most; at which the King
161. Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:
162. But one had watched, and had not held his peace:
163. It made the laughter of an afternoon
164. That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.
165. And after that, she set herself to gain
166. Him, the most famous man of all those times,
167. Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,
168. Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,
169. Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;
170. The people called him Wizard; whom at first
171. She played about with slight and sprightly talk,
172. And vivid smiles, and faintly-venomed points
173. Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;
174. And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer
175. Would watch her at her petulance, and play,
176. Even when they seemed unloveable, and laugh
177. As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew
178. Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,
179. Perceiving that she was but half disdained,
180. Began to break her sports with graver fits,
181. Turn red or pale, would often when they met
182. Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him
183. With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,
184. Though doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times
185. Would flatter his own wish in age for love,
186. And half believe her true:  for thus at times
187. He wavered; but that other clung to him,
188. Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.

189. Then fell on Merlin a great melancholy;
190. He walked with dreams and darkness, and he found
191. A doom that ever poised itself to fall,
192. An ever-moaning battle in the mist,
193. World-war of dying flesh against the life,
194. Death in all life and lying in all love,
195. The meanest having power upon the highest,
196. And the high purpose broken by the worm.

197. So leaving Arthur's court he gained the beach;
198. There found a little boat, and stept into it;
199. And Vivien followed, but he marked her not.
200. She took the helm and he the sail; the boat
201. Drave with a sudden wind across the deeps,
202. And touching Breton sands, they disembarked.
203. And then she followed Merlin all the way,
204. Even to the wild woods of Broceliande.
205. For Merlin once had told her of a charm,
206. The which if any wrought on anyone
207. With woven paces and with waving arms,
208. The man so wrought on ever seemed to lie
209. Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower,
210. From which was no escape for evermore;
211. And none could find that man for evermore,
212. Nor could he see but him who wrought the charm
213. Coming and going, and he lay as dead
214. And lost to life and use and name and fame.
215. And Vivien ever sought to work the charm
216. Upon the great Enchanter of the Time,
217. As fancying that her glory would be great
218. According to his greatness whom she quenched.

219. There lay she all her length and kissed his feet,
220. As if in deepest reverence and in love.
221. A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe
222. Of samite without price, that more exprest
223. Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,
224. In colour like the satin-shining palm
225. On sallows in the windy gleams of March:
226. And while she kissed them, crying, 'Trample me,
227. Dear feet, that I have followed through the world,
228. And I will pay you worship; tread me down
229. And I will kiss you for it;' he was mute:
230. So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,
231. As on a dull day in an Ocean cave
232. The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall
233. In silence:  wherefore, when she lifted up
234. A face of sad appeal, and spake and said,
235. 'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and again,
236. 'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and once more,
237. 'Great Master, do ye love me?' he was mute.
238. And lissome Vivien, holding by his heel,
239. Writhed toward him, slided up his knee and sat,
240. Behind his ankle twined her hollow feet
241. Together, curved an arm about his neck,
242. Clung like a snake; and letting her left hand
243. Droop from his mighty shoulder, as a leaf,
244. Made with her right a comb of pearl to part
245. The lists of such a board as youth gone out
246. Had left in ashes:  then he spoke and said,
247. Not looking at her, 'Who are wise in love
248. Love most, say least,' and Vivien answered quick,
249. 'I saw the little elf-god eyeless once
250. In Arthur's arras hall at Camelot:
251. But neither eyes nor tongue--O stupid child!
252. Yet you are wise who say it; let me think
253. Silence is wisdom:  I am silent then,
254. And ask no kiss;' then adding all at once,
255. 'And lo, I clothe myself with wisdom,' drew
256. The vast and shaggy mantle of his beard
257. Across her neck and bosom to her knee,
258. And called herself a gilded summer fly
259. Caught in a great old tyrant spider's web,
260. Who meant to eat her up in that wild wood
261. Without one word.  So Vivien called herself,
262. But rather seemed a lovely baleful star
263. Veiled in gray vapour; till he sadly smiled:
264. 'To what request for what strange boon,' he said,
265. 'Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries,
266. O Vivien, the preamble? yet my thanks,
267. For these have broken up my melancholy.'

268. And Vivien answered smiling saucily,
269. 'What, O my Master, have ye found your voice?
270. I bid the stranger welcome.  Thanks at last!
271. But yesterday you never opened lip,
272. Except indeed to drink:  no cup had we:
273. In mine own lady palms I culled the spring
274. That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,
275. And made a pretty cup of both my hands
276. And offered you it kneeling:  then you drank
277. And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;
278. O no more thanks than might a goat have given
279. With no more sign of reverence than a beard.
280. And when we halted at that other well,
281. And I was faint to swooning, and you lay
282. Foot-gilt with all the blossom-dust of those
283. Deep meadows we had traversed, did you know
284. That Vivien bathed your feet before her own?
285. And yet no thanks:  and all through this wild wood
286. And all this morning when I fondled you:
287. Boon, ay, there was a boon, one not so strange--
288. How had I wronged you? surely ye are wise,
289. But such a silence is more wise than kind.'

290. And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said:
291. 'O did ye never lie upon the shore,
292. And watch the curled white of the coming wave
293. Glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks?
294. Even such a wave, but not so pleasurable,
295. Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,
296. Had I for three days seen, ready to fall.
297. And then I rose and fled from Arthur's court
298. To break the mood.  You followed me unasked;
299. And when I looked, and saw you following me still,
300. My mind involved yourself the nearest thing
301. In that mind-mist:  for shall I tell you truth?
302. You seemed that wave about to break upon me
303. And sweep me from my hold upon the world,
304. My use and name and fame.  Your pardon, child.
305. Your pretty sports have brightened all again.
306. And ask your boon, for boon I owe you thrice,
307. Once for wrong done you by confusion, next
308. For thanks it seems till now neglected, last
309. For these your dainty gambols:  wherefore ask;
310. And take this boon so strange and not so strange.'

311. And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:
312. 'O not so strange as my long asking it,
313. Not yet so strange as you yourself are strange,
314. Nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours.
315. I ever feared ye were not wholly mine;
316. And see, yourself have owned ye did me wrong.
317. The people call you prophet:  let it be:
318. But not of those that can expound themselves.
319. Take Vivien for expounder; she will call
320. That three-days-long presageful gloom of yours
321. No presage, but the same mistrustful mood
322. That makes you seem less noble than yourself,
323. Whenever I have asked this very boon,
324. Now asked again:  for see you not, dear love,
325. That such a mood as that, which lately gloomed
326. Your fancy when ye saw me following you,
327. Must make me fear still more you are not mine,
328. Must make me yearn still more to prove you mine,
329. And make me wish still more to learn this charm
330. Of woven paces and of waving hands,
331. As proof of trust.  O Merlin, teach it me.
332. The charm so taught will charm us both to rest.
333. For, grant me some slight power upon your fate,
334. I, feeling that you felt me worthy trust,
335. Should rest and let you rest, knowing you mine.
336. And therefore be as great as ye are named,
337. Not muffled round with selfish reticence.
338. How hard you look and how denyingly!
339. O, if you think this wickedness in me,
340. That I should prove it on you unawares,
341. That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond
342. Had best be loosed for ever:  but think or not,
343. By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,
344. As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:
345. O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,
346. If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,
347. Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,
348. Have tript on such conjectural treachery--
349. May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell
350. Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,
351. If I be such a traitress.  Yield my boon,
352. Till which I scarce can yield you all I am;
353. And grant my re-reiterated wish,
354. The great proof of your love:  because I think,
355. However wise, ye hardly know me yet.'

356. And Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,
357. 'I never was less wise, however wise,
358. Too curious Vivien, though you talk of trust,
359. Than when I told you first of such a charm.
360. Yea, if ye talk of trust I tell you this,
361. Too much I trusted when I told you that,
362. And stirred this vice in you which ruined man
363. Through woman the first hour; for howsoe'er
364. In children a great curiousness be well,
365. Who have to learn themselves and all the world,
366. In you, that are no child, for still I find
367. Your face is practised when I spell the lines,
368. I call it,--well, I will not call it vice:
369. But since you name yourself the summer fly,
370. I well could wish a cobweb for the gnat,
371. That settles, beaten back, and beaten back
372. Settles, till one could yield for weariness:
373. But since I will not yield to give you power
374. Upon my life and use and name and fame,
375. Why will ye never ask some other boon?
376. Yea, by God's rood, I trusted you too much.'

377. And Vivien, like the tenderest-hearted maid
378. That ever bided tryst at village stile,
379. Made answer, either eyelid wet with tears:
380. 'Nay, Master, be not wrathful with your maid;
381. Caress her:  let her feel herself forgiven
382. Who feels no heart to ask another boon.
383. I think ye hardly know the tender rhyme
384. Of "trust me not at all or all in all."
385. I heard the great Sir Lancelot sing it once,
386. And it shall answer for me.  Listen to it.

387. "In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,
388. Faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers:
389. Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.

390. "It is the little rift within the lute,
391. That by and by will make the music mute,
392. And ever widening slowly silence all.

393. "The little rift within the lover's lute
394. Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,
395. That rotting inward slowly moulders all.

396. "It is not worth the keeping:  let it go:
397. But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.
398. And trust me not at all or all in all."

399. O Master, do ye love my tender rhyme?'

400. And Merlin looked and half believed her true,
401. So tender was her voice, so fair her face,
402. So sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears
403. Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower:
404. And yet he answered half indignantly:

405. 'Far other was the song that once I heard
406. By this huge oak, sung nearly where we sit:
407. For here we met, some ten or twelve of us,
408. To chase a creature that was current then
409. In these wild woods, the hart with golden horns.
410. It was the time when first the question rose
411. About the founding of a Table Round,
412. That was to be, for love of God and men
413. And noble deeds, the flower of all the world.
414. And each incited each to noble deeds.
415. And while we waited, one, the youngest of us,
416. We could not keep him silent, out he flashed,
417. And into such a song, such fire for fame,
418. Such trumpet-glowings in it, coming down
419. To such a stern and iron-clashing close,
420. That when he stopt we longed to hurl together,
421. And should have done it; but the beauteous beast
422. Scared by the noise upstarted at our feet,
423. And like a silver shadow slipt away
424. Through the dim land; and all day long we rode
425. Through the dim land against a rushing wind,
426. That glorious roundel echoing in our ears,
427. And chased the flashes of his golden horns
428. Till they vanished by the fairy well
429. That laughs at iron--as our warriors did--
430. Where children cast their pins and nails, and cry,
431. "Laugh, little well!" but touch it with a sword,
432. It buzzes fiercely round the point; and there
433. We lost him:  such a noble song was that.
434. But, Vivien, when you sang me that sweet rhyme,
435. I felt as though you knew this cursd charm,
436. Were proving it on me, and that I lay
437. And felt them slowly ebbing, name and fame.'

438. And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:
439. 'O mine have ebbed away for evermore,
440. And all through following you to this wild wood,
441. Because I saw you sad, to comfort you.
442. Lo now, what hearts have men! they never mount
443. As high as woman in her selfless mood.
444. And touching fame, howe'er ye scorn my song,
445. Take one verse more--the lady speaks it--this:

446. '"My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,
447. For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine,
448. And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine.
449. So trust me not at all or all in all."

450. 'Says she not well? and there is more--this rhyme
451. Is like the fair pearl-necklace of the Queen,
452. That burst in dancing, and the pearls were spilt;
453. Some lost, some stolen, some as relics kept.
454. But nevermore the same two sister pearls
455. Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other
456. On her white neck--so is it with this rhyme:
457. It lives dispersedly in many hands,
458. And every minstrel sings it differently;
459. Yet is there one true line, the pearl of pearls:
460. "Man dreams of Fame while woman wakes to love."
461. Yea!  Love, though Love were of the grossest, carves
462. A portion from the solid present, eats
463. And uses, careless of the rest; but Fame,
464. The Fame that follows death is nothing to us;
465. And what is Fame in life but half-disfame,
466. And counterchanged with darkness? ye yourself
467. Know well that Envy calls you Devil's son,
468. And since ye seem the Master of all Art,
469. They fain would make you Master of all vice.'

470. And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said,
471. 'I once was looking for a magic weed,
472. And found a fair young squire who sat alone,
473. Had carved himself a knightly shield of wood,
474. And then was painting on it fancied arms,
475. Azure, an Eagle rising or, the Sun
476. In dexter chief; the scroll "I follow fame."
477. And speaking not, but leaning over him
478. I took his brush and blotted out the bird,
479. And made a Gardener putting in a graff,
480. With this for motto, "Rather use than fame."
481. You should have seen him blush; but afterwards
482. He made a stalwart knight.  O Vivien,
483. For you, methinks you think you love me well;
484. For me, I love you somewhat; rest:  and Love
485. Should have some rest and pleasure in himself,
486. Not ever be too curious for a boon,
487. Too prurient for a proof against the grain
488. Of him ye say ye love:  but Fame with men,
489. Being but ampler means to serve mankind,
490. Should have small rest or pleasure in herself,
491. But work as vassal to the larger love,
492. That dwarfs the petty love of one to one.
493. Use gave me Fame at first, and Fame again
494. Increasing gave me use.  Lo, there my boon!
495. What other? for men sought to prove me vile,
496. Because I fain had given them greater wits:
497. And then did Envy call me Devil's son:
498. The sick weak beast seeking to help herself
499. By striking at her better, missed, and brought
500. Her own claw back, and wounded her own heart.
501. Sweet were the days when I was all unknown,
502. But when my name was lifted up, the storm
503. Brake on the mountain and I cared not for it.
504. Right well know I that Fame is half-disfame,
505. Yet needs must work my work.  That other fame,
506. To one at least, who hath not children, vague,
507. The cackle of the unborn about the grave,
508. I cared not for it:  a single misty star,
509. Which is the second in a line of stars
510. That seem a sword beneath a belt of three,
511. I never gazed upon it but I dreamt
512. Of some vast charm concluded in that star
513. To make fame nothing.  Wherefore, if I fear,
514. Giving you power upon me through this charm,
515. That you might play me falsely, having power,
516. However well ye think ye love me now
517. (As sons of kings loving in pupilage
518. Have turned to tyrants when they came to power)
519. I rather dread the loss of use than fame;
520. If you--and not so much from wickedness,
521. As some wild turn of anger, or a mood
522. Of overstrained affection, it may be,
523. To keep me all to your own self,--or else
524. A sudden spurt of woman's jealousy,--
525. Should try this charm on whom ye say ye love.'

526. And Vivien answered smiling as in wrath:
527. 'Have I not sworn?  I am not trusted.  Good!
528. Well, hide it, hide it; I shall find it out;
529. And being found take heed of Vivien.
530. A woman and not trusted, doubtless I
531. Might feel some sudden turn of anger born
532. Of your misfaith; and your fine epithet
533. Is accurate too, for this full love of mine
534. Without the full heart back may merit well
535. Your term of overstrained.  So used as I,
536. My daily wonder is, I love at all.
537. And as to woman's jealousy, O why not?
538. O to what end, except a jealous one,
539. And one to make me jealous if I love,
540. Was this fair charm invented by yourself?
541. I well believe that all about this world
542. Ye cage a buxom captive here and there,
543. Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower
544. From which is no escape for evermore.'

545. Then the great Master merrily answered her:
546. 'Full many a love in loving youth was mine;
547. I needed then no charm to keep them mine
548. But youth and love; and that full heart of yours
549. Whereof ye prattle, may now assure you mine;
550. So live uncharmed.  For those who wrought it first,
551. The wrist is parted from the hand that waved,
552. The feet unmortised from their ankle-bones
553. Who paced it, ages back:  but will ye hear
554. The legend as in guerdon for your rhyme?

555. 'There lived a king in the most Eastern East,
556. Less old than I, yet older, for my blood
557. Hath earnest in it of far springs to be.
558. A tawny pirate anchored in his port,
559. Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles;
560. And passing one, at the high peep of dawn,
561. He saw two cities in a thousand boats
562. All fighting for a woman on the sea.
563. And pushing his black craft among them all,
564. He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off,
565. With loss of half his people arrow-slain;
566. A maid so smooth, so white, so wonderful,
567. They said a light came from her when she moved:
568. And since the pirate would not yield her up,
569. The King impaled him for his piracy;
570. Then made her Queen:  but those isle-nurtured eyes
571. Waged such unwilling though successful war
572. On all the youth, they sickened; councils thinned,
573. And armies waned, for magnet-like she drew
574. The rustiest iron of old fighters' hearts;
575. And beasts themselves would worship; camels knelt
576. Unbidden, and the brutes of mountain back
577. That carry kings in castles, bowed black knees
578. Of homage, ringing with their serpent hands,
579. To make her smile, her golden ankle-bells.
580. What wonder, being jealous, that he sent
581. His horns of proclamation out through all
582. The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed
583. To find a wizard who might teach the King
584. Some charm, which being wrought upon the Queen
585. Might keep her all his own:  to such a one
586. He promised more than ever king has given,
587. A league of mountain full of golden mines,
588. A province with a hundred miles of coast,
589. A palace and a princess, all for him:
590. But on all those who tried and failed, the King
591. Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it
592. To keep the list low and pretenders back,
593. Or like a king, not to be trifled with--
594. Their heads should moulder on the city gates.
595. And many tried and failed, because the charm
596. Of nature in her overbore their own:
597. And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:
598. And many weeks a troop of carrion crows
599. Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers.'

600. And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:
601. 'I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,
602. Thy tongue has tript a little:  ask thyself.
603. The lady never made UNWILLING war
604. With those fine eyes:  she had her pleasure in it,
605. And made her good man jealous with good cause.
606. And lived there neither dame nor damsel then
607. Wroth at a lover's loss? were all as tame,
608. I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?
609. Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,
610. Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink,
611. Or make her paler with a poisoned rose?
612. Well, those were not our days:  but did they find
613. A wizard?  Tell me, was he like to thee?

614. She ceased, and made her lithe arm round his neck
615. Tighten, and then drew back, and let her eyes
616. Speak for her, glowing on him, like a bride's
617. On her new lord, her own, the first of men.

618. He answered laughing, 'Nay, not like to me.
619. At last they found--his foragers for charms--
620. A little glassy-headed hairless man,
621. Who lived alone in a great wild on grass;
622. Read but one book, and ever reading grew
623. So grated down and filed away with thought,
624. So lean his eyes were monstrous; while the skin
625. Clung but to crate and basket, ribs and spine.
626. And since he kept his mind on one sole aim,
627. Nor ever touched fierce wine, nor tasted flesh,
628. Nor owned a sensual wish, to him the wall
629. That sunders ghosts and shadow-casting men
630. Became a crystal, and he saw them through it,
631. And heard their voices talk behind the wall,
632. And learnt their elemental secrets, powers
633. And forces; often o'er the sun's bright eye
634. Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud,
635. And lashed it at the base with slanting storm;
636. Or in the noon of mist and driving rain,
637. When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared,
638. And the cairned mountain was a shadow, sunned
639. The world to peace again:  here was the man.
640. And so by force they dragged him to the King.
641. And then he taught the King to charm the Queen
642. In such-wise, that no man could see her more,
643. Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm,
644. Coming and going, and she lay as dead,
645. And lost all use of life:  but when the King
646. Made proffer of the league of golden mines,
647. The province with a hundred miles of coast,
648. The palace and the princess, that old man
649. Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass,
650. And vanished, and his book came down to me.'

651. And Vivien answered smiling saucily:
652. 'Ye have the book:  the charm is written in it:
653. Good:  take my counsel:  let me know it at once:
654. For keep it like a puzzle chest in chest,
655. With each chest locked and padlocked thirty-fold,
656. And whelm all this beneath as vast a mound
657. As after furious battle turfs the slain
658. On some wild down above the windy deep,
659. I yet should strike upon a sudden means
660. To dig, pick, open, find and read the charm:
661. Then, if I tried it, who should blame me then?'

662. And smiling as a master smiles at one
663. That is not of his school, nor any school
664. But that where blind and naked Ignorance
665. Delivers brawling judgments, unashamed,
666. On all things all day long, he answered her:

667. 'Thou read the book, my pretty Vivien!
668. O ay, it is but twenty pages long,
669. But every page having an ample marge,
670. And every marge enclosing in the midst
671. A square of text that looks a little blot,
672. The text no larger than the limbs of fleas;
673. And every square of text an awful charm,
674. Writ in a language that has long gone by.
675. So long, that mountains have arisen since
676. With cities on their flanks--thou read the book!
677. And ever margin scribbled, crost, and crammed
678. With comment, densest condensation, hard
679. To mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights
680. Of my long life have made it easy to me.
681. And none can read the text, not even I;
682. And none can read the comment but myself;
683. And in the comment did I find the charm.
684. O, the results are simple; a mere child
685. Might use it to the harm of anyone,
686. And never could undo it:  ask no more:
687. For though you should not prove it upon me,
688. But keep that oath ye sware, ye might, perchance,
689. Assay it on some one of the Table Round,
690. And all because ye dream they babble of you.'

691. And Vivien, frowning in true anger, said:
692. 'What dare the full-fed liars say of me?
693. THEY ride abroad redressing human wrongs!
694. They sit with knife in meat and wine in horn!
695. THEY bound to holy vows of chastity!
696. Were I not woman, I could tell a tale.
697. But you are man, you well can understand
698. The shame that cannot be explained for shame.
699. Not one of all the drove should touch me:  swine!'

700. Then answered Merlin careless of her words:
701. 'You breathe but accusation vast and vague,
702. Spleen-born, I think, and proofless.  If ye know,
703. Set up the charge ye know, to stand or fall!'

704. And Vivien answered frowning wrathfully:
705. 'O ay, what say ye to Sir Valence, him
706. Whose kinsman left him watcher o'er his wife
707. And two fair babes, and went to distant lands;
708. Was one year gone, and on returning found
709. Not two but three? there lay the reckling, one
710. But one hour old!  What said the happy sire?'
711. A seven-months' babe had been a truer gift.
712. Those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood.'

713. Then answered Merlin, 'Nay, I know the tale.
714. Sir Valence wedded with an outland dame:
715. Some cause had kept him sundered from his wife:
716. One child they had:  it lived with her:  she died:
717. His kinsman travelling on his own affair
718. Was charged by Valence to bring home the child.
719. He brought, not found it therefore:  take the truth.'

720. 'O ay,' said Vivien, 'overtrue a tale.
721. What say ye then to sweet Sir Sagramore,
722. That ardent man? "to pluck the flower in season,"
723. So says the song, "I trow it is no treason."
724. O Master, shall we call him overquick
725. To crop his own sweet rose before the hour?'

726. And Merlin answered, 'Overquick art thou
727. To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing
728. Of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey
729. Is man's good name:  he never wronged his bride.
730. I know the tale.  An angry gust of wind
731. Puffed out his torch among the myriad-roomed
732. And many-corridored complexities
733. Of Arthur's palace:  then he found a door,
734. And darkling felt the sculptured ornament
735. That wreathen round it made it seem his own;
736. And wearied out made for the couch and slept,
737. A stainless man beside a stainless maid;
738. And either slept, nor knew of other there;
739. Till the high dawn piercing the royal rose
740. In Arthur's casement glimmered chastely down,
741. Blushing upon them blushing, and at once
742. He rose without a word and parted from her:
743. But when the thing was blazed about the court,
744. The brute world howling forced them into bonds,
745. And as it chanced they are happy, being pure.'

746. 'O ay,' said Vivien, 'that were likely too.
747. What say ye then to fair Sir Percivale
748. And of the horrid foulness that he wrought,
749. The saintly youth, the spotless lamb of Christ,
750. Or some black wether of St Satan's fold.
751. What, in the precincts of the chapel-yard,
752. Among the knightly brasses of the graves,
753. And by the cold Hic Jacets of the dead!'

754. And Merlin answered careless of her charge,
755. 'A sober man is Percivale and pure;
756. But once in life was flustered with new wine,
757. Then paced for coolness in the chapel-yard;
758. Where one of Satan's shepherdesses caught
759. And meant to stamp him with her master's mark;
760. And that he sinned is not believable;
761. For, look upon his face!--but if he sinned,
762. The sin that practice burns into the blood,
763. And not the one dark hour which brings remorse,
764. Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be:
765. Or else were he, the holy king, whose hymns
766. Are chanted in the minster, worse than all.
767. But is your spleen frothed out, or have ye more?'

768. And Vivien answered frowning yet in wrath:
769. 'O ay; what say ye to Sir Lancelot, friend
770. Traitor or true? that commerce with the Queen,
771. I ask you, is it clamoured by the child,
772. Or whispered in the corner? do ye know it?'

773. To which he answered sadly, 'Yea, I know it.
774. Sir Lancelot went ambassador, at first,
775. To fetch her, and she watched him from her walls.
776. A rumour runs, she took him for the King,
777. So fixt her fancy on him:  let them be.
778. But have ye no one word of loyal praise
779. For Arthur, blameless King and stainless man?'

780. She answered with a low and chuckling laugh:
781. 'Man! is he man at all, who knows and winks?
782. Sees what his fair bride is and does, and winks?
783. By which the good King means to blind himself,
784. And blinds himself and all the Table Round
785. To all the foulness that they work.  Myself
786. Could call him (were it not for womanhood)
787. The pretty, popular cause such manhood earns,
788. Could call him the main cause of all their crime;
789. Yea, were he not crowned King, coward, and fool.'

790. Then Merlin to his own heart, loathing, said:
791. 'O true and tender!  O my liege and King!
792. O selfless man and stainless gentleman,
793. Who wouldst against thine own eye-witness fain
794. Have all men true and leal, all women pure;
795. How, in the mouths of base interpreters,
796. From over-fineness not intelligible
797. To things with every sense as false and foul
798. As the poached filth that floods the middle street,
799. Is thy white blamelessness accounted blame!'

800. But Vivien, deeming Merlin overborne
801. By instance, recommenced, and let her tongue
802. Rage like a fire among the noblest names,
803. Polluting, and imputing her whole self,
804. Defaming and defacing, till she left
805. Not even Lancelot brave, nor Galahad clean.

806. Her words had issue other than she willed.
807. He dragged his eyebrow bushes down, and made
808. A snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes,
809. And muttered in himself, 'Tell HER the charm!
810. So, if she had it, would she rail on me
811. To snare the next, and if she have it not
812. So will she rail.  What did the wanton say?
813. "Not mount as high;" we scarce can sink as low:
814. For men at most differ as Heaven and earth,
815. But women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.
816. I know the Table Round, my friends of old;
817. All brave, and many generous, and some chaste.
818. She cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies;
819. I well believe she tempted them and failed,
820. Being so bitter:  for fine plots may fail,
821. Though harlots paint their talk as well as face
822. With colours of the heart that are not theirs.
823. I will not let her know:  nine tithes of times
824. Face-flatterer and backbiter are the same.
825. And they, sweet soul, that most impute a crime
826. Are pronest to it, and impute themselves,
827. Wanting the mental range; or low desire
828. Not to feel lowest makes them level all;
829. Yea, they would pare the mountain to the plain,
830. To leave an equal baseness; and in this
831. Are harlots like the crowd, that if they find
832. Some stain or blemish in a name of note,
833. Not grieving that their greatest are so small,
834. Inflate themselves with some insane delight,
835. And judge all nature from her feet of clay,
836. Without the will to lift their eyes, and see
837. Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire,
838. And touching other worlds.  I am weary of her.'

839. He spoke in words part heard, in whispers part,
840. Half-suffocated in the hoary fell
841. And many-wintered fleece of throat and chin.
842. But Vivien, gathering somewhat of his mood,
843. And hearing 'harlot' muttered twice or thrice,
844. Leapt from her session on his lap, and stood
845. Stiff as a viper frozen; loathsome sight,
846. How from the rosy lips of life and love,
847. Flashed the bare-grinning skeleton of death!
848. White was her cheek; sharp breaths of anger puffed
849. Her fairy nostril out; her hand half-clenched
850. Went faltering sideways downward to her belt,
851. And feeling; had she found a dagger there
852. (For in a wink the false love turns to hate)
853. She would have stabbed him; but she found it not:
854. His eye was calm, and suddenly she took
855. To bitter weeping like a beaten child,
856. A long, long weeping, not consolable.
857. Then her false voice made way, broken with sobs:

858. 'O crueller than was ever told in tale,
859. Or sung in song!  O vainly lavished love!
860. O cruel, there was nothing wild or strange,
861. Or seeming shameful--for what shame in love,
862. So love be true, and not as yours is--nothing
863. Poor Vivien had not done to win his trust
864. Who called her what he called her--all her crime,
865. All--all--the wish to prove him wholly hers.'

866. She mused a little, and then clapt her hands
867. Together with a wailing shriek, and said:
868. 'Stabbed through the heart's affections to the heart!
869. Seethed like the kid in its own mother's milk!
870. Killed with a word worse than a life of blows!
871. I thought that he was gentle, being great:
872. O God, that I had loved a smaller man!
873. I should have found in him a greater heart.
874. O, I, that flattering my true passion, saw
875. The knights, the court, the King, dark in your light,
876. Who loved to make men darker than they are,
877. Because of that high pleasure which I had
878. To seat you sole upon my pedestal
879. Of worship--I am answered, and henceforth
880. The course of life that seemed so flowery to me
881. With you for guide and master, only you,
882. Becomes the sea-cliff pathway broken short,
883. And ending in a ruin--nothing left,
884. But into some low cave to crawl, and there,
885. If the wolf spare me, weep my life away,
886. Killed with inutterable unkindliness.'

887. She paused, she turned away, she hung her head,
888. The snake of gold slid from her hair, the braid
889. Slipt and uncoiled itself, she wept afresh,
890. And the dark wood grew darker toward the storm
891. In silence, while his anger slowly died
892. Within him, till he let his wisdom go
893. For ease of heart, and half believed her true:
894. Called her to shelter in the hollow oak,
895. 'Come from the storm,' and having no reply,
896. Gazed at the heaving shoulder, and the face
897. Hand-hidden, as for utmost grief or shame;
898. Then thrice essayed, by tenderest-touching terms,
899. To sleek her ruffled peace of mind, in vain.
900. At last she let herself be conquered by him,
901. And as the cageling newly flown returns,
902. The seeming-injured simple-hearted thing
903. Came to her old perch back, and settled there.
904. There while she sat, half-falling from his knees,
905. Half-nestled at his heart, and since he saw
906. The slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet,
907. About her, more in kindness than in love,
908. The gentle wizard cast a shielding arm.
909. But she dislinked herself at once and rose,
910. Her arms upon her breast across, and stood,
911. A virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged,
912. Upright and flushed before him:  then she said:

913. 'There must now be no passages of love
914. Betwixt us twain henceforward evermore;
915. Since, if I be what I am grossly called,
916. What should be granted which your own gross heart
917. Would reckon worth the taking?  I will go.
918. In truth, but one thing now--better have died
919. Thrice than have asked it once--could make me stay--
920. That proof of trust--so often asked in vain!
921. How justly, after that vile term of yours,
922. I find with grief!  I might believe you then,
923. Who knows? once more.  Lo! what was once to me
924. Mere matter of the fancy, now hath grown
925. The vast necessity of heart and life.
926. Farewell; think gently of me, for I fear
927. My fate or folly, passing gayer youth
928. For one so old, must be to love thee still.
929. But ere I leave thee let me swear once more
930. That if I schemed against thy peace in this,
931. May yon just heaven, that darkens o'er me, send
932. One flash, that, missing all things else, may make
933. My scheming brain a cinder, if I lie.'

934. Scarce had she ceased, when out of heaven a bolt
935. (For now the storm was close above them) struck,
936. Furrowing a giant oak, and javelining
937. With darted spikes and splinters of the wood
938. The dark earth round.  He raised his eyes and saw
939. The tree that shone white-listed through the gloom.
940. But Vivien, fearing heaven had heard her oath,
941. And dazzled by the livid-flickering fork,
942. And deafened with the stammering cracks and claps
943. That followed, flying back and crying out,
944. 'O Merlin, though you do not love me, save,
945. Yet save me!' clung to him and hugged him close;
946. And called him dear protector in her fright,
947. Nor yet forgot her practice in her fright,
948. But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close.

970. And lost to life and use and name and fame.

971. Then crying 'I have made his glory mine,'
972. And shrieking out 'O fool!' the harlot leapt
973. Adown the forest, and the thicket closed
974. Behind her, and the forest echoed 'fool.'
