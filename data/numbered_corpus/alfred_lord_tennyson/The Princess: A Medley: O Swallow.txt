1. O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,
2. Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,
3. And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.
4. O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,
5. That bright and fierce and fickle is the South,
6. And dark and true and tender is the North.
7. O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light
8. Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,
9. And cheep and twitter twenty million loves.

10. O were I thou that she might take me in,
11. And lay me on her bosom, and her heart
12. Would rock the snowy cradle till I died.

13. Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,
14. Delaying as the tender ash delays
15. To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?

16. O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:
17. Say to her, I do but wanton in the South,
18. But in the North long since my nest is made.

19. O tell her, brief is life but love is long,
20. And brief the sun of summer in the North,
21. And brief the moon of beauty in the South.

22. O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,
23. Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,
24. And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.
