1. Thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums,
2. That beat to battle where he stands;
3. Thy face across his fancy comes,
4. And gives the battle to his hands:
5. A moment, while the trumpets blow,
6. He sees his brood about thy knee;
7. The next, like fire he meets the foe,
8. And strikes him dead for thine and thee.
