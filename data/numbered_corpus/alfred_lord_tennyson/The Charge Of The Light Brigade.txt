1. Half a league, half a league,
2. Half a league onward,
3. All in the valley of Death
4. Rode the six hundred.
5. 'Forward, the Light Brigade!
6. Charge for the guns!' he said:
7. Into the valley of Death
8. Rode the six hundred.

9. 'Forward, the Light Brigade!'
10. Was there a man dismay'd ?
11. Not tho' the soldier knew
12. Some one had blunder'd:
13. Their's not to make reply,
14. Their's not to reason why,
15. Their's but to do and die:
16. Into the valley of Death
17. Rode the six hundred.

18. Cannon to right of them,
19. Cannon to left of them,
20. Cannon in front of them
21. Volley'd and thunder'd;
22. Storm'd at with shot and shell,
23. Boldly they rode and well,
24. Into the jaws of Death,
25. Into the mouth of Hell
26. Rode the six hundred.

27. Flash'd all their sabres bare,
28. Flash'd as they turn'd in air
29. Sabring the gunners there,
30. Charging an army, while
31. All the world wonder'd:
32. Plunged in the battery-smoke
33. Right thro' the line they broke;
34. Cossack and Russian
35. Reel'd from the sabre-stroke
36. Shatter'd and sunder'd.
37. Then they rode back, but not
38. Not the six hundred.

39. Cannon to right of them,
40. Cannon to left of them,
41. Cannon behind them
42. Volley'd and thunder'd;
43. Storm'd at with shot and shell,
44. While horse and hero fell,
45. They that had fought so well
46. Came thro' the jaws of Death,
47. Back from the mouth of Hell,
48. All that was left of them,
49. Left of six hundred.

50. When can their glory fade ?
51. O the wild charge they made!
52. All the world wonder'd.
53. Honour the charge they made!
54. Honour the Light Brigade,
55. Noble six hundred!
