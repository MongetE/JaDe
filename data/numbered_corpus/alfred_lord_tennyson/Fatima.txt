1. O LOVE, Love, Love! O withering might!
2. O sun, that from thy noonday height
3. Shudderest when I strain my sight,
4. Throbbing thro' all thy heat and light,
5. Lo, falling from my constant mind,
6. Lo, parch'd and wither'd, deaf and blind,
7. I whirl like leaves in roaring wind.

8. Last night I wasted hateful hours
9. Below the city's eastern towers:
10. I thirsted for the brooks, the showers:
11. I roll'd among the tender flowers:
12. I crush'd them on my breast, my mouth;
13. I look'd athwart the burning drouth
14. Of that long desert to the south.

15. Last night, when some one spoke his name,
16. From my swift blood that went and came
17. A thousand little shafts of flame
18. Were shiver'd in my narrow frame.
19. O Love, O fire! once he drew
20. With one long kiss my whole soul thro'
21. My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew.

22. Before he mounts the hill, I know
23. He cometh quickly: from below
24. Sweet gales, as from deep gardens, blow
25. Before him, striking on my brow.
26. In my dry brain my spirit soon,
27. Down-deepening from swoon to swoon,
28. Faints like a daled morning moon.

29. The wind sounds like a silver wire,
30. And from beyond the noon a fire
31. Is pour'd upon the hills, and nigher
32. The skies stoop down in their desire;
33. And, isled in sudden seas of light,
34. My heart, pierced thro' with fierce delight,
35. Bursts into blossom in his sight.

36. My whole soul waiting silently,
37. All naked in a sultry sky,
38. Droops blinded with his shining eye:
39. I will possess him or will die.
40. I will grow round him in his place,
41. Grow, live, die looking on his face,
42. Die, dying clasp'd in his embrace.
