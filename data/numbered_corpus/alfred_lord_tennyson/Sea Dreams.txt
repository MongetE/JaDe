1. A city clerk, but gently born and bred;
2. His wife, an unknown artist's orphan child-
3. One babe was theirs, a Margaret, three years old:
4. They, thinking that her clear germander eye
5. Droopt in the giant-factoried city-gloom,
6. Came, with a month's leave given them, to the sea:
7. For which his gains were dock'd, however small:
8. Small were his gains, and hard his work; besides,
9. Their slender household fortunes (for the man
10. Had risk'd his little)  like the little thrift,
11. Trembled in perilous places o'er a deep:
12. And oft, when sitting all alone, his face
13. Would darken, as he cursed his credulousness,
14. And that one unctuous mount which lured him, rogue,
15. To buy strange shares in some Peruvian mine.
16. Now seaward-bound for health they gain'd a coast,
17. All sand and cliff and deep-inrunning cave,
18. At close of day; slept, woke, and went the next,
19. The Sabbath, pious variers from the church,
20. To chapel; where a heated pulpiteer,
21. Not preaching simple Christ to simple men,
22. Announced the coming doom, and fulminated
23. Against the scarlet woman and her creed:
24. For sideways up he swung his arms, and shriek'd
25. `Thus, thus with violence,' ev'n as if he held
26. The Apocalyptic millstone, and himself
27. Were that great Angel; `Thus with violence
28. Shall Babylon be cast into the sea;
29. Then comes the close.'  The gentle-hearted wife
30. Sat shuddering at the ruin of a world;
31. He at his own: but when the wordy storm
32. Had ended, forth they came and paced the shore,
33. Ran in and out the long sea-framing caves,
34. Drank the large air, and saw, but scarce believed
35. (The sootflake of so many a summer still
36. Clung to their fancies)  that they saw, the sea.
37. So now on sand they walk'd, and now on cliff,
38. Lingering about the thymy promontories,
39. Till all the sails were darken'd in the west,
40. And rosed in the east: then homeward and to bed:
41. Where she, who kept a tender Christian hope
42. Haunting a holy text, and still to that
43. Returning, as the bird returns, at night,
44. `Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,'
45. Said, `Love, forgive him:' but he did not speak;
46. And silenced by that silence lay the wife,
47. Remembering her dear Lord who died for all,
48. And musing on the little lives of men,
49. And how they mar this little by their feuds.

50. But while the two were sleeping, a full tide
51. Rose with ground-swell, which, on the foremost rocks
52. Touching, upjetted in spirts of wild sea-smoke,
53. And scaled in sheets of wasteful foam, and fell
54. In vast sea-cataracts- ever and anon
55. Dead claps of thunder from within the cliffs
56. Heard thro' the living roar.  At this the babe,
57. Their Margaret cradled near them, wail'd and woke
58. The mother, and the father suddenly cried,
59. `A wreck, a wreck! ' then turn'd, and groaning said,

60. `Forgive!  How many will say, 'forgive,' and find
61. A sort of absolution in the sound
62. To hate a little longer!  No; the sin
63. That neither God nor man can well forgive,
64. Hypocrisy, I saw it in him at once.
65. Is it so true that second thoughts are best?
66. Not first, and third, which are a riper first?
67. Too ripe, too late! they come too late for use.
68. Ah love, there surely lives in man and beast
69. Something divine to warn them of their foes:
70. And such a sense, when first I fronted him,
71. Said, 'trust him not; ' but after, when I came
72. To know him more, I lost it, knew him less;
73. Fought with what seem'd my own uncharity;
74. Sat at his table; drank his costly wines;
75. Made more and more allowance for his talk;
76. Went further, fool! and trusted him with all,
77. All my poor scrapings from a dozen years
78. Of dust and deskwork: there is no such mine,
79. None; but a gulf of ruin, swallowing gold,
80. Not making.  Ruin'd! ruin'd! the sea roars
81. Ruin: a fearful night! '

82. `Not fearful; fair,'
83. Said the good wife, `if every star in heaven
84. Can make it fair: you do but bear the tide.
85. Had you ill dreams? '

86. `O yes,' he said, `I dream'd
87. Of such a tide swelling toward the land,
88. And I from out the boundless outer deep
89. Swept with it to the shore, and enter'd one
90. Of those dark caves that run beneath the cliffs.
91. I thought the motion of the boundless deep
92. Bore through the cave, and I was heaved upon it
93. In darkness: then I saw one lovely star
94. Larger and larger.  'What a world,' I thought,
95. 'To live in! ' but in moving I found
96. Only the landward exit of the cave,
97. Bright with the sun upon the stream beyond:
98. And near the light a giant woman sat,
99. All over earthy, like a piece of earth,
100. A pickaxe in her hand: then out I slipt
101. Into a land all of sun and blossom, trees
102. As high as heaven, and every bird that sings:
103. And here the night-light flickering in my eyes
104. Awoke me.'

105. `That was then your dream,' she said,
106. `Not sad, but sweet.'

107. `So sweet, I lay,' said he,
108. `And mused upon it, drifting up the stream
109. In fancy, till I slept again, and pieced
110. The broken vision; for I dream'd that still
111. The motion of the great deep bore me on,
112. And that the woman walk'd upon the brink:
113. I wonder'd at her strength, and ask'd her of it:
114. 'It came,' she said, 'by working in the mines:'
115. O then to ask her of my shares, I thought;
116. And ask'd; but not a word; she shook her head.
117. And then the motion of the current ceased,
118. And there was rolling thunder; and we reach'd
119. A mountain, like a wall of burs and thorns;
120. But she with her strong feet up the steep hill
121. Trod out a path: I follow'd; and at top
122. She pointed seaward: there a fleet of glass,
123. That seem'd a fleet of jewels under me,
124. Sailing along before a gloomy cloud
125. That not one moment ceased to thunder, past
126. In sunshine: right across its track there lay,
127. Down in the water, a long reef of gold,
128. Or what seem'd gold: and I was glad at first
129. To think that in our often-ransack'd world
130. Still so much gold was left; and then I fear'd
131. Lest the gay navy there should splinter on it,
132. And fearing waved my arm to warn them off;
133. An idle signal, for the brittle fleet
134. (I thought I could have died to save it)  near'd,
135. Touch'd, clink'd, and clash'd, and vanish'd, and I woke,
136. I heard the clash so clearly.  Now I see
137. My dream was Life; the woman honest Work;
138. And my poor venture but a fleet of glass
139. Wreck'd on a reef of visionary gold.'

140. `Nay,' said the kindly wife to comfort him,
141. `You raised your arm, you tumbled down and broke
142. The glass with little Margaret's medicine it it;
143. And, breaking that, you made and broke your dream:
144. A trifle makes a dream, a trifle breaks.'

145. `No trifle,' groan'd the husband; `yesterday
146. I met him suddenly in the street, and ask'd
147. That which I ask'd the woman in my dream.
148. Like her, he shook his head.  'Show me the books! '
149. He dodged me with a long and loose account.
150. 'The books, the books! ' but he, he could not wait,
151. Bound on a matter he of life and death:
152. When the great Books (see Daniel seven and ten)
153. Were open'd, I should find he meant me well;
154. And then began to bloat himself, and ooze
155. All over with the fat affectionate smile
156. That makes the widow lean.  'My dearest friend,
157. Have faith, have faith!  We live by faith,' said he;
158. 'And all things work together for the good
159. Of those'- it makes me sick to quote him- last
160. Gript my hand hard, and with God-bless-you went.
161. I stood like one that had received a blow:
162. I found a hard friend in his loose accounts,
163. A loose one in the hard grip of his hand,
164. A curse in his God-bless-you: then my eyes
165. Pursued him down the street, and far away,
166. Among the honest shoulders of the crowd,
167. Read rascal in the motions of his back,
168. And scoundrel in the supple-sliding knee.'

169. `Was he so bound, poor soul? ' said the good wife;
170. `So are we all: but do not call him, love,
171. Before you prove him, rogue, and proved, forgive.
172. His gain is loss; for he that wrongs his friend
173. Wrongs himself more, and ever bears about
174. A silent court of justice in his breast,
175. Himself the judge and jury, and himself
176. The prisoner at the bar, ever condemn'd:
177. And that drags down his life: then comes what comes
178. Hereafter: and he meant, he said he meant,
179. Perhaps he meant, or partly meant, you well.'

180. ` 'With all his conscience and one eye askew'-
181. Love, let me quote these lines, that you may learn
182. A man is likewise counsel for himself,
183. Too often, in that silent court of yours-
184. 'With all his conscience and one eye askew,
185. So false, he partly took himself for true;
186. Whose pious talk, when most his heart was dry,
187. Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye;
188. Who, never naming God except for gain,
189. So never took that useful name in vain;
190. Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool,
191. And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool;
192. Nor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace he forged,
193. And snakelike slimed his victim ere he gorged;
194. And oft at Bible meetings, o'er the rest
195. Arising, did his holy oily best,
196. Dropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven,
197. To spread the Word by which himself had thriven.'
198. How like you this old satire? '

199. `Nay,' she said
200. `I loathe it: he had never kindly heart,
201. Nor ever cared to better his own kind,
202. Who first wrote satire, with no pity in it.
203. But will you hear MY dream, for I had one
204. That altogether went to music?  Still
205. It awed me.'

206. Then she told it, having dream'd
207. Of that same coast.

208. - But round the North, a light,
209. A belt, it seem'd, of luminous vapor, lay,
210. And ever in it a low musical note
211. Swell'd up and died; and, as it swell'd, a ridge
212. Of breaker issued from the belt, and still
213. Grew with the growing note, and when the note
214. Had reach'd a thunderous fullness, on those cliffs
215. Broke, mixt with awful light (the same as that
216. Living within the belt)  whereby she saw
217. That all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more,
218. But huge cathedral fronts of every age,
219. Grave, florid, stern, as far as eye could see.
220. One after one: and then the great ridge drew,
221. Lessening to the lessening music, back,
222. And past into the belt and swell'd again
223. Slowly to music: ever when it broke
224. The statues, king or saint, or founder fell;
225. Then from the gaps and chasms of ruin left
226. Came men and women in dark clusters round,
227. Some crying, 'Set them up! they shall not fall! '
228. And others 'Let them lie, for they have fall'n.'
229. And still they strove and wrangled: and she grieved
230. In her strange dream, she knew not why, to find
231. Their wildest wailings never out of tune
232. With that sweet note; and ever as their shrieks
233. Ran highest up the gamut, that great wave
234. Returning, while none mark'd it, on the crowd
235. Broke, mixt with awful light, and show'd their eyes
236. Glaring, and passionate looks, and swept away
237. The men of flesh and blood, and men of stone,
238. To the waste deeps together.

239. `Then I fixt
240. My wistful eyes on two fair images,
241. Both crown'd with stars and high among the stars,-
242. The Virgin Mother standing with her child
243. High up on one of those dark minster-fronts-
244. Till she began to totter, and the child
245. Clung to the mother, and sent out a cry
246. Which mixt with little Margaret's, and I woke,
247. And my dream awed me:- well- but what are dreams?
248. Yours came but from the breaking of a glass,
249. And mine but from the crying of a child.'

250. `Child?  No! ' said he, `but this tide's roar, and his,
251. Our Boanerges with his threats of doom,
252. And loud-lung'd Antibabylonianisms
253. (Altho' I grant but little music there)
254. Went both to make your dream: but if there were
255. A music harmonizing our wild cries,
256. Sphere-music such as that you dream'd about,
257. Why, that would make our passions far too like
258. The discords dear to the musician.  No-
259. One shriek of hate would jar all the hymns of heaven:
260. True Devils with no ear, they howl in tune
261. With nothing but the Devil! '

262. `'True' indeed!
263. One of our town, but later by an hour
264. Here than ourselves, spoke with me on the shore;
265. While you were running down the sands, and made
266. The dimpled flounce of the sea-furbelow flap,
267. Good man, to please the child.  She brought strange news.
268. Why were you silent when I spoke to-night?
269. I had set my heart on your forgiving him
270. Before you knew.  We MUST forgive the dead.'

271. `Dead! who is dead? '

272. `The man your eye pursued.
273. A little after you had parted with him,
274. He suddenly dropt dead of heart-disease.'

275. `Dead? he? of heart-disease? what heart had he
276. To die of? dead! '

277. `Ah, dearest, if there be
278. A devil in man, there is an angel too,
279. And if he did that wrong you charge him with,
280. His angel broke his heart.  But your rough voice
281. (You spoke so loud)  has roused the child again.
282. Sleep, little birdie, sleep! will she not sleep
283. Without her 'little birdie? ' well then, sleep,
284. And I will sing you 'birdie.''

285. Saying this,
286. The woman half turn'd round from him she loved,
287. Left him one hand, and reaching thro' the night
288. Her other, found (for it was close beside)
289. And half embraced the basket cradle-head
290. With one soft arm, which, like the pliant bough
291. That moving moves the nest and nestling, sway'd
292. The cradle, while she sang this baby song.

293. What does the little birdie say
294. In her nest at peep of day?
295. Let me fly, says little birdie,
296. Mother, let me fly away.
297. Birdie, rest a little longer,
298. Till the little wings are stronger.
299. So she rests a little longer,
300. Then she flies away.

301. What does little baby say,
302. In her bed at peep of day?
303. Baby says, like little birdie,
304. Let me rise and fly away.
305. Baby, sleep a little longer,
306. Till the little limbs are stronger.
307. If she sleeps a little longer,
308. Baby too shall fly away.

309. `She sleeps: let us too, let all evil, sleep.
310. He also sleeps- another sleep than ours.
311. He can do no more wrong: forgive him, dear,
312. And I shall sleep the sounder! '

313. Then the man,
314. `His deeds yet live, the worst is yet to come.
315. Yet let your sleep for this one night be sound:
316. I do forgive him! '

317. `Thanks, my love,' she said,
318. `Your own will be the sweeter,' and they slept.
