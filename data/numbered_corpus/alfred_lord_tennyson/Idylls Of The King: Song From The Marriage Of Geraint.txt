1. Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud;
2. Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud;
3. Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.
4. Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;
5. With that wild wheel we go not up or down;
6. Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.

7. Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;
8. Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;
9. For man is man and master of his fate.

10. Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;
11. Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;
12. Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.
