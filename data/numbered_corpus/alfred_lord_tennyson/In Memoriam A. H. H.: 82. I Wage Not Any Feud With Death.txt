1. I wage not any feud with Death
2. For changes wrought on form and face;
3. No lower life that earth's embrace
4. May breed with him, can fright my faith.
5. Eternal process moving on,
6. From state to state the spirit walks;
7. And these are but the shatter'd stalks,
8. Or ruin'd chrysalis of one.
9. Nor blame I Death, because he bare
10. The use of virtue out of earth:
11. I know transplanted human worth
12. Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.

13. For this alone on Death I wreak
14. The wrath that garners in my heart;
15. He put our lives so far apart
16. We cannot hear each other speak.
