1. Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!
2. Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.
3. Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.
4. No light had we: for that we do repent;
5. And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.
6. Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.
7. No light: so late! and dark and chill the night!
8. O, let us in, that we may find the light!
9. Too late, too late: ye cannot enter now.

10. Have we not heard the bridgegroom is so sweet?
11. O, let us in, tho' late, to kiss his feet!
12. No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now."
