1. Birds' love and birds' song
2. Flying here and there,
3. Birds' songand birds' love
4. And you with gold for hair!
5. Birds' songand birds' love
6. Passing with the weather,
7. Men's song and men's love,
8. To love once and forever.

9. Men's love and birds' love,
10. And women's love and men's!
11. And you my wren with a crown of gold,
12. You my queen of the wrens!
13. You the queen of the wrens --
14. We'll be birds of a feather,
15. I'll be King of the Queen of the wrens,
16. And all in a nest together.
