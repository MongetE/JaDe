1. 'Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;
2. Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;
3. Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:
4. The fire-fly wakens: wake thou with me.

5. Now droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost,
6. And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.

7. Now lies the Earth all DanaÃ« to the stars,
8. And all thy heart lies open unto me.

9. Now lies the silent meteor on, and leaves
10. A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.

11. Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,
12. And slips into the bosom of the lake:
13. So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip
14. Into my bosom and be lost in me.'
