1. It is the miller's daughter,
2. And she is grown so dear, so dear,
3. That I would be the jewel
4. That trembles in her ear:
5. For hid in ringlets day and night,
6. I'd touch her neck so warm and white.

7. And I would be the girdle
8. About her dainty dainty waist,
9. And her heart would beat against me,
10. In sorrow and in rest:
11. And I should know if it beat right,
12. I'd clasp it round so close and tight.

13. And I would be the necklace,
14. And all day long to fall and rise
15. Upon her balmy bosom,
16. With her laughter or her sighs:
17. And I would lie so light, so light,
18. I scarce should be unclasp'd at night.
