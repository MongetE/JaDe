1. 'Your ringlets, your ringlets,
2. That look so golden-gay,
3. If you will give me one, but one,
4. To kiss it night and day,
5. The never chilling touch of Time
6. Will turn it silver-gray;
7. And then shall I know it is all true gold
8. To flame and sparkle and stream as of old.
9. Till all the comets in heaven are cold,
10. And all her stars decay.'
11. 'Then take it, love, and put it by;
12. This cannot change, nor yet can I.'

13. 'My ringlet, my ringlet,
14. That art so golden-gay,
15. Now never chilling touch of Time
16. Can turn thee silver-gray;
17. And a lad may wink, and a girl may hint,
18. And a fool may say his say;
19. For my doubts and fears were all amiss,
20. And I swear henceforth by this and this,
21. That a doubt will only come for a kiss,
22. And a fear to be kiss'd away.'
23. 'Then kiss it, love, and put it by:
24. If this can change, why so can I.'

25. O Ringlet, O Ringlet,
26. I kiss'd you night and day,
27. And Ringlet, O Ringlet,
28. You still are golden-gay,
29. But Ringlet, O Ringlet,
30. You should be silver-gray:
31. For what is this which now I'm told,
32. I that took you for true gold,
33. She that gave you 's bought and sold,
34. Sold, sold.

35. O Ringlet, O Ringlet,
36. She blush'd a rosy red,
37. When Ringlet, O Ringlet
38. She clipt you from her head,
39. And Ringlet, O Ringlet,
40. She gave you me, and said,
41. 'Come, kiss it, love and put it by:
42. If this can change, why so can I.'
43. O fie, you golden nothing, fie,
44. You golden lie.

45. O Ringlet, O Ringlet,
46. I count you much to blame,
47. For Ringlet, O Ringlet,
48. You put me much to shame,
49. So Ringlet, O Ringlet,
50. I doom you to the flame.
51. For what is this which now I learn,
52. Has given all my faith a turn?
53. Burn, you glossy heretic, burn,
54. Burn, burn.
