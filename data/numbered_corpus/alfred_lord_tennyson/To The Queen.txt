1. O loyal to the royal in thyself,
2. And loyal to thy land, as this to thee--
3. Bear witness, that rememberable day,
4. When, pale as yet, and fever-worn, the Prince
5. Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again
6. From halfway down the shadow of the grave,
7. Past with thee through thy people and their love,
8. And London rolled one tide of joy through all
9. Her trebled millions, and loud leagues of man
10. And welcome! witness, too, the silent cry,
11. The prayer of many a race and creed, and clime--
12. Thunderless lightnings striking under sea
13. From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm,
14. And that true North, whereof we lately heard
15. A strain to shame us 'keep you to yourselves;
16. So loyal is too costly! friends--your love
17. Is but a burthen:  loose the bond, and go.'
18. Is this the tone of empire? here the faith
19. That made us rulers? this, indeed, her voice
20. And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont
21. Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven?
22. What shock has fooled her since, that she should speak
23. So feebly? wealthier--wealthier--hour by hour!
24. The voice of Britain, or a sinking land,
25. Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas?
26. THERE rang her voice, when the full city pealed
27. Thee and thy Prince!  The loyal to their crown
28. Are loyal to their own far sons, who love
29. Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes
30. For ever-broadening England, and her throne
31. In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle,
32. That knows not her own greatness:  if she knows
33. And dreads it we are fallen. --But thou, my Queen,
34. Not for itself, but through thy living love
35. For one to whom I made it o'er his grave
36. Sacred, accept this old imperfect tale,
37. New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul,
38. Ideal manhood closed in real man,
39. Rather than that gray king, whose name, a ghost,
40. Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak,
41. And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him
42. Of Geoffrey's book, or him of Malleor's, one
43. Touched by the adulterous finger of a time
44. That hovered between war and wantonness,
45. And crownings and dethronements:  take withal
46. Thy poet's blessing, and his trust that Heaven
47. Will blow the tempest in the distance back
48. From thine and ours:  for some are sacred, who mark,
49. Or wisely or unwisely, signs of storm,
50. Waverings of every vane with every wind,
51. And wordy trucklings to the transient hour,
52. And fierce or careless looseners of the faith,
53. And Softness breeding scorn of simple life,
54. Or Cowardice, the child of lust for gold,
55. Or Labour, with a groan and not a voice,
56. Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France,
57. And that which knows, but careful for itself,
58. And that which knows not, ruling that which knows
59. To its own harm:  the goal of this great world
60. Lies beyond sight:  yet--if our slowly-grown
61. And crowned Republic's crowning common-sense,
62. That saved her many times, not fail--their fears
63. Are morning shadows huger than the shapes
64. That cast them, not those gloomier which forego
65. The darkness of that battle in the West,
66. Where all of high and holy dies away.
