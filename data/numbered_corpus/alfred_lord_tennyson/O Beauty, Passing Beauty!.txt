1. O beauty, passing beauty! Sweetest sweet!
2. How can thou let me waste my youth in sighs?
3. I only ask to sit beside thy feet.
4. Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes.
5. Might I but kiss thy hand! I dare not fold
6. My arms about thee--scarcely dare to speak.
7. And nothing seems to me so wild and bold,
8. As with one kiss to touch thy blessed cheek.
9. Methinks if I should kiss thee, no control
10. Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat
11. The subtle spirit. Even while I spoke,
12. The bare word "kiss" hath made my inner soul
13. To tremble like a lute string, ere the note
14. Hath melted in the silence that it broke.
