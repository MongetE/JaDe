1. NIGHTINGALES warbled without,
2. Within was weeping for thee:
3. Shadows of three dead men
4. Walk'd in the walks with me:
5. Shadows of three dead men, and thou wast one of the three.

6. Nightingales sang in the woods:
7. The Master was far away:
8. Nightingales warbled and sang
9. Of a passion that lasts but a day;
10. Still in the house in his coffin the Prince of courtesy lay.

11. Two dead men have I known
12. In courtesy like to thee:
13. Two dead men have I loved
14. With a love that ever will be:
15. Three dead men have I loved, and thou art last of the three.
