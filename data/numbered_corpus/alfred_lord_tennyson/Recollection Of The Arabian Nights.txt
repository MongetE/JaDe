1. WHEN the breeze of a joyful dawn blew free
2. In the silken sail of infancy,
3. The tide of time flow'd back with me,
4. The forward-flowing tide of time;
5. And many a sheeny summer-morn,
6. Adown the Tigris I was borne,
7. By Bagdat's shrines of fretted gold,
8. High-walled gardens green and old;
9. True Mussulman was I and sworn,
10. For it was in the golden prime
11. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

12. Anight my shallop, rustling thro'
13. The low and bloomed foliage, drove
14. The fragrant, glistening deeps, and clove
15. The citron-shadows in the blue:
16. By garden porches on the brim,
17. The costly doors flung open wide,
18. Gold glittering thro' lamplight dim,
19. And broider'd sofas on each side:
20. In sooth it was a goodly time,
21. For it was in the golden prime
22. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

23. Often where clear-stemm'd platans guard
24. The outlet, did I turn away
25. The boat-head down a broad canal
26. From the main river sluiced, where all
27. The sloping of the moon-lit sward
28. Was damask-work, and deep inlay
29. Of braided blooms unmown, which crept
30. Adown to where the water slept.
31. A goodly place, a goodly time,
32. For it was in the golden prime
33. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

34. A motion from the river won
35. Ridged the smooth level, bearing on
36. My shallop thro' the star-strown calm,
37. Until another night in night
38. I enter'd, from the clearer light,
39. Imbower'd vaults of pillar'd palm,
40. Imprisoning sweets, which, as they clomb
41. Heavenward, were stay'd beneath the dome
42. Of hollow boughs.--A goodly time,
43. For it was in the golden prime
44. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

45. Still onward; and the clear canal
46. Is rounded to as clear a lake.
47. From the green rivage many a fall
48. Of diamond rillets musical,
49. Thro' little crystal arches low
50. Down from the central fountain's flow
51. Fall'n silver-chiming, seemed to shake
52. The sparkling flints beneath the prow.
53. A goodly place, a goodly time,
54. For it was in the golden prime
55. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

56. Above thro' many a bowery turn
57. A walk with vary-colour'd shells
58. Wander'd engrain'd.  On either side
59. All round about the fragrant marge
60. From fluted vase, and brazen urn
61. In order, eastern flowers large,
62. Some dropping low their crimson bells
63. Half-closed, and others studded wide
64. With disks and tiars, fed the time
65. With odour in the golden prime
66. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

67. Far off, and where the lemon grove
68. In closest coverture upsprung,
69. The living airs of middle night
70. Died round the bulbul as he sung;
71. Not he: but something which possess'd
72. The darkness of the world, delight,
73. Life, anguish, death, immortal love,
74. Ceasing not, mingled, unrepress'd,
75. Apart from place, withholding time,
76. But flattering the golden prime
77. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

78. Black the garden-bowers and grots
79. Slumber'd: the solemn palms were ranged
80. Above, unwoo'd of summer wind:
81. A sudden splendour from behind
82. Flush'd all the leaves with rich gold-green,
83. And, flowing rapidly between
84. Their interspaces, counterchanged
85. The level lake with diamond-plots
86. Of dark and bright. A lovely time,
87. For it was in the golden prime
88. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

89. Dark-blue the deep sphere overhead,
90. Distinct with vivid stars inlaid,
91. Grew darker from that under-flame:
92. So, leaping lightly from the boat,
93. With silver anchor left afloat,
94. In marvel whence that glory came
95. Upon me, as in sleep I sank
96. In cool soft turf upon the bank,
97. Entranced with that place and time,
98. So worthy of the golden prime
99. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

100. Thence thro' the garden I was drawn--
101. A realm of pleasance, many a mound,
102. And many a shadow-chequer'd lawn
103. Full of the city's stilly sound,
104. And deep myrrh-thickets blowing round
105. The stately cedar, tamarisks,
106. Thick rosaries of scented thorn,
107. Tall orient shrubs, and obelisks
108. Graven with emblems of the time,
109. In honour of the golden prime
110. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

111. With dazed vision unawares
112. From the long alley's latticed shade
113. Emerged, I came upon the great
114. Pavilion of the Caliphat.
115. Right to the carven cedarn doors,
116. Flung inward over spangled floors,
117. Broad-based flights of marble stairs
118. Ran up with golden balustrade,
119. After the fashion of the time,
120. And humour of the golden prime
121. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

122. The fourscore windows all alight
123. As with the quintessence of flame,
124. A million tapers flaring bright
125. From twisted silvers look'd to shame
126. The hollow-vaulted dark, and stream'd
127. Upon the mooned domes aloof
128. In inmost Bagdat, till there seem'd
129. Hundreds of crescents on the roof
130. Of night new-risen, that marvellous time
131. To celebrate the golden prime
132. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

133. Then stole I up, and trancedly
134. Gazed on the Persian girl alone,
135. Serene with argent-lidded eyes
136. Amorous, and lashes like to rays
137. Of darkness, and a brow of pearl
138. Tressed with redolent ebony,
139. In many a dark delicious curl,
140. Flowing beneath her rose-hued zone;
141. The sweetest lady of the time,
142. Well worthy of the golden prime
143. Of good Haroun Alraschid.

144. Six columns, three on either side,
145. Pure silver, underpropt a rich
146. Throne of the massive ore, from which
147. Down-droop'd, in many a floating fold,
148. Engarlanded and diaper'd
149. With inwrought flowers, a cloth of gold.
150. Thereon, his deep eye laughter-stirr'd
151. With merriment of kingly pride,
152. Sole star of all that place and time,
153. I saw him--in his golden prime,
154. The good Haroun Alraschid.
