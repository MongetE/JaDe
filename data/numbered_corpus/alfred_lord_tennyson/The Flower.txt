1. Once in a golden hour
2. I cast to earth a seed.
3. Up there came a flower,
4. The people said, a weed.

5. To and fro they went
6. Thro' my garden bower,
7. And muttering discontent
8. Cursed me and my flower.

9. Then it grew so tall
10. It wore a crown of light,
11. But thieves from o'er the wall
12. Stole the seed by night.

13. Sow'd it far and wide
14. By every town and tower,
15. Till all the people cried,
16. 'Splendid is the flower! '

17. Read my little fable:
18. He that runs may read.
19. Most can raise the flowers now,
20. For all have got the seed.

21. And some are pretty enough,
22. And some are poor indeed;
23. And now again the people
24. Call it but a weed.
