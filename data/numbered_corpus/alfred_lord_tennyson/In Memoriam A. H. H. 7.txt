1. Dark house, by which once more I stand
2. Here in the long unlovely street,
3. Doors, where my heart was used to beat
4. So quickly, waiting for a hand,
5. A hand that can be clasp'd no more-
6. Behold me, for I cannot sleep,
7. And like a guilty thing I creep
8. At earliest morning to the door.
9. He is not here; but far away
10. The noise of life begins again,
11. And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain
12. On the bald street breaks the blank day.
