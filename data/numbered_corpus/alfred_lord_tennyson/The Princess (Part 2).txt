1. At break of day the College Portress came:
2. She brought us Academic silks, in hue
3. The lilac, with a silken hood to each,
4. And zoned with gold; and now when these were on,
5. And we as rich as moths from dusk cocoons,
6. She, curtseying her obeisance, let us know
7. The Princess Ida waited:  out we paced,
8. I first, and following through the porch that sang
9. All round with laurel, issued in a court
10. Compact of lucid marbles, bossed with lengths
11. Of classic frieze, with ample awnings gay
12. Betwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers.
13. The Muses and the Graces, grouped in threes,
14. Enringed a billowing fountain in the midst;
15. And here and there on lattice edges lay
16. Or book or lute; but hastily we past,
17. And up a flight of stairs into the hall.

18. There at a board by tome and paper sat,
19. With two tame leopards couched beside her throne,
20. All beauty compassed in a female form,
21. The Princess; liker to the inhabitant
22. Of some clear planet close upon the Sun,
23. Than our man's earth; such eyes were in her head,
24. And so much grace and power, breathing down
25. From over her arched brows, with every turn
26. Lived through her to the tips of her long hands,
27. And to her feet.  She rose her height, and said:

28. 'We give you welcome:  not without redound
29. Of use and glory to yourselves ye come,
30. The first-fruits of the stranger:  aftertime,
31. And that full voice which circles round the grave,
32. Will rank you nobly, mingled up with me.
33. What! are the ladies of your land so tall?'
34. 'We of the court' said Cyril.  'From the court'
35. She answered, 'then ye know the Prince?' and he:
36. 'The climax of his age! as though there were
37. One rose in all the world, your Highness that,
38. He worships your ideal:'  she replied:
39. 'We scarcely thought in our own hall to hear
40. This barren verbiage, current among men,
41. Light coin, the tinsel clink of compliment.
42. Your flight from out your bookless wilds would seem
43. As arguing love of knowledge and of power;
44. Your language proves you still the child.  Indeed,
45. We dream not of him:  when we set our hand
46. To this great work, we purposed with ourself
47. Never to wed.  You likewise will do well,
48. Ladies, in entering here, to cast and fling
49. The tricks, which make us toys of men, that so,
50. Some future time, if so indeed you will,
51. You may with those self-styled our lords ally
52. Your fortunes, justlier balanced, scale with scale.'

53. At those high words, we conscious of ourselves,
54. Perused the matting:  then an officer
55. Rose up, and read the statutes, such as these:
56. Not for three years to correspond with home;
57. Not for three years to cross the liberties;
58. Not for three years to speak with any men;
59. And many more, which hastily subscribed,
60. We entered on the boards:  and 'Now,' she cried,
61. 'Ye are green wood, see ye warp not.  Look, our hall!
62. Our statues!--not of those that men desire,
63. Sleek Odalisques, or oracles of mode,
64. Nor stunted squaws of West or East; but she
65. That taught the Sabine how to rule, and she
66. The foundress of the Babylonian wall,
67. The Carian Artemisia strong in war,
68. The Rhodope, that built the pyramid,
69. Clelia, Cornelia, with the Palmyrene
70. That fought Aurelian, and the Roman brows
71. Of Agrippina.  Dwell with these, and lose
72. Convention, since to look on noble forms
73. Makes noble through the sensuous organism
74. That which is higher.  O lift your natures up:
75. Embrace our aims:  work out your freedom.  Girls,
76. Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:
77. Drink deep, until the habits of the slave,
78. The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite
79. And slander, die.  Better not be at all
80. Than not be noble.  Leave us:  you may go:
81. Today the Lady Psyche will harangue
82. The fresh arrivals of the week before;
83. For they press in from all the provinces,
84. And fill the hive.'
85. She spoke, and bowing waved
86. Dismissal:  back again we crost the court
87. To Lady Psyche's:  as we entered in,
88. There sat along the forms, like morning doves
89. That sun their milky bosoms on the thatch,
90. A patient range of pupils; she herself
91. Erect behind a desk of satin-wood,
92. A quick brunette, well-moulded, falcon-eyed,
93. And on the hither side, or so she looked,
94. Of twenty summers.  At her left, a child,
95. In shining draperies, headed like a star,
96. Her maiden babe, a double April old,
97. Agla√Øa slept.  We sat:  the Lady glanced:
98. Then Florian, but not livelier than the dame
99. That whispered 'Asses' ears', among the sedge,
100. 'My sister.'  'Comely, too, by all that's fair,'
101. Said Cyril.  'Oh hush, hush!' and she began.

102. 'This world was once a fluid haze of light,
103. Till toward the centre set the starry tides,
104. And eddied into suns, that wheeling cast
105. The planets:  then the monster, then the man;
106. Tattooed or woaded, winter-clad in skins,
107. Raw from the prime, and crushing down his mate;
108. As yet we find in barbarous isles, and here
109. Among the lowest.'
110. Thereupon she took
111. A bird's-eye-view of all the ungracious past;
112. Glanced at the legendary Amazon
113. As emblematic of a nobler age;
114. Appraised the Lycian custom, spoke of those
115. That lay at wine with Lar and Lucumo;
116. Ran down the Persian, Grecian, Roman lines
117. Of empire, and the woman's state in each,
118. How far from just; till warming with her theme
119. She fulmined out her scorn of laws Salique
120. And little-footed China, touched on Mahomet
121. With much contempt, and came to chivalry:
122. When some respect, however slight, was paid
123. To woman, superstition all awry:
124. However then commenced the dawn:  a beam
125. Had slanted forward, falling in a land
126. Of promise; fruit would follow.  Deep, indeed,
127. Their debt of thanks to her who first had dared
128. To leap the rotten pales of prejudice,
129. Disyoke their necks from custom, and assert
130. None lordlier than themselves but that which made
131. Woman and man.  She had founded; they must build.
132. Here might they learn whatever men were taught:
133. Let them not fear:  some said their heads were less:
134. Some men's were small; not they the least of men;
135. For often fineness compensated size:
136. Besides the brain was like the hand, and grew
137. With using; thence the man's, if more was more;
138. He took advantage of his strength to be
139. First in the field:  some ages had been lost;
140. But woman ripened earlier, and her life
141. Was longer; and albeit their glorious names
142. Were fewer, scattered stars, yet since in truth
143. The highest is the measure of the man,
144. And not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay,
145. Nor those horn-handed breakers of the glebe,
146. But Homer, Plato, Verulam; even so
147. With woman:  and in arts of government
148. Elizabeth and others; arts of war
149. The peasant Joan and others; arts of grace
150. Sappho and others vied with any man:
151. And, last not least, she who had left her place,
152. And bowed her state to them, that they might grow
153. To use and power on this Oasis, lapt
154. In the arms of leisure, sacred from the blight
155. Of ancient influence and scorn.
156. At last
157. She rose upon a wind of prophecy
158. Dilating on the future; 'everywhere
159. Who heads in council, two beside the hearth,
160. Two in the tangled business of the world,
161. Two in the liberal offices of life,
162. Two plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss
163. Of science, and the secrets of the mind:
164. Musician, painter, sculptor, critic, more:
165. And everywhere the broad and bounteous Earth
166. Should bear a double growth of those rare souls,
167. Poets, whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world.'

168. She ended here, and beckoned us:  the rest
169. Parted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she
170. Began to address us, and was moving on
171. In gratulation, till as when a boat
172. Tacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice
173. Faltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried
174. 'My brother!'  'Well, my sister.'  'O,' she said,
175. 'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?
176. Why who are these? a wolf within the fold!
177. A pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!
178. A plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!'
179. 'No plot, no plot,' he answered.  'Wretched boy,
180. How saw you not the inscription on the gate,
181. LET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?'
182. 'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think
183. The softer Adams of your Academe,
184. O sister, Sirens though they be, were such
185. As chanted on the blanching bones of men?'
186. 'But you will find it otherwise' she said.
187. 'You jest:  ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow
188. Binds me to speak, and O that iron will,
189. That axelike edge unturnable, our Head,
190. The Princess.'  'Well then, Psyche, take my life,
191. And nail me like a weasel on a grange
192. For warning:  bury me beside the gate,
193. And cut this epitaph above my bones;
194. ~Here lies a brother by a sister slain,
195. All for the common good of womankind.~'
196. 'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen
197. And heard the Lady Psyche.'
198. I struck in:
199. 'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;
200. Receive it; and in me behold the Prince
201. Your countryman, affianced years ago
202. To the Lady Ida:  here, for here she was,
203. And thus (what other way was left) I came.'
204. 'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;
205. If any, this; but none.  Whate'er I was
206. Disrooted, what I am is grafted here.
207. Affianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe
208. Within this vestal limit, and how should I,
209. Who am not mine, say, live:  the thunderbolt
210. Hangs silent; but prepare:  I speak; it falls.'
211. 'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there,
212. I think no more of deadly lurks therein,
213. Than in a clapper clapping in a garth,
214. To scare the fowl from fruit:  if more there be,
215. If more and acted on, what follows? war;
216. Your own work marred:  for this your Academe,
217. Whichever side be Victor, in the halloo
218. Will topple to the trumpet down, and pass
219. With all fair theories only made to gild
220. A stormless summer.'  'Let the Princess judge
221. Of that' she said:  'farewell, Sir--and to you.
222. I shudder at the sequel, but I go.'

223. 'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I rejoined,
224. 'The fifth in line from that old Florian,
225. Yet hangs his portrait in my father's hall
226. (The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow
227. Sun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)
228. As he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,
229. And all else fled? we point to it, and we say,
230. The loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,
231. But branches current yet in kindred veins.'
232. 'Are you that Psyche,' Florian added; 'she
233. With whom I sang about the morning hills,
234. Flung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,
235. And snared the squirrel of the glen? are you
236. That Psyche, wont to bind my throbbing brow,
237. To smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught
238. Of fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read
239. My sickness down to happy dreams? are you
240. That brother-sister Psyche, both in one?
241. You were that Psyche, but what are you now?'
242. 'You are that Psyche,' said Cyril, 'for whom
243. I would be that for ever which I seem,
244. Woman, if I might sit beside your feet,
245. And glean your scattered sapience.'
246. Then once more,
247. 'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I began,
248. 'That on her bridal morn before she past
249. From all her old companions, when the kind
250. Kissed her pale cheek, declared that ancient ties
251. Would still be dear beyond the southern hills;
252. That were there any of our people there
253. In want or peril, there was one to hear
254. And help them? look! for such are these and I.'
255. 'Are you that Psyche,' Florian asked, 'to whom,
256. In gentler days, your arrow-wounded fawn
257. Came flying while you sat beside the well?
258. The creature laid his muzzle on your lap,
259. And sobbed, and you sobbed with it, and the blood
260. Was sprinkled on your kirtle, and you wept.
261. That was fawn's blood, not brother's, yet you wept.
262. O by the bright head of my little niece,
263. You were that Psyche, and what are you now?'
264. 'You are that Psyche,' Cyril said again,
265. 'The mother of the sweetest little maid,
266. That ever crowed for kisses.'
267. 'Out upon it!'
268. She answered, 'peace! and why should I not play
269. The Spartan Mother with emotion, be
270. The Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind?
271. Him you call great:  he for the common weal,
272. The fading politics of mortal Rome,
273. As I might slay this child, if good need were,
274. Slew both his sons:  and I, shall I, on whom
275. The secular emancipation turns
276. Of half this world, be swerved from right to save
277. A prince, a brother? a little will I yield.
278. Best so, perchance, for us, and well for you.
279. O hard, when love and duty clash!  I fear
280. My conscience will not count me fleckless; yet--
281. Hear my conditions:  promise (otherwise
282. You perish) as you came, to slip away
283. Today, tomorrow, soon:  it shall be said,
284. These women were too barbarous, would not learn;
285. They fled, who might have shamed us:  promise, all.'

286. What could we else, we promised each; and she,
287. Like some wild creature newly-caged, commenced
288. A to-and-fro, so pacing till she paused
289. By Florian; holding out her lily arms
290. Took both his hands, and smiling faintly said:
291. 'I knew you at the first:  though you have grown
292. You scarce have altered:  I am sad and glad
293. To see you, Florian.  ~I~ give thee to death
294. My brother! it was duty spoke, not I.
295. My needful seeming harshness, pardon it.
296. Our mother, is she well?'
297. With that she kissed
298. His forehead, then, a moment after, clung
299. About him, and betwixt them blossomed up
300. From out a common vein of memory
301. Sweet household talk, and phrases of the hearth,
302. And far allusion, till the gracious dews
303. Began to glisten and to fall:  and while
304. They stood, so rapt, we gazing, came a voice,
305. 'I brought a message here from Lady Blanche.'
306. Back started she, and turning round we saw
307. The Lady Blanche's daughter where she stood,
308. Melissa, with her hand upon the lock,
309. A rosy blonde, and in a college gown,
310. That clad her like an April daffodilly
311. (Her mother's colour) with her lips apart,
312. And all her thoughts as fair within her eyes,
313. As bottom agates seen to wave and float
314. In crystal currents of clear morning seas.

315. So stood that same fair creature at the door.
316. Then Lady Psyche, 'Ah--Melissa--you!
317. You heard us?' and Melissa, 'O pardon me
318. I heard, I could not help it, did not wish:
319. But, dearest Lady, pray you fear me not,
320. Nor think I bear that heart within my breast,
321. To give three gallant gentlemen to death.'
322. 'I trust you,' said the other, 'for we two
323. Were always friends, none closer, elm and vine:
324. But yet your mother's jealous temperament--
325. Let not your prudence, dearest, drowse, or prove
326. The Dana√Ød of a leaky vase, for fear
327. This whole foundation ruin, and I lose
328. My honour, these their lives.'  'Ah, fear me not'
329. Replied Melissa; 'no--I would not tell,
330. No, not for all Aspasia's cleverness,
331. No, not to answer, Madam, all those hard things
332. That Sheba came to ask of Solomon.'
333. 'Be it so' the other, 'that we still may lead
334. The new light up, and culminate in peace,
335. For Solomon may come to Sheba yet.'
336. Said Cyril, 'Madam, he the wisest man
337. Feasted the woman wisest then, in halls
338. Of Lebanonian cedar:  nor should you
339. (Though, Madam, ~you~ should answer, ~we~ would ask)
340. Less welcome find among us, if you came
341. Among us, debtors for our lives to you,
342. Myself for something more.'  He said not what,
343. But 'Thanks,' she answered 'Go:  we have been too long
344. Together:  keep your hoods about the face;
345. They do so that affect abstraction here.
346. Speak little; mix not with the rest; and hold
347. Your promise:  all, I trust, may yet be well.'

348. We turned to go, but Cyril took the child,
349. And held her round the knees against his waist,
350. And blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter,
351. While Psyche watched them, smiling, and the child
352. Pushed her flat hand against his face and laughed;
353. And thus our conference closed.
354. And then we strolled
355. For half the day through stately theatres
356. Benched crescent-wise.  In each we sat, we heard
357. The grave Professor.  On the lecture slate
358. The circle rounded under female hands
359. With flawless demonstration:  followed then
360. A classic lecture, rich in sentiment,
361. With scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out
362. By violet-hooded Doctors, elegies
363. And quoted odes, and jewels five-words-long
364. That on the stretched forefinger of all Time
365. Sparkle for ever:  then we dipt in all
366. That treats of whatsoever is, the state,
367. The total chronicles of man, the mind,
368. The morals, something of the frame, the rock,
369. The star, the bird, the fish, the shell, the flower,
370. Electric, chemic laws, and all the rest,
371. And whatsoever can be taught and known;
372. Till like three horses that have broken fence,
373. And glutted all night long breast-deep in corn,
374. We issued gorged with knowledge, and I spoke:
375. 'Why, Sirs, they do all this as well as we.'
376. 'They hunt old trails' said Cyril 'very well;
377. But when did woman ever yet invent?'
378. 'Ungracious!' answered Florian; 'have you learnt
379. No more from Psyche's lecture, you that talked
380. The trash that made me sick, and almost sad?'
381. 'O trash' he said, 'but with a kernel in it.
382. Should I not call her wise, who made me wise?
383. And learnt?  I learnt more from her in a flash,
384. Than in my brainpan were an empty hull,
385. And every Muse tumbled a science in.
386. A thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls,
387. And round these halls a thousand baby loves
388. Fly twanging headless arrows at the hearts,
389. Whence follows many a vacant pang; but O
390. With me, Sir, entered in the bigger boy,
391. The Head of all the golden-shafted firm,
392. The long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too;
393. He cleft me through the stomacher; and now
394. What think you of it, Florian? do I chase
395. The substance or the shadow? will it hold?
396. I have no sorcerer's malison on me,
397. No ghostly hauntings like his Highness.  I
398. Flatter myself that always everywhere
399. I know the substance when I see it.  Well,
400. Are castles shadows?  Three of them?  Is she
401. The sweet proprietress a shadow?  If not,
402. Shall those three castles patch my tattered coat?
403. For dear are those three castles to my wants,
404. And dear is sister Psyche to my heart,
405. And two dear things are one of double worth,
406. And much I might have said, but that my zone
407. Unmanned me:  then the Doctors!  O to hear
408. The Doctors!  O to watch the thirsty plants
409. Imbibing! once or twice I thought to roar,
410. To break my chain, to shake my mane:  but thou,
411. Modulate me, Soul of mincing mimicry!
412. Make liquid treble of that bassoon, my throat;
413. Abase those eyes that ever loved to meet
414. Star-sisters answering under crescent brows;
415. Abate the stride, which speaks of man, and loose
416. A flying charm of blushes o'er this cheek,
417. Where they like swallows coming out of time
418. Will wonder why they came:  but hark the bell
419. For dinner, let us go!'
420. And in we streamed
421. Among the columns, pacing staid and still
422. By twos and threes, till all from end to end
423. With beauties every shade of brown and fair
424. In colours gayer than the morning mist,
425. The long hall glittered like a bed of flowers.
426. How might a man not wander from his wits
427. Pierced through with eyes, but that I kept mine own
428. Intent on her, who rapt in glorious dreams,
429. The second-sight of some Astr√¶an age,
430. Sat compassed with professors:  they, the while,
431. Discussed a doubt and tost it to and fro:
432. A clamour thickened, mixt with inmost terms
433. Of art and science:  Lady Blanche alone
434. Of faded form and haughtiest lineaments,
435. With all her autumn tresses falsely brown,
436. Shot sidelong daggers at us, a tiger-cat
437. In act to spring.
438. At last a solemn grace
439. Concluded, and we sought the gardens:  there
440. One walked reciting by herself, and one
441. In this hand held a volume as to read,
442. And smoothed a petted peacock down with that:
443. Some to a low song oared a shallop by,
444. Or under arches of the marble bridge
445. Hung, shadowed from the heat:  some hid and sought
446. In the orange thickets:  others tost a ball
447. Above the fountain-jets, and back again
448. With laughter:  others lay about the lawns,
449. Of the older sort, and murmured that their May
450. Was passing:  what was learning unto them?
451. They wished to marry; they could rule a house;
452. Men hated learned women:  but we three
453. Sat muffled like the Fates; and often came
454. Melissa hitting all we saw with shafts
455. Of gentle satire, kin to charity,
456. That harmed not:  then day droopt; the chapel bells
457. Called us:  we left the walks; we mixt with those
458. Six hundred maidens clad in purest white,
459. Before two streams of light from wall to wall,
460. While the great organ almost burst his pipes,
461. Groaning for power, and rolling through the court
462. A long melodious thunder to the sound
463. Of solemn psalms, and silver litanies,
464. The work of Ida, to call down from Heaven
465. A blessing on her labours for the world.


466. Sweet and low, sweet and low,
467. Wind of the western sea,
468. Low, low, breathe and blow,
469. Wind of the western sea!
470. Over the rolling waters go,
471. Come from the dying moon, and blow,
472. Blow him again to me;
473. While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.

474. Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
475. Father will come to thee soon;
476. Rest, rest, on mother's breast,
477. Father will come to thee soon;
478. Father will come to his babe in the nest,
479. Silver sails all out of the west
480. Under the silver moon:
481. Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.
