1. When on my bed the moonlight falls,
2. I know that in thy place of rest
3. By that broad water of the west,
4. There comes a glory on the walls:
5. Thy marble bright in dark appears,
6. As slowly steals a silver flame
7. Along the letters of thy name,
8. And o'er the number of thy years.
9. The mystic glory swims away;
10. From off my bed the moonlight dies;
11. And closing eaves of wearied eyes
12. I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray:

13. And then I know the mist is drawn
14. A lucid veil from coast to coast,
15. And in the dark church like a ghost
16. Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn.
