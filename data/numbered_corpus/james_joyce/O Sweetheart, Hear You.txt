1. O Sweetheart, hear you
2. Your lover's tale;
3. A man shall have sorrow
4. When friends him fail.

5. For he shall know then
6. Friends be untrue
7. And a little ashes
8. Their words come to.

9. But one unto him
10. Will softly move
11. And softly woo him
12. In ways of love.

13. His hand is under
14. Her smooth round breast;
15. So he who has sorrow
16. Shall have rest.
