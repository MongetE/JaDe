1. Bid adieu, adieu, adieu,
2. Bid adieu to girlish days,
3. Happy Love is come to woo
4. Thee and woo thy girlish waysâ€”
5. The zone that doth become thee fair,
6. The snood upon thy yellow hair,

7. When thou hast heard his name upon
8. The bugles of the cherubim
9. Begin thou softly to unzone
10. Thy girlish bosom unto him
11. And softly to undo the snood
12. That is the sign of maidenhood.
