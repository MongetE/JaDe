1. Wind whines and whines the shingle,
2. The crazy pierstakes groan;
3. A senile sea numbers each single
4. Slimesilvered stone.

5. From whining wind and colder
6. Grey sea I wrap him warm
7. And touch his trembling fineboned shoulder
8. And boyish arm.

9. Around us fear, descending
10. Darkness of fear above
11. And in my heart how deep unending
12. Ache of love!
