1. Goldbrown upon the sated flood
2. The rockvine clusters lift and sway;
3. Vast wings above the lambent waters brood
4. Of sullen day.

5. A waste of waters ruthlessly
6. Sways and uplifts its weedy mane
7. Where brooding day stares down upon the sea
8. In dull disdain.

9. Uplift and sway, O golden vine,
10. Your clustered fruits to love's full flood,
11. Lambent and vast and ruthless as is thine
12. Incertitude!
