1. A birdless heaven, seadusk, one lone star
2. Piercing the west,
3. As thou, fond heart, love's time, so faint, so far,
4. Rememberest.

5. The clear young eyes' soft look, the candid brow,
6. The fragrant hair,
7. Falling as through the silence falleth now
8. Dusk of the air.

9. Why then, remembering those shy
10. Sweet lures, repine
11. When the dear love she yielded with a sigh
12. Was all but thine?
