1. Rain on Rahoon falls softly, softly falling,
2. Where my dark lover lies.
3. Sad is his voice that calls me, sadly calling,
4. At grey moonrise.

5. Love, hear thou
6. How soft, how sad his voice is ever calling,
7. Ever unanswered, and the dark rain falling,
8. Then as now.

9. Dark too our hearts, O love, shall lie and cold
10. As his sad heart has lain
11. Under the moongrey nettles, the black mould
12. And muttering rain.
