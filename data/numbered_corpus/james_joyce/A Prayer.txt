1. Again!
2. Come, give, yield all your strength to me!
3. From far a low word breathes on the breaking brain
4. Its cruel calm, submission's misery,
5. Gentling her awe as to a soul predestined.
6. Cease, silent love! My doom!

7. Blind me with your dark nearness, O have mercy, beloved enemy of my will!
8. I dare not withstand the cold touch that I dread.
9. Draw from me still
10. My slow life! Bend deeper on me, threatening head,
11. Proud by my downfall, remembering, pitying
12. Him who is, him who was!

13. Again!
14. Together, folded by the night, they lay on earth. I hear
15. From far her low word breathe on my breaking brain.
16. Come! I yield. Bend deeper upon me! I am here.
17. Subduer, do not leave me! Only joy, only anguish,
18. Take me, save me, soothe me, O spare me!
