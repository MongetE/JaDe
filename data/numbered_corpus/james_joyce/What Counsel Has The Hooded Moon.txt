1. What counsel has the hooded moon
2. Put in thy heart, my shyly sweet,
3. Of Love in ancient plenilune,
4. Glory and stars beneath his feet -- -
5. A sage that is but kith and kin
6. With the comedian Capuchin?

7. Believe me rather that am wise
8. In disregard of the divine,
9. A glory kindles in those eyes
10. Trembles to starlight. Mine, O Mine!
11. No more be tears in moon or mist
12. For thee, sweet sentimentalist.
