1. In the dark pine-wood
2. I would we lay,
3. In deep cool shadow
4. At noon of day.

5. How sweet to lie there,
6. Sweet to kiss,
7. Where the great pine-forest
8. Enaisled is!

9. Thy kiss descending
10. Sweeter were
11. With a soft tumult
12. Of thy hair.

13. O unto the pine-wood
14. At noon of day
15. Come with me now,
16. Sweet love, away.
