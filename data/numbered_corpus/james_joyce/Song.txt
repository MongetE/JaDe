1. My love is in a light attire
2. Among the apple trees,
3. Where the gay winds do most desire
4. To run in companies.

5. There, where the gay winds stay to woo
6. The young leaves as they pass,
7. My love goes slowly, bending to
8. Her shadow on the grass.

9. And where the skyâ€™s a pale blue cup
10. Over the laughing land,
11. My love goes lightly, holding up
12. Her dress with dainty hand.
