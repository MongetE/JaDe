1. Though I thy Mithridates were,
2. Framed to defy the poison-dart,
3. Yet must thou fold me unaware
4. To know the rapture of thy heart,
5. And I but render and confess
6. The malice of thy tenderness.

7. For elegant and antique phrase,
8. Dearest, my lips wax all too wise;
9. Nor have I known a love whose praise
10. Our piping poets solemnize,
11. Neither a love where may not be
12. Ever so little falsity.
