1. Lean out of the window,
2. Goldenhair,
3. I hear you singing
4. A merry air.

5. My book was closed,
6. I read no more,
7. Watching the fire dance
8. On the floor.

9. I have left my book,
10. I have left my room,
11. For I heard you singing
12. Through the gloom.

13. Singing and singing
14. A merry air,
15. Lean out of the window,
16. Goldenhair.
