1. This heart that flutters near my heart
2. My hope and all my riches is,
3. Unhappy when we draw apart
4. And happy between kiss and kiss:
5. My hope and all my riches -- - yes! -- -
6. And all my happiness.

7. For there, as in some mossy nest
8. The wrens will divers treasures keep,
9. I laid those treasures I possessed
10. Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep.
11. Shall we not be as wise as they
12. Though love live but a day?
