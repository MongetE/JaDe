1. Have you heard of one Humpty Dumpty
2. How he fell with a roll and a rumble
3. And curled up like Lord Olofa Crumple
4. By the butt of the Magazine Wall,
5. (Chorus) Of the Magazine Wall,
6. Hump, helmet and all?

7. He was one time our King of the Castle
8. Now he's kicked about like a rotten old parsnip.
9. And from Green street he'll be sent by order of His Worship
10. To the penal jail of Mountjoy
11. (Chorus) To the jail of Mountjoy!
12. Jail him and joy.

13. He was fafafather of all schemes for to bother us

15. Mare's milk for the sick, seven dry Sundays a week,
16. Openair love and religion's reform,
17. (Chorus) And religious reform,
18. Hideous in form.

19. Arrah, why, says you, couldn't he manage it?
20. I'll go bail, my fine dairyman darling,
21. Like the bumping bull of the Cassidys
22. All your butter is in your horns.
23. (Chorus) His butter is in his horns.
24. Butter his horns!

25. (Repeat) Hurrah there, Hosty, frosty Hosty, change that shirt
26. on ye,
27. Rhyme the rann, the king of all ranns!


28. Balbaccio, balbuccio!

29. We had chaw chaw chops, chairs, chewing gum, the chicken-pox
30. and china chambers
31. Universally provided by this soffsoaping salesman.
32. Small wonder He'll Cheat E'erawan our local lads nicknamed him.
33. When Chimpden first took the floor
34. (Chorus) With his bucketshop store
35. Down Bargainweg, Lower.

36. So snug he was in his hotel premises sumptuous
37. But soon we'll bonfire all his trash, tricks and trumpery
38. And 'tis short till sheriff Clancy'll be winding up his unlimited
39. company
40. With the bailiff's bom at the door,
41. (Chorus) Bimbam at the door.
42. Then he'll bum no more.

43. Sweet bad luck on the waves washed to our island
44. The hooker of that hammerfast viking
45. And Gall's curse on the day when Eblana bay
46. Saw his black and tan man-o'-war.
47. (Chorus) Saw his man-o'-war
48. On the harbour bar.

49. Where from? roars Poolbeg. Cookingha'pence, he bawls
50. Donnez-moi scampitle, wick an wipin'fampiny
51. Fingal Mac Oscar Onesine Bargearse Boniface
52. Thok's min gammelhole Norveegickers moniker

54. (Chorus) A Norwegian camel old cod.
55. He is, begod.


56. Lift it, Hosty, lift it, ye devil, ye! up with the rann,
57. the rhyming rann!

58. It was during some fresh water garden pumping
59. Or, according to the Nursing Mirror, while admiring the monkeys
60. That our heavyweight heathen Humpharey
61. Made bold a maid to woo
62. (Chorus) Woohoo, what'll she doo!
63. The general lost her maidenloo!

64. He ought to blush for himself, the old hayheaded philosopher,
65. For to go and shove himself that way on top of her.
66. Begob, he's the crux of the catalogue
67. Of our antediluvial zoo,
68. (Chorus) Messrs Billing and Coo.
69. Noah's larks, good as noo.

70. He was joulting by Wellinton's monument
71. Our rotorious hippopopotamuns
72. When some bugger let down the backtrap of the omnibus
73. And he caught his death of fusiliers,
74. (Chorus) With his rent in his rears.
75. Give him six years.

76. 'Tis sore pity for his innocent poor children
77. But look out for his missus legitimate!
78. When that frew gets a grip of old Earwicker
79. Won't there be earwigs on the green?
80. (Chorus) Big earwigs on the green,
81. The largest ever you seen.

82. Suffoclose! Shikespower! Seudodanto! Anonymoses!

83. Then we'll have a free trade Gael's band and mass meeting
84. For to sod him the brave son of Scandiknavery.
85. And we'll bury him down in Oxmanstown
86. Along with the devil and the Danes,
87. (Chorus) With the deaf and dumb Danes,
88. And all their remains.

89. And not all the king's men nor his horses
90. Will resurrect his corpus
91. For there's no true spell in Connacht or hell
92. (bis) That's able to raise a Cain.
