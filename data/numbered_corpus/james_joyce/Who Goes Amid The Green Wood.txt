1. Who goes amid the green wood
2. With springtide all adorning her?
3. Who goes amid the merry green wood
4. To make it merrier?

5. Who passes in the sunlight
6. By ways that know the light footfall?
7. Who passes in the sweet sunlight
8. With mien so virginal?

9. The ways of all the woodland
10. Gleam with a soft and golden fire -- -
11. For whom does all the sunny woodland
12. Carry so brave attire?

13. O, it is for my true love
14. The woods their rich apparel wear -- -
15. O, it is for my own true love,
16. That is so young and fair.
