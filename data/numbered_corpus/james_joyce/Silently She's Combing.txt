1. Silently she's combing,
2. Combing her long hair
3. Silently and graciously,
4. With many a pretty air.

5. The sun is in the willow leaves
6. And on the dappled grass,
7. And still she's combing her long hair
8. Before the looking-glass.

9. I pray you, cease to comb out,
10. Comb out your long hair,
11. For I have heard of witchery
12. Under a pretty air,

13. That makes as one thing to the lover
14. Staying and going hence,
15. All fair, with many a pretty air
16. And many a negligence.
