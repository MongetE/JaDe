1. Of the dark past
2. A child is born;
3. With joy and grief
4. My heart is torn.

5. Calm in his cradle
6. The living lies.
7. May love and mercy
8. Unclose his eyes!

9. Young life is breathed
10. On the glass;
11. The world that was not
12. Comes to pass.

13. A child is sleeping:
14. An old man gone.
15. O, father forsaken,
16. Forgive your son!
