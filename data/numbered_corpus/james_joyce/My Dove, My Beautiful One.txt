1. My dove, my beautiful one,
2. Arise, arise!The night-dew lies
3. Upon my lips and eyes.

4. The odorous winds are weaving
5. A music of sighs:
6. Arise, arise,
7. My dove, my beautiful one!

8. I wait by the cedar tree,
9. My sister, my love,
10. White breast of the dove,
11. My breast shall be your bed.

12. The pale dew lies
13. Like a veil on my head.
14. My fair one, my fair dove,
15. Arise, arise!
