1. Gaunt in gloom,
2. The pale stars their torches,
3. Enshrouded, wave.
4. Ghostfires from heaven's far verges faint illume,
5. Arches on soaring arches,
6. Night's sindark nave.

7. Seraphim,
8. The lost hosts awaken
9. To service till
10. In moonless gloom each lapses muted, dim,
11. Raised when she has and shaken
12. Her thurible.

13. And long and loud,
14. To night's nave upsoaring,
15. A starknell tolls
16. As the bleak incense surges, cloud on cloud,
17. Voidward from the adoring
18. Waste of souls.
