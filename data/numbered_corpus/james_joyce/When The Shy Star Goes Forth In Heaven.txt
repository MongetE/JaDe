1. When the shy star goes forth in heaven
2. All maidenly, disconsolate,
3. Hear you amid the drowsy even
4. One who is singing by your gate.
5. His song is softer than the dew
6. And he is come to visit you.

7. O bend no more in revery
8. When he at eventide is calling.
9. Nor muse: Who may this singer be
10. Whose song about my heart is falling?
11. Know you by this, the lover's chant,
12. 'Tis I that am your visitant.
