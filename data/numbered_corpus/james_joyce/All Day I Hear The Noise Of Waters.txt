1. All day I hear the noise of waters
2. Making moan,
3. Sad as the sea-bird is when, going
4. Forth alone,
5. He hears the winds cry to the water's
6. Monotone.

7. The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing
8. Where I go.
9. I hear the noise of many waters
10. Far below.
11. All day, all night, I hear them flowing
12. To and fro.
