1. I would in that sweet bosom be
2. (O sweet it is and fair it is!)
3. Where no rude wind might visit me.
4. Because of sad austerities
5. I would in that sweet bosom be.

6. I would be ever in that heart
7. (O soft I knock and soft entreat her!)
8. Where only peace might be my part.
9. Austerities were all the sweeter
10. So I were ever in that heart.
