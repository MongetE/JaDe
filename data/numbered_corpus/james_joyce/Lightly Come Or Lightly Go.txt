1. Lightly come or lightly go:
2. Though thy heart presage thee woe,
3. Vales and many a wasted sun,
4. Oread let thy laughter run,
5. Till the irreverent mountain air
6. Ripple all thy flying hair.

7. Lightly, lightly -- - ever so:
8. Clouds that wrap the vales below
9. At the hour of evenstar
10. Lowliest attendants are;
11. Love and laughter song-confessed
12. When the heart is heaviest.
