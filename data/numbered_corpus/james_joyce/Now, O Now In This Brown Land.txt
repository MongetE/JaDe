1. Now, O now, in this brown land
2. Where Love did so sweet music make
3. We two shall wander, hand in hand,
4. Forbearing for old friendship' sake,
5. Nor grieve because our love was gay
6. Which now is ended in this way.

7. A rogue in red and yellow dress
8. Is knocking, knocking at the tree;
9. And all around our loneliness
10. The wind is whistling merrily.
11. The leaves -- - they do not sigh at all
12. When the year takes them in the fall.

13. Now, O now, we hear no more
14. The vilanelle and roundelay!
15. Yet will we kiss, sweetheart, before
16. We take sad leave at close of day.
17. Grieve not, sweetheart, for anything -- -
18. The year, the year is gathering.
