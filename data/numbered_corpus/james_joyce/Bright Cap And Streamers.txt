1. Bright cap and streamers,
2. He sings in the hollow:
3. Come follow, come follow,
4. All you that love.
5. Leave dreams to the dreamers
6. That will not after,
7. That song and laughter
8. Do nothing move.

9. With ribbons streaming
10. He sings the bolder;
11. In troop at his shoulder
12. The wild bees hum.
13. And the time of dreaming
14. Dreams is over -- -
15. As lover to lover,
16. Sweetheart, I come.
