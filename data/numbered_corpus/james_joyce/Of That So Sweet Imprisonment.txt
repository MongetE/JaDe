1. Of that so sweet imprisonment
2. My soul, dearest, is fain -- -
3. Soft arms that woo me to relent
4. And woo me to detain.
5. Ah, could they ever hold me there
6. Gladly were I a prisoner!

7. Dearest, through interwoven arms
8. By love made tremulous,
9. That night allures me where alarms
10. Nowise may trouble us;
11. But lseep to dreamier sleep be wed
12. Where soul with soul lies prisoned.
