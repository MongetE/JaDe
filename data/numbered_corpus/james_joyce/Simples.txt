1. O bella bionda,
2. Sei come l'onda!


3. Of cool sweet dew and radiance mild
4. The moon a web of silence weaves
5. In the still garden where a child
6. Gathers the simple salad leaves.

7. A moondew stars her hanging hair
8. And moonlight kisses her young brow
9. And, gathering, she sings an air:
10. Fair as the wave is, fair, art thou!

11. Be mine, I pray, a waxen ear
12. To shield me from her childish croon
13. And mine a shielded heart for her
14. Who gathers simples of the moon.
