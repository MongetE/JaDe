1. Sleep now, O sleep now,
2. O you unquiet heart!A voice crying "Sleep now"
3. Is heard in my heart.

4. The voice of the winter
5. Is heard at the door.
6. O sleep, for the winter
7. Is crying "Sleep no more."

8. My kiss will give peace now
9. And quiet to your heart -- -
10. Sleep on in peace now,
11. O you unquiet heart!
