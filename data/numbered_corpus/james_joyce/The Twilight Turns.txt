1. The twilight turns from amethyst
2. To deep and deeper blue,
3. The lamp fills with a pale green glow
4. The trees of the avenue.

5. The old piano plays an air,
6. Sedate and slow and gay;
7. She bends upon the yellow keys,
8. Her head inclines this way.

9. Shy thought and grave wide eyes and hands
10. That wander as they list -- -
11. The twilight turns to darker blue
12. With lights of amethyst.
