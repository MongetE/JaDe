1. I thought the Train would never come -
2. How slow the whistle sang -
3. I don't believe a peevish Bird
4. So whimpered for the Spring -
5. I taught my Heart a hundred times
6. Precisely what to say -
7. Provoking Lover, when you came
8. Its Treatise flew away
9. To hide my strategy too late
10. To wiser be too soon -
11. For miseries so halcyon
12. The happiness atone -
