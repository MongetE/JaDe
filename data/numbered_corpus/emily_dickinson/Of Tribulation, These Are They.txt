1. Of Tribulation, these are They,
2. Denoted by the White—
3. The Spangled Gowns, a lesser Rank
4. Of Victors—designate—

5. All these—did conquer—
6. But the ones who overcame most times—
7. Wear nothing commoner than Snow—
8. No Ornament, but Palms—

9. Surrender—is a sort unknown—
10. On this superior soil—
11. Defeat—an outgrown Anguish—
12. Remembered, as the Mile

13. Our panting Ankle barely passed—
14. When Night devoured the Road—
15. But we—stood whispering in the House—
16. And all we said—was "Saved"!
