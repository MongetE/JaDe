1. MY cocoon tightens, colors tease,
2. I 'm feeling for the air;
3. A dim capacity for wings
4. Degrades the dress I wear.

5. A power of butterfly must be
6. The aptitude to fly,
7. Meadows of majesty concedes
8. And easy sweeps of sky.

9. So I must baffle at the hint
10. And cipher at the sign,
11. And make much blunder, if at last
12. I take the clew divine.
