1. I measure every Grief I meet
2. With narrow, probing, Eyes --
3. I wonder if It weighs like Mine --
4. Or has an Easier size.

5. I wonder if They bore it long --
6. Or did it just begin --
7. I could not tell the Date of Mine --
8. It feels so old a pain --

9. I wonder if it hurts to live --
10. And if They have to try --
11. And whether -- could They choose between --
12. It would not be -- to die --

13. I note that Some -- gone patient long --
14. At length, renew their smile --
15. An imitation of a Light
16. That has so little Oil --

17. I wonder if when Years have piled --
18. Some Thousands -- on the Harm --
19. That hurt them early -- such a lapse
20. Could give them any Balm --

21. Or would they go on aching still
22. Through Centuries of Nerve --
23. Enlightened to a larger Pain --
24. In Contrast with the Love --

25. The Grieved -- are many -- I am told --
26. There is the various Cause --
27. Death -- is but one -- and comes but once --
28. And only nails the eyes --

29. There's Grief of Want -- and Grief of Cold --
30. A sort they call "Despair" --
31. There's Banishment from native Eyes --
32. In sight of Native Air

33. And though I may not guess the kind --
34. Correctly -- yet to me
35. A piercing Comfort it affords
36. In passing Calvary --

37. To note the fashions -- of the Cross --
38. And how they're mostly worn --
39. Still fascinated to presume
40. That Some -- are like My -- Own --
