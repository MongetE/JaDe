1. The Heart has narrow Banks
2. It measures like the Sea
3. In mighty—unremitting Bass
4. And Blue Monotony

5. Till Hurricane bisect
6. And as itself discerns
7. Its sufficient Area
8. The Heart convulsive learns

9. That Calm is but a Wall
10. Of unattempted Gauze
11. An instant's Push demolishes
12. A Questioning—dissolves.
