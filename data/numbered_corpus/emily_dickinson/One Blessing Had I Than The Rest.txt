2. So larger to my Eyes
3. That I stopped gauging—satisfied—
4. For this enchanted size—

5. It was the limit of my Dream—
6. The focus of my Prayer—
7. A perfect—paralyzing Bliss—
8. Contented as Despair—

9. I knew no more of Want—or Cold—
10. Phantasms both become
11. For this new Value in the Soul—
12. Supremest Earthly Sum—

13. The Heaven below the Heaven above—
14. Obscured with ruddier Blue—
15. Life's Latitudes leant over—full—
16. The Judgment perished—too—

17. Why Bliss so scantily disburse—
18. Why Paradise defer—
19. Why Floods be served to Us—in Bowls—
20. I speculate no more—
