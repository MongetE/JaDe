1. She lay as if at play
2. Her life had leaped away—
3. Intending to return—
4. But not so soon—

5. Her merry Arms, half dropt—
6. As if for lull of sport—
7. An instant had forgot—
8. The Trick to start—

9. Her dancing Eyes—ajar—
10. As if their Owner were
11. Still sparkling through
12. For fun—at you—

13. Her Morning at the door—
14. Devising, I am sure—
15. To force her sleep—
16. So light—so deep—
