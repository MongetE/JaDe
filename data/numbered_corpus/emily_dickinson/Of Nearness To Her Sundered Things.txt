1. Of nearness to her sundered Things
2. The Soul has special times—
3. When Dimness—looks the Oddity—
4. Distinctness—easy—se ems—

5. The Shapes we buried, dwell about,
6. Familiar, in the Rooms—
7. Untarnished by the Sepulchre,
8. The Mouldering Playmate comes—

9. In just the Jacket that he wore—
10. Long buttoned in the Mold
11. Since we—old mornings, Children—played—
12. Divided—by a world—

13. The Grave yields back her Robberies—
14. The Years, our pilfered Things—
15. Bright Knots of Apparitions
16. Salute us, with their wings—

17. As we—it were—that perished—
18. Themself—had just remained till we rejoin them—
19. And 'twas they, and not ourself
20. That mourned.
