1. The Doomed—regard the Sunrise
2. With different Delight—
3. Because—when next it burns abroad
4. They doubt to witness it—

5. The Man—to die—tomorrow—
6. Harks for the Meadow Bird—
7. Because its Music stirs the Axe
8. That clamors for his head—

9. Joyful—to whom the Sunrise
10. Precedes Enamored—Day—
11. Joyful—for whom the Meadow Bird
12. Has ought but Elegy!
