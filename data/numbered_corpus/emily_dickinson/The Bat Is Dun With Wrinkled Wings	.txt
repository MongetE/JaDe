1. THE BAT is dun with wrinkled wings
2. Like fallow article,
3. And not a song pervades his lips,
4. Or none perceptible.

5. His small umbrella, quaintly halved,
6. Describing in the air
7. An arc alike inscrutable,â€”
8. Elate philosopher!

9. Deputed from what firmament
10. Of what astute abode,
11. Empowered with what malevolence
12. Auspiciously withheld.

13. To his adroit Creator
14. Ascribe no less the praise;
15. Beneficent, believe me,
16. His eccentricities.
