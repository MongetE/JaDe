1. What care the Dead, for Chanticleer—
2. What care the Dead for Day?
3. 'Tis late your Sunrise vex their face—
4. And Purple Ribaldry—of Morning

5. Pour as blank on them
6. As on the Tier of Wall
7. The Mason builded, yesterday,
8. And equally as cool—

9. What care the Dead for Summer?
10. The Solstice had no Sun
11. Could waste the Snow before their Gate—
12. And knew One Bird a Tune—

13. Could thrill their Mortised Ear
14. Of all the Birds that be—
15. This One—beloved of Mankind
16. Henceforward cherished be—

17. What care the Dead for Winter?
18. Themselves as easy freeze—
19. June Noon—as January Night—
20. As soon the South—her Breeze

21. Of Sycamore—or Cinnamon—
22. Deposit in a Stone
23. And put a Stone to keep it Warm—
24. Give Spices—unto Men—
