1. Death is like the insect
2. Menacing the tree,
3. Competent to kill it,
4. But decoyed may be.

5. Bait it with the balsam,
6. Seek it with the saw,
7. Baffle, if it cost you
8. Everything you are.

9. Then, if it have burrowed
10. Out of reach of skill -
11. Wring the tree and leave it,
12. 'Tis the vermin's will.
