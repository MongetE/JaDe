1. What if I say I shall not wait!
2. What if I burst the fleshly Gate—
3. And pass escaped—to thee!

4. What if I file this Mortal—off—
5. See where it hurt me—That's enough—
6. And wade in Liberty!

7. They cannot take me—any more!
8. Dungeons can call—and Guns implore
9. Unmeaning—now—to me—

10. As laughter—was—an hour ago—
11. Or Laces—or a Travelling Show—
12. Or who died—yesterday!
