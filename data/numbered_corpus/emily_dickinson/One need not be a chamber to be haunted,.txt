1. One need not be a chamber to be haunted,
2. One need not be a house;
3. The brain has corridors surpassing
4. Material place.

5. Far safer, of a midnight meeting
6. External ghost,
7. Than an interior confronting
8. That whiter host.

9. Far safer through an Abbey gallop,
10. The stones achase,
11. Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
12. In lonesome place.

13. Ourself, behind ourself concealed,
14. Should startle most;
15. Assassin, hid in our apartment,
16. Be horror's least.

17. The prudent carries a revolver,
18. He bolts the door,
19. O'erlooking a superior spectre
20. More near.
