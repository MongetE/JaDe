1. What shall I do when the Summer troubles—
2. What, when the Rose is ripe—
3. What when the Eggs fly off in Music
4. From the Maple Keep?

5. What shall I do when the Skies a'chirrup
6. Drop a Tune on me—
7. When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup
8. What will become of me?

9. Oh, when the Squirrel fills His Pockets
10. And the Berries stare
11. How can I bear their jocund Faces
12. Thou from Here, so far?

13. 'Twouldn't afflict a Robin—
14. All His Goods have Wings—
15. I—do not fly, so wherefore
16. My Perennial Things?
