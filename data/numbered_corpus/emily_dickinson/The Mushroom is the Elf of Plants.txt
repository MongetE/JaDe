1. The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants -
2. At Evening, it is not
3. At Morning, in a Truffled Hut
4. It stop opon a Spot

5. As if it tarried always
6. And yet it's whole Career
7. Is shorter than a Snake's Delay -
8. And fleeter than a Tare -

9. 'Tis Vegetation's Juggler -
10. The Germ of Alibi -
11. Doth like a Bubble antedate
12. And like a Bubble, hie -

13. I feel as if the Grass was pleased
14. To have it intermit -
15. This surreptitious Scion
16. Of Summer's circumspect.

17. Had Nature any supple Face
18. Or could she one contemn -
19. Had Nature an Apostate -
20. That Mushroom - it is Him!
