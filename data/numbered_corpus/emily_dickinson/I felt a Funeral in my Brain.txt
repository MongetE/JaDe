1. I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
2. And Mourners to and fro
3. Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
4. That Sense was breaking through -

5. And when they all were seated,
6. A Service, like a Drum -
7. Kept beating - beating - till I thought
8. My Mind was going numb -

9. And then I heard them lift a Box
10. And creak across my Soul
11. With those same Boots of Lead, again,
12. Then Space - began to toll,

13. As all the Heavens were a Bell,
14. And Being but an Ear,
15. And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
16. Wrecked, solitary, here -

17. And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
18. And I dropped down, and down -
19. And hit a World at every plunge,
20. And Finished knowing—then.
