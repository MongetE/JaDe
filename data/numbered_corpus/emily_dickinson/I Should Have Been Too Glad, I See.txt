2. Too lifted—for the scant degree
3. Of Life's penurious Round—
4. My little Circuit would have shamed
5. This new Circumference—have blamed—
6. The homelier time behind.

7. I should have been too saved—I see—
8. Too rescued—Fear too dim to me
9. That I could spell the Prayer
10. I knew so perfect—yesterday—
11. That Scalding One—Sabachthani—
12. Recited fluent—here—

13. Earth would have been too much—I see—
14. And Heaven—not enough for me—
15. I should have had the Joy
16. Without the Fear—to justify—
17. The Palm—without the Calvary—
18. So Savior—Crucify—
19. Defeat—whets Victory—they say—
20. The Reefs—in old Gethsemane—
21. Endear the Coast—beyond!
22. 'Tis Beggars—Banquets—can define—
23. 'Tis Parching—vitalizes Wine—
24. "Faith" bleats—to understand!
