1. It's coming—the postponeless Creature—
2. It gains the Block—and now—it gains the Door—
3. Chooses its latch, from all the other fastenings—
4. Enters—with a "You know Me—Sir"?

5. Simple Salute—and certain Recognition—
6. Bold—were it Enemy—Brief—were it friend—
7. Dresses each House in Crape, and Icicle—
8. And carries one—out of it—to God—
