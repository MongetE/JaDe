1. The Snow that never drifts -
2. The transient, fragrant snow
3. That comes a single time a Year
4. Is softly driving now -

5. So thorough in the Tree
6. At night beneath the star
7. That it was February's Foot
8. Experience would swear -

9. Like Winter as a Face
10. We stern and former knew
11. Repaired of all but Loneliness
12. By Nature's Alibit -

13. Were every storm so spice
14. The Value could not be -
15. We buy with contrast -  Pang is good
16. As near as memory -
