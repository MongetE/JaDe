1. This—is the land—the Sunset washes—
2. These—are the Banks of the Yellow Sea—
3. Where it rose—or whither it rushes—
4. These—are the Western Mystery!

5. Night after Night
6. Her purple traffic
7. Strews the landing with Opal Bales—
8. Merchantmen—poise upon Horizons—
9. Dip—and vanish like Orioles!
