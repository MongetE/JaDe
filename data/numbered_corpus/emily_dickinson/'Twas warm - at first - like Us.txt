1. 'Twas warm — at first — like Us —
2. Until there crept upon
3. A Chill — like frost upon a Glass —
4. Till all the scene — be gone.

5. The Forehead copied Stone —
6. The Fingers grew too cold
7. To ache — and like a Skater's Brook —
8. The busy eyes — congealed —

9. It straightened — that was all —
10. It crowded Cold to Cold —
11. It multiplied indifference —
12. As Pride were all it could —

13. And even when with Cords —
14. 'Twas lowered, like a Weight —
15. It made no Signal, nor demurred,
16. But dropped like Adamant.
