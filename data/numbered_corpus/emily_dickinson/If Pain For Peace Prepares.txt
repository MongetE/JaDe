1. If pain for peace prepares
2. Lo, what "Augustan" years
3. Our feet await!

4. If springs from winter rise,
5. Can the Anemones
6. Be reckoned up?

7. If night stands fastâ€”then noon
8. To gird us for the sun,
9. What gaze!

10. When from a thousand skies
11. On our developed eyes
12. Noons blaze!
