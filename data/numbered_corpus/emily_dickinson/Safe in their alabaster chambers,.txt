1. Safe in their alabaster chambers,
2. Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
3. Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
4. Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.

5. Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;
6. Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;
7. Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadences, â€”
8. Ah, what sagacity perished here!

9. Grand go the years in the crescent above them;
10. Worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
11. Diadems drop and Doges surrender,
12. Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.
