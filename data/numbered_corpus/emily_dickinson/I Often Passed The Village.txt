1. I often passed the village
2. When going home from school—
3. And wondered what they did there—
4. And why it was so still—

5. I did not know the year then—
6. In which my call would come—
7. Earlier, by the Dial,
8. Than the rest have gone.

9. It's stiller than the sundown.
10. It's cooler than the dawn—
11. The Daisies dare to come here—
12. And birds can flutter down—

13. So when you are tired—
14. Or perplexed—or cold—
15. Trust the loving promise
16. Underneath the mould,
17. Cry "it's I," "take Dollie,"
18. And I will enfold!
