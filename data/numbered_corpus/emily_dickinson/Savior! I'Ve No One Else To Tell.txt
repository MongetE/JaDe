1. Savior! I've no one else to tell—
2. And so I trouble thee.
3. I am the one forgot thee so—
4. Dost thou remember me?
5. Nor, for myself, I came so far—
6. That were the little load—
7. I brought thee the imperial Heart
8. I had not strength to hold—
9. The Heart I carried in my own—
10. Till mine too heavy grew—
11. Yet—strangest—heavier since it went—
12. Is it too large for you?
