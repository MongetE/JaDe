1. I died for Beauty - but was scarce
2. Adjusted in the Tomb
3. When One who died for Truth, was lain
4. In an adjoining Room -

5. He questioned softly "Why I failed"?
6. "For Beauty", I replied -
7. "And I - for Truth - Themself are One -
8. We Brethren are",  He said -

9. And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night —
10. We talked between the Rooms -
11. Until the Moss had reached our lips -
12. And covered up  - Our names -
