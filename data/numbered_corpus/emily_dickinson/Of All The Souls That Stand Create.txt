1. Of all the souls that stand create
2. I have elected one.
3. When sense from spirit files away,
4. And subterfuge is done;

5. When that which is and that which was
6. Apart, intrinsic, stand,
7. And this brief tragedy of flesh
8. Is shifted like a sand;

9. When figures show their royal front
10. And mists are carved sway,--
11. Behold the atom I Feferred
12. To all the lists of clay!
