1. We pray—to Heaven—
2. We prate—of Heaven—
3. Relate—when Neighbors die—
4. At what o'clock to heaven—they fled—
5. Who saw them—Wherefore fly?

6. Is Heaven a Place—a Sky—a Tree?
7. Location's narrow way is for Ourselves—
8. Unto the Dead
9. There's no Geography—

10. But State—Endowal—Focus—
11. Wheremnipresence—fly?
