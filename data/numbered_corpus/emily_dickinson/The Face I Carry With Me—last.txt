1. The face I carry with me—last—
2. When I go out of Time—
3. To take my Rank—by—in the West—
4. That face—will just be thine—

5. I'll hand it to the Angel—

12. And beg me put it on—

13. And then—he'll turn me round and round—
14. To an admiring sky—
15. As one that bore her Master's name—
16. Sufficient Royalty!
