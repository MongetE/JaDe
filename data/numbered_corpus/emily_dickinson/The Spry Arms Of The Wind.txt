1. The spry Arms of the Wind
2. If I could crawl between
3. I have an errand imminent
4. To an adjoining Zone -

5. I should not care to stop
6. My Process is not long
7. The Wind could wait without the Gate
8. Or stroll the Town among.

9. To ascertain the House
10. And is the soul at Home
11. And hold the Wick of mine to it
12. To light, and then return -
