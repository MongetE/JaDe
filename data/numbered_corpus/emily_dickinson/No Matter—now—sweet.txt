1. No matter—now—Sweet—
2. But when I'm Earl—
3. Won't you wish you'd spoken
4. To that dull Girl?

5. Trivial a Word—just—
6. Trivial—a Smile—
7. But won't you wish you'd spared one
8. When I'm Earl?

9. I shan't need it—then—
10. Crests—will do—
11. Eagles on my Buckles—
12. On my Belt—too—

13. Ermine—my familiar Gown—
14. Say—Sweet—then
15. Won't you wish you'd smiled—just—
16. Me upon?
