1. I started early, took my dog,
2. And visited the sea;
3. The mermaids in the basement
4. Came out to look at me.

5. And frigates in the upper floor
6. Extended hempen hands,
7. Presuming me to be a mouse
8. Aground, upon the sands.

9. But no man moved me till the tide
10. Went past my simple shoe,
11. And past my apron and my belt,
12. And past my bodice too,

13. And made as he would eat me up
14. As wholly as a dew
15. Upon a dandelion's sleeve —
16. And then I started too.

17. And he — he followed close behind;
18. I felt his silver heel
19. Upon my ankle, — then my shoes
20. Would overflow with pearl.

21. Until we met the solid town,
22. No man he seemed to know;
23. And bowing with a mighty look
24. At me, the sea withdrew.
