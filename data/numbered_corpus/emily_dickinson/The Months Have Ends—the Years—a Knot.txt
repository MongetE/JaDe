1. The Months have ends—the Years—a knot—
2. No Power can untie
3. To stretch a little further
4. A Skein of Misery—

5. The Earth lays back these tired lives
6. In her mysterious Drawers—
7. Too tenderly, that any doubt
8. An ultimate Repose—

9. The manner of the Children—
10. Who weary of the Day—
11. Themself—the noisy Plaything
12. They cannot put away—
