1. Where bells no more affright the morn—
2. Where scrabble never comes—
3. Where very nimble Gentlemen
4. Are forced to keep their rooms—

5. Where tired Children placid sleep
6. Thro' Centuries of noon
7. This place is Bliss—this town is Heaven—
8. Please, Pater, pretty soon!

9. "Oh could we climb where Moses stood,
10. And view the Landscape o'er"
11. Not Father's bells—nor Factories,
12. Could scare us any more!
