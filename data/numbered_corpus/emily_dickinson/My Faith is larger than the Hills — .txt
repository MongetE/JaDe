1. My Faith is larger than the Hills —
2. So when the Hills decay —
3. My Faith must take the Purple Wheel
4. To show the Sun the way —

5. 'Tis first He steps upon the Vane —
6. And then — upon the Hill —
7. And then abroad the World He go
8. To do His Golden Will —

9. And if His Yellow feet should miss —
10. The Bird would not arise —
11. The Flowers would slumber on their Stems  —
12. No Bells have Paradise —

13. How dare I, therefore, stint a faith
14. On which so vast depends —
15. Lest Firmament should fail for me —
16. The Rivet in the Bands
