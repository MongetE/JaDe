1. Before you thought of spring,
2. Except as a surmise,
3. You see, God bless his suddenness,
4. A fellow in the skies
5. Of independent hues,
6. A little weather-worn,
7. Inspiriting habiliments
8. Of indigo and brown.

9. With specimens of song,
10. As if for you to choose,
11. Discretion in the interval,
12. With gay delays he goes
13. To some superior tree
14. Without a single leaf,
15. And shouts for joy to nobody
16. But his seraphic self!
