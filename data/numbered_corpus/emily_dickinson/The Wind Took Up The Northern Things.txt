1. The Wind took up the Northern Things
2. And piled them in the south -
3. Then gave the East unto the West
4. And opening his mouth

5. The four Divisions of the Earth
6. Did make as to devour
7. While everything to corners slunk
8. Behind the awful power -

9. The Wind -  unto his Chambers went
10. And nature ventured out -
11. Her subjects scattered into place
12. Her systems ranged about

13. Again the smoke from Dwellings rose
14. The Day abroad was heard -
15. How intimate, a Tempest past
16. The Transport of the Bird -
