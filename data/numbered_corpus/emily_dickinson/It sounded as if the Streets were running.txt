1. It sounded as if the Streets were running
2. And then -  the Streets stood still -
3. Eclipse -  was all we could see at the Window
4. And Awe -  was all we could feel.

5. By and by -  the boldest stole out of his Covert
6. To see if Time was there -
7. Nature was in an Opal Apron,
8. Mixing fresher Air.
