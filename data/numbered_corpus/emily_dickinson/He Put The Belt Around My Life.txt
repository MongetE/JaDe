2. I heard the Buckle snap—
3. And turned away, imperial,
4. My Lifetime folding up—
5. Deliberate, as a Duke would do
6. A Kingdom's Title Deed—
7. Henceforth, a Dedicated sort—
8. A Member of the Cloud.

9. Yet not too far to come at call—
10. And do the little Toils
11. That make the Circuit of the Rest—
12. And deal occasional smiles
13. To lives that stoop to notice mine—
14. And kindly ask it in—
15. Whose invitation, know you not
16. For Whom I must decline?
