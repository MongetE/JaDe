1. Read—Sweet—how others—strove—
2. Till we—are stouter—
3. What they—renounced—
4. Till we—are less afraid—
5. How many times they—bore the faithful witness—
6. Till we—are helped—
7. As if a Kingdom—cared!

8. Read then—of faith—
9. That shone above the fagot—
10. Clear strains of Hymn
11. The River could not drown—
12. Brave names of Men—
13. And Celestial Women—
14. Passed out—of Record
15. Into—Renown!
