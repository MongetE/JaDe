1. The Tint I cannot take—is best—
2. The Color too remote
3. That I could show it in Bazaar—
4. A Guinea at a sight—

5. The fine—impalpable Array—
6. That swaggers on the eye
7. Like Cleopatra's Company—
8. Repeated—in the sky—

9. The Moments of Dominion
10. That happen on the Soul
11. And leave it with a Discontent
12. Too exquisite—to tell—

13. The eager look—on Landscapes—
14. As if they just repressed
15. Some Secret—that was pushing
16. Like Chariots—in the Vest—

17. The Pleading of the Summer—
18. That other Prank—of Snow—
19. That Cushions Mystery with Tulle,
20. For fear the Squirrels—know.

21. Their Graspless manners—mock us—
22. Until the Cheated Eye
23. Shuts arrogantly—in the Grave—
24. Another way—to see—
