1. Drowning is not so pitiful
2. As the attempt to rise.
3. Three times, 't is said, a sinking man
4. Comes up to face the skies,
5. And then declines forever
6. To that abhorred abode

7. Where hope and he part company,â€”
8. For he is grasped of God.
9. The Maker's cordial visage,
10. However good to see,
11. Is shunned, we must admit it,
12. Like an adversity.
