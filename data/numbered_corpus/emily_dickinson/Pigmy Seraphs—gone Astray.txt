1. Pigmy seraphs—gone astray—
2. Velvet people from Vevay—
3. Balles from some lost summer day—
4. Bees exclusive Coterie—
5. Paris could not lay the fold
6. Belted down with Emerald—
7. Venice could not show a check
8. Of a tint so lustrous meek—
9. Never such an Ambuscade
10. As of briar and leaf displayed
11. For my little damask maid—

12. I had rather wear her grace
13. Than an Earl's distinguished face—
14. I had rather dwell like her
15. Than be "Duke of Exeter"—
16. Royalty enough for me
17. To subdue the Bumblebee.
