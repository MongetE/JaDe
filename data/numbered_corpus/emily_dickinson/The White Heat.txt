1. Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat?
2. Then crouch within the door --
3. Red -- is the Fire's common tint --
4. But when the vivid Ore
5. Has vanquished Flame's conditions,
6. It quivers from the Forge
7. Without a color, but the light
8. Of unanointed Blaze.
9. Least Village has its Blacksmith
10. Whose Anvil's even ring
11. Stands symbol for the finer Forge
12. That soundless tugs -- within --
13. Re[f]ining these impatient Ores
14. With Hammer, and with Blaze
15. Untile the Designated Light
16. Repudiate the Forge
