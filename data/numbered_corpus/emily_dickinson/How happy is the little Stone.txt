1. How happy is the little Stone
2. That rambles in the Road alone,
3. And doesn't care about Careers
4. And Exigencies never fears—
5. Whose Coat of elemental Brown
6. A passing Universe put on,
7. And independent as the Sun
8. Associates or glows alone,
9. Fulfilling absolute Decree
10. In casual simplicity—
