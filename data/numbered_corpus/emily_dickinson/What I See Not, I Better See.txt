1. What I see not, I better see—
2. Through Faith—my Hazel Eye
3. Has periods of shutting—
4. But, No lid has Memory—

5. For frequent, all my sense obscured
6. I equally behold
7. As someone held a light unto
8. The Features so beloved—-

9. And I arise—and in my Dream—
10. Do Thee distinguished Grace—
11. Till jealous Daylight interrupt—
12. And mar thy perfectness—
