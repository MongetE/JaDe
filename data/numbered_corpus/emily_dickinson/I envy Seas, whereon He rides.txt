1. I envy Seas, whereon He rides—
2. I envy Spokes of Wheels
3. Of Chariots, that Him convey—
4. I envy Crooked Hills

5. That gaze upon His journey—
6. How easy All can see
7. What is forbidden utterly
8. As Heaven—unto me!

9. I envy Nests of Sparrows—
10. That dot His distant Eaves—
11. The wealthy Fly, upon His Pane—
12. The happy—happy Leaves—

13. That just abroad His Window
14. Have Summer's leave to play—
15. The Ear Rings of Pizarro
16. Could not obtain for me—

17. I envy Light—that wakes Him—
18. And Bells—that boldly ring
19. To tell Him it is Noon, abroad—
20. Myself—be Noon to Him—

21. Yet interdict—my Blossom—
22. And abrogate—my Bee—
23. Lest Noon in Everlasting Night—
24. Drop Gabriel—and Me—
