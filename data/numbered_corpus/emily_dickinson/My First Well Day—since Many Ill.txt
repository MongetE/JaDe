2. I asked to go abroad,
3. And take the Sunshine in my hands,
4. And see the things in Pod—

5. A 'blossom just when I went in

14. As if before a child
15. To fade—Tomorrow—Rainbows held
16. The Sepulchre, could hide.

17. She dealt a fashion to the Nut—
18. She tied the Hoods to Seeds—
19. She dropped bright scraps of Tint, about—

21. On every shoulder that she met—
22. Then both her Hands of Haze
23. Put up—to hide her parting Grace
24. From our unfitted eyes.

25. My loss, by sickness—Was it Loss?
26. Or that Ethereal Gain
27. One earns by measuring the Grave—
28. Then—measuring the Sun—
