1. They leave us with the Infinite.
2. But He—is not a man—
3. His fingers are the size of fists—
4. His fists, the size of men—

5. And whom he foundeth, with his Arm
6. As Himmaleh, shall stand—
7. Gibraltar's Everlasting Shoe
8. Poised lightly on his Hand,

9. So trust him, Comrade—
10. You for you, and I, for you and me
11. Eternity is ample,
12. And quick enough, if true.
