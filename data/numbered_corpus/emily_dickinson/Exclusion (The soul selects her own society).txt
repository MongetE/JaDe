1. The soul selects her own society,
2. Then shuts the door;
3. On her divine majority
4. Obtrude no more.
5. Unmoved, she notes the chariot's pausing
6. At her low gate;
7. Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
8. Upon her mat.
9. I've known her from an ample nation
10. Choose one
11. Then close the valves of her attention
12. Like stone.
