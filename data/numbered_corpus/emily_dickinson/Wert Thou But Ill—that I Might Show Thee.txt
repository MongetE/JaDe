1. Wert Thou but ill—that I might show thee
2. How long a Day I could endure
3. Though thine attention stop not on me
4. Nor the least signal, Me assure—

5. Wert Thou but Stranger in ungracious country—
6. And Mine—the Door
7. Thou paused at, for a passing bounty—
8. No More—

9. Accused—wert Thou—and Myself—Tribunal—
10. Convicted—Sentenced—Ermine—not to Me
11. Half the Condition, thy Reverse—to follow—
12. Just to partake—the infamy—

13. The Tenant of the Narrow Cottage, wert Thou—
14. Permit to be
15. The Housewife in thy low attendance
16. Contenteth Me—

17. No Service hast Thou, I would not achieve it—
18. To die—or live—
19. The first—Sweet, proved I, ere I saw thee—
20. For Life—be Love—
