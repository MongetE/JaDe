1. The World—stands—solemner—to me—
2. Since I was wed—to Him—
3. A modesty befits the soul
4. That bears another's—name—
5. A doubt—if it be fair—indeed—
6. To wear that perfect—pearl—
7. The Man—upon the Woman—binds—
8. To clasp her soul—for all—
9. A prayer, that it more angel—prove—
10. A whiter Gift—within—
11. To that munificence, that chose—
12. So unadorned—a Queen—
13. A Gratitude—that such be true—
14. It had esteemed the Dream—
15. Too beautiful—for Shape to prove—
16. Or posture—to redeem!
