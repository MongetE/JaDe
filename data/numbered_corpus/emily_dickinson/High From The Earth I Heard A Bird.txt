1. High from the earth I heard a bird;
2. He trod upon the trees
3. As he esteemed them trifles,
4. And then he spied a breeze,
5. And situated softly
6. Upon a pile of wind
7. Which in a perturbation
8. Nature had left behind.
9. A joyous-going fellow
10. I gathered from his talk,
11. Which both of benediction
12. And badinage partook,
13. Without apparent burden,
14. I learned, in leafy wood
15. He was the faithful father
16. Of a dependent brood;
17. And this untoward transport
18. His remedy for care,â€”
19. A contrast to our respites.
20. How different we are!
