1. It's easy to invent a Life—
2. God does it—every Day—
3. Creation—but the Gambol
4. Of His Authority—

5. It's easy to efface it—
6. The thrifty Deity
7. Could scarce afford Eternity
8. To Spontaneity—

9. The Perished Patterns murmur—
10. But His Perturbless Plan
11. Proceed—inserting Here—a Sun—
12. There—leaving out a Man—
