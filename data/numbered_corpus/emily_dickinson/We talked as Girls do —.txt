1. We talked as Girls do —
2. Fond, and late —
3. We speculated fair, on every subject, but the Grave —

6. As we — Disposers — be —
7. And God, a Quiet Party
8. To our Authority —

9. But fondest, dwelt upon Ourself
10. As we eventual — be —
11. When Girls to Women, softly raised
12. We — occupy — Degree —

13. We parted with a contract
14. To cherish, and to write
15. But Heaven made both, impossible
16. Before another night.
