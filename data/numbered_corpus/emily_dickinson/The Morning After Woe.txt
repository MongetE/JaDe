1. The Morning after Woe—
2. 'Tis frequently the Way—
3. Surpasses all that rose before—
4. For utter Jubilee—

5. As Nature did not care—
6. And piled her Blossoms on—
7. And further to parade a Joy
8. Her Victim stared upon—

9. The Birds declaim their Tunes—
10. Pronouncing every word
11. Like Hammers—Did they know they fell
12. Like Litanies of Lead—

13. On here and there—a creature—
14. They'd modify the Glee
15. To fit some Crucifixal Clef—
16. Some Key of Calvary—
