1. Kill your Balm—and its Odors bless you—
2. Bare your Jessamine—to the storm—
3. And she will fling her maddest perfume—
4. Haply—your Summer night to Charm—

5. Stab the Bird—that built in your bosom—
6. Oh, could you catch her last Refrain—
7. Bubble! "forgive"—"Some better"—Bubble!
8. "Carol for Him—when I am gone"!
