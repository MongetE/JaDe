1. I like to see it lap the miles,
2. And lick the valleys up,
3. And stop to feed itself at tanks;
4. And then, prodigious, step 

5. Around a pile of mountains,
6. And, supercilious, peer
7. In shanties by the sides of roads;
8. And then a quarry pare 

9. To fit its sides, and crawl between,
10. Complaining all the while
11. In horrid, hooting stanza;
12. Then chase itself down the hill 

13. And neigh like Boanerges;
14. Then, punctual as a star,
15. Stop - docile and omnipotent -
16. At its own stable door.
