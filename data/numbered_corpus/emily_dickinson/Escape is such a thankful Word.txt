1. Escape is such a thankful Word
2. I often in the Night
3. Consider it unto myself
4. No spectacle in sight

5. Escape -  it is the Basket
6. In which the Heart is caught
7. When down some awful Battlement
8. The rest of Life is dropt -

9. 'Tis not to sight the savior -
10. It is to be the saved -
11. And that is why I lay my Head
12. Upon this trusty word -
