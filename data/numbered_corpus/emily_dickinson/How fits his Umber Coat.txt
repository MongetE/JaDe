1. How fits his Umber Coat
2. The Tailor of the Nut?
3. Combined without a seam
4. Like Raiment of a Dream -

5. Who spun the Auburn Cloth?
6. Computed how the girth?
7. The Chestnut aged grows
8. In those primeval Clothes -

9. We know that we are wise -
10. Accomplished in Surprise -
11. Yet by this Countryman -
12. This nature -  how undone!
