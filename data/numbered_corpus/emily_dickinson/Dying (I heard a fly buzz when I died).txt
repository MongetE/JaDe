1. I heard a fly buzz when I died;
2.     The stillness round my form 
3.     Was like the stillness in the air
4.     Between the heaves of storm.
5.     The eyes beside had wrung them dry,
6.     And breaths were gathering sure 
7.     For that last onset, when the king
8.     Be witnessed in his power.
9.     I willed my keepsakes, signed away
10.    What portion of me I 
11.    Could make assignable, — and then 
12.    There interposed a fly,

13.    With blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
14.    Between the light and me;
15.    And then the windows failed, and then
16.    I could not see to see.
