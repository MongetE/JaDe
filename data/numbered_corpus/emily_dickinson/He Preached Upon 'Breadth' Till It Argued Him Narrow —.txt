1. He preached upon 'Breadth' till it argued him narrow -
2. The Broad are too broad to define
3. And of 'Truth' until it proclaimed him a Liar -
4. The Truth never flaunted a Sign -

5. Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
6. As Gold the Pyrites would shun -
7. What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
8. To meet so enabled a Man!
