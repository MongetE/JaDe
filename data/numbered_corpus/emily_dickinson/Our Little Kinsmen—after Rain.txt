1. Our little Kinsmenâ€”after Rain
2. In plenty may be seen,
3. A Pink and Pulpy multitude
4. The tepid Ground upon.

5. A needless life, it seemed to me
6. Until a little Bird
7. As to a Hospitality
8. Advanced and breakfasted.

9. As I of He, so God of Me
10. I pondered, may have judged,
11. And left the little Angle Worm
12. With Modesties enlarged.
