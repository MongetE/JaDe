1. As imperceptibly as grief
2. The summer lapsed away, —
3. Too imperceptible, at last,
4. To seem like perfidy.
5. A quietness distilled,
6. As twilight long begun,
7. Or Nature, spending with herself
8. Sequestered afternoon.
9. The dusk drew earlier in,
10. The morning foreign shone, —
11. A courteous, yet harrowing grace,
12. As guest who would be gone.

13. And thus, without a wing,
14. Or service of a keel,
15. Our summer made her light escape
16. Into the beautiful.
