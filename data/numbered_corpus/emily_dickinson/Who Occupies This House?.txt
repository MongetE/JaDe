1. Who occupies this House?
2. A Stranger I must judge
3. Since No one know His Circumstance—

5. Are writ upon the Door
6. Or I should fear to pause
7. Where not so much as Honest Dog

12. Were I compelled to build

13. It should not be among
14. Inhabitants so still
15. But where the Birds assemble
16. And Boys were possible.

17. Before Myself was born
18. 'Twas settled, so they say,
19. A Territory for the Ghosts—
20. And Squirrels, formerly.

21. Until a Pioneer, as
22. Settlers often do
23. Liking the quiet of the Place
24. Attracted more unto—

25. And from a Settlement
26. A Capital has grown
27. Distinguished for the gravity
28. Of every Citizen.

29. The Owner of this House
30. A Stranger He must be—
31. Eternity's Acquaintances
32. Are mostly so—to me.
