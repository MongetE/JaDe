2. With but a single Star—
3. That often as a Cloud it met—
4. Blew out itself—for fear—

5. The Wind pursued the little Bush—
6. And drove away the Leaves
7. November left—then clambered up

10. A Dog's belated feet
11. Like intermittent Plush, he heard

14. And closer to the fire—
15. Her little Rocking Chair to draw—
16. And shiver for the Poor—

17. The Housewife's gentle Task—
18. How pleasanter—said she
19. Unto the Sofa opposite—
20. The Sleet—than May, no Thee—
