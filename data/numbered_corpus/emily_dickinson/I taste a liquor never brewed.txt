1. I taste a liquor never brewed--
2. From Tankards scooped in Pearl--
3. Not all the vats upon the Rhine
4. Yield such an Alcohol!

5. Inebriate of Air--am I--
6. And Debauchee of Dew--
7. Reeling--throÂ endless summer days--
8. From inns of Molten Blue--

9. When the "Landlords" turn the drunken Bee
10. Out of the Foxglove's door--
11. When Butterflies--renounce their drams--
12. I shall but drink the more!

13. Till Seraphs swing their snowy Hats--
14. And Saints--to windows run--
15. To see the little Tippler--
16. Leaning against the--Sun!
