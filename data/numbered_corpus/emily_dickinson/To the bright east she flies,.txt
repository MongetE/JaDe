1. To the bright east she flies,
2. Brothers of Paradise
3. Remit her home,
4. Without a change of wings,
5. Or Love's convenient things,
6. Enticed to come.

7. Fashioning what she is,
8. Fathoming what she was,
9. We deem we dream -
10. And that dissolves the days
11. Through which existence strays
12. Homeless at home.
