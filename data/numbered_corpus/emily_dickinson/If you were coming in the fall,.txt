1. If you were coming in the Fall,
2. I'd brush the Summer by
3. With half a smile, and half a spurn,
4. As Housewives do, a Fly.
5. If I could see you in a year,
6. I'd wind the months in balls---
7. And put them each in separate Drawers,
8. For fear the numbers fuse---
9. If only Centuries, delayed,
10. I'd count them on my Hand,
11. Subtracting, til my fingers dropped
12. Into Van Dieman's Land,
13. If certain, when this life was out---
14. That yours and mine, should be
15. I'd toss it yonder, like a Rind,
16. And take Eternity---
17. But, now, uncertain of the length
18. Of this, that is between,
19. It goads me, like the Goblin Bee---
20. That will not state--- its sting.
