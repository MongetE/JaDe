1. A Bird came down the Walk--
2. He did not know I saw--
3. He bit an Angle-worm in halves
4. And ate the fellow, raw.

5. And then he drank a Dew
6. From a convenient Grass--
7. And then hopped sidewise to the Wall
8. To let a Beetle pass.--

9. He glanced with rapid eyes
10. That hurried all aroundâ€”
11. They looked like frightened Beads, I thought--
12. He stirred his Velvet Head

13. Like one in danger; Cautious,
14. I offered him a Crumb
15. And he unrolled his feathers
16. And rowed him softer home--

17. Than oars divide the ocean,
18. Too silver for a seam,
19. Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon,
20. Leap, plashless, as they swim.
