1. Rearrange a 'Wife's' affection!
2. When they dislocate my Brain!
3. Amputate my freckled Bosom!
4. Make me bearded like a man!

5. Blush, my spirit, in thy Fastness -
6. Blush, my unacknowledged clay -
7. Seven years of troth have taught thee
8. More than Wifehood every may!

9. Love that never leaped its socket -
10. Trust entrenched in narrow pain -
11. Constancy thro' fire -  awarded -
12. Anguish -  bare of anodyne!

13. Burden -  borne so far triumphant -
14. None suspect me of the crown,
15. For I wear the 'Thorns' till Sunset -
16. Then -  my Diadem put on.

17. Big my Secret but it's bandaged -
18. It will never get away
19. Till the Day its Weary Keeper
20. Leads it through the Grave to thee.
