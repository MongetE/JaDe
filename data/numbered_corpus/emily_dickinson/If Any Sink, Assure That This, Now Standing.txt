1. If any sink, assure that this, now standing—
2. Failed like Themselves—and conscious that it rose—
3. Grew by the Fact, and not the Understanding
4. How Weakness passed—or Force—arose—

6. Dread, but the Whizzing, before the Ball—
7. When the Ball enters, enters Silence—
8. Dying—annuls the power to kill.
