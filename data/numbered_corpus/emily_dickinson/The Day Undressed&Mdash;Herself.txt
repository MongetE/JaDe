1. The Day undressed—Herself—
2. Her Garter—was of Gold—
3. Her Petticoat—of Purple plain—
4. Her Dimities—as old

5. Exactly—as the World—
6. And yet the newest Star—
7. Enrolled upon the Hemisphere
8. Be wrinkled—much as Her—

9. Too near to God—to pray—
10. Too near to Heaven—to fear—
11. The Lady of the Occident
12. Retired without a care—

13. Her Candle so expire
14. The flickering be seen
15. On Ball of Mast in Bosporus—
16. And Dome—and Window Pane—
