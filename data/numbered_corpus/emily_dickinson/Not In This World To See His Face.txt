1. Not in this world to see his face
2. Sounds long, until I read the place
3. Where this is said to be
4. But just the primer to a life
5. Unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
6. Clasped yet to him and me.

7. And yet, my primer suits me so
8. I would not choose a book to know
9. Than that, be sweeter wise;
10. Might some one else so learned be.
11. And leave me just my A B C,
12. Himself could have the skies.
