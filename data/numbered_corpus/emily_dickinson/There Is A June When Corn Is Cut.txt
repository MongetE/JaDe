1. There is a June when Corn is cut
2. And Roses in the Seed—
3. A Summer briefer than the first
4. But tenderer indeed

5. As should a Face supposed the Grave's
6. Emerge a single Noon
7. In the Vermilion that it wore
8. Affect us, and return—

9. Two Seasons, it is said, exist—
10. The Summer of the Just,
11. And this of Ours, diversified
12. With Prospect, and with Frost—

13. May not our Second with its First
14. So infinite compare
15. That We but recollect the one
16. The other to prefer?
