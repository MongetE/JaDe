1. There's something quieter than sleep
2. Within this inner room!
3. It wears a sprig upon its breast—
4. And will not tell its name.

5. Some touch it, and some kiss it—
6. Some chafe its idle hand—
7. It has a simple gravity
8. I do not understand!

9. I would not weep if I were they—
10. How rude in one to sob!
11. Might scare the quiet fairy
12. Back to her native wood!

13. While simple-hearted neighbors
14. Chat of the "Early dead"—
15. We—prone to periphrasis
16. Remark that Birds have fled!
