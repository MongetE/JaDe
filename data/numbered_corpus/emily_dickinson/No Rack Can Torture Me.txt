1. No Rack can torture me—
2. My Soul—at Liberty—
3. Behind this mortal Bone
4. There knits a bolder One—

5. You cannot prick with saw—
6. Nor pierce with Scimitar—
7. Two Bodies—therefore be—
8. Bind One—The Other fly—

9. The Eagle of his Nest
10. No easier divest—
11. And gain the Sky
12. Than mayest Thou—

13. Except Thyself may be
14. Thine Enemy—
15. Captivity is Consciousness—
16. So's Liberty.
