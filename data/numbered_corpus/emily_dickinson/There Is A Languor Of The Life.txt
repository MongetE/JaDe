1. There is a Languor of the Life
2. More imminent than Pain—
3. 'Tis Pain's Successor—When the Soul
4. Has suffered all it can—

5. A Drowsiness—diffuses—
6. A Dimness like a Fog
7. Envelops Consciousness—
8. As Mists—obliterate a Crag.

9. The Surgeon—does not blanch—at pain
10. His Habit—is severe—
11. But tell him that it ceased to feel—
12. The Creature lying there—

13. And he will tell you—skill is late—
14. A Mightier than He—
15. Has ministered before Him—
16. There's no Vitality.
