1. How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand,
2. Until a sudden sky
3. Reveals the fact that One is rapt
4. Forever from the Eye—

5. Members of the Invisible,
6. Existing, while we stare,
7. In Leagueless Opportunity,
8. O'ertakenless, as the Air—

9. Why didn't we detain Them?
10. The Heavens with a smile,
11. Sweep by our disappointed Heads
12. Without a syllable—
