1. The Heaven vests for Each
2. In that small Deity
3. It craved the grace to worship
4. Some bashful Summer's Day—

5. Half shrinking from the Glory
6. It importuned to see
7. Till these faint Tabernacles drop
8. In full Eternity—

9. How imminent the Venture—
10. As one should sue a Star—
11. For His mean sake to leave the Row
12. And entertain Despair—

13. A Clemency so common—
14. We almost cease to fear—
15. Enabling the minutest—
16. And furthest—to adore—
