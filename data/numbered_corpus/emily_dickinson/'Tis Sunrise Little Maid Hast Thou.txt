1. 'Tis Sunrise—Little Maid—Hast Thou
2. No Station in the Day?
3. 'Twas not thy wont, to hinder so—
4. Retrieve thine industry—

5. 'Tis Noon—My little Maid—
6. Alas—and art thou sleeping yet?
7. The Lily—waiting to be Wed—
8. The Bee—Hast thou forgot?

9. My little Maid—'Tis Night—Alas
10. That Night should be to thee
11. Instead of Morning—Had'st thou broached
12. Thy little Plan to Die—
13. Dissuade thee, if I could not, Sweet,
14. I might have aided—thee—
