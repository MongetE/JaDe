1. After a hundred years
2. Nobody knows the place, —
3. Agony, that enacted there,
4. Motionless as peace.

5. Weeds triumphant ranged,
6. Strangers strolled and spelled
7. At the lone orthography
8. Of the elder dead.

9. Winds of summer fields
10. Recollect the way, —
11. Instinct picking up the key
12. Dropped by memory.
