1. No brigadier throughout the year
2. So civic as the jay.
3. A neighbor and a warrior too,
4. With shrill felicity

5. Pursuing winds that censure us
6. A February day,
7. The brother of the universe
8. Was never blown away.

9. The snow and he are intimate;
10. I 've often seen them play
11. When heaven looked upon us all
12. With such severity,

13. I felt apology were due
14. To an insulted sky,
15. Whose pompous frown was nutriment
16. To their temerity.

17. The pillow of this daring head
18. Is pungent evergreens;
19. His larder — terse and militant —
20. Unknown, refreshing things;

21. His character a tonic,
22. His future a dispute;
23. Unfair an immortality
24. That leaves this neighbor out.
