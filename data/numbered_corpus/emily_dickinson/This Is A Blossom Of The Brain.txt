1. This is a Blossom of the Brain—
2. A small—italic Seed
3. Lodged by Design or Happening
4. The Spirit fructified—

5. Shy as the Wind of his Chambers
6. Swift as a Freshet's Tongue
7. So of the Flower of the Soul
8. Its process is unknown.

9. When it is found, a few rejoice
10. The Wise convey it Home
11. Carefully cherishing the spot
12. If other Flower become.

13. When it is lost, that Day shall be
14. The Funeral of God,
15. Upon his Breast, a closing Soul
16. The Flower of our Lord.
