1. I'm un-ore-clowded, too! free from the mist!
2. The blind and late Heaven's-eyes great Occulist,
3. Obscured with the false fires of his sceme,
4. Not half those souls are lightned by this theme.

5. Unhappy murmurers, that still repine
6. (After th' Eclipse our Sun doth brighter shine),
7. Recant your false grief, and your true joys know;
8. Your blisse is endlesse, as you fear'd your woe!
9. What fort'nate flood is this! what storm of wit!
10. Oh, who would live, and not ore-whelm'd in it?
11. No more a fatal Deluge shall be hurl'd:
12. This inundation hath sav'd the world.
13. Once more the mighty Fletcher doth arise,
14. Roab'd in a vest studded with stars and eyes
15. Of all his former glories; his last worth
16. Imbroiderd with what yet light ere brought forth.
17. See! in this glad farewel he doth appear
18. Stuck with the Constellations of his Sphere,
19. Fearing we numb'd fear'd no flagration,
20. Hath curl'd all his fires in this one ONE:
21. Which (as they guard his hallowed chast urn)
22. The dull aproaching hereticks do burn.

23. Fletcher at his adieu carouses thus
24. To the luxurious ingenious,
25. As Cleopatra did of old out-vie,
26. Th' un-numb'red dishes of her Anthony,
27. When (he at th' empty board a wonderer)
28. Smiling she calls for pearl and vinegar,
29. First pledges him in's BREATH, then at one draught
30. Swallows THREE KINGDOMS of To HIS BEST THOUGHT.

31. Hear, oh ye valiant writers, and subscribe;
32. (His force set by) y'are conquer'd by this bribe.
33. Though you hold out your selves, he doth commit
34. In this a sacred treason in your wit;
35. Although in poems desperately stout,
36. Give up: this overture must buy you out.

37. Thus with some prodigal us'rer 't doth fare,
38. That keeps his gold still vayl'd, his steel-breast bare;
39. That doth exceed his coffers all but's eye,
40. And his eyes' idol the wing'd Deity:
41. That cannot lock his mines with half the art
42. As some rich beauty doth his wretched heart;
43. Wild at his real poverty, and so wise
44. To win her, turns himself into a prise.
45. First startles her with th' emerald Mad-Lover
46. The ruby Arcas, least she should recover
47. Her dazled thought, a Diamond he throws,
48. Splendid in all the bright Aspatia's woes;
49. Then to sum up the abstract of his store,
50. He flings a rope of Pearl of forty more.
51. Ah, see! the stagg'ring virtue faints! which he
52. Beholding, darts his Wealths Epitome;
53. And now, to consummate her wished fall,
54. Shows this one Carbuncle, that darkens all.
