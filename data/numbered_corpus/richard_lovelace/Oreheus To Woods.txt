1. Heark!  Oh heark! you guilty trees,
2. In whose gloomy galleries
3. Was the cruell'st murder done,
4. That e're yet eclipst the sunne.
5. Be then henceforth in your twigges
6. Blasted, e're you sprout to sprigges;
7. Feele no season of the yeere,
8. But what shaves off all your haire,
9. Nor carve any from your wombes
10. Ought but coffins and their tombes.
