2. I laugh and sing, but cannot tell
3. Whether the folly on't sounds well;
4. But then I groan,
5. Methinks, in tune;
6. Whilst grief, despair and fear dance to the air
7. Of my despised prayer.

8. II.

9. A pretty antick love does this,
10. Then strikes a galliard with a kiss;
11. As in the end
12. The chords they rend;
13. So you but with a touch from your fair hand
14. Turn all to saraband.
