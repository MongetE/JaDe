1. I.

2. Like to the sent'nel stars, I watch all night;
3. For still the grand round of your light
4. And glorious breast
5. Awake in me an east:
6. Nor will my rolling eyes ere know a west.

7. II.

8. Now on my down I'm toss'd as on a wave,
9. And my repose is made my grave;
10. Fluttering I lye,
11. Do beat my self and dye,
12. But for a resurrection from your eye.

13. III.

14. Ah, my fair murdresse! dost thou cruelly heal
15. With various pains to make me well?
16. Then let me be
17. Thy cut anatomie,
18. And in each mangled part my heart you'l see.
