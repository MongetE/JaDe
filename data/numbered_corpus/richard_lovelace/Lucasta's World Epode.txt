1. I.
2. Cold as the breath of winds that blow
3. To silver shot descending snow,
4. Lucasta sigh't; when she did close
5. The world in frosty chaines!
6. And then a frowne to rubies frose
7. The blood boyl'd in our veines:
8. Yet cooled not the heat her sphere
9. Of beauties first had kindled there.

10. II.
11. Then mov'd, and with a suddaine flame
12. Impatient to melt all againe,
13. Straight from her eyes she lightning hurl'd,
14. And earth in ashes mournes;
15. The sun his blaze denies the world,
16. And in her luster burnes:
17. Yet warmed not the hearts, her nice
18. Disdaine had first congeal'd to ice.

19. III.
20. And now her teares nor griev'd desire
21. Can quench this raging, pleasing fire;
22. Fate but one way allowes; behold
23. Her smiles' divinity!
24. They fann'd this heat, and thaw'd that cold,
25. So fram'd up a new sky.
26. Thus earth, from flames and ice repreev'd,
27. E're since hath in her sun-shine liv'd.
