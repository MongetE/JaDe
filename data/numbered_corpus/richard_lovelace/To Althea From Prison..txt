1. I.
2. When love with unconfined wings
3. Hovers within my gates;
4. And my divine ALTHEA brings
5. To whisper at the grates;
6. When I lye tangled in her haire,
7. And fetterd to her eye,
8. The birds, that wanton in the aire,
9. Know no such liberty.

10. II.
11. When flowing cups run swiftly round
12. With no allaying THAMES,
13. Our carelesse heads with roses bound,
14. Our hearts with loyal flames;
15. When thirsty griefe in wine we steepe,
16. When healths and draughts go free,
17. Fishes, that tipple in the deepe,
18. Know no such libertie.

19. III.
20. When (like committed linnets) I
21. With shriller throat shall sing
22. The sweetnes, mercy, majesty,
23. And glories of my King.
24. When I shall voyce aloud, how good
25. He is, how great should be,
26. Inlarged winds, that curle the flood,
27. Know no such liberty.

28. IV.
29. Stone walls doe not a prison make,
30. Nor iron bars a cage;
31. Mindes innocent and quiet take
32. That for an hermitage;
33. If I have freedome in my love,
34. And in my soule am free,
35. Angels alone that sore above
36. Enjoy such liberty.
