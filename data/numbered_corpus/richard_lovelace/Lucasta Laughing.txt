1. Heark, how she laughs aloud,
2. Although the world put on its shrowd:
3. Wept at by the fantastic crowd,
4. Who cry: one drop, let fall
5. From her, might save the universal ball.
6. She laughs again
7. At our ridiculous pain;
8. And at our merry misery
9. She laughs, until she cry.
10. Sages, forbear
11. That ill-contrived tear,
12. Although your fear
13. Doth barricado hope from your soft ear.
14. That which still makes her mirth to flow,
15. Is our sinister-handed woe,
16. Which downwards on its head doth go,
17. And, ere that it is sown, doth grow.
18. This makes her spleen contract,
19. And her just pleasure feast:
20. For the unjustest act
21. Is still the pleasant'st jest.
