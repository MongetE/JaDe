2. And learn to chaunt a goddess praise;

4. Employ'd to serve her deity:
5. And warble forth, ye virgins nine,
6. Some music to my Valentine.

12. To beautifie my Valentine.

13. "She's Nature's choicest cabinet,
14. Where honour, beauty, worth and wit
15. Are all united in her breast.

17. All virtues that are most divine
18. Shine clearest in my Valentine."And learn to chaunt a goddess praise;
