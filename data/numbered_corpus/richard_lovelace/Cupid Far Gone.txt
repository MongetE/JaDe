1. I.
2. What, so beyond all madnesse is the elf,
3. Now he hath got out of himself!
4. His fatal enemy the Bee,
5. Nor his deceiv'd artillerie,
6. His shackles, nor the roses bough
7. Ne'r half so netled him, as he is now.

8. II.
9. See! at's own mother he is offering;
10. His finger now fits any ring;
11. Old Cybele he would enjoy,
12. And now the girl, and now the boy.
13. He proffers Jove a back caresse,
14. And all his love in the antipodes.

15. III.
16. Jealous of his chast Psyche, raging he
17. Quarrels with student Mercurie,
18. And with a proud submissive breath
19. Offers to change his darts with Death.
20. He strikes at the bright eye of day,
21. And Juno tumbles in her milky way.

22. IV.
23. The dear sweet secrets of the gods he tells,
24. And with loath'd hate lov'd heaven he swells;
25. Now, like a fury, he belies
26. Myriads of pure virginities,
27. And swears, with this false frenzy hurl'd,
28. There's not a vertuous she in all the world.

29. V.
30. Olympus he renownces, then descends,
31. And makes a friendship with the fiends;
32. Bids Charon be no more a slave,
33. He Argos rigg'd with stars shall have,
34. And triple Cerberus from below
35. Must leash'd t' himself with him a hunting go.
