1. Behold! three sister-wonders, in whom met,
2. Distinct and chast, the splendrous counterfeit
3. Of Juno, Venus and the warlike Maid,
4. Each in their three divinities array'd;
5. The majesty and state of Heav'ns great Queen,
6. And when she treats the gods, her noble meen;
7. The sweet victorious beauties and desires
8. O' th' sea-born princess, empresse too of fires;
9. The sacred arts and glorious lawrels torn
10. From the fair brow o' th' goddesse father-born;
11. All these were quarter'd in each snowy coat,
12. With canton'd honours of their own, to boot.
13. Paris, by fate new-wak'd from his dead cell,
14. Is charg'd to give his doom impossible.
15. He views in each the brav'ry of all Ide;
16. Whilst one, as once three, doth his soul divide.
17. Then sighs so equally they're glorious all:
18. WHAT PITY THE WHOLE WORLD IS BUT ONE BALL!
