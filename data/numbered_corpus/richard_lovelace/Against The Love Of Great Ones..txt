1. Vnhappy youth, betrayd by Fate
2. To such a love hath sainted hate,
3. And damned those celestiall bands
4. Are onely knit with equal hands;
5. The love of great ones is a love,
6. Gods are incapable to prove:
7. For where there is a joy uneven,
8. There never, never can be Heav'n:
9. 'Tis such a love as is not sent
10. To fiends as yet for punishment;
11. IXION willingly doth feele
12. The gyre of his eternal wheele,
13. Nor would he now exchange his paine
14. For cloudes and goddesses againe.

15. Wouldst thou with tempests lye?  Then bow
16. To th' rougher furrows of her brow,
17. Or make a thunder-bolt thy choyce?
18. Then catch at her more fatal voyce;
19. Or 'gender with the lightning? trye
20. The subtler flashes of her eye:
21. Poore SEMELE wel knew the same,
22. Who both imbrac't her God and flame;
23. And not alone in soule did burne,
24. But in this love did ashes turne.

25. How il doth majesty injoy
26. The bow and gaity oth' boy,
27. As if the purple-roabe should sit,
28. And sentence give ith' chayr of wit.

29. Say, ever-dying wretch, to whom
30. Each answer is a certaine doom,
31. What is it that you would possesse,
32. The Countes, or the naked Besse?
33. Would you her gowne or title do?
34. Her box or gem, the thing or show?
35. If you meane HER, the very HER,
36. Abstracted from her caracter,
37. Unhappy boy! you may as soone
38. With fawning wanton with the Moone,
39. Or with an amorous complaint
40. Get prostitute your very saint;
41. Not that we are not mortal, or
42. Fly VENUS altars, and abhor
43. The selfesame knack, for which you pine;
44. But we (defend us!) are divine,
45. [Not] female, but madam born, and come
46. From a right-honourable wombe.
47. Shal we then mingle with the base,
48. And bring a silver-tinsell race?
49. Whilst th' issue noble wil not passe
50. The gold alloyd (almost halfe brasse),
51. And th' blood in each veine doth appeare,
52. Part thick Booreinn, part Lady Cleare;
53. Like to the sordid insects sprung
54. From Father Sun and Mother Dung:
55. Yet lose we not the hold we have,
56. But faster graspe the trembling slave;
57. Play at baloon with's heart, and winde
58. The strings like scaines, steale into his minde
59. Ten thousand false and feigned joyes
60. Far worse then they; whilst, like whipt boys,
61. After this scourge hee's hush with toys.

62. This heard, Sir, play stil in her eyes,
63. And be a dying, live like flyes
64. Caught by their angle-legs, and whom
65. The torch laughs peece-meale to consume.
