7. Be proud! and if your waters be
8. Foul'd with a counterfeyted teare,
9. Or some false sigh hath stained yee,
10. Haste, and be purified there.

12. And when her rosie gates y'have trac'd,

23. You trickle wantonly, beware:

27. And see! you boyle as well as I;
28. You, that to coole her did aspire,

33. That in so small a time as this,
34. Through all the Heavens you were brought
35. Of Vertue, Honour, Love and Blisse.
