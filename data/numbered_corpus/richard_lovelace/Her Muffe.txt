1. I.
2. Twas not for some calm blessing to deceive,
3. Thou didst thy polish'd hands in shagg'd furs weave;
4. It were no blessing thus obtain'd;
5. Thou rather would'st a curse have gain'd,
6. Then let thy warm driven snow be ever stain'd.

7. II.
8. Not that you feared the discolo'ring cold
9. Might alchymize their silver into gold;
10. Nor could your ten white nuns so sin,
11. That you should thus pennance them in,
12. Each in her coarse hair smock of discipline.

13. III.
14. Nor, Hero-like who, on their crest still wore
15. A lyon, panther, leopard, or a bore,
16. To looke their enemies in their herse,
17. Thou would'st thy hand should deeper pierce,
18. And, in its softness rough, appear more fierce.

19. IV.
20. No, no, LUCASTA, destiny decreed,
21. That beasts to thee a sacrifice should bleed,
22. And strip themselves to make you gay:
23. For ne'r yet herald did display
24. A coat, where SABLES upon ERMIN lay.

25. V.
26. This for lay-lovers, that must stand at dore,
27. Salute the threshold, and admire no more;
28. But I, in my invention tough,
29. Rate not this outward bliss enough,
30. But still contemplate must the hidden muffe.
