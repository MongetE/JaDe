3. Thus: By my awfull bow and quiver,
4. Yon' weeping, kissing, smiling pair,

8. Up then to th' head with his best art
9. Full of spite and envy blowne,
10. At her constant marble heart,
11. He drawes his swiftest surest dart,
12. Which bounded back, and hit his owne.

14. Now the prince of fires burnes;
15. Flames in the luster of her eyes;
16. Triumphant she, refuses, scornes;
17. He submits, adores and mournes,
18. And is his votresse sacrifice.

20. Foolish boy! resolve me now
21. What 'tis to sigh and not be heard?
22. He weeping kneel'd, and made a vow:
23. The world shall love as yon' fast two;
24. So on his sing'd wings up he steer'd.
