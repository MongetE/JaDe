1. I.

2. Strive not, vain lover, to be fine;
3. Thy silk's the silk-worm's, and not thine:
4. You lessen to a fly your mistriss' thought,
5. To think it may be in a cobweb caught.
6. What, though her thin transparent lawn
7. Thy heart in a strong net hath drawn:
8. Not all the arms the god of fire ere made
9. Can the soft bulwarks of nak'd love invade.

10. II.

11. Be truly fine, then, and yourself dress
12. In her fair soul's immac'late glass.
13. Then by reflection you may have the bliss
14. Perhaps to see what a true fineness is;
15. When all your gawderies will fit
16. Those only that are poor in wit.
17. She that a clinquant outside doth adore,
18. Dotes on a gilded statue and no more.
