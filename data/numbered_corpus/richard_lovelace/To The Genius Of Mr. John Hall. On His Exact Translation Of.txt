1. Tis not from cheap thanks thinly to repay
2. Th' immortal grove of thy fair-order'd bay
3. Thou planted'st round my humble fane, that I
4. Stick on thy hearse this sprig of Elegie:
5. Nor that your soul so fast was link'd in me,
6. That now I've both, since't has forsaken thee:
7. That thus I stand a Swisse before thy gate,
8. And dare, for such another, time and fate.
9. Alas! our faiths made different essays,
10. Our Minds and Merits brake two several ways;
11. Justice commands I wake thy learned dust,
12. And truth, in whom all causes center must.

13. Behold! when but a youth, thou fierce didst whip
14. Upright the crooked age, and gilt vice strip;
15. A senator praetext, that knew'st to sway
16. The fasces, yet under the ferula;
17. Rank'd with the sage, ere blossome did thy chin,
18. Sleeked without, and hair all ore within,
19. Who in the school could'st argue as in schools:
20. Thy lessons were ev'n academie rules.
21. So that fair Cam saw thee matriculate,
22. At once a tyro and a graduate.

23. At nineteen, what ESSAYES have we beheld!
24. That well might have the book of Dogmas swell'd;
25. Tough Paradoxes, such as Tully's, thou
26. Didst heat thee with, when snowy was thy brow,
27. When thy undown'd face mov'd the Nine to shake,
28. And of the Muses did a decad make.
29. What shall I say? by what allusion bold?
30. NONE BUT THE SUN WAS ERE SO YOUNG AND OLD.

31. Young reverend shade, ascend awhile! whilst we
32. Now celebrate this posthume victorie,
33. This victory, that doth contract in death
34. Ev'n all the pow'rs and labours of thy breath.
35. Like the Judean Hero, in thy fall
36. Thou pull'st the house of learning on us all.
37. And as that soldier conquest doubted not,
38. Who but one splinter had of Castriot,
39. But would assault ev'n death so strongly charmd,
40. And naked oppose rocks, with his bone arm'd;
41. So we, secure in this fair relique, stand
42. The slings and darts shot by each profane hand.
43. These soveraign leaves thou left'st us are become
44. Sear clothes against all Times infection.

45. Sacred Hierocles, whose heav'nly thought
46. First acted ore this comment, ere it wrote,
47. Thou hast so spirited, elixir'd, we
48. Conceive there is a noble alchymie,
49. That's turning of this gold to something more
50. Pretious than gold, we never knew before.
51. Who now shall doubt the metempsychosis
52. Of the great Author, that shall peruse this?
53. Let others dream thy shadow wandering strays
54. In th' Elizian mazes hid with bays;
55. Or that, snatcht up in th' upper region,
56. 'Tis kindled there a constellation;
57. I have inform'd me, and declare with ease
58. THY SOUL IS FLED INTO HIEROCLES.
