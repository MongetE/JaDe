1. Why should you swear I am forsworn,
2. Since thine I vowed to be?
3. Lady, it is already morn,
4. And 'twas last night I swore to thee
5. That fond impossibility.

6. Have I not loved thee much and long,
7. A tedious twelve hours' space?
8. I must all other beauties wrong,
9. And rob thee of a new embrace,
10. Could I still dote upon thy face.

11. Not but all joy in thy brown hair
12. By others may be found;â€”
13. But I must search the black and fair,
14. Like skilful mineralists that sound
15. For treasure in unploughed-up ground.

16. Then if, when I have loved my round,
17. Thou prov'st the pleasant she,
18. With spoils of meaner beauties crowned
19. I laden will return to thee,
20. Ev'n sated with variety.
