1. I.
2. In mine one monument I lye,
3. And in my self am buried;
4. Sure, the quick lightning of her eye
5. Melted my soul ith' scabberd dead;
6. And now like some pale ghost I walk,
7. And with another's spirit talk.

8. II.
9. Nor can her beams a heat convey,
10. That may my frozen bosome warm,
11. Unless her smiles have pow'r, as they,
12. That a cross charm can countercharm.
13. But this is such a pleasing pain,
14. I'm loth to be alive again.



15. ANOTHER.

16. I did believe I was in heav'n,
17. When first the heav'n her self was giv'n,
18. That in my heart her beams did passe
19. As some the sun keep in a glasse,
20. So that her beauties thorow me
21. Did hurt my rival-enemy.
22. But fate, alas! decreed it so,
23. That I was engine to my woe:
24. For, as a corner'd christal spot,
25. My heart diaphanous was not;
26. But solid stuffe, where her eye flings
27. Quick fire upon the catching strings:
28. Yet, as at triumphs in the night,
29. You see the Prince's Arms in light,
30. So, when I once was set on flame,
31. I burnt all ore the letters of her name.
