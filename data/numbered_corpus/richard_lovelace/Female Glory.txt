1. Mongst the worlds wonders, there doth yet remain
2. One greater than the rest, that's all those o're again,
3. And her own self beside: A Lady, whose soft breast
4. Is with vast honours soul and virtues life possest.
5. Fair as original light first from the chaos shot,
6. When day in virgin-beams triumph'd, and night was not,
7. And as that breath infus'd in the new-breather good,
8. When ill unknown was dumb, and bad not understood;
9. Chearful, as that aspect at this world's finishing,
10. When cherubims clapp'd wings, and th' sons of Heaven did sing;
11. Chast as th' Arabian bird, who all the ayr denyes,
12. And ev'n in flames expires, when with her selfe she lyes.
13. Oh! she's as kind as drops of new faln April showers,
14. That on each gentle breast spring fresh perfuming flowers;
15. She's constant, gen'rous, fixt; she's calm, she is the all
16. We can of vertue, honour, faith, or glory call,
17. And she is (whom I thus transmit to endless fame)
18. Mistresse oth' world and me, and LAURA is her name.
