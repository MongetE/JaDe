1. See! what a clouded majesty, and eyes
2. Whose glory through their mist doth brighter rise!
3. See! what an humble bravery doth shine,
4. And griefe triumphant breaking through each line,
5. How it commands the face! so sweet a scorne
6. Never did HAPPY MISERY adorne!
7. So sacred a contempt, that others show
8. To this, (oth' height of all the wheele) below,
9. That mightiest monarchs by this shaded booke
10. May coppy out their proudest, richest looke.

11. Whilst the true eaglet this quick luster spies,
12. And by his SUN'S enlightens his owne eyes;
13. He cures his cares, his burthen feeles, then streight
14. Joyes that so lightly he can beare such weight;
15. Whilst either eithers passion doth borrow,
16. And both doe grieve the same victorious sorrow.

17. These, my best LILLY, with so bold a spirit
18. And soft a grace, as if thou didst inherit
19. For that time all their greatnesse, and didst draw
20. With those brave eyes your royal sitters saw.

21. Not as of old, when a rough hand did speake
22. A strong aspect, and a faire face, a weake;
23. When only a black beard cried villaine, and
24. By hieroglyphicks we could understand;
25. When chrystall typified in a white spot,
26. And the bright ruby was but one red blot;
27. Thou dost the things Orientally the same
28. Not only paintst its colour, but its flame:
29. Thou sorrow canst designe without a teare,
30. And with the man his very hope or feare;
31. So that th' amazed world shall henceforth finde
32. None but my LILLY ever drew a MINDE.
