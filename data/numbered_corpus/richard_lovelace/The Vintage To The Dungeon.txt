1. I.

2. Sing out, pent soules, sing cheerefully!
3. Care shackles you in liberty:
4. Mirth frees you in captivity.
5. Would you double fetters adde?
6. Else why so sadde?

7. Besides your pinion'd armes youl finde
8. Griefe too can manakell the minde.

9. II.

10. Live then, pris'ners, uncontrol'd;
11. Drink oth' strong, the rich, the old,
12. Till wine too hath your wits in hold;
13. Then if still your jollitie
14. And throats are free--

15. Tryumph in your bonds and paines,
16. And daunce to the music of your chaines.
