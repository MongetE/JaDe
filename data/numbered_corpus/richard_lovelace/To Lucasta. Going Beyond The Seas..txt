2. If to be absent were to be
3. Away from thee;
4. Or that when I am gone,
5. You or I were alone;
6. Then my LUCASTA might I crave
7. Pity from blustring winde or swallowing wave.

8. II.
9. But I'le not sigh one blast or gale
10. To swell my saile,
11. Or pay a teare to swage
12. The foaming blew-gods rage;
13. For whether he will let me passe
14. Or no, I'm still as happy as I was.

15. III.
16. Though seas and land betwixt us both,
17. Our faith and troth,
18. Like separated soules,
19. All time and space controules:
20. Above the highest sphere wee meet,
21. Unseene, unknowne, and greet as angels greet

22. IV.
23. So then we doe anticipate
24. Our after-fate,
25. And are alive i'th' skies,
26. If thus our lips and eyes
27. Can speake like spirits unconfin'd
28. In Heav'n, their earthy bodies left behind.
