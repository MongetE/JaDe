1. I.
2. Eastrich! thou featherd foole, and easie prey,
3. That larger sailes to thy broad vessell needst;
4. Snakes through thy guttur-neck hisse all the day,
5. Then on thy iron messe at supper feedst.

6. II.
7. O what a glorious transmigration
8. From this to so divine an edifice
9. Hast thou straight made! heere from a winged stone
10. Transform'd into a bird of paradice!

11. III.
12. Now doe thy plumes for hiew and luster vie
13. With th' arch of heav'n that triumphs or'e past wet,
14. And in a rich enamel'd pinion lye
15. With saphyres, amethists and opalls set.

16. IV.
17. Sometime they wing her side,  strive to drown
18. The day's eyes piercing beames, whose am'rous heat
19. Sollicites still, 'till with this shield of downe
20. From her brave face his glowing fires are beat.

21. V.
22. But whilst a plumy curtaine she doth draw,
23. A chrystall mirror sparkles in thy breast,
24. In which her fresh aspect when as she saw,
25. And then her foe retired to the west.

26. VI.
27. Deare engine, that oth' sun got'st me the day,
28. 'Spite of his hot assaults mad'st him retreat!
29. No wind (said she) dare with thee henceforth play
30. But mine own breath to coole the tyrants heat.

31. VII.
32. My lively shade thou ever shalt retaine
33. In thy inclosed feather-framed glasse,
34. And but unto our selves to all remaine
35. Invisible, thou feature of this face!

36. VIII.
37. So said, her sad swaine over-heard and cried:
38. Yee Gods! for faith unstaind this a reward!
39. Feathers and glasse t'outweigh my vertue tryed!
40. Ah! show their empty strength! the gods accord.

41. IX.
42. Now fall'n the brittle favourite lyes and burst!
43. Amas'd LUCASTA weepes, repents and flies
44. To her ALEXIS, vowes her selfe acurst,
45. If hence she dresse her selfe but in his eyes.
