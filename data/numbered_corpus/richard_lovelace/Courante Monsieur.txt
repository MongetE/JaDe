1. That frown, Aminta, now hath drown'd
2. Thy bright front's pow'r, and crown'd
3. Me that was bound.
4. No, no, deceived cruel, no!
5. Love's fiery darts,
6. Till tipt with kisses, never kindle hearts.

7. Adieu, weak beauteous tyrant, see!
8. Thy angry flames meant me,
9. Retort on thee:
10. For know, it is decreed, proud fair,
11. I ne'r must dye
12. By any scorching, but a melting, eye.
