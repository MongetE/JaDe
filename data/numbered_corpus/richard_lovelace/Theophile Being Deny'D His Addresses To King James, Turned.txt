1. THEOPHILE BEING DENY'D HIS ADDRESSES TO KING JAMES,
2. TURNED THE AFFRONT TO HIS OWN GLORY IN THIS EPIGRAM.

3. Si Jaques, le Roy du scavior,
4. Ne trouue bon de me voir,
5. Voila la cause infallible!
6. Car, ravy de mon escrit,
7. Il creut, que j'estois tout esprit
8. Et par consequent invisible.

9. LINEALLY TRANSLATED OUT OF THE FRENCH.

10. If James, the king of wit,
11. To see me thought not fit,
12. Sure this the cause hath been,
13. That, ravish'd with my merit,
14. He thought I was all spirit,
15. And so not to be seen.
