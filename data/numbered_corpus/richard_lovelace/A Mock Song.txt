1. I.
2. Now Whitehall's in the grave,
3. And our head is our slave,
4. The bright pearl in his close shell of oyster;
5. Now the miter is lost,
6. The proud Praelates, too, crost,
7. And all Rome's confin'd to a cloister.
8. He, that Tarquin was styl'd,
9. Our white land's exil'd,
10. Yea, undefil'd;
11. Not a court ape's left to confute us;
12. Then let your voyces rise high,
13. As your colours did flye,
14. And flour'shing cry:
15. Long live the brave Oliver-Brutus.

16. II.
17. Now the sun is unarm'd,
18. And the moon by us charm'd,
19. All the stars dissolv'd to a jelly;
20. Now the thighs of the Crown
21. And the arms are lopp'd down,
22. And the body is all but a belly.
23. Let the Commons go on,
24. The town is our own,
25. We'l rule alone:
26. For the Knights have yielded their spent-gorge;
27. And an order is tane
28. With HONY SOIT profane,
29. Shout forth amain:
30. For our Dragon hath vanquish'd the St. George.
