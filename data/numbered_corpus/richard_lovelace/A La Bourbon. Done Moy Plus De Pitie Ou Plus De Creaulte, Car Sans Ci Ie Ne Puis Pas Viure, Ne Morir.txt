1. I.
2. Divine Destroyer, pitty me no more,
3. Or else more pitty me;
4. Give me more love, ah, quickly give me more,
5. Or else more cruelty!
6. For left thus as I am,
7. My heart is ice and flame;
8. And languishing thus, I
9. Can neither live nor dye!

10. II.
11. Your glories are eclipst, and hidden in the grave
12. Of this indifferency;
13. And, Caelia, you can neither altars have,
14. Nor I, a Diety:
15. They are aspects divine,
16. That still or smile, or shine,
17. Or, like th' offended sky,
18. Frowne death immediately.
