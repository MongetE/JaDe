1. To the richest Treasury
2. That e'er fill'd ambitious eye;
3. To the faire bright Magazin
4. Hath impoverisht Love's Queen;
5. To th' Exchequer of all honour
6. (All take pensions but from her);
7. To the taper of the thore
8. Which the god himselfe but bore;
9. To the Sea of Chaste Delight;
10. Let me cast the Drop I write.
11. And as at Loretto's shrine
12. Caesar shovels in his mine,
13. Th' Empres spreads her carkanets,
14. The lords submit their coronets,
15. Knights their chased armes hang by,
16. Maids diamond-ruby fancies tye;
17. Whilst from the pilgrim she wears
18. One poore false pearl, but ten true tears:
19. So among the Orient prize,
20. (Saphyr-onyx eulogies)
21. Offer'd up unto your fame,
22. Take my garnet-dublet name,
23. And vouchsafe 'midst those rich joyes
24. (With devotion) these toyes.
