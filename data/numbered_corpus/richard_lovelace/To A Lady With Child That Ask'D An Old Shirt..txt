2. Like tatter'd ensigns, all its bodie's blows?
3. Should it be swathed in a vest so dire,
4. It were enough to set the child on fire;
5. Dishevell'd queen[s] should strip them of their hair,
6. And in it mantle the new rising heir:

10. That first was rowl'd in down, now furs of bears.

11. But since to ladies 't hath a custome been
12. Linnen to send, that travail and lye in;
13. To the nine sempstresses, my former friends,
14. I su'd; but they had nought but shreds and ends.
15. At last, the jolli'st of the three times three
16. Rent th' apron from her smock, and gave it me;
17. 'Twas soft and gentle, subt'ly spun, no doubt;
18. Pardon my boldnese, madam; HERE'S THE CLOUT.
