1. I.

2. See! with what constant motion
3. Even and glorious, as the sunne,
4. Gratiana steeres that noble frame,
5. Soft as her breast, sweet as her voyce,
6. That gave each winding law and poyze,
7. And swifter then the wings of Fame.

8. II.

9. She beat the happy pavement
10. By such a starre-made firmament,
11. Which now no more the roofe envies;
12. But swells up high with Atlas ev'n,
13. Bearing the brighter, nobler Heav'n,
14. And in her, all the Dieties.

15. III.

16. Each step trod out a lovers thought
17. And the ambitious hopes he brought,
18. Chain'd to her brave feet with such arts,
19. Such sweet command and gentle awe,
20. As when she ceas'd, we sighing saw
21. The floore lay pav'd with broken hearts.

22. IV.

23. So did she move: so did she sing:
24. Like the harmonious spheres that bring
25. Unto their rounds their musick's ayd;
26. Which she performed such a way,
27. As all th' inamour'd world will say:
28. The Graces daunced, and Apollo play'd.
