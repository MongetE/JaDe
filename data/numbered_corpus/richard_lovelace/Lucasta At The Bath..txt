1. I.
2. I' th' autumn of a summer's day,
3. When all the winds got leave to play,
4. LUCASTA, that fair ship, is lanch'd,
5. And from its crust this almond blanch'd.

6. II.
7. Blow then, unruly northwind, blow,
8. 'Till in their holds your eyes you stow;
9. And swell your cheeks, bequeath chill death;
10. See! she hath smil'd thee out of breath.

11. III.
12. Court, gentle zephyr, court and fan
13. Her softer breast's carnation wan;
14. Your charming rhethorick of down
15. Flyes scatter'd from before her frown.

16. IV.
17. Say, my white water-lilly, say,
18. How is't those warm streams break away,
19. Cut by thy chast cold breast, which dwells
20. Amidst them arm'd in isicles?

21. V.
22. And the hot floods, more raging grown,
23. In flames of thee then in their own,
24. In their distempers wildly glow,
25. And kisse thy pillar of fix'd snow.

26. VI.
27. No sulphur, through whose each blew vein
28. The thick and lazy currents strein,
29. Can cure the smarting nor the fell
30. Blisters of love, wherewith they swell.

31. VII.
32. These great physicians of the blind,
33. The lame, and fatal blains of Inde
34. In every drop themselves now see
35. Speckled with a new leprosie.

36. VIII.
37. As sick drinks are with old wine dash'd,
38. Foul waters too with spirits wash'd,
39. Thou greiv'd, perchance, one tear let'st fall,
40. Which straight did purifie them all.

41. IX.
42. And now is cleans'd enough the flood,
43. Which since runs cleare as doth thy blood;
44. Of the wet pearls uncrown thy hair,
45. And mantle thee with ermin air.

46. X.
47. Lucasta, hail! fair conqueresse
48. Of fire, air, earth and seas!
49. Thou whom all kneel to, yet even thou
50. Wilt unto love, thy captive, bow.
