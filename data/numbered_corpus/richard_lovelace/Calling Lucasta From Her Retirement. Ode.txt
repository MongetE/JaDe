1. I.
2. From the dire monument of thy black roome,
3. Wher now that vestal flame thou dost intombe,
4. As in the inmost cell of all earths wombe.

5. II.
6. Sacred Lucasta, like the pow'rfull ray
7. Of heavenly truth, passe this Cimmerian way,
8. Whilst all the standards of your beames display.

9. III.
10. Arise and climbe our whitest, highest hill;
11. There your sad thoughts with joy and wonder fill,
12. And see seas calme as earth, earth as your will.

13. IV.
14. Behold! how lightning like a taper flyes,
15. And guilds your chari't, but ashamed dyes,
16. Seeing it selfe out-gloried by your eyes.

17. V.
18. Threatning and boystrous tempests gently bow,
19. And to your steps part in soft paths, when now
20. There no where hangs a cloud, but on your brow.

21. VI.
22. No showrs but 'twixt your lids, nor gelid snow,
23. But what your whiter, chaster brest doth ow,
24. Whilst winds in chains colder for sorrow blow.

25. VII.
26. Shrill trumpets doe only sound to eate,
27. Artillery hath loaden ev'ry dish with meate,
28. And drums at ev'ry health alarmes beate.

29. VIII.
30. All things Lucasta, but Lucasta, call,
31. Trees borrow tongues, waters in accents fall,
32. The aire doth sing, and fire is musicall.

33. IX.
34. Awake from the dead vault in which you dwell,
35. All's loyall here, except your thoughts rebell
36. Which, so let loose, often their gen'rall quell.

37. X.
38. See! she obeys!  By all obeyed thus,
39. No storms, heats, colds, no soules contentious,
40. Nor civill war is found; I meane, to us.

41. XI.
42. Lovers and angels, though in heav'n they show,
43. And see the woes and discords here below,
44. What they not feele, must not be said to know.
