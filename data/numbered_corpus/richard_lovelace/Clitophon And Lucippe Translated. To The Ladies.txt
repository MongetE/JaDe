1. Pray, ladies, breath, awhile lay by
2. Caelestial Sydney's ARCADY;
3. Heere's a story that doth claime
4. A little respite from his flame:
5. Then with a quick dissolving looke
6. Unfold the smoothnes of this book,
7. To which no art (except your sight)
8. Can reach a worthy epithite;
9. 'Tis an abstract of all volumes,
10. A pillaster of all columnes
11. Fancy e're rear'd to wit, to be
12. The smallest gods epitome,
13. And so compactedly expresse
14. All lovers pleasing wretchednes.

15. Gallant Pamela's majesty
16. And her sweet sisters modesty
17. Are fixt in each of you; you are,
18. Distinct, what these together were;
19. Divinest, that are really
20. What Cariclea's feign'd to be;
21. That are ev'ry one the Nine,
22. And brighter here Astreas shine;
23. View our Lucippe, and remaine
24. In her, these beauties o're againe.

25. Amazement!  Noble Clitophon
26. Ev'n now lookt somewhat colder on
27. His cooler mistresse, and she too
28. Smil'd not as she us'd to do.
29. See! the individuall payre
30. Are at sad oddes, and parted are;
31. They quarrell, aemulate, and stand
32. At strife, who first shal kisse your hand.

33. A new dispute there lately rose
34. Betwixt the Greekes and Latines, whose
35. Temples should be bound with glory,
36. In best languaging this story;

37. Yee heyres of love, that with one SMILE
38. A ten-yeeres war can reconcile;
39. Peacefull Hellens!  Vertuous!  See:
40. The jarring languages agree!
41. And here, all armes layd by, they doe
42. In English meet to wayt on you.
