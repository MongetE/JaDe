1. "Come, pretty birds, present your lays,
2. And learn to chaunt a goddess praise;
3. Ye wood-nymphs, let your voices be
4. Employ'd to serve her deity:
5. And warble forth, ye virgins nine,
6. Some music to my Valentine.

7. "Her bosom is love's paradise,
8. There is no heav'n but in her eyes;
9. She's chaster than the turtle-dove,
10. And fairer than the queen of love:
11. Yet all perfections do combine
12. To beautifie my Valentine.

13. "She's Nature's choicest cabinet,
14. Where honour, beauty, worth and wit
15. Are all united in her breast.
16. The graces claim an interest:
17. All virtues that are most divine
18. Shine clearest in my Valentine."
