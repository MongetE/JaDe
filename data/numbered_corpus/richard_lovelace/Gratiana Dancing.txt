1. SHE beat the happy pavement--
2. By such a star made firmament,
3. Which now no more the roof envies!
4. But swells up high, with Atlas even,
5. Bearing the brighter nobler heaven,
6. And, in her, all the deities.

7. Each step trod out a Lover's thought,
8. And the ambitious hopes he brought
9. Chain'd to her brave feet with such arts,
10. Such sweet command and gentle awe,
11. As, when she ceased, we sighing saw
12. The floor lay paved with broken hearts.
