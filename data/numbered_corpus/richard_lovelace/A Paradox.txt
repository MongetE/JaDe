1. I.
2. Tis true the beauteous Starre
3. To which I first did bow
4. Burnt quicker, brighter far,
5. Than that which leads me now;
6. Which shines with more delight,
7. For gazing on that light
8. So long, neere lost my sight.

9. II.
10. Through foul we follow faire,
11. For had the world one face,
12. And earth been bright as ayre,
13. We had knowne neither place.
14. Indians smell not their neast;
15. A Swisse or Finne tastes best
16. The spices of the East.

17. III.
18. So from the glorious Sunne
19. Who to his height hath got,
20. With what delight we runne
21. To some black cave or grot!
22. And, heav'nly Sydney you
23. Twice read, had rather view
24. Some odde romance so new.

25. IV.
26. The god, that constant keepes
27. Unto his deities,
28. Is poore in joyes, and sleepes
29. Imprison'd in the skies.
30. This knew the wisest, who
31. From Juno stole, below
32. To love a bear or cow.
