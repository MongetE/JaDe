1. I.

2. Why shouldst thou sweare I am forsworn,
3. Since thine I vow'd to be?
4. Lady, it is already Morn,
5. And 'twas last night I swore to thee
6. That fond impossibility.

7. II.

8. Have I not lov'd thee much and long,
9. A tedious twelve moneths space?
10. I should all other beauties wrong,
11. And rob thee of a new imbrace;
12. Should I still dote upon thy face.

13. III.

14. Not but all joy in thy browne haire
15. In others may be found;
16. But I must search the black and faire,
17. Like skilfulle minerallists that sound
18. For treasure in un-plow'd-up ground.

19. IV.

20. Then if, when I have lov'd my round,
21. Thou prov'st the pleasant she;
22. With spoyles of meaner beauties crown'd,
23. I laden will returne to thee,
24. Ev'n sated with varietie.
