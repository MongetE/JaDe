2. Thou snowy farme with thy five tenements!
3. Tell thy white mistris here was one,

8. But grieve not, pretty Ermin cabinet,
9. Thy alabaster lady will come home;
10. If not, what tenant can there fit

14. Then give me leave to leave my rent with thee:
15. Five kisses, one unto a place:

17. Yet servants, knowing minikin nor base,
18. Are still allow'd to fiddle with the case.
