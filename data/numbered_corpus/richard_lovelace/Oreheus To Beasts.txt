2. Here, here, oh here! EURIDICE,
3. Here was she slaine;
4. Her soule 'still'd through a veine:
5. The gods knew lesse
6. That time divinitie,
7. Then ev'n, ev'n these
8. Of brutishnesse.

10. Oh! could you view the melodie
11. Of ev'ry grace,
12. And musick of her face,
13. You'd drop a teare,
14. Seeing more harmonie
15. In her bright eye,
16. Then now you heare.
