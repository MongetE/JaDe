1. Tell me not (Sweet) I am unkind,
2. That from the nunnery
3. Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
4. To war and arms I fly.

5. True, a new mistress now I chase,
6. The first foe in the field;
7. And with a stronger faith embrace
8. A sword, a horse, a shield.

9. Yet this inconstancy is such
10. As you too shall adore;
11. I could not love thee (Dear) so much,
12. Lov'd I not Honour more.
