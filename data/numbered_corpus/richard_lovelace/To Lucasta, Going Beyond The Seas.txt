1. If to be absent were to be
2. Away from thee;
3. Or that when I am gone,
4. You or I were alone, -
5. Then, my Lucasta, might I crave
6. Pity from blust'ring wind or swallowing wave.

7. But I'll not sigh one blast or gale
8. To swell my sail,
9. Or pay a tear to 'suage
10. The foaming blue god's rage;
11. For whether he will let me pass
12. Or no, I'm still as happy as I was.

13. Though seas and land betwixt us both,
14. Our faith and troth,
15. Like separated souls,
16. All time and space controls:
17. Above the highest sphere we meet
18. Unseen, unknown, and greet as angels greet.

19. So then we do anticipate
20. Our after-fate,
21. And are alive i'th' skies,
22. If thus our lips and eyes
23. Can speak like spirits unconfined
24. In Heaven, their earthy bodies left behind.
