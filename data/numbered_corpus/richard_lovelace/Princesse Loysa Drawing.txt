1. I saw a little Diety,
2. MINERVA in epitomy,
3. Whom VENUS, at first blush, surpris'd,
4. Tooke for her winged wagge disguis'd.
5. But viewing then, whereas she made
6. Not a distrest, but lively shade
7. Of ECCHO whom he had betrayd,
8. Now wanton, and ith' coole oth' Sunne
9. With her delight a hunting gone,
10. And thousands more, whom he had slaine;
11. To live and love, belov'd againe:
12. Ah! this is true divinity!
13. I will un-God that toye! cri'd she;
14. Then markt she SYRINX running fast
15. To Pan's imbraces, with the haste
16. Shee fled him once, whose reede-pipe rent
17. He finds now a new Instrument.
18. THESEUS return'd invokes the Ayre
19. And windes, then wafts his faire;
20. Whilst ARIADNE ravish't stood
21. Half in his armes, halfe in the flood.
22. Proud ANAXERETE doth fall
23. At IPHIS feete, who smiles at all:
24. And he (whilst she his curles doth deck)
25. Hangs no where now, but on her neck.
26. Here PHOEBUS with a beame untombes
27. Long-hid LEUCOTHOE, and doomes
28. Her father there; DAPHNE the faire
29. Knowes now no bayes but round her haire;
30. And to APOLLO and his Sons,
31. Who pay him their due Orisons,
32. Bequeaths her lawrell-robe, that flame
33. Contemnes, Thunder and evill Fame.
34. There kneel'd ADONIS fresh as spring,
35. Gay as his youth, now offering
36. Herself those joyes with voice and hand,
37. Which first he could not understand.
38. Transfixed VENUS stood amas'd,
39. Full of the Boy and Love, she gaz'd,
40. And in imbraces seemed more
41. Senceless and colde then he before.
42. Uselesse Childe!  In vaine (said she)
43. You beare that fond artillerie;
44. See heere a pow'r above the slow
45. Weake execution of thy bow.
46. So said, she riv'd the wood in two,
47. Unedged all his arrowes too,
48. And with the string their feathers bound
49. To that part, whence we have our wound.
50. See, see! the darts by which we burn'd
51. Are bright Loysa's pencills turn'd,
52. With which she now enliveth more
53. Beauties, than they destroy'd before.
