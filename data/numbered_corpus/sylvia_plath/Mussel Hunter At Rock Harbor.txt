1. I came before the water —-
2. Colorists came to get the
3. Good of the Cape light that scours
4. Sand grit to sided crystal
5. And buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls
6. Of the three fishing smacks beached
7. On the bank of the river's

8. Backtracking tail. I'd come for
9. Free fish-bait: the blue mussels
10. Clumped like bulbs at the grassroot
11. Margin of the tidal pools.
12. Dawn tide stood dead low. I smelt
13. Mud stench, shell guts, gulls' leavings;
14. Heard a queer crusty scrabble

15. Cease, and I neared the silenced
16. Edge of a cratered pool-bed.
17. The mussels hung dull blue and
18. Conspicuous, yet it seemed
19. A sly world's hinges had swung
20. Shut against me. All held still.
21. Though I counted scant seconds,

22. Enough ages lapsed to win
23. Confidence of safe-conduct
24. In the wary other world
25. Eyeing me. Grass put forth claws,
26. Small mud knobs, nudged from under,
27. Displaced their domes as tiny
28. Knights might doff their casques. The crabs

29. Inched from their pygmy burrows
30. And from the trench-dug mud, all Camouflaged in mottled mail
31. Of browns and greens. Each wore one
32. Claw swollen to a shield large
33. As itself—no fiddler's arm
34. Grown Gargantuan by trade,

35. But grown grimly, and grimly
36. Borne, for a use beyond my
37. Guessing of it. Sibilant
38. Mass-motived hordes, they sidled
39. Out in a converging stream
40. Toward the pool-mouth, perhaps to
41. Meet the thin and sluggish thread

42. Of sea retracing its tide-
43. Way up the river-basin.
44. Or to avoid me. They moved
45. Obliquely with a dry-wet
46. Sound, with a glittery wisp
47. And trickle. Could they feel mud
48. Pleasurable under claws

49. As I could between bare toes?
50. That question ended it—I
51. Stood shut out, for once, for all,
52. Puzzling the passage of their
53. Absolutely alien
54. Order as I might puzzle
55. At the clear tail of Halley's

56. Comet coolly giving my
57. Orbit the go-by, made known
58. By a family name it
59. Knew nothing of. So the crabs
60. Went about their business, which
61. Wasn't fiddling, and I filled
62. A big handkerchief with blue

63. Mussels. From what the crabs saw,
64. If they could see, I was one
65. Two-legged mussel-picker.
66. High on the airy thatching
67. Of the dense grasses I found
68. The husk of a fiddler-crab,
69. Intact, strangely strayed above

70. His world of mud—green color
71. And innards bleached out blown off
72. Somewhere by much sun and wind;
73. There was no telling if he'd
74. Died recluse of suicide
75. Or headstrong Columbus crab.
76. The crab-face, etched and set there,

77. Grimaced as skulls grimace: it
78. Had an Oriental look,
79. A samurai death mask done
80. On a tiger tooth, less for
81. Art's sake than God's. Far from sea —-
82. Where red-freckled crab-backs, claws
83. And whole crabs, dead, their soggy

84. Bellies pallid and upturned,
85. Perform their shambling waltzes
86. On the waves' dissolving turn
87. And return, losing themselves
88. Bit by bit to their friendly
89. Element—this relic saved
90. Face, to face the bald-faced sun.
