1. A garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black
2. The great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks.
3. Their musk encroaches, circle after circle,
4. A well of scents almost too dense to breathe in.
5. Hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees,
6. You move among the many-breasted hives,

7. My heart under your foot, sister of a stone.

8. Trumpet-throats open to the beaks of birds.
9. The Golden Rain Tree drips its powders down.
10. In these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red
11. The anthers nod their heads, potent as kings
12. To father dynasties. The air is rich.
13. Here is a queenship no mother can contest â€”-

14. A fruit that's death to taste: dark flesh, dark parings.

15. In burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees
16. Keep house among the grasses. Kneeling down
17. I set my eyes to a hole-mouth and meet an eye
18. Round, green, disconsolate as a tear.
19. Father, bridegroom, in this Easter egg
20. Under the coronal of sugar roses

21. The queen bee marries the winter of your year.
