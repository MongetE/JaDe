1. Where the three magenta
2. Breakwaters take the shove
3. And suck of the grey sea

4. To the left, and the wave
5. Unfists against the dun
6. Barb-wired headland of

7. The Deer Island prison
8. With its trim piggeries,
9. Hen huts and cattle green

10. To the right, and March ice
11. Glazes the rock pools yet,
12. Snuff-colored sand cliffs rise

13. Over a great stone spit
14. Bared by each falling tide,
15. And you, across those white

16. Stones, strode out in you dead
17. Black coat, black shoes, and your
18. Black hair till there you stood,

19. Fixed vortex on the far
20. Tip, riveting stones, air,
21. All of it, together.
