1. Empty, I echo to the least footfall,
2. Museum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas.
3. In my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself,
4. Nun-hearted and blind to the world. Marble lilies
5. Exhale their pallor like scent.

6. I imagine myself with a great public,
7. Mother of a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.
8. Instead, the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing can happen.
9. Blank-faced and mum as a nurse.
