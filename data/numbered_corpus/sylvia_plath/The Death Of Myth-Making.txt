1. Two virtues ride, by stallion, by nag,
2. To grind our knives and scissors:
3. Lantern-jawed Reason, squat Common Sense,
4. One courting doctors of all sorts,
5. One, housewives and shopkeepers.

6. The trees are lopped, the poodles trim,
7. The laborer's nails pared level
8. Since those two civil servants set
9. Their whetstone to the blunted edge
10. And minced the muddling devil

11. Whose owl-eyes in the scraggly wood
12. Scared mothers to miscarry,
13. Drove the dogs to cringe and whine
14. And turned the farmboy's temper wolfish,
15. The housewife's, desultory.
