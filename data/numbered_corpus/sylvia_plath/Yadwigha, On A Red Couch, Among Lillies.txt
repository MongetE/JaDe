1. Yadwigha, the literalists once wondered how you
2. Came to be lying on this baroque couch
3. Upholstered in red velvet, under the eye
4. Of uncaged tigers and a tropical moon,
5. Set in intricate wilderness of green
6. Heart-shaped leaves, like catalpa leaves, and lillies

7. Of monstrous size, like no well-bred lilies
8. It seems teh consistent critics wanted you
9. To choose between your world of jungle green
10. And the fashionable monde of the red couch
11. With its prim bric-Ã -brac, without a moon
12. To turn you luminous, without the eye

13. Of tigers to be stilled by your dark eye
14. And body whiter than its frill of lilies:
15. They'd have had yellow silk screening the moon,
16. Leaves and lilies flattened to paper behind you
17. Or, at most, to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the couch
18. Stood stubborn in it's jungle: red against green,

19. Red against fifty variants of green,
20. The couch glared out at the prosaic eye.
21. So Rousseau, to explain why the red couch
22. Persisted in the picture with the lilies,
23. Tigers, snakes, and the snakecharmer and you,
24. And birds of paradise, and the round moon,

25. Described how you fell dreaming at full of moon
26. On a red velvet couch within your green-
27. Tessellared boudoir. Hearing flutes, you
28. Dreamed yourself away in the moon's eye
29. To a beryl jungle, and dreamed that bright moon-lilies
30. Nodded their petaled heads around your couch.

31. And that, Rousseau told the critics, was why the couch
32. Accompanied you. So they nodded at the couch with the moon
33. And the snakecharmer's song and the gigantic lilies,
34. Marvelingly numbered the many shades of green.
35. But to a friend, in private, Rousseau confessed his eye
36. So possessed by the glowing red of the couch which you,

37. Yadwigha, pose on, that he put you on the couch
38. To feed his eye with red, such red! under the moon,
39. In the midst of all that green and those great lilies!
