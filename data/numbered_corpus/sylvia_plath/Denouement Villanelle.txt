1. The telegram says you have gone away
2. And left our bankrupt circus on its own;
3. There is nothing more for me to say.
4. The maestro gives the singing birds their pay
5. And they buy tickets for the tropic zone;
6. The telegram says you have gone away.

7. The clever woolly dogs have had their day
8. They shoot the dice for one remaining bone;
9. There is nothing more for me to say.
10. The lion and the tigers turn to clay
11. And Jumbo sadly trumpets into stone;
12. The telegram says you have gone away.

13. The morbid cobra's wits have run astray;
14. He rents his poisons out by telephone;
15. There is nothing more for me to say.
16. The colored tents all topple in the bay;
17. The magic saw dust writes: address unknown.
18. The telegram says you have gone away;
19. There is nothing more for me to say.
