1. From under the crunch of my man's boot
2. green oat-sprouts jut;
3. he names a lapwing, starts rabbits in a rout
4. legging it most nimble
5. to sprigged hedge of bramble,
6. stalks red fox, shrewd stoat.

7. Loam-humps, he says, moles shunt
8. up from delved worm-haunt;
9. blue fur, moles have; hefting chalk-hulled flint
10. he with rock splits open
11. knobbed quartz; flayed colors ripen
12. rich, brown, sudden in sunlight.

13. For his least look, scant acres yield:
14. each finger-furrowed field
15. heaves forth stalk, leaf, fruit-nubbed emerald;
16. bright grain sprung so rarely
17. he hauls to his will early;
18. at his hand's staunch hest, birds build.

19. Ringdoves roost well within his wood,
20. shirr songs to suit which mood
21. he saunters in; how but most glad
22. could be this adam's woman
23. when all earth his words do summon
24. leaps to laud such man's blood!
