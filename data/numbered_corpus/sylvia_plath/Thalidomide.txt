1. O half moon—-

2. Half-brain, luminosity—-
3. Negro, masked like a white,

4. Your dark
5. Amputations crawl and appall—-

6. Spidery, unsafe.
7. What glove

8. What leatheriness
9. Has protected

10. Me from that shadow—-
11. The indelible buds.

12. Knuckles at shoulder-blades, the
13. Faces that

14. Shove into being, dragging
15. The lopped

16. Blood-caul of absences.
17. All night I carpenter

18. A space for the thing I am given,
19. A love

20. Of two wet eyes and a screech.
21. White spit

22. Of indifference!
23. The dark fruits revolve and fall.

24. The glass cracks across,
25. The image

26. Flees and aborts like dropped mercury.
