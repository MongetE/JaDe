1. Since Christmas they have lived with us,
2. Guileless and clear,
3. Oval soul-animals,
4. Taking up half the space,
5. Moving and rubbing on the silk

6. Invisible air drifts,
7. Giving a shriek and pop
8. When attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling.
9. Yellow cathead, blue fish————
10. Such queer moons we live with

11. Instead of dead furniture!
12. Straw mats, white walls
13. And these traveling
14. Globes of thin air, red, green,
15. Delighting

16. The heart like wishes or free
17. Peacocks blessing
18. Old ground with a feather
19. Beaten in starry metals.
20. Your small

21. Brother is making
22. His balloon squeak like a cat.
23. Seeming to see
24. A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,
25. He bites,

26. Then sits
27. Back, fat jug
28. Contemplating a world clear as water.
29. A red
30. Shred in his little fist.
