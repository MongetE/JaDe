1. I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
2. Whatever I see I swallow immediately
3. Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
4. I am not cruel, only truthful â€š
5. The eye of a little god, four-cornered.
6. Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.
7. It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long
8. I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.
9. Faces and darkness separate us over and over.
10. Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
11. Searching my reaches for what she really is.
12. Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.
13. I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.
14. She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.
15. I am important to her. She comes and goes.
16. Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.
17. In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
18. Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.
