1. Always in the middle of a kiss
2. Came the profane stimulus to cough;
3. Always from teh pulpit during service
4. Leaned the devil prompting you to laugh.

5. Behind mock-ceremony of your grief
6. Lurked the burlesque instinct of the ham;
7. You never altered your amused belief
8. That life was a mere monumental sham.

9. From the comic accident of birth
10. To the final grotesque joke of death
11. Your malady of sacrilegious mirth
12. Spread gay contagion with each clever breath.

13. Now you must play the straight man for a term
14. And tolerate the humor of the worm.
