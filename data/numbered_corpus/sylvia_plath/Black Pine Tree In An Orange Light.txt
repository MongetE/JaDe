1. Tell me what you see in it :
2. The pine tree like a Rorschach-blot
3. black against the orange light :

4. Plant an orange pumpkin patch
5. which at twelve will quaintly hatch
6. nine black mice with ebon coach,

7. or walk into the orange and make
8. a devil's cataract of black
9. obscure god's eye with corkscrew fleck;

10. put orange mistress half in sun,
11. half in shade, until her skin
12. tattoos black leaves on tangerine.

13. Read black magic or holy book
14. or lyric of love in the orange and black
15. till dark is conquered by orange cock,

16. but more pragmatic than all this,
17. say how crafty the painter was
18. to make orange and black ambiguous.
