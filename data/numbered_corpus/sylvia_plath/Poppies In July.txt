1. Little poppies, little hell flames,
2. Do you do no harm?

3. You flicker.  I cannot touch you.
4. I put my hands among the flames.  Nothing burns

5. And it exhausts me to watch you
6. Flickering like that, wrinkly and clear red, like the skin of a mouth.

7. A mouth just bloodied.
8. Little bloody skirts!

9. There are fumes I cannot touch.
10. Where are your opiates, your nauseous capsules?

11. If I could bleed, or sleep! -
12. If my mouth could marry a hurt like that!

13. Or your liquors seep to me, in this glass capsule,
14. Dulling and stilling.

15. But colorless.  Colorless.
