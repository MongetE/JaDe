1. Your brother will trim my hedges!
2. They darken your house,
3. Nosy grower,
4. Mole on my shoulder,
5. To be scratched absently,
6. To bleed, if it comes to that.
7. The stain of the tropics
8. Still urinous on you, a sin.
9. A kind of bush-stink.

10. You may be local,
11. But that yellow!
12. Godawful!
13. Your body one
14. Long nicotine-finger
15. On which I,
16. White cigarette,
17. Burn, for your inhalation,
18. Driving the dull cells wild.

19. Let me roost in you!
20. My distractions, my pallors.
21. Let them start the queer alchemy
22. That melts the skin
23. Gray tallow, from bone and bone.
24. So I saw your much sicker
25. Predecessor wrapped up,
26. A six and a half foot wedding-cake.
27. And he was not even malicious.

28. Do not think I don't notice your curtain—
29. Midnight, four o'clock,
30. Lit (you are reading),
31. Tarting with the drafts that pass,
32. Little **** tongue,
33. Chenille beckoner,
34. Beckoning my words in—
35. The zoo yowl, the mad soft
36. Mirror talk you love to catch me at.

37. How you jumped when I jumped on you!
38. Arms folded, ear cocked,
39. Toad-yellow under the drop
40. That would not, would not drop
41. In a desert of cow people
42. Trundling their udders home
43. To the electric milker, the wifey, the big blue eye
44. That watches, like God, or the sky
45. The ciphers that watch it.

46. I called.
47. You crawled out,
48. A weather figure, boggling,
49. Belge troll, the low
50. Church smile
51. Spreading itself, like butter.
52. This is what I am in for—
53. Flea body!
54. Eyes like mice

55. Flicking over my property,
56. Levering letter flaps,
57. Scrutinizing the fly
58. Of the man's pants
59. Dead on the chair back,
60. Opening the fat smiles, the eyes
61. Of two babies
62. Just to make sure—
63. Toad-stone! Sister-****! Sweet neighbor!
