1. Old goatherds swear how all night long they hear
2. The warning whirr and burring of the bird
3. Who wakes with darkness and till dawn works hard
4. Vampiring dry of milk each great goat udder.
5. Moon full, moon dark, the chary dairy farmer
6. Dreams that his fattest cattle dwindle, fevered
7. By claw-cuts of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,
8. Its eye, flashlit, a chip of ruby fire.

9. So fables say the Goatsucker moves, masked from men's sight
10. In an ebony air, on wings of witch cloth,
11. Well-named, ill-famed a knavish fly-by-night,
12. Yet it never milked any goat, nor dealt cow death
13. And shadows only—cave-mouth bristle beset—
14. Cockchafers and the wan, green luna moth.
