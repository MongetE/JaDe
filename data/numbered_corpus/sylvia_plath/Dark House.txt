1. This is a dark house, very big.
2. I made it myself,
3. Cell by cell from a quiet corner,
4. Chewing at the grey paper,
5. Oozing the glue drops,
6. Whistling, wiggling my ears,
7. Thinking of something else.

8. It has so many cellars,
9. Such eelish delvings!
10. U an round as an owl,
11. I see by my own light.
12. Any day I may litter puppies
13. Or mother a horse. My belly moves.
14. I must make more maps.

15. These marrowy tunnels!
16. Moley-handed, I eat my way.
17. All-mouth licks up the bushes
18. And the pots of meat.
19. He lives in an old well,
20. A stoney hole. He's to blame.
21. He's a fat sort.

22. Pebble smells, turnipy chambers.
23. Small nostrils are breathing.
24. Little humble loves!
25. Footlings, boneless as noses,
26. It is warm and tolerable
27. In the bowel of the root.
28. Here's a cuddly mother.
