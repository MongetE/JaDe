1. The hills step off into whiteness.
2. People or stars
3. Regard me sadly, 

4. I disappoint them.
5. The train leaves a line of breath.
6. O slow
7. Horse the colour of rust,

8. Hooves, dolorous bells -
9. All morning the
10. Morning has been blackening,

11. A flower left out.
12. My bones hold a stillness, the far
13. Fields melt my heart.

14. They threaten
15. To let me through to a heaven
16. Starless and fatherless, a dark water.
