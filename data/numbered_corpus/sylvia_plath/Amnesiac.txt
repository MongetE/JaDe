1. No use, no use, now, begging Recognize!
2. There is nothing to do with such a beautiful blank but smooth it.
3. Name, house, car keys,

4. The little toy wife—
5. Erased, sigh, sigh.
6. Four babies and a cocker!

7. Nurses the size of worms and a minute doctor
8. Tuck him in.
9. Old happenings

10. Peel from his skin.
11. Down the drain with all of it!
12. Hugging his pillow

13. Like the red-headed sister he never dared to touch,
14. He dreams of a new one—
15. Barren, the lot are barren!

16. And of another color.
17. How they'll travel, travel, travel, scenery
18. Sparking off their brother-sister rears

19. A comet tail!
20. And money the sperm fluid of it all.
21. One nurse brings in

22. A green drink, one a blue.
23. They rise on either side of him like stars.
24. The two drinks flame and foam.

25. O sister, mother, wife,
26. Sweet Lethe is my life.
27. I am never, never, never coming home!
