1. In sunless air, under pines
2. Green to the point of blackness, some
3. Founding father set these lobed, warped stones
4. To loom in the leaf-filtered gloom
5. Black as the charred knuckle-bones

6. Of a giant or extinct
7. Animal, come from another
8. Age, another planet surely. Flanked
9. By the orange and fuchsia bonfire
10. Of azaleas, sacrosanct

11. These stones guard a dark repose
12. And keep their shapes intact while sun
13. Alters shadows of rose and iris —-
14. Long, short, long —- in the lit garden
15. And kindles a day's-end blaze

16. Colored to dull the pigment
17. Of azaleas, yet burnt out
18. Quick as they. To follow the light's tint
19. And intensity by midnight
20. By noon and throughout the brunt

21. Of various weathers is
22. To know the still heart of the stones:
23. Stones that take the whole summer to lose
24. Their dream of the winter's cold; stones
25. Warming at core only as

26. Frost forms. No man's crowbar could
27. Uproot them: their beards are ever-
28. Green. Nor do they, once in a hundred
29. Years, go down to drink the river:
30. No thirst disturbs a stone's bed.
