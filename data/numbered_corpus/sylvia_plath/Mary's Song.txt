1. The Sunday lamb cracks in its fat.
2. The fat
3. Sacrifices its opacity. . . .

4. A window, holy gold.
5. The fire makes it precious,
6. The same fire

7. Melting the tallow heretics,
8. Ousting the Jews.
9. Their thick palls float

10. Over the cicatrix of Poland, burnt-out
11. Germany.
12. They do not die.

13. Grey birds obsess my heart,
14. Mouth-ash, ash of eye.
15. They settle.  On the high

16. Precipice
17. That emptied one man into space
18. The ovens glowed like heavens, incandescent.

19. It is a heart,
20. This holocaust I walk in,
21. O golden child the world will kill and eat.
