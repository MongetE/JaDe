1. Worship this world of watercolor mood
2. in glass pagodas hung with veils of green
3. where diamonds jangle hymns within the blood
4. and sap ascends the steeple of the vein.

5. A saintly sparrow jargons madrigals
6. to waken dreamers in the milky dawn,
7. while tulips bow like a college of cardinals
8. before that papal paragon, the sun.

9. Christened in a spindrift of snowdrop stars,
10. where on pink-fluted feet the pigeons pass
11. and jonquils sprout like solomon's metaphors,
12. my love and I go garlanded with grass.

13. Again we are deluded and infer
14. that somehow we are younger than we were.
