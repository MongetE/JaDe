1. Love set you going like a fat gold watch.
2. 	The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry
3. 	Took its place among the elements.

4. 	Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival.  New statue.
5. 	In a drafty museum, your nakedness
6. 	Shadows our safety.  We stand round blankly as walls.

7. 	I'm no more your mother 
8. 	Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow
9. 	Effacement at the wind's hand.

10. 	All night your moth-breath
11. 	Flickers among the flat pink roses.  I wake to listen:
12. 	A far sea moves in my ear.

13. 	One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
14. 	In my Victorian nightgown.
15. 	Your mouth opens clean as a cat's.  The window square

16. 	Whitens and swallows its dull stars.  And now you try
17. 	Your handful of notes;
18. 	The clear vowels rise like balloons.
