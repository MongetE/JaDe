1. 1
2. They're out of the dark's ragbag, these two
3. Moles dead in the pebbled rut,
4. Shapeless as flung gloves, a few feet apart —-
5. Blue suede a dog or fox has chewed.
6. One, by himself, seemed pitiable enough,
7. Little victim unearthed by some large creature
8. From his orbit under the elm root.
9. The second carcass makes a duel of the affair:
10. Blind twins bitten by bad nature.

11. The sky's far dome is sane a clear.
12. Leaves, undoing their yellow caves
13. Between the road and the lake water,
14. Bare no sinister spaces. Already
15. The moles look neutral as the stones.
16. Their corkscrew noses, their white hands
17. Uplifted, stiffen in a family pose.
18. Difficult to imagine how fury struck —-
19. Dissolved now, smoke of an old war.

21. Nightly the battle-snouts start up
22. In the ear of the veteran, and again
23. I enter the soft pelt of the mole.
24. Light's death to them: they shrivel in it.
25. They move through their mute rooms while I sleep,
26. Palming the earth aside, grubbers
27. After the fat children of root and rock.
28. By day, only the topsoil heaves.
29. Down there one is alone.

30. Outsize hands prepare a path,
31. They go before: opening the veins,
32. Delving for the appendages
33. Of beetles, sweetbreads, shards — to be eaten
34. Over and over. And still the heaven
35. Of final surfeit is just as far
36. From the door as ever. What happens between us
37. Happens in darkness, vanishes
38. Easy and often as each breath.
