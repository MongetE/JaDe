1. "I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead;
2. I lift my lids and all is born again.
3. (I think I made you up inside my head.)

4. The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,
5. And arbitrary blackness gallops in:
6. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

7. I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed
8. And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.
9. (I think I made you up inside my head.)

10. God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:
11. Exit seraphim and Satan's men:
12. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.

13. I fancied you'd return the way you said,
14. But I grow old and I forget your name.
15. (I think I made you up inside my head.)

16. I should have loved a thunderbird instead;
17. At least when spring comes they roar back again.
18. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.
19. (I think I made you up inside my head.)"
