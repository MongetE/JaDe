1. Meadows of gold dust. The silver
2. Currents of the Connecticut fan
3. And meander in bland pleatings under
4. River-verge farms where rye-heads whiten.
5. All's polished to a dull luster

6. In the sulfurous noon. We move
7. With the languor of idols below
8. The sky's great bell glass and briefly engrave
9. Our limbs' image on a field of straw
10. And goldenrod as on gold leaf.

11. It might be heaven, this static
12. Plenitude: apples gold on the bough,
13. Goldfinch, goldfish, golden tiger cat stock-
14. Still in one gigantic tapestryâ€”
15. And lovers affable, dovelike.

16. But now the water-skiers race,
17. Bracing their knees. On unseen towlines
18. They cleave the river's greening patinas;
19. The mirror quivers to smithereens.
20. They stunt like clowns in the circus.

21. So we are hauled, though we would stop
22. On this amber bank where grasses bleach.
23. Already the farmer's after his crop,
24. August gives over its Midas touch,
25. Wind bares a flintier landscape.
