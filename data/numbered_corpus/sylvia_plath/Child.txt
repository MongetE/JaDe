1. Your clear eye is the one absolutely beautiful thing.
2. I want to fill it with color and ducks,
3. The zoo of the new
4. Whose name you meditate â€”
5. April snowdrop, Indian pipe,
6. Little

7. Stalk without wrinkle,
8. Pool in which images
9. Should be grand and classical

10. Not this troublous
11. Wringing of hands, this dark
12. Ceiling without a star.
