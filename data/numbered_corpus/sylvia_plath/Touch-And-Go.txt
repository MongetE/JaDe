1. Sing praise for statuary:
2. For those anchored attitudes
3. And staunch stone eyes that stare
4. Through lichen-lid and passing bird-foot
5. At some steadfast mark
6. Beyond the inconstant green
7. Gallop and flick of light
8. In this precarious park

9. Where vivid children twirl
10. Like colored tops through time
11. Nor stop to understand
12. How all their play is touch-and-go:
13. But, Go! they cry, and the swing
14. Arcs up to the tall tree tip;
15. Go! and the merry-go-round
16. Hauls them round with it.

17. And I, like the children, caught
18. In the mortal active verb,
19. Let my transient eye break a tear
20. For each quick, flaring game
21. Of child, leaf and cloud,
22. While on this same fugue, unmoved,
23. Those stonier eyes look,
24. Safe-socketed in rock.
