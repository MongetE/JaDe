1. Will they occur,
2. These people with torso of steel
3. Winged elbows and eyeholes

4. Awaiting masses
5. Of cloud to give them expression,
6. These super-people! -
7. And my baby a nail
8. Driven, driven in.
9. He shrieks in his grease

10. Bones nosing for distance.
11. And I, nearly extinct,
12. His three teeth cutting

13. Themselves on my thumb -
14. And the star,
15. The old story.

16. In the lane I meet sheep and wagons,
17. Red earth, motherly blood.
18. O You who eat

19. People like light rays, leave
20. This one
21. Mirror safe, unredeemed

22. By the dove's annihilation,
23. The glory
24. The power, the glory.
