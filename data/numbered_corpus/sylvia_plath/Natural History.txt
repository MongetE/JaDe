1. That lofty monarch, Monarch Mind,
2. Blue-blooded in coarse country reigned;
3. Though he bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,
4. Pure Philosophy his love engrossed:
5. While subjects hungered, empty-pursed,
6. With stars, with angels, he conversed

7. Till, sick of their ruler's godling airs,
8. In one body those earthborn commoners
9. Rose up and put royal nerves to the rack:
10. King Egg-Head saw his domain crack,
11. His crown usurped by the low brow
12. Of the base, barbarous Prince Ow.
