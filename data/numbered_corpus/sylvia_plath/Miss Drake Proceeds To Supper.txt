1. No novice
2. In those elaborate rituals
3. Which allay the malice
4. Of knotted table and crooked chair,
5. The new woman in the ward
6. Wears purple, steps carefully
7. Among her secret combinations of eggshells
8. And breakable hummingbirds,
9. Footing sallow as a mouse
10. Between the cabbage-roses
11. Which are slowly opening their furred petals
12. To devour and drag her down
13. Into the carpet's design.

14. With bid-quick eyed cocked askew
15. She can see in the nick of time
16. How perilous needles grain the floorboards
17. And outwit their brambled plan;
18. Now through her ambushed air,
19. Adazzle with bright shards
20. Of broken glass,
21. She edges with wary breath,
22. Fending off jag and tooth,
23. Until, turning sideways,
24. She lifts one webbed foot after the other
25. Into the still, sultry weather
26. Of the patients' dining room.
