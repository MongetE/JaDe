1. There, spring lambs jam the sheepfold. In air
2. Stilled, silvered as water in a glass
3. Nothing is big or far.
4. The small shrew chitters from its wilderness
5. Of grassheads and is heard.
6. Each thumb-sized bird
7. Fits nimble-winged in thickets, and of good color.

8. Cloudrack and owl-hollowed willows slanting over
9. The bland Granta double their white and green
10. World under the sheer water
11. And ride that flux at anchor, upside down.
12. The punter sinks his pole.
13. In Byron's pool
14. Cattails part where the tame cygnets steer.

15. It is a country on a nursery plate.
16. Spotted cows revolve their jaws and crop
17. Red clover or gnaw beetroot
18. Bellied on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
19. Hedging meadows of benign
20. Arcadian green
21. The blood-berried hawthorn hides its spines with white.

22. Droll, vegetarian, the water rat
23. Saws down a reed and swims from his limber grove,
24. While the students stroll or sit,
25. Hands laced, in a moony indolence of love â€”-
26. Black-gowned, but unaware
27. How in such mild air
28. The owl shall stoop from his turret, the rat cry out.
