1. It beguilesâ€”
2. This little Odyssey
3. In pink and lavender
4. Over a surface of gently-
5. Graded turquoise tiles
6. That represent a sea
7. With chequered waves and gaily
8. Bear up the seafarer,
9. Gaily, gaily,
10. In his pink plume and armor.

11. A lantern-frail
12. Gondola of paper
13. Ferries the fishpond Sindbad
14. Who poises his pastel spear
15. Toward three pinky-purple
16. Monsters which uprear
17. Off the ocean-floor
18. With fanged and dreadful head.
19. Beware, beware
20. The whale, the shark, the squid.

21. But fins and scales
22. Of each scrolled sea-beast
23. Troll no slime, no weed.
24. They are polished for the joust,
25. They gleam like easter eggshells,
26. Rose and amethyst.
27. Ahab, fulfill your boast:
28. Bring home each storied head.
29. One thrust, one thrust,
30. One thrust: and they are sped.

31. So fables go.
32. And so all children sing
33. Their bathtub battles deep,
34. Hazardous and long,
35. But oh, sage grownups know
36. Sea-dragon for sofa, fang
37. For pasteboard, and siren-song
38. For fever in a sleep.
39. Laughing, laughing
40. Of graybeards wakes us up.
