1. No lame excuses can gloss over
2. Barge-tar clotted at the tide-line, the wrecked pier.
3. I should have known better.

4. Fifteen years between me and the bay
5. Profited memory, but did away with the old scenery
6. And patched this shoddy

7. Makeshift of a view to quit
8. My promise of an idyll. The blue's worn out:
9. It's a ****rd estate,

10. Inimical now. The great green rock
11. We gave good use as ship and house is black
12. With tarry muck

13. And periwinkles, shrunk to common
14. Size. The cries of scavenging gulls sound thin
15. In the traffic of planes

16. From Logan Airport opposite.
17. Gulls circle gray under shadow of a steelier flight.
18. Loss cancels profit.

19. Unless you do this tawdry harbor
20. A service and ignore it, I go a liar
21. Gilding what's eyesore,

22. Or must take loophole and blame time
23. For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the drabbled scum,
24. For a churlish welcome.
