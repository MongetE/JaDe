1. Flintlike, her feet struck
2. Such a racket of echoes from the steely street,
3. Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the black
4. Stone-built town, that she heard the quick air ignite
5. Its tinder and shake

6. A firework of echoes from wall
7. To wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages.
8. But the echoes died at her back as the walls
9. Gave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses
10. Riding in the full

11. Of the moon, manes to the wind,
12. Tireless, tied, as a moon-bound sea
13. Moves on its root. Though a mist-wraith wound
14. Up from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
15. Ahead, it fattened

16. To no family-featured ghost,
17. Nor did any word body with a name
18. The blank mood she walked in. Once past
19. The dream-peopled village, her eyes entertained no dream,
20. And the sandman's dust

21. Lost luster under her footsoles.
22. The long wind, paring her person down
23. To a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle
24. In the whorl of her ear, and like a scooped-out pumpkin crown
25. Her head cupped the babel.

26. All the night gave her, in return
27. For the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat
28. Of her heart was the humped indifferent iron
29. Of its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
30. On black stone. Barns

31. Guarded broods and litters
32. Behind shut doors; the dairy herds
33. Knelt in the meadow mute as boulders;
34. Sheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds,
35. Twig-sleep, wore

36. Granite ruffs, their shadows
37. The guise of leaves. The whole landscape
38. Loomed absolute as the antique world was
39. Once in its earliest sway of lymph and sap,
40. Unaltered by eyes,

41. Enough to snuff the quick
42. Of her small heat out, but before the weight
43. Of stones and hills of stones could break
44. Her down to mere quartz grit n that stony light
45. She turned back.
