1. Cold on my narrow cot I lie
2. and in sorrow look
3. through my window-square of black:

4. figured in the midnight sky,
5. a mosaic of stars
6. diagrams the falling years,

7. while from the moon, my lover's eye
8. chills me to death
9. with radiance of his frozen faith.

10. Once I wounded him with so
11. small a thorn
12. I never thought his flesh would burn

13. or that the heat within would grow
14. until he stood
15. incandescent as a god;

16. now there is nowhere I can go
17. to hide from him:
18. moon and sun reflect his flame.

19. In the morning all shall be
20. the same again:
21. stars pale before the angry dawn;

22. the gilded cock will turn for me
23. the rack of time
24. until the peak of noon has come

25. and by that glare, my love will see
26. how I am still
27. blazing in my golden hell.
