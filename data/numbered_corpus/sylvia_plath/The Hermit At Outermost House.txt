1. Sky and sea, horizon-hinged
2. Tablets of blank blue, couldn't,
3. Clapped shut, flatten this man out.

4. The great gods, Stone-Head, Claw-Foot
5. Winded by much rock-bumping
6. And claw-threat, realized that.

7. For what, then, had they endured
8. Dourly the long hots and colds,
9. Those old despots, if he sat

10. Laugh-shaken on his doorsill,
11. Backbone unbendable as
12. Timbers of his upright hut?

13. Hard gods were there, nothing else.
14. Still he thumbed out something else.
15. Thumbed no stony, horny pot,

16. But a certain meaning green.
17. He withstood them, that hermit.
18. Rock-face, crab-claw verged on green.

19. Gulls mulled in the greenest light.
