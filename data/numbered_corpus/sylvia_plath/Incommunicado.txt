1. The groundhog on the mountain did not run
2. But fatly scuttled into the splayed fern
3. And faced me, back to a ledge of dirt, to rattle
4. Her sallow rodent teeth like castanets
5. Against my leaning down, would not exchange
6. For that wary clatter sound or gesture
7. Of love : claws braced, at bay, my currency not hers.

8. Such meetings never occur in marchen
9. Where love-met groundhogs love one in return,
10. Where straight talk is the rule, whether warm or hostile,
11. Which no gruff animal misinterprets.
12. From what grace am I fallen. Tongues are strange,
13. Signs say nothing. The falcon who spoke clear
14. To Canacee cries gibberish to coarsened ears.
