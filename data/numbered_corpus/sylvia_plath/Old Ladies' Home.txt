1. Sharded in black, like beetles,
2. Frail as antique earthenwear
3. One breath might shiver to bits,
4. The old women creep out here
5. To sun on the rocks or prop
6. Themselves up against the wall
7. Whose stones keep a little heat.

8. Needles knit in a bird-beaked
9. Counterpoint to their voices:
10. Sons, daughters, daughters and sons,
11. Distant and cold as photos,
12. Grandchildren nobody knows.
13. Age wears the best black fabric
14. Rust-red or green as lichens.

15. At owl-call the old ghosts flock
16. To hustle them off the lawn.
17. From beds boxed-in like coffins
18. The bonneted ladies grin.
19. And Death, that bald-head buzzard,
20. Stalls in halls where the lamp wick
21. Shortens with each breath drawn.
