1. The prince leans to the girl in scarlet heels,
2. Her green eyes slant, hair flaring in a fan
3. Of silver as the rondo slows; now reels
4. Begin on tilted violins to span

5. The whole revolving tall glass palace hall
6. Where guests slide gliding into light like wine;
7. Rose candles flicker on the lilac wall
8. Reflecting in a million flagons' shine,

9. And glided couples all in whirling trance
10. Follow holiday revel begun long since,
11. Until near twelve the strange girl all at once
12. Guilt-stricken halts, pales, clings to the prince

13. As amid the hectic music and cocktail talk
14. She hears the caustic ticking of the clock.
