1. First frost, and I walk among the rose-fruit, the marble toes
2. Of the Greek beauties you brought
3. Off Europe's relic heap
4. To sweeten your neck of the New York woods.
5. Soon each white lady will be boarded up
6. Against the crackling climate.

7. All morning, with smoking breath, the handyman
8. Has been draining the goldfish ponds.
9. They collapse like lungs, the escaped water
10. Threading back, filament by filament, to the pure
11. Platonic table where it lives. The baby carp
12. Litter the mud like orangepeel.

13. Eleven weeks, and I know your estate so well
14. I need hardly go out at all.
15. A superhighway seals me off.
16. Trading their poisons, the north and south bound cars
17. Flatten the doped snakes to ribbon. In here, the grasses
18. Unload their griefs on my shoes,

19. The woods creak and ache, and the day forgets itself.
20. I bend over this drained basin where the small fish
21. Flex as the mud freezes.
22. They glitter like eyes, and I collect them all.
23. Morgue of old logs and old images, the lake
24. Opens and shuts, accepting them among its reflections.
