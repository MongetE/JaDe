1. 'Perspective betrays with its dichotomy:
2. train tracks always meet, not here, but only
3. in the impossible mind's eye;
4. horizons beat a retreat as we embark
5. on sophist seas to overtake that mark
6. where wave pretends to drench real sky.'

7. 'Well then, if we agree, it is not odd
8. that one man's devil is another's god
9. or that the solar spectrum is
10. a multitude of shaded grays; suspense
11. on the quicksands of ambivalence
12. is our life's whole nemesis.

13. So we could rave on, darling, you and I,
14. until the stars tick out a lullaby
15. about each cosmic pro and con;
16. nothing changes, for all the blazing of
17. our drastic jargon, but clock hands that move
18. implacably from twelve to one.

19. We raise our arguments like sitting ducks
20. to knock them down with logic or with luck
21. and contradict ourselves for fun;
22. the waitress holds our coats and we put on
23. the raw wind like a scarf; love is a faun
24. who insists his playmates run.

25. Now you, my intellectual leprechaun,
26. would have me swallow the entire sun
27. like an enormous oyster, down
28. the ocean in one gulp: you say a mark
29. of comet hara-kiri through the dark
30. should inflame the sleeping town.

31. So kiss: the drunks upon the curb and dames
32. in dubious doorways forget their monday names,
33. caper with candles in their heads;
34. the leaves applaud, and santa claus flies in
35. scattering candy from a zeppelin,
36. playing his prodigal charades.

37. The moon leans down to took; the tilting fish
38. in the rare river wink and laugh; we lavish
39. blessings right and left and cry
40. hello, and then hello again in deaf
41. churchyard ears until the starlit stiff
42. graves all carol in reply.

43. Now kiss again: till our strict father leans
44. to call for curtain on our thousand scenes;
45. brazen actors mock at him,
46. multiply pink harlequins and sing
47. in gay ventriloquy from wing to wing
48. while footlights flare and houselights dim.

49. Tell now, we taunt where black or white begins
50. and separate the flutes from violins:
51. the algebra of absolutes
52. explodes in a kaleidoscope of shapes
53. that jar, while each polemic jackanapes
54. joins his enemies' recruits.

55. The paradox is that 'the play's the thing':
56. though prima donna pouts and critic stings,
57. there burns throughout the line of words,
58. the cultivated act, a fierce brief fusion
59. which dreamers call real, and realists, illusion:
60. an insight like the flight of birds:

61. Arrows that lacerate the sky, while knowing
62. the secret of their ecstasy's in going;
63. some day, moving, one will drop,
64. and, dropping, die, to trace a wound that heals
65. only to reopen as flesh congeals:
66. cycling phoenix never stops.

67. So we shall walk barefoot on walnut shells
68. of withered worlds, and stamp out puny hells
69. and heavens till the spirits squeak
70. surrender: to build our bed as high as jack's
71. bold beanstalk; lie and love till sharp scythe hacks
72. away our rationed days and weeks.

73. Then jet the blue tent topple, stars rain down,
74. and god or void appall us till we drown
75. in our own tears: today we start
76. to pay the piper with each breath, yet love
77. knows not of death nor calculus above
78. the simple sum of heart plus heart.
