1. Woodsmoke and a distant loudspeaker
2. Filter into this clear
3. Air, and blur.

4. The red tomato's in, the green bean;
5. The cook lugs a pumpkin
6. From the vine

7. For pies. The fir tree's thick with grackles.
8. Gold carp loom in the pools.
9. A wasp crawls

10. Over windfalls to sip cider-juice.
11. Guests in the studios
12. Muse, compose.

13. Indoors, Tiffany's phoenix rises
14. Above the fireplace;
15. Two carved sleighs

16. Rest on orange plush near the newel post.
17. Wood stoves burn warm as toast.
18. The late guest

19. Wakens, mornings, to a cobalt sky,
20. A diamond-paned window,
21. Zinc-white snow.
