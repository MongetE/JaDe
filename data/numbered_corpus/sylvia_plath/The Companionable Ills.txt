1. The nose-end that twitches, the old imperfections—-
2. Tolerable now as moles on the face
3. Put up with until chagrin gives place
4. To a wry complaisance—-

5. Dug in first as God's spurs
6. To start the spirit out of the mud
7. It stabled in; long-used, became well-loved
8. Bedfellows of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
