1. Thou shalt have an everlasting
2. Monday and stand in the moon.

3. The moon's man stands in his shell,
4. Bent under a bundle
5. Of sticks. The light falls chalk and cold
6. Upon our bedspread.
7. His teeth are chattering among the leprous
8. Peaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes.

9. He also against black frost
10. Would pick sticks, would not rest
11. Until his own lit room outshone
12. Sunday's ghost of sun;
13. Now works his hell of Mondays in the moon's ball,
14. Fireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle.
