1. Riding home from credulous blue domes,
2. the dreamer reins his waking appetite
3. in panic at the crop of catacombs
4. sprung up like plague of toadstools overnight:
5. refectories where he reveled have become
6. the holstery of worms, rapacious blades
7. who weave within the skeleton's white womb
8. a caviare decay of rich brocades.

9. Turning the tables of this grave gourmet,
10. the fiendish butler saunters in and serves
11. for feast the sweetest meat of hell's chef d' uvres:
12. his own pale bride upon a flaming tray:
13. parsleyed with elegies, she lies in state
14. waiting for his grace to consecrate.
