1. Stalemated their armies stood, with tottering banners:
2. She flung from a room
3. Still ringing with bruit of insults and dishonors

4. And in fury left him
5. Glowering at the coal-fire: ‘Come find me'—her last taunt.
6. He did not come

7. But sat on, guarding his grim battlement.
8. By the doorstep
9. Her winter-beheaded daisies, marrowless, gaunt,

10. Warned her to keep
11. Indoors with politic goodwill, not haste
12. Into a landscape

13. Of stark wind-harrowed hills and weltering mist;
14. But from the house
15. She stalked intractable as a driven ghost

16. Across moor snows
17. Pocked by rock-claw and rabbit-track: she must yet win
18. Him to his knees—

19. Let him send police and hounds to bring her in.
20. Nursing her rage
21. Through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black stone,

22. To the world's white edge
23. She came, and called hell to subdue an unruly man
24. And join her siege.

25. It was no fire-blurting fork-tailed demon
26. Volcanoed hot
27. From marble snow-heap of moor to ride that woman

28. With spur and knout
29. Down from pride's size: instead, a grisly-thewed,
30. Austere, corpse-white

31. Giant heaved into the distance, stone-hatcheted,
32. Sky-high, and snow
33. Floured his whirling beard, and at his tread

34. Ambushed birds by
35. Dozens dropped dead in the hedges: o she felt
36. No love in his eye,

37. Worse—saw dangling from that spike-studded belt
38. Ladies' sheaved skulls:
39. Mournfully the dry tongues clacked their guilt:

40. ‘Our wit made fools
41. Of kings, unmanned kings' sons: our masteries
42. Amused court halls:

43. For that brag, we barnacle these iron thighs.'
44. Throned in the thick
45. Of a blizzard, the giant roared up with his chittering trophies.

46. From brunt of axe-crack
47. She shied sideways: a white fizz! and the giant, pursuing,
48. Crumbled to smoke.

49. Humbled then, and crying,
50. The girl bent homeward, brimful of gentle talk
51. And mild obeying.
