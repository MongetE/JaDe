1. I've got a stubborn goose whose gut's
2. Honeycombed with golden eggs,
3. Yet won't lay one.
4. She, addled in her goose-wit, struts
5. The barnyard like those taloned hags
6. Who ogle men

7. And crimp their wrinkles in a grin,
8. Jangling their great money bags.
9. While I eat grits
10. She fattens on the finest grain.
11. Now, as I hone my knife, she begs
12. Pardon, and that's

13. So humbly done, I'd turn this keen
14. Steel on myself before profit
15. By such a rogue's
16. Act, but â€”- How those feathers shine!

17. Exit from a smoking slit
18. Her ruby dregs.
