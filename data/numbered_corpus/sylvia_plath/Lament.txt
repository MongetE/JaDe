1. The sting of bees took away my father
2. who walked in a swarming shroud of wings
3. and scorned the tick of the falling weather.

4. Lightning licked in a yellow lather
5. but missed the mark with snaking fangs:
6. the sting of bees took away my father.

7. Trouncing the sea like a ragin bather,
8. he rode the flood in a pride of prongs
9. and scorned the tick of the falling weather.

10. A scowl of sun struck down my mother,
11. tolling her grave with golden gongs,
12. but the sting of bees took away my father.

13. He counted the guns of god a bother,
14. laughed at the ambush of angels' tongues,
15. and scorned the tick of the falling weather.

16. O ransack the four winds and find another
17. man who can mangle the grin of kings:
18. the sting of bees took away my father
19. who scorned the tick of the falling weather.
