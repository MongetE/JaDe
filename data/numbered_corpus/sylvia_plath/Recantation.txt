1. 'Tea leaves I've given up,
2. And that crooked line
3. On the queen's palm
4. Is no more my concern.
5. On my black pilgrimage
6. This moon-pocked crystal ball
7. Will break before it help;
8. Rather than croak out
9. What's to come,
10. My darling ravens are flown.

11. 'Forswear those freezing tricks of sight
12. And all else I've taught
13. Against the flower in the blood:
14. Not wealth nor wisdom stands
15. Above the simple vein,
16. The straight mouth.
17. Go to your greenhorn youth
18. Before time ends
19. And do good
20. With your white hands.'
