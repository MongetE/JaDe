1. Through fen and farmland walking
2. With my own country love
3. I saw slow flocked cows move
4. White hulks on their day's cruising;
5. Sweet grass sprang for their grazing.

6. The air was bright for looking:
7. Most far in blue, aloft,
8. Clouds steered a burnished drift;
9. Larks' nip and tuck arising
10. Came in for my love's praising.

11. Sheen of the noonsun striking
12. Took my heart as if
13. It were a green-tipped leaf
14. Kindled by my love's pleasing
15. Into an ardent blazing.

16. And so, together, talking,
17. Through Sunday's honey-air
18. We walked (and still walk thereâ€”-
19. Out of the sun's bruising)
20. Till the night mists came rising.
