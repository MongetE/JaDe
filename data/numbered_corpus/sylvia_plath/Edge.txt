1. The woman is perfected
2. 	Her dead

3. 	Body wears the smile of accomplishment,
4. 	The illusion of a Greek necessity

5. 	Flows in the scrolls of her toga,
6. 	Her bare

7. 	Feet seem to be saying:
8. 	We have come so far, it is over.

9. 	Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,
10. 	One at each little

11. 	Pitcher of milk, now empty
12. 	She has folded

13. 	Them back into her body as petals
14. 	Of a rose close when the garden

15. 	Stiffens and odors bleed
16. 	From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.

17. 	The moon has nothing to be sad about,
18. 	Staring from her hood of bone.

19. 	She is used to this sort of thing.
20. 	Her blacks crackle and drag.
