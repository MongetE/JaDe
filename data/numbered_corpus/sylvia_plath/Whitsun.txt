1. This is not what I meant:
2. Stucco arches, the banked rocks sunning in rows,
3. Bald eyes or petrified eggs,
4. Grownups coffined in stockings and jackets,
5. Lard-pale, sipping the thin
6. Air like a medicine.

7. The stopped horse on his chromium pole
8. Stares through us; his hooves chew the breeze.
9. Your shirt of crisp linen
10. Bloats like a spinnaker. Hat brims
11. Deflect the watery dazzle; the people idle
12. As if in hospital.

13. I can smell the salt, all right.
14. At our feet, the weed-mustachioed sea
15. Exhibits its glaucous silks,
16. Bowing and truckling like an old-school oriental.
17. You're no happier than I about it.
18. A policeman points out a vacant cliff

19. Green as a pool table, where cabbage butterflies
20. Peel off to sea as gulls do,
21. And we picnic in the death-stench of a hawthorn.
22. The waves pulse like hearts.
23. Beached under the spumy blooms, we lie
24. Sea-sick and fever-dry.
