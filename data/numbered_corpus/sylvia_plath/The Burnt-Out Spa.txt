1. An old beast ended in this place:

2. A monster of wood and rusty teeth.
3. Fire smelted his eyes to lumps
4. Of pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
5. As resin drops oozed from pine bark.

6. The rafters and struts of his body wear
7. Their char of karakul still. I can't tell
8. How long his carcass had foundered under
9. The rubbish of summers, the black-leaved falls.

10. Now little weeds insinuate
11. Soft suede tongues between his bones.
12. His armorplate, his toppled stones
13. Are an esplanade for crickets.

14. I pick and pry like a doctor or
15. Arch√¶ologist among
16. Iron entrails, enameled bowl,
17. The coils and pipes that made him run.

18. The small dell eats what ate it once.
19. And yet the ichor of the spring
20. Proceeds clear as it ever did
21. From the broken throat, that marshy lip.

22. It flows off below the green and white
23. Balustrade of a sag-backed bridge.
24. Leaning over, I encounter one
25. Blue and improbable person

26. Framed in a basketwork of cattails.
27. O she is gracious and austere,
28. Seated beneath the toneless water!
29. It is not I, it is not I.

30. No animal spoils on her green doorstep.
31. And we shall never enter there
32. Where the durable ones keep house.
33. The stream that hustles us

34. Neither nourishes nor heals.
