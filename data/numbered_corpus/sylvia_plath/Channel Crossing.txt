1. On storm-struck deck, wind sirens caterwaul;
2. With each tilt, shock and shudder, our blunt ship
3. Cleaves forward into fury; dark as anger,
4. Waves wallop, assaulting the stubborn hull.
5. Flayed by spray, we take the challenge up,
6. Grip the rail, squint ahead, and wonder how much longer

7. Such force can last; but beyond, the neutral view
8. Shows, rank on rank, the hungry seas advancing.
9. Below, rocked havoc-sick, voyagers lie
10. Retching in bright orange basins; a refugee
11. Sprawls, hunched in black, among baggage, wincing
12. Under the strict mask of his agony.

13. Far from the sweet stench of that perilous air
14. In which our comrades are betrayed, we freeze
15. And marvel at the smashing nonchalance
16. Of nature : what better way to test taut fiber
17. Than against this onslaught, these casual blasts of ice
18. That wrestle with us like angels; the mere chance

19. Of making harbor through this racketing flux
20. Taunts us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey
21. Would be full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
22. With radiance, peacock-colored; instead, bleak rocks
23. Jutted early to mark our going, while sky
24. Curded over with clouds and chalk cliffs blanched

25. In sullen light of the inauspicious day.
26. Now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the common ill
27. Knocking our brothers down, we strike a stance
28. Most mock-heroic, to cloak our waking awe
29. At this rare rumpus which no man can control :
30. Meek and proud both fall; stark violence

31. Lays all walls waste; private estates are torn,
32. Ransacked in the public eye. We forsake
33. Our lone luck now, compelled by bond, by blood,
34. To keep some unsaid pact; perhaps concern
35. Is helpless here, quite extra, yet we must make
36. The gesture, bend and hold the prone man's head.

37. And so we sail toward cities, streets and homes
38. Of other men, where statues celebrate
39. Brave acts played out in peace, in war; all dangers
40. End : green shores appear; we assume our names,
41. Our luggage, as docks halt our brief epic; no debt
42. Survives arrival; we walk the plank with strangers.
