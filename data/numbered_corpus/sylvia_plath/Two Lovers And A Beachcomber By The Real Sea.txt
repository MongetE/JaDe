1. Cold and final, the imagination
2. Shuts down its fabled summer house;
3. Blue views are boarded up; our sweet vacation
4. Dwindles in the hour-glass.

5. Thoughts that found a maze of mermaid hair
6. Tangling in the tide's green fall
7. Now fold their wings like bats and disappear
8. Into the attic of the skull.

9. We are not what we might be; what we are
10. Outlaws all extrapolation
11. Beyond the interval of now and here:
12. White whales are gone with the white ocean.

13. A lone beachcomber squats among the wrack
14. Of kaleidoscope shells
15. Probing fractured Venus with a stick
16. Under a tent of taunting gulls.

17. No sea-change decks the sunken shank of bone
18. That chucks in backtrack of the wave;
19. Though the mind like an oyster labors on and on,
20. A grain of sand is all we have.

21. Water will run by; the actual sun
22. Will scrupulously rise and set;
23. No little man lives in the exacting moon
24. And that is that, is that, is that.
