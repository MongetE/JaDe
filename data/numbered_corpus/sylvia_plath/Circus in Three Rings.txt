1. In the circus tent of a hurricane
2. designed by a drunken god
3. my extravagant heart blows up again
4. in a rampage of champagne-colored rain
5. and the fragments whir like a weather vane
6. while the angels all applaud.

7. Daring as death and debonair
8. I invade my lion's den;
9. a rose of jeopardy flames in my hair
10. yet I flourish my whip with a fatal flair
11. defending my perilous wounds with a chair
12. while the gnawings of love begin.

13. Mocking as Mephistopheles,
14. eclipsed by magician's disguise,
15. my demon of doom tilts on a trapeze,
16. winged rabbits revolving about his knees,
17. only to vanish with devilish ease
18. in a smoke that sears my eyes.
