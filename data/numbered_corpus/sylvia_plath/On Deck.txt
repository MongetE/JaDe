1. Midnight in the mid-Atlantic. On deck.
2. Wrapped up in themselves as in thick veiling
3. And mute as mannequins in a dress shop,
4. Some few passangers keep track
5. Of the old star-map on the ceiling.
6. Tiny and far, a single ship

7. Lit like a two-tiered wedding cake
8. Carries its candles slowly off.
9. Now there is nothing much to look at.
10. Still nobody will move or speak â€”-
11. The bingo players, the players at love
12. On a square no bigger than a carpet

13. Are hustled over the crests and troughs,
14. Each stalled in his particular minute
15. And castled in it like a king.
16. Small drops spot their coats, their gloves:
17. They fly too fast to feel the wet.
18. Anything can happen where they are going.

19. The untidy lady revivalist
20. For whom the good Lord provides (He gave
21. Her a pocketbook, a pearl hatpin
22. And seven winter coats last August)
23. Prays under her breath that she may save
24. The art students in West Berlin.

25. The astrologer at her elbow (a Leo)
26. Picked his trip-date by the stars.
27. The is gratified by the absence of icecakes.
28. He'll be rich in a year (and he should know)
29. Selling the Welsh and English mothers
30. Nativities at two and six.

31. And the white-haired jeweler from Denmark is carving
32. A perfectly faceted wife to wait
33. On him hand and foot, quiet as a diamond.
34. Moony balloons, tied by a string
35. To their owner' wrists, the light dreams float
36. To be let loose at news of land.
