1. The womb
2. Rattles its pod, the moon
3. Discharges itself from the tree with nowhere to go.

4. My landscape is a hand with no lines,
5. The roads bunched to a knot,
6. The knot myself,

7. Myself the rose you acheive—-
8. This body,
9. This ivory

10. Ungodly as a child's shriek.
11. Spiderlike, I spin mirrors,
12. Loyal to my image,

13. Uttering nothing but blood—-
14. Taste it, dark red!
15. And my forest

16. My funeral,
17. And this hill and this
18. Gleaming with the mouths of corpses.
