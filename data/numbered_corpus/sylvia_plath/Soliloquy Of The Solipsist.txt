1. Soliloquy Of The Solipsist
2. I?
3. I walk alone;
4. The midnight street
5. Spins itself from under my feet;
6. When my eyes shut
7. These dreaming houses all snuff out;
8. Through a whim of mine
9. Over gables the moon's celestial onion
10. Hangs high.

11. I
12. Make houses shrink
13. And trees diminish
14. By going far; my look's leash
15. Dangles the puppet-people
16. Who, unaware how they dwindle,
17. Laugh, kiss, get drunk,
18. Nor guess that if I choose to blink
19. They die.

20. I
21. When in good humor,
22. Give grass its green
23. Blazon sky blue, and endow the sun
24. With gold;
25. Yet, in my wintriest moods, I hold
26. Absolute power
27. To boycott any color and forbid any flower
28. To be.

29. I
30. Know you appear
31. Vivid at my side,
32. Denying you sprang out of my head,
33. Claiming you feel
34. Love fiery enough to prove flesh real,
35. Though it's quite clear
36. All you beauty, all your wit, is a gift, my dear,
37. From me.
