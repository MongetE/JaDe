1. It is a chilly god, a god of shades,
2. Rises to the glass from his black fathoms.
3. At the window, those unborn, those undone
4. Assemble with the frail paleness of moths,
5. An envious phosphorescence in their wings.
6. Vermillions, bronzes, colors of the sun
7. In the coal fire will not wholly console them.
8. Imagine their deep hunger, deep as the dark
9. For the blood-heat that would ruddlr or reclaim.
10. The glass mouth sucks blooh-heat from my forefinger.
11. The old god dribbles, in return, his words.

12. The old god, too, write aureate poetry
13. In tarnished modes, maundering among the wastes,
14. Fair chronicler of every foul declension.
15. Age, and ages of prose, have uncoiled
16. His talking whirlwind, abated his excessive temper
17. When words, like locusts, drummed the darkening air
18. And left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean.
19. Skies once wearing a blue, divine hauteur
20. Ravel above us, mistily descend,
21. Thickening with motes, to a marriage with the mire.

22. He hymns the rotten queen with saffron hair
23. Who has saltier aphrodisiacs
24. Than virgins' tears. That bawdy queen of death,
25. Her wormy couriers aer at his bones.
26. Still he hymns juice of her, hot nectarine.
27. I see him, horny-skinned and tough, construe
28. What flinty pebbles and ploughable upturns
29. As ponderable tokens of her love.
30. He, godly, doddering, spells
31. No succinct Gabriel from the letters here
32. But floridly, his amorous nostalgias.
