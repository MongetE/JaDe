1. I have done it again.
2. One year in every ten
3. I manage it——

4. A sort of walking miracle, my skin
5. Bright as a Nazi lampshade,
6. My right foot

7. A paperweight,
8. My face a featureless, fine
9. Jew linen.

10. Peel off the napkin
11. 0 my enemy.
12. Do I terrify?——

13. The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?
14. The sour breath
15. Will vanish in a day.

16. Soon, soon the flesh
17. The grave cave ate will be
18. At home on me

19. And I a smiling woman.
20. I am only thirty.
21. And like the cat I have nine times to die.

22. This is Number Three.
23. What a trash
24. To annihilate each decade.

25. What a million filaments.
26. The peanut-crunching crowd
27. Shoves in to see

28. Them unwrap me hand and foot
29. The big strip tease.
30. Gentlemen, ladies

31. These are my hands
32. My knees.
33. I may be skin and bone,

34. Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.
35. The first time it happened I was ten.
36. It was an accident.

37. The second time I meant
38. To last it out and not come back at all.
39. I rocked shut

40. As a seashell.
41. They had to call and call
42. And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.

43. Dying
44. Is an art, like everything else,
45. I do it exceptionally well.

46. I do it so it feels like hell.
47. I do it so it feels real.
48. I guess you could say I've a call.

49. It's easy enough to do it in a cell.
50. It's easy enough to do it and stay put.
51. It's the theatrical

52. Comeback in broad day
53. To the same place, the same face, the same brute
54. Amused shout:

55. 'A miracle!'
56. That knocks me out.
57. There is a charge

58. For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge
59. For the hearing of my heart——
60. It really goes.

61. And there is a charge, a very large charge
62. For a word or a touch
63. Or a bit of blood

64. Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.
65. So, so, Herr Doktor.
66. So, Herr Enemy.

67. I am your opus,
68. I am your valuable,
69. The pure gold baby

70. That melts to a shriek.
71. I turn and burn.
72. Do not think I underestimate your great concern.

73. Ash, ash —-
74. You poke and stir.
75. Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——

76. A cake of soap,
77. A wedding ring,
78. A gold filling.

79. Herr God, Herr Lucifer
80. Beware
81. Beware.

82. Out of the ash
83. I rise with my red hair
84. And I eat men like air.
