1. Once I was ordinary:
2. Sat by my father's bean tree
3. Eating the fingers of wisdom.
4. The birds made milk.
5. When it thundered I hid under a flat stone.

6. The mother of mouths didn't love me.
7. The old man shrank to a doll.
8. O I am too big to go backward:
9. Birdmilk is feathers,
10. The bean leaves are dumb as hands.

11. This month is fit for little.
12. The dead ripen in the grapeleaves.
13. A red tongue is among us.
14. Mother, keep out of my barnyard,
15. I am becoming another.

16. Dog-head, devourer:
17. Feed me the berries of dark.
18. The lids won't shut. Time
19. Unwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun
20. Its endless glitter.

21. I must swallow it all.

22. Lady, who are these others in the moon's vat â€”-
23. Sleepdrunk, their limbs at odds?
24. In this light the blood is black.
25. Tell me my name.
