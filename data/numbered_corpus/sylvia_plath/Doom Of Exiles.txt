1. Now we, returning from the vaulted domes
2. Of our colossal sleep, come home to find
3. A tall metropolis of catacombs
4. Erected down the gangways of our mind.

5. Green alleys where we reveled have become
6. The infernal haunt of demon dangers;
7. Both seraph song and violins are dumb;
8. Each clock tick consecrates the death of strangers

9. Backward we traveled to reclaim the day
10. Before we fell, like Icarus, undone;
11. All we find are altars in decay
12. And profane words scrawled black across the sun.

13. Still, stubbornly we try to crack the nut
14. In which the riddle of our race is shut.
