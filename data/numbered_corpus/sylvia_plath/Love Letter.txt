1. Not easy to state the change you made.
2. If I'm alive now, then I was dead,
3. Though, like a stone, unbothered by it,
4. Staying put according to habit.
5. You didn't just tow me an inch, no-
6. Nor leave me to set my small bald eye
7. Skyward again, without hope, of course,
8. Of apprehending blueness, or stars.

9. That wasn't it. I slept, say: a snake
10. Masked among black rocks as a black rock
11. In the white hiatus of winter-
12. Like my neighbors, taking no pleasure
13. In the million perfectly-chisled
14. Cheeks alighting each moment to melt
15. My cheeks of basalt. They turned to tears,
16. Angels weeping over dull natures,
17. But didn't convince me. Those tears froze.
18. Each dead head had a visor of ice.

19. And I slept on like a bent finger.
20. The first thing I was was sheer air
21. And the locked drops rising in dew
22. Limpid as spirits. Many stones lay
23. Dense and expressionless round about.
24. I didn't know what to make of it.
25. I shone, mice-scaled, and unfolded
26. To pour myself out like a fluid
27. Among bird feet and the stems of plants.
28. I wasn't fooled. I knew you at once. 

29. Tree and stone glittered, without shadows.
30. My finger-length grew lucent as glass.
31. I started to bud like a March twig:
32. An arm and a leg, and arm, a leg.
33. From stone to cloud, so I ascended.
34. Now I resemble a sort of god
35. Floating through the air in my soul-shift
36. Pure as a pane of ice. It's a gift.
