1. All day she plays at chess with the bones of the world:
2. Favored (while suddenly the rains begin
3. Beyond the window) she lies on cushions curled
4. And nibbles an occasional bonbon of sin.

5. Prim, pink-breasted, feminine, she nurses
6. Chocolate fancies in rose-papered rooms
7. Where polished higboys whisper creaking curses
8. And hothouse roses shed immortal blooms.

9. The garnets on her fingers twinkle quick
10. And blood reflects across the manuscript;
11. She muses on the odor, sweet and sick,
12. Of festering gardenias in a crypt,

13. And lost in subtle metaphor, retreats
14. From gray child faces crying in the streets.
