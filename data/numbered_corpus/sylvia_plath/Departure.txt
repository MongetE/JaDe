1. The figs on the fig tree in the yard are green;
2. Green, also, the grapes on the green vine
3. Shading the brickred porch tiles.
4. The money's run out.

5. How nature, sensing this, compounds her bitters.
6. Ungifted, ungrieved, our leavetaking.
7. The sun shines on unripe corn.
8. Cats play in the stalks.

9. Retrospect shall not often such penury-
10. Sun's brass, the moon's steely patinas,
11. The leaden slag of the world-
12. But always expose

13. The scraggy rock spit shielding the town's blue bay
14. Against which the brunt of outer sea
15. Beats, is brutal endlessly.
16. Gull-fouled, a stone hut

17. Bares its low lintel to corroding weathers:
18. Across the jut of ochreous rock
19. Goats shamble, morose, rank-haired,
20. To lick the sea-salt.
