1. By the roots of my hair some god got hold of me.
2. I sizzled in his blue volts like a desert prophet.

3. The nights snapped out of sight like a lizard's eyelid :
4. A world of bald white days in a shadeless socket.

5. A vulturous boredom pinned me in this tree.
6. If he were I, he would do what I did.
