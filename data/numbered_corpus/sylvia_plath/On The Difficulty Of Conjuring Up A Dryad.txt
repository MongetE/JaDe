1. Ravening through the persistent bric-à-brac
2. Of blunt pencils, rose-sprigged coffee cup,
3. Postage stamps, stacked books' clamor and yawp,
4. Neighborhood cockcrow—all nature's prodigal backtalk,
5. The vaunting mind
6. Snubs impromptu spiels of wind
7. And wrestles to impose
8. Its own order on what is.

9. ‘With my fantasy alone,' brags the importunate head,
10. Arrogant among rook-tongued spaces,
11. Sheep greens, finned falls, ‘I shall compose a crisis
12. To stun sky black out, drive gibbering mad
13. Trout, cock, ram,
14. That bulk so calm
15. On my jealous stare,
16. Self-sufficient as they are.'

17. But no hocus-pocus of green angels
18. Damasks with dazzle the threadbare eye;
19. ‘My trouble, doctor, is: I see a tree,
20. And that damn scrupulous tree won't practice wiles
21. To beguile sight:
22. E.g., by cant of light
23. Concoct a Daphne;
24. My tree stays tree.

25. ‘However I wrench obstinate bark and trunk
26. To my sweet will, no luminous shape
27. Steps out radiant in limb, eye, lip,
28. To hoodwink the honest earth which pointblank
29. Spurns such fiction
30. As nymphs; cold vision
31. Will have no counterfeit
32. Palmed off on it.

33. ‘No doubt now in dream-propertied fall some moon-eyed,
34. Star-lucky sleight-of-hand man watches
35. My jilting lady squander coin, gold leaf stock ditches,
36. And the opulent air go studded with seed,
37. While this beggared brain
38. Hatches no fortune,
39. But from leaf, from grass,
40. Thieves what it has.'
