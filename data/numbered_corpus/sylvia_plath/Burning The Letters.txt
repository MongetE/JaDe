1. I made a fire; being tired
2. Of the white fists of old
3. Letters and their death rattle
4. When I came too close to the wastebasket
5. What did they know that I didn't?
6. Grain by grain, they unrolled
7. Sands where a dream of clear water
8. Grinned like a getaway car.
9. I am not subtle
10. Love, love, and well, I was tired
11. Of cardboard cartons the color of cement or a dog pack
12. Holding in it's hate
13. Dully, under a pack of men in red jackets,
14. And the eyes and times of the postmarks.

15. This fire may lick and fawn, but it is merciless:
16. A glass case
17. My fingers would enter although
18. They melt and sag, they are told
19. Do not touch.
20. And here is an end to the writing,
21. The spry hooks that bend and cringe and the smiles, the smiles
22. And at least it will be a good place now, the attic.
23. At least I won't be strung just under the surface,
24. Dumb fish
25. With one tin eye,
26. Watching for glints,
27. Riding my Arctic
28. Between this wish and that wish.

29. So, I poke at the carbon birds in my housedress.
30. They are more beautiful than my bodiless owl,
31. They console me—
32. Rising and flying, but blinded.
33. They would flutter off, black and glittering, they would be coal angels
34. Only they have nothing to say but anybody.
35. I have seen to that.
36. With the butt of a rake
37. I flake up papers that breathe like people,
38. I fan them out
39. Between the yellow lettuces and the German cabbage
40. Involved in it's weird blue dreams
41. Involved in a foetus.
42. And a name with black edges

43. Wilts at my foot,
44. Sinuous orchis
45. In a nest of root-hairs and boredom—
46. Pale eyes, patent-leather gutturals!
47. Warm rain greases my hair, extinguishes nothing.
48. My veins glow like trees.
49. The dogs are tearing a fox. This is what it is like
50. A read burst and a cry
51. That splits from it's ripped bag and does not stop
52. With that dead eye
53. And the stuffed expression, but goes on
54. Dyeing the air,
55. Telling the particles of the clouds, the leaves, the water
56. What immortality is. That it is immortal.
