1. Now this particular girl
2. During a ceremonious april walk
3. With her latest suitor
4. Found herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck
5. By the bird's irregular babel
6. And the leaves' litter.
7. By this tumult afflicted, she
8. Observed her lover's gestures unbalance the air,
9. His gait stray uneven
10. Through a rank wilderness of fern and flower;
11. She judged petals in disarray,
12. The whole season, sloven.
13. How she longed for winter then!-
14. Scrupulously austere in its order
15. Of white and black
16. Ice and rock; each sentiment within border,
17. And heart's frosty discipline
18. Exact as a snowflake.
19. But here - a burgeoning
20. Unruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits
21. Into vulgar motley-
22. A treason not to be borne; let idiots
23. Reel giddy in bedlam spring;
24. She withdrew neatly.
25. And round her house she set
26. Such a barricade of barb and check
27. Against mutinous weather
28. As no mere insurgent man could hope to break
29. With curse, fist, threat
30. Or love, either.
