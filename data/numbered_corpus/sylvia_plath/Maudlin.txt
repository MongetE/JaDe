1. Mud-mattressed under the sign of the hag
2. In a clench of blood, the sleep-talking virgin
3. Gibbets with her curse the moon's man,
4. ****-bearing Jack in his crackless egg :

5. Hatched with a claret hogshead to swig
6. He kings it, navel-knit to no groan,
7. But at the price of a pin-stitched skin
8. Fish-tailed girls purchase each white leg.
