1. No map traces the street
2. Where those two sleepers are.
3. We have lost track of it.
4. They lie as if under water
5. In a blue, unchanging light,
6. The French window ajar

7. Curtained with yellow lace.
8. Through the narrow crack
9. Odors of wet earth rise.
10. The snail leaves a silver track;
11. Dark thickets hedge the house.
12. We take a backward look.

13. Among petals pale as death
14. And leaves steadfast in shape
15. They sleep on, mouth to mouth.
16. A white mist is going up.
17. The small green nostrils breathe,
18. And they turn in their sleep.

19. Ousted from that warm bed
20. We are a dream they dream.
21. Their eyelids keep up the shade.
22. No harm can come to them.
23. We cast our skins and slide
24. Into another time.
