1. Through portico of my elegant house you stalk
2. With your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit
3. And the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net
4. Of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back.
5. Now, rich order of walls is fallen; rooks croakA
6. bove the appalling ruin; in bleak light
7. Of your stormy eye, magic takes flight
8. Like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break.

9. Fractured pillars frame prospects of rock;
10. While you stand heroic in coat and tie, I sit
11. Composed in Grecian tunic and psyche-knot,
12. Rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic:
13. Which such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate, 

14. What ceremony of words can patch the havoc?
