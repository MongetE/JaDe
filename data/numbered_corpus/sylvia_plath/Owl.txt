1. Clocks belled twelve. Main street showed otherwise
2. Than its suburb of woods : nimbusâ€”-
3. Lit, but unpeopled, held its windows
4. Of wedding pastries,

5. Diamond rings, potted roses, fox-skins
6. Ruddy on the wax mannequins
7. In a glassed tableau of affluence.
8. From deep-sunk basements

9. What moved the pale, raptorial owl
10. Then, to squall above the level
11. Of streetlights and wires, its wall to wall
12. Wingspread in control

13. Of the ferrying currents, belly
14. Dense-feathered, fearfully soft to
15. Look upon? Rats' teeth gut the city
16. Shaken by owl cry.
