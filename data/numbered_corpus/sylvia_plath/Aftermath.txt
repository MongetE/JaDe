1. Compelled by calamity's magnet 
2. They loiter and stare as if the house 
3. Burnt-out were theirs, or as if they thought 
4. Some scandal might any minute ooze 
5. From a smoke-choked closet into light; 
6. No deaths, no prodigious injuries 
7. Glut these hunters after an old meat, 
8. Blood-spoor of the austere tragedies. 

9. Mother Medea in a green smock 
10. Moves humbly as any housewife through 
11. Her ruined apartments, taking stock 
12. Of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery: 
13. Cheated of the pyre and the rack, 
14. The crowd sucks her last tear and turns away.
