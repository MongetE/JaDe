1. From Water-Tower Hill to the brick prison
2. The shingle booms, bickering under
3. The sea's collapse.
4. Snowcakes break and welter. This year
5. The gritted wave leaps
6. The seawall and drops onto a bier
7. Of quahog chips,
8. Leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten

9. In my grandmother's sand yard. She is dead,
10. Whose laundry snapped and froze here, who
11. Kept house against
12. What the ****tish, rutted sea could do.
13. Squall waves once danced
14. Ship timbers in through the cellar window;
15. A thresh-tailed, lanced
16. Shark littered in the geranium bed â€”-

17. Such collusion of mulish elements
18. She wore her broom straws to the nub.
19. Twenty years out
20. Of her hand, the house still hugs in each drab
21. Stucco socket
22. The purple egg-stones: from Great Head's knob
23. To the filled-in Gut
24. The sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds.

25. Nobody wintering now behind
26. The planked-up windows where she set
27. Her wheat loaves
28. And apple cakes to cool. What is it
29. Survives, grieves
30. So, battered, obstinate spit
31. Of gravel? The waves'
32. Spewed relics clicker masses in the wind,

33. Grey waves the stub-necked eiders ride.
34. A labor of love, and that labor lost.
35. Steadily the sea
36. Eats at Point Shirley. She died blessed,
37. And I come by
38. Bones, only bones, pawed and tossed,
39. A dog-faced sea.
40. The sun sinks under Boston, bloody red.

41. I would get from these dry-papped stones
42. The milk your love instilled in them.
43. The black ducks dive.
44. And though your graciousness might stream,
45. And I contrive,
46. Grandmother, stones are nothing of home
47. To that spumiest dove.
48. Against both bar and tower the black sea runs.
