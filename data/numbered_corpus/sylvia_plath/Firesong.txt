1. Born green we were
2. to this flawed garden,
3. but in speckled thickets, warted as a toad,
4. spitefully skulks our warden,
5. fixing his snare
6. which hauls down buck, cock, trout, till all most fair
7. is tricked to faulter in split blood.

8. Now our whole task's to hack
9. some angel-shape worth wearing
10. from his crabbed midden where all's wrought so awry
11. that no straight inquiring
12. could unlock
13. shrewd catch silting our each bright act back
14. to unmade mud cloaked by sour sky.

15. Sweet salts warped stem
16. of weeds we tackle towards way's rank ending;
17. scorched by red sun
18. we heft globed flint, racked in veins' barbed bindings;
19. brave love, dream
20. not of staunching such strict flame, but come,
21. lean to my wound; burn on, burn on.
