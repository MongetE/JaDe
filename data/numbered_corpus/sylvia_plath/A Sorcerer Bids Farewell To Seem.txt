1. I'm through with this grand looking-glass hotel
2. where adjectives play croquet with flamingo nouns;
3. methinks I shall absent me for a while
4. from rhetoric of these rococo queens.
5. Item : chuck out royal rigmarole of props
6. and auction off each rare white-rabbit verb;
7. send my muse Alice packing with gaudy scraps
8. of mushroom simile and gryphon garb.

9. My native sleight-of-hand is wearing out :
10. mad hatter's hat yields no new metaphor,
11. and jabberwock will not translate his songs :
12. it's time to vanish like the cheshire cat
13. alone to that authentic island where
14. cabbages are cabbages; kings : kings.
