1. Unlucky the hero born
2. In this province of the stuck record
3. Where the most watchful cooks go jobless
4. And the mayor's r√¥tisserie turns
5. Round of its own accord.

6. There's no career in the venture
7. Of riding against the lizard,
8. Himself withered these latter-days
9. To leaf-size from lack of action:
10. History's beaten the hazard.

11. The last crone got burnt up
12. More than eight decades back
13. With the love-hot herb, the talking cat,
14. But the children are better for it,
15. The cow milks cream an inch thick.
