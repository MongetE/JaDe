1. Up here among the gull cries
2. we stroll through a maze of pale
3. red-mottled relics, shells, claws

4. as if it were summer still.
5. That season has turned its back.
6. Through the green sea gardens stall,

7. bow, and recover their look
8. of the imperishable
9. gardens in an antique book

10. or tapestries on a wall,
11. leaves behind us warp and lapse.
12. The late month withers, as well.

13. Below us a white gull keeps
14. the weed-slicked shelf for his own,
15. hustles other gulls off. Crabs

16. rove over his field of stone;
17. mussels cluster blue as grapes :
18. his beak brings the harvest in.

19. The watercolorist grips
20. his brush in the stringent air.
21. The horizon's bare of ships,

22. the beach and the rocks are bare.
23. He paints a blizzard of gulls,
24. wings drumming in the winter.
