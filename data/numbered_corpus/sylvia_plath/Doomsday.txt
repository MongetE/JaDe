1. Doomsday
2. The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans
3. Atop the broken universal clock:
4. The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens.Out painted stages fall apart by scenes
5. While all the actors halt in mortal shock:
6. The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans.

7. Streets crack through in havoc-split ravines
8. As the doomstruck city crumbles block by block:
9. The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens.
10. Fractured glass flies down in smithereens;
11. Our lucky relics have been put in hock:
12. The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans.

13. The monkey's wrench has blasted all machines;
14. We never thought to hear the holy cock:
15. The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens.
16. Too late to ask if end was worth the means,
17. Too late to calculate the toppling stock:
18. The idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans,
19. The hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens.
