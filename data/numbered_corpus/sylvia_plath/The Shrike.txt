1. When night comes black
2. Such royal dreams beckon this man
3. As lift him apart
4. From his earth-wife's side
5. To wing, sleep-feathered,
6. The singular air,
7. While she, envious bride,
8. Cannot follow after, but lies
9. With her blank brown eyes starved wide,
10. Twisting curses in the tangled sheet
11. With taloned fingers,
12. Shaking in her skull's cage
13. The stuffed shape of her flown mate
14. Escaped among moon-plumaged strangers;
15. So hungered, she must wait in rage
16. Until bird-racketing dawn
17. When her shrike-face
18. Leans to peck open those locked lids, to eat
19. Crowns, palace, all
20. That nightlong stole her male,
21. And with red beak
22. Spike and suck out
23. Last blood-drop of that truant heart.
