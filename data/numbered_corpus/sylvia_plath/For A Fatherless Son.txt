1. You will be aware of an absence, presently,
2. Growing beside you, like a tree,
3. A death tree, color gone, an Australian gum tree —-
4. Balding, gelded by lightning—an illusion,
5. And a sky like a pig's backside, an utter lack of attention.
6. But right now you are dumb.
7. And I love your stupidity,
8. The blind mirror of it. I look in
9. And find no face but my own, and you think that's funny.
10. It is good for me
11. To have you grab my nose, a ladder rung.
12. One day you may touch what's wrong —-
13. The small skulls, the smashed blue hills, the godawful hush.
14. Till then your smiles are found money.
