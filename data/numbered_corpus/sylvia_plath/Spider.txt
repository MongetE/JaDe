1. Anansi, black busybody of the folktales,
2. You scuttle out on impulse
3. Blunt in self-interest
4. As a sledge hammer, as a man's bunched fist,
5. Yet of devils the cleverest
6. To get your carousals told:
7. You spun the cosmic web: you squint from center field.

8. Last summer I came upon your Spanish cousin,
9. Notable robber baron,
10. Behind a goatherd's hut:
11. Near his small stonehenge above the ants' route,
12. One-third ant-size, a leggy spot,
13. He tripped an ant with a rope
14. Scarcely visible. About and about the slope

15. Of his redoubt he ran his nimble filament,
16. Each time round winding that ant
17. Tighter to the cocoon
18. Already veiling the gray spool of stone
19. From which coils, caught ants waved legs in
20. Torpid warning, or lay still
21. And suffered their livelier fellows to struggle.

22. Then briskly scaled his altar tiered with tethered ants,
23. Nodding in a somnolence
24. Appalling to witness,
25. To the barbarous outlook, from there chose
26. His next martyr to the gross cause
27. Of concupiscence. Once more
28. With black alacrity bound round his prisoner.

29. The ants—a file of comers, a file of goers—
30. Persevered on a set course
31. No scruple could disrupt,
32. Obeying orders of instinct till swept
33. Off-stage and infamously wrapped
34. Up by a spry black deus
35. Ex machina. Nor did they seem deterred by this.
