1. By the gate with star and moon
2. Worked into the peeled orange wood
3. The bronze snake lay in the sun

4. Inert as a shoelace; dead
5. But pliable still, his jaw
6. Unhinged and his grin crooked,

7. Tongue a rose-colored arrow.
8. Over my hand I hung him.
9. His little vermilion eye

10. Ignited with a glassed flame
11. As I turned him in the light;
12. When I split a rock one time

13. The garnet bits burned like that.
14. Bust dulled his back to ocher
15. The way sun ruins a trout.

16. Yet his belly kept its fire
17. Going under the chainmail,
18. The old jewels smoldering there

19. In each opaque belly-scale:
20. Sunset looked at through milk glass.
21. And I saw white maggots coil

22. Thin as pins in the dark bruise
23. Where innards bulged as if
24. He were digesting a mouse.

25. Knifelike, he was chaste enough,
26. Pure death's-metal. The yard-man's
27. Flung brick perfected his laugh.
