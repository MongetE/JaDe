1. They called the place Lookout Farm.
2. Back then, the sun
3. Didn't go down in such a hurry. How it
4. Lit things, that lamp of the Possible!
5. Wet yet
6. Lay over the leaves like a clear cellophane,
7. A pane of dragonfly wing, when they left me
8. With a hundred bushel baskets on the edge
9. Of the spinach patch.
10. Bunch after bunch of green
11. Upstanding spinach-tips wedged in a circle—
12. Layer on layer, and you had a basket
13. Irreproachable as any lettuce head,
14. Pure leafage. A hundred baskets by day's end.

15. Sun and sky mirrored the green of the spinach.
16. In the tin pail shaded by yellow paper
17. Well-water kept cool at the start of the rows.
18. The water had an iron taste, and the air,
19. Even, a tang of metal.
20. Day in, day out,
21. I bent over the plants in my leather-kneed
22. Dungarees, proud as a lady in a sea
23. Of prize roses, culling the fullest florets;
24. My world pyramided with laden baskets.

25. I'd only to set one foot in wilderness—
26. A whole sea of spinach-heads leaned to my hand.
