1. Off that landspit of stony mouth-plugs,
2. Eyes rolled by white sticks,
3. Ears cupping the sea's incoherences,
4. You house your unnerving headâ€”God-ball,
5. Lens of mercies,
6. Your stooges
7. Plying their wild cells in my keel's shadow,
8. Pushing by like hearts,
9. Red stigmata at the very center,
10. Riding the rip tide to the nearest point of
11. departure,

12. Dragging their Jesus hair.
13. Did I escape, I wonder?
14. My mind winds to you
15. Old barnacled umbilicus, Atlantic cable,
16. Keeping itself, it seems, in a state of miraculous
17. repair.

18. In any case, you are always there,
19. Tremulous breath at the end of my line,
20. Curve of water upleaping
21. To my water rod, dazzling and grateful,
22. Touching and sucking.
23. I didn't call you.
24. I didn't call you at all.
25. Nevertheless, nevertheless
26. You steamed to me over the sea,
27. Fat and red, a placenta

28. Paralyzing the kicking lovers.
29. Cobra light
30. Squeezing the breath from the blood bells
31. Of the fuchsia. I could draw no breath,
32. Dead and moneyless,

33. Overexposed, like an X-ray.
34. Who do you think you are?
35. A Communion wafer? Blubbery Mary?
36. I shall take no bite of your body,
37. Bottle in which I live,

38. Ghastly Vatican.
39. I am sick to death of hot salt.
40. Green as eunuchs, your wishes
41. Hiss at my sins.
42. Off, off, eely tentacle!
43. There is nothing between us.
