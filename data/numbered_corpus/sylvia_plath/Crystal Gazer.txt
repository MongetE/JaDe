1. Gerd sits spindle-shaped in her dark tent,
2. Lean face gone tawn with seasons ,
3. Skin worn down to the knucklebones
4. At her tough trade; without time's taint
5. The burnished ball hangs fire in her hands, a lens
6. Fusing time's three horizons.

7. Two enter to tap her sight, a green pair
8. Fresh leaved out in vows: 'Come tell
9. How we shall do together,
10. Well or ill.' Gerd slants a look at each: most dear,
11. Each to the other; fit fiber for stern weather.
12. Slowly she spins the ball:

13. 'I see two stalwart apple trees
14. Coupled by branches intertwined
15. And, springing all about,
16. Staunch saplings; to this house, thriving days
17. Will bring crop's increase, and harvest fruit
18. Follow on kind wind.'

19. 'No hardship then?' he asks. 'We'll take
20. Whatever trial's to come, so say true.'
21. His bride echoes his word. At that,
22. Gerd whirls the ball ablaze: 'Rough storm,' she grunts, ' may wreak
23. Some havoc on tender limb, and yet
24. Strengthen that orchard thereby.'

25. Their small price paid, these wedded ones
26. Walk forth into sun-moneyed air, quickened
27. To savor their span of flourishing.
28. Aloof, squatting mummy-wise, Gerd scans
29. That clairvoyant quartz which once, at her own wishing,
30. Exacted her first simple sight for this strict second.

31. Then, a free-gadding hoyden, Gerd had craved
32. To govern more sight than given to a woman
33. By wits alone: to foresee her lover's faith
34. And their future lot, she braved
35. Church curse to ken that crooked oath
36. Whereby one hires a demon.

37. A flash like doomcrack rent night's black:
38. God's work stood anchored in that glare
39. Focusing all time's day-suns in one
40. So beggar Gerd might aim her look
41. At gorgon-prospects with power to strike to stone
42. Hearts of those who pierced time's core.

43. What Gerd saw then engraved her mind —-
44. Plague-pitted as the moon: each bud
45. Shriveling to cinders at its source,
46. Each love blazing blind to its gutted end —-
47. And, fixed in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
48. Earth's ever-green death's head.
