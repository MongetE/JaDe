1. Over your body the clouds go
2. High, high and icily
3. And a little flat, as if they

4. Floated on a glass that was invisible.
5. Unlike swans,
6. Having no reflections;

7. Unlike you,
8. With no strings attached.
9. All cool, all blue. Unlike you —-

10. You, there on your back,
11. Eyes to the sky.
12. The spider-men have caught you,

13. Winding and twining their petty fetters,
14. Their bribes —-
15. So many silks.

16. How they hate you.
17. They converse in the valley of your fingers, they are inchworms.
18. They would have you sleep in their cabinets,

19. This toe and that toe, a relic.
20. Step off!
21. Step off seven leagues, like those distances

22. That revolve in Crivelli, untouchable.
23. Let this eye be an eagle,
24. The shadow of this lip, an abyss.
