1. Rigged poker -stiff on her back
2. With a granite grin
3. This antique museum-cased lady
4. Lies, companioned by the gimcrack
5. Relics of a mouse and a shrew
6. That battened for a day on her ankle-bone.

7. These three, unmasked now, bear
8. Dry witness
9. To the gross eating game
10. We'd wink at if we didn't hear
11. Stars grinding, crumb by crumb,
12. Our own grist down to its bony face.

13. How they grip us through think and thick,
14. These barnacle dead!
15. This lady here's no kin
16. Of mine, yet kin she is: she'll suck
17. Blood and whistle my narrow clean
18. To prove it. As I think now of her hand,

19. From the mercury-backed glass
20. Mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother
21. Reach hag hands to haul me in,
22. And an image looms under the fishpond surface
23. Where the daft father went down
24. With orange duck-feet winnowing this hair â€”-

25. All the long gone darlings: They
26. Get back, though, soon,
27. Soon: be it by wakes, weddings,
28. Childbirths or a family barbecue:
29. Any touch, taste, tang's
30. Fit for those outlaws to ride home on,

31. And to sanctuary: usurping the armchair
32. Between tick
33. And tack of the clock, until we go,
34. Each skulled-and-crossboned Gulliver
35. Riddled with ghosts, to lie
36. Deadlocked with them, taking roots as cradles rock.
