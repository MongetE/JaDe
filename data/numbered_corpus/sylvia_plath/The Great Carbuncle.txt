1. We came over the moor-top
2. Through air streaming and green-lit,
3. Stone farms foundering in it,
4. Valleys of grass altering
5. In a light neither dawn

6. Nor nightfall, out hands, faces
7. Lucent as percelain, the earth's
8. Claim and weight gone out of them.
9. Some such transfiguring moved
10. The eight pilgrims towards its source—

11. Toward the great jewel: shown often,
12. Never given; hidden, yet
13. Simultaneously seen
14. On moor-top, at sea-bottom,
15. Knowable only by light

16. Other than noon, that moon, stars —-
17. The once-known way becoming
18. Wholly other, and ourselves
19. Estranged, changed, suspended where
20. Angels are rumored, clearly

21. Floating , among the floating
22. Tables and chairs. Gravity's
23. Lost in the lift and drift of
24. An easier element
25. Than earth, and there is nothing

26. So fine we cannot do it.
27. But nearing means distancing:
28. At the common homecoming
29. Light withdraws. Chairs, tables drop
30. Down: the body weighs like stone.
