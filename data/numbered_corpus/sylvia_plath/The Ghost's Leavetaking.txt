1. Enter the chilly no-man's land of about
2. Five o'clock in the morning, the no-color void
3. Where the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot
4. Of sulfurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums
5. Which seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much,

6. Gets ready to face the ready-made creation
7. Of chairs and bureaus and sleep-twisted sheets.
8. This is the kingdom of the fading apparition,
9. The oracular ghost who dwindles on pin-legs
10. To a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets

11. Upraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell.
12. At this joint between two worlds and two entirely
13. Incompatible modes of time, the raw material
14. Of our meat-and-potato thoughts assumes the nimbus
15. Of ambrosial revelation. And so departs.

16. Chair and bureau are the hieroglyphs
17. Of some godly utterance wakened heads ignore:
18. So these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing,
19. Speak in sign language of a lost otherworld,
20. A world we lose by merely waking up.

21. Trailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost
22. Fringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes
23. Hand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down
24. Into the rocky gizzard of the earth,
25. But toward a region where our thick atmosphere

26. Diminishes, and God knows what is there.
27. A point of exclamation marks that sky
28. In ringing orange like a stellar carrot.
29. Its round period, displaced and green,
30. Suspends beside it the first point, the starting

31. Point of Eden, next the new moon's curve.
32. Go, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us,
33. And ghost of our dreams' children, in those sheets
34. Which signify our origin and end,
35. To the cloud-cuckoo land of color wheels

36. And pristine alphabets and cows that moo
37. And moo as they jump over moons as new
38. As that crisp cusp toward which you voyage now.
39. Hail and farewell. Hello, goodbye. O keeper
40. Of the profane grail, the dreaming skull.
