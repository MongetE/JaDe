1. From fabrication springs the spiral stair
2. up which the wakeful princess climbs to find
3. the source of blanching light that conjured her

4. to leave her bed of fever and ascend
5. a visionary ladder toward the moon
6. whose holy blue anoints her injured hand.

7. With finger bandaged where the waspish pin
8. flew from the intricate embroidery
9. and stung according to the witch's plan,

10. she mounts through malice of the needle's eye,
11. trailing her scrupulously simple gown
12. along bright asterisks by milky way.

13. Colonnades of angels nod her in
14. where ancient, infinite, and beautiful,
15. her legendary godmother leans down,

16. spinning a single stubborn thread of wool
17. which all the artful wizards cannot crimp
18. to keep the young girl from her crowning goal.

19. Initiated by the lunar lamp,
20. kindling her within a steepled flame,
21. the princess hears the thunder and the pomp

22. of squadrons underground abducting him
23. who is the destination of the cord
24. now bound around her wrist till she redeem
25. this miner's boy from goblin bodyguard.


26. Guided only by the tug and twitch
27. of that mercurial strand, the girl goes down
28. the darkening stair, undoes the palace latch

29. and slips unseen past watchmen on the lawn
30. dozing around their silvered sentry box.
31. Across the frosted grass she marks the sheen

32. of thread conducting her to the worn tracks
33. made by miners up the mountainside
34. among the jagged mazes of the rocks.

35. Laboring on the tilt of that steep grade
36. behind which the declining moon has set,
37. she recalls queer stories her nurse read

38. about a goblin raid on miner's hut
39. because new excavations came too near
40. the chambers where their fiendish queen would sit.

41. Hearing a weird cackle from afar,
42. she clutches at the talismanic cord
43. and confronts a cairn of iron ore.

44. Suddenly a brazen song is heard
45. from the pragmatic boy confined within,
46. gaily cursing the whole goblin horde.

47. Inviolate in the circle of that skein,
48. looping like faith about her bleeding feet,
49. the princess frees the miner, stone by stone,
50. and leads him home to be her chosen knight.


51. The princess coaxes the incredulous boy
52. through candid kitchens in the rising sun
53. to seek the staircase by the glare of day.

54. Hand in hand, they scale meridian,
55. clambering up the creaking heights of heat
56. until she hears the twittering machine

57. which quaintly wove the fabric of her fate
58. behind the zodiac on attic door
59. with abracadabra from the alphabet.

60. Pointing toward the spindle's cryptic whir,
61. she tells the greenhorn miner to bow down
62. and honor the great goddess of the air

63. suspended aloft within her planet-shine.
64. Laughing aloud, the dazzled boy demands
65. why he should kneel before a silly scene

66. where pigeons promenade the gable-ends
67. and coo quadrilles about the blighted core
68. in a batch of raveled apple rinds.

69. At his words, the indignant godmother
70. vanishes in a labyrinth of hay
71. while sunlight winds its yarn upon the floor.

72. O never again will the extravagant straw
73. knit up a gilded fable for the child
74. who weeps before the desolate tableau
75. of clockwork that makes the royal blood run cold.
