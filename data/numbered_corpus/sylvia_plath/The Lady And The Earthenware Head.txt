1. Fired in sanguine clay, the model head
2. Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a dense lid,
3. On the long bookshelf it stood
4. Stolidly propping thick volumes of prose: spite-set
5. Ape of her look. Best rid
6. Hearthstone at once of the outrageous head;
7. Still, she felt loath to junk it.

8. No place, it seemed, for the effigy to fare
9. Free from all molesting. Rough boys,
10. Spying a pate to spare
11. Glowering sullen and pompous from an ash-heap,
12. Might well seize this prize,
13. Maltreat the hostage head in shocking wise,
14. And waken the sly nerve up

15. That knits to each original its coarse copy. A dark tarn
16. She thought of then, thick-silted, with weeds obscured,
17. To serve her exacting turn:
18. But out of the watery aspic, laureled by fins,
19. The simulacrum leered,
20. Lewdly beckoning, and her courage wavered:
21. She blenched, as one who drowns,

22. And resolved more ceremoniously to lodge
23. The mimic head—in a crotched willow, green-
24. Vaulted by foliage:
25. Let bell-tongued birds descant in blackest feather
26. On the rendering, grain by grain,
27. Of that uncouth shape to simple sod again
28. Through drear and dulcet weather.

29. Yet, shrined on her shelf, the grisly visage endured,
30. Despite her wrung hands, her tears, her praying: Vanish!
31. Steadfast and evil-starred,
32. It ogled through rock-fault, wind-flaw and fisted wave—
33. An antique hag-head, too tough for knife to finish,
34. Refusing to diminish
35. By one jot its basilisk-look of love.
