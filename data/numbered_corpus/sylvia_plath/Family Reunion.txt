1. Outside in the street I hear
2. A car door slam; voices coming near;
3. Incoherent scraps of talk
4. And high heels clicking up the walk;
5. The doorbell rends the noonday heat
6. With copper claws;
7. A second's pause.
8. The dull drums of my pulses beat
9. Against a silence wearing thin.
10. The door now opens from within.
11. Oh, hear the clash of people meeting â€”-
12. The laughter and the screams of greeting :

13. Fat always, and out of breath,
14. A greasy smack on every cheek
15. From Aunt Elizabeth;
16. There, that's the pink, pleased squeak
17. Of Cousin Jane, out spinster with
18. The faded eyes
19. And hands like nervous butterflies;
20. While rough as splintered wood
21. Across them all
22. Rasps the jarring baritone of Uncle Paul;
23. The youngest nephew gives a fretful whine
24. And drools at the reception line.

25. Like a diver on a lofty spar of land
26. Atop the flight of stairs I stand.
27. A whirlpool leers at me,
28. I cast off my identity
29. And make the fatal plunge.
