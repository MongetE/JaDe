1. IT was a beautiful and silent day
2. That overspread the countenance of earth,
3. Then fading with unusual quietness,--
4. A day as beautiful as e'er was given
5. To soothe regret, though deepening what it soothed,
6. When by the gliding Loire I paused, and cast
7. Upon his rich domains, vineyard and tilth,
8. Green meadow-ground, and many-coloured woods,
9. Again, and yet again, a farewell look;
10. Then from the quiet of that scene passed on,
11. Bound to the fierce Metropolis. From his throne
12. The King had fallen, and that invading host--
13. Presumptuous cloud, on whose black front was written
14. The tender mercies of the dismal wind
15. That bore it--on the plains of Liberty
16. Had burst innocuous. Say in bolder words,
17. They--who had come elate as eastern hunters
18. Banded beneath the Great Mogul, when he
19. Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore,
20. Rajahs and Omrahs in his train, intent
21. To drive their prey enclosed within a ring
22. Wide as a province, but, the signal given,
23. Before the point of the life-threatening spear
24. Narrowing itself by moments--they, rash men,
25. Had seen the anticipated quarry turned
26. Into avengers, from whose wrath they fled
27. In terror. Disappointment and dismay
28. Remained for all whose fancies had run wild
29. With evil expectations; confidence
30. And perfect triumph for the better cause.

31. The State--as if to stamp the final seal
32. On her security, and to the world
33. Show what she was, a high and fearless soul,
34. Exulting in defiance, or heart-stung
35. By sharp resentment, or belike to taunt
36. With spiteful gratitude the baffled League,
37. That had stirred up her slackening faculties
38. To a new transition--when the King was crushed,
39. Spared not the empty throne, and in proud haste
40. Assumed the body and venerable name
41. Of a Republic. Lamentable crimes,
42. 'Tis true, had gone before this hour, dire work
43. Of massacre, in which the senseless sword
44. Was prayed to as a judge; but these were past,
45. Earth free from them for ever, as was thought,--
46. Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once!
47. Things that could only show themselves and die.

48. Cheered with this hope, to Paris I returned,
49. And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt,
50. The spacious city, and in progress passed
51. The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay,
52. Associate with his children and his wife
53. In bondage; and the palace, lately stormed
54. With roar of cannon by a furious host.
55. I crossed the square (an empty area then!)
56. Of the Carrousel, where so late had lain
57. The dead, upon the dying heaped, and gazed
58. On this and other spots, as doth a man
59. Upon a volume whose contents he knows
60. Are memorable, but from him locked up,
61. Being written in a tongue he cannot read,
62. So that he questions the mute leaves with pain,
63. And half upbraids their silence. But that night
64. I felt most deeply in what world I was,
65. What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed.
66. High was my room and lonely, near the roof
67. Of a large mansion or hotel, a lodge
68. That would have pleased me in more quiet times;
69. Nor was it wholly without pleasure then.
70. With unextinguished taper I kept watch,
71. Reading at intervals; the fear gone by
72. Pressed on me almost like a fear to come.
73. I thought of those September massacres,
74. Divided from me by one little month,
75. Saw them and touched: the rest was conjured up
76. From tragic fictions or true history,
77. Remembrances and dim admonishments.
78. The horse is taught his manage, and no star
79. Of wildest course but treads back his own steps;
80. For the spent hurricane the air provides
81. As fierce a successor; the tide retreats
82. But to return out of its hiding-place
83. In the great deep; all things have second birth;
84. The earthquake is not satisfied at once;
85. And in this way I wrought upon myself,
86. Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried,
87. To the whole city, 'Sleep no more.' The trance
88. Fled with the voice to which it had given birth;
89. But vainly comments of a calmer mind
90. Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness.
91. The place, all hushed and silent as it was,
92. Appeared unfit for the repose of night,
93. Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam.

94. With early morning towards the Palace-walk
95. Of Orleans eagerly I turned: as yet
96. The streets were still; not so those long Arcades;
97. There, 'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries,
98. That greeted me on entering, I could hear
99. Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng,
100. Bawling, 'Denunciation of the Crimes
101. Of Maximilian Robespierre;' the hand,
102. Prompt as the voice, held forth a printed speech,
103. The same that had been recently pronounced,
104. When Robespierre, not ignorant for what mark
105. Some words of indirect reproof had been
106. Intended, rose in hardihood, and dared
107. The man who had an ill surmise of him
108. To bring his charge in openness; whereat,
109. When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirred,
110. In silence of all present, from his seat
111. Louvet walked single through the avenue,
112. And took his station in the Tribune, saying,
113. 'I, Robespierre, accuse thee!' Well is known
114. The inglorious issue of that charge, and how
115. He, who had launched the startling thunderbolt,
116. The one bold man, whose voice the attack had sounded,
117. Was left without a follower to discharge
118. His perilous duty, and retire lamenting
119. That Heaven's best aid is wasted upon men
120. Who to themselves are false.
121. But these are things
122. Of which I speak, only as they were storm
123. Or sunshine to my individual mind,
124. No further. Let me then relate that now--
125. In some sort seeing with my proper eyes
126. That Liberty, and Life, and Death, would soon
127. To the remotest corners of the land
128. Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled
129. The capital City; what was struggled for,
130. And by what combatants victory must be won;
131. The indecision on their part whose aim
132. Seemed best, and the straightforward path of those
133. Who in attack or in defence were strong
134. Through their impiety--my inmost soul
135. Was agitated; yea, I could almost
136. Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men,
137. By patient exercise of reason made
138. Worthy of liberty, all spirits filled
139. With zeal expanding in Truth's holy light,
140. The gift of tongues might fall, and power arrive
141. From the four quarters of the winds to do
142. For France, what without help she could not do,
143. A work of honour; think not that to this
144. I added, work of safety: from all doubt
145. Or trepidation for the end of things
146. Far was I, far as angels are from guilt.

147. Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thought
148. Of opposition and of remedies:
149. An insignificant stranger and obscure,
150. And one, moreover, little graced with power
151. Of eloquence even in my native speech,
152. And all unfit for tumult or intrigue,
153. Yet would I at this time with willing heart
154. Have undertaken for a cause so great
155. Service however dangerous. I revolved,
156. How much the destiny of Man had still
157. Hung upon single persons; that there was,
158. Transcendent to all local patrimony,
159. One nature, as there is one sun in heaven;
160. That objects, even as they are great, thereby
161. Do come within the reach of humblest eyes;
162. That Man is only weak through his mistrust
163. And want of hope where evidence divine
164. Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure;
165. Nor did the inexperience of my youth
166. Preclude conviction, that a spirit strong
167. In hope, and trained to noble aspirations,
168. A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself,
169. Is for Society's unreasoning herd
170. A domineering instinct, serves at once
171. For way and guide, a fluent receptacle
172. That gathers up each petty straggling rill
173. And vein of water, glad to be rolled on
174. In safe obedience; that a mind, whose rest
175. Is where it ought to be, in self-restraint,
176. In circumspection and simplicity,
177. Falls rarely in entire discomfiture
178. Below its aim, or meets with, from without,
179. A treachery that foils it or defeats;
180. And, lastly, if the means on human will,
181. Frail human will, dependent should betray
182. Him who too boldly trusted them, I felt
183. That 'mid the loud distractions of the world
184. A sovereign voice subsists within the soul,
185. Arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong,
186. Of life and death, in majesty severe
187. Enjoining, as may best promote the aims
188. Of truth and justice, either sacrifice,
189. From whatsoever region of our cares
190. Or our infirm affections Nature pleads,
191. Earnest and blind, against the stern decree.

192. On the other side, I called to mind those truths
193. That are the commonplaces of the schools--
194. (A theme for boys, too hackneyed for their sires,)
195. Yet, with a revelation's liveliness,
196. In all their comprehensive bearings known
197. And visible to philosophers of old,
198. Men who, to business of the world untrained,
199. Lived in the shade; and to Harmodius known
200. And his compeer Aristogiton, known
201. To Brutus--that tyrannic power is weak,
202. Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor love,
203. Nor the support of good or evil men
204. To trust in; that the godhead which is ours
205. Can never utterly be charmed or stilled;
206. That nothing hath a natural right to last
207. But equity and reason; that all else
208. Meets foes irreconcilable, and at best
209. Lives only by variety of disease.

210. Well might my wishes be intense, my thoughts
211. Strong and perturbed, not doubting at that time
212. But that the virtue of one paramount mind
213. Would have abashed those impious crests--have quelled
214. Outrage and bloody power, and--in despite
215. Of what the People long had been and were
216. Through ignorance and false teaching, sadder proof
217. Of immaturity, and--in the teeth
218. Of desperate opposition from without--
219. Have cleared a passage for just government,
220. And left a solid birthright to the State,
221. Redeemed, according to example given
222. By ancient lawgivers.
223. In this frame of mind,
224. Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity,
225. So seemed it,--now I thankfully acknowledge,
226. Forced by the gracious providence of Heaven,--
227. To England I returned, else (though assured
228. That I both was and must be of small weight,
229. No better than a landsman on the deck
230. Of a ship struggling with a hideous storm)
231. Doubtless, I should have then made common cause
232. With some who perished; haply perished too,
233. A poor mistaken and bewildered offering,--
234. Should to the breast of Nature have gone back,
235. With all my resolutions, all my hopes,
236. A Poet only to myself, to men
237. Useless, and even, beloved Friend! a soul
238. To thee unknown!
239. Twice had the trees let fall
240. Their leaves, as often Winter had put on
241. His hoary crown, since I had seen the surge
242. Beat against Albion's shore, since ear of mine
243. Had caught the accents of my native speech
244. Upon our native country's sacred ground.
245. A patriot of the world, how could I glide
246. Into communion with her sylvan shades,
247. Erewhile my tuneful haunt? It pleased me more
248. To abide in the great City, where I found
249. The general air still busy with the stir
250. Of that first memorable onset made
251. By a strong levy of humanity
252. Upon the traffickers in Negro blood;
253. Effort which, though defeated, had recalled
254. To notice old forgotten principles,
255. And through the nation spread a novel heat
256. Of virtuous feeling. For myself, I own
257. That this particular strife had wanted power
258. To rivet my affections; nor did now
259. Its unsuccessful issue much excite
260. My sorrow; for I brought with me the faith
261. That, if France prospered, good men would not long
262. Pay fruitless worship to humanity,
263. And this most rotten branch of human shame,
264. Object, so seemed it, of superfluous pains
265. Would fall together with its parent tree.
266. What, then, were my emotions, when in arms
267. Britain put forth her free-born strength in league,
268. Oh, pity and shame! with those confederate Powers!
269. Not in my single self alone I found,
270. But in the minds of all ingenuous youth,
271. Change and subversion from that hour. No shock
272. Given to my moral nature had I known
273. Down to that very moment; neither lapse
274. Nor turn of sentiment that might be named
275. A revolution, save at this one time;
276. All else was progress on the self-same path
277. On which, with a diversity of pace,
278. I had been travelling: this a stride at once
279. Into another region. As a light
280. And pliant harebell, swinging in the breeze
281. On some grey rock--its birth-place--so had I
282. Wantoned, fast rooted on the ancient tower
283. Of my beloved country, wishing not
284. A happier fortune than to wither there:
285. Now was I from that pleasant station torn
286. And tossed about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,
287. Yea, afterwards--truth most painful to record!--
288. Exulted, in the triumph of my soul,
289. When Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown,
290. Left without glory on the field, or driven,
291. Brave hearts! to shameful flight. It was a grief,--
292. Grief call it not, 'twas anything but that,--
293. A conflict of sensations without name,
294. Of which 'he' only, who may love the sight
295. Of a village steeple, as I do, can judge,
296. When, in the congregation bending all
297. To their great Father, prayers were offered up,
298. Or praises for our country's victories;
299. And, 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance
300. I only, like an uninvited guest
301. Whom no one owned, sate silent, shall I add,
302. Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come.

303. Oh! much have they to account for, who could tear,
304. By violence, at one decisive rent,
305. From the best youth in England their dear pride,
306. Their joy, in England; this, too, at a time
307. In which worst losses easily might wean
308. The best of names, when patriotic love
309. Did of itself in modesty give way,
310. Like the Precursor when the Deity
311. Is come Whose harbinger he was; a time
312. In which apostasy from ancient faith
313. Seemed but conversion to a higher creed;
314. Withal a season dangerous and wild,
315. A time when sage Experience would have snatched
316. Flowers out of any hedge-row to compose
317. A chaplet in contempt of his grey locks.

318. When the proud fleet that bears the red-cross flag
319. In that unworthy service was prepared
320. To mingle, I beheld the vessels lie,
321. A brood of gallant creatures, on the deep;
322. I saw them in their rest, a sojourner
323. Through a whole month of calm and glassy days
324. In that delightful island which protects
325. Their place of convocation--there I heard,
326. Each evening, pacing by the still sea-shore,
327. A monitory sound that never failed,--
328. The sunset cannon. While the orb went down
329. In the tranquillity of nature, came
330. That voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me
331. Without a spirit overcast by dark
332. Imaginations, sense of woes to come,
333. Sorrow for human kind, and pain of heart.

334. In France, the men, who, for their desperate ends,
335. Had plucked up mercy by the roots, were glad
336. Of this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before
337. In wicked pleas, were strong as demons now;
338. And thus, on every side beset with foes,
339. The goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of few
340. Spread into madness of the many; blasts
341. From hell came sanctified like airs from heaven.
342. The sternness of the just, the faith of those
343. Who doubted not that Providence had times
344. Of vengeful retribution, theirs who throned
345. The human Understanding paramount
346. And made of that their God, the hopes of men
347. Who were content to barter short-lived pangs
348. For a paradise of ages, the blind rage
349. Of insolent tempers, the light vanity
350. Of intermeddlers, steady purposes
351. Of the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet,
352. And all the accidents of life--were pressed
353. Into one service, busy with one work.
354. The Senate stood aghast, her prudence quenched,
355. Her wisdom stifled, and her justice scared,
356. Her frenzy only active to extol
357. Past outrages, and shape the way for new,
358. Which no one dared to oppose or mitigate.

359. Domestic carnage now filled the whole year
360. With feast-days; old men from the chimney-nook,
361. The maiden from the bosom of her love,
362. The mother from the cradle of her babe,
363. The warrior from the field--all perished, all--
364. Friends, enemies, of all parties, ages, ranks,
365. Head after head, and never heads enough
366. For those that bade them fall. They found their joy,
367. They made it proudly, eager as a child,
368. (If like desires of innocent little ones
369. May with such heinous appetites be compared),
370. Pleased in some open field to exercise
371. A toy that mimics with revolving wings
372. The motion of a wind-mill; though the air
373. Do of itself blow fresh, and make the vanes
374. Spin in his eyesight, 'that' contents him not,
375. But with the plaything at arm's length, he sets
376. His front against the blast, and runs amain,
377. That it may whirl the faster.
378. Amid the depth
379. Of those enormities, even thinking minds
380. Forgot, at seasons, whence they had their being
381. Forgot that such a sound was ever heard
382. As Liberty upon earth: yet all beneath
383. Her innocent authority was wrought,
384. Nor could have been, without her blessed name.
385. The illustrious wife of Roland, in the hour
386. Of her composure, felt that agony,
387. And gave it vent in her last words. O Friend!
388. It was a lamentable time for man,
389. Whether a hope had e'er been his or not:
390. A woful time for them whose hopes survived
391. The shock; most woful for those few who still
392. Were flattered, and had trust in human kind:
393. They had the deepest feeling of the grief.
394. Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved:
395. The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms,
396. And throttled with an infant godhead's might
397. The snakes about her cradle; that was well,
398. And as it should be; yet no cure for them
399. Whose souls were sick with pain of what would be
400. Hereafter brought in charge against mankind.
401. Most melancholy at that time, O Friend!
402. Were my day-thoughts,--my nights were miserable;
403. Through months, through years, long after the last beat
404. Of those atrocities, the hour of sleep
405. To me came rarely charged with natural gifts,
406. Such ghastly visions had I of despair
407. And tyranny, and implements of death;
408. And innocent victims sinking under fear,
409. And momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,
410. Each in his separate cell, or penned in crowds
411. For sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirth
412. And levity in dungeons, where the dust
413. Was laid with tears. Then suddenly the scene
414. Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me
415. In long orations, which I strove to plead
416. Before unjust tribunals,--with a voice
417. Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense,
418. Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt
419. In the last place of refuge--my own soul.

420. When I began in youth's delightful prime
421. To yield myself to Nature, when that strong
422. And holy passion overcame me first,
423. Nor day nor night, evening or morn, was free
424. From its oppression. But, O Power Supreme!
425. Without Whose call this world would cease to breathe
426. Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill
427. The veins that branch through every frame of life,
428. Making man what he is, creature divine,
429. In single or in social eminence,
430. Above the rest raised infinite ascents
431. When reason that enables him to be
432. Is not sequestered--what a change is here!
433. How different ritual for this after-worship,
434. What countenance to promote this second love!
435. The first was service paid to things which lie
436. Guarded within the bosom of Thy will.
437. Therefore to serve was high beatitude;
438. Tumult was therefore gladness, and the fear
439. Ennobling, venerable; sleep secure,
440. And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams.

441. But as the ancient Prophets, borne aloft
442. In vision, yet constrained by natural laws
443. With them to take a troubled human heart,
444. Wanted not consolations, nor a creed
445. Of reconcilement, then when they denounced,
446. On towns and cities, wallowing in the abyss
447. Of their offences, punishment to come;
448. Or saw, like other men, with bodily eyes,
449. Before them, in some desolated place,
450. The wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled;
451. So, with devout humility be it said,
452. So, did a portion of that spirit fall
453. On me uplifted from the vantage-ground
454. Of pity and sorrow to a state of being
455. That through the time's exceeding fierceness saw
456. Glimpses of retribution, terrible,
457. And in the order of sublime behests:
458. But, even if that were not, amid the awe
459. Of unintelligible chastisement,
460. Not only acquiescences of faith
461. Survived, but daring sympathies with power,
462. Motions not treacherous or profane, else why
463. Within the folds of no ungentle breast
464. Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged?
465. Wild blasts of music thus could find their way
466. Into the midst of turbulent events;
467. So that worst tempests might be listened to.
468. Then was the truth received into my heart,
469. That, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring,
470. If from the affliction somewhere do not grow
471. Honour which could not else have been, a faith,
472. An elevation, and a sanctity,
473. If new strength be not given nor old restored,
474. The blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt
475. Was taken up by scoffers in their pride,
476. Saying, 'Behold the harvest that we reap
477. From popular government and equality,'
478. I clearly saw that neither these nor aught
479. Of wild belief engrafted on their names
480. By false philosophy had caused the woe,
481. But a terrific reservoir of guilt
482. And ignorance filled up from age to age,
483. That could no longer hold its loathsome charge,
484. But burst and spread in deluge through the land.

485. And as the desert hath green spots, the sea
486. Small islands scattered amid stormy waves,
487. So 'that' disastrous period did not want
488. Bright sprinklings of all human excellence,
489. To which the silver wands of saints in Heaven
490. Might point with rapturous joy. Yet not the less,
491. For those examples, in no age surpassed,
492. Of fortitude and energy and love,
493. And human nature faithful to herself
494. Under worst trials, was I driven to think
495. Of the glad times when first I traversed France
496. A youthful pilgrim; above all reviewed
497. That eventide, when under windows bright
498. With happy faces and with garlands hung,
499. And through a rainbow-arch that spanned the street,
500. Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed,
501. I paced, a dear companion at my side,
502. The town of Arras, whence with promise high
503. Issued, on delegation to sustain
504. Humanity and right, 'that' Robespierre,
505. He who thereafter, and in how short time!
506. Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew.
507. When the calamity spread far and wide--
508. And this same city, that did then appear
509. To outrun the rest in exultation, groaned
510. Under the vengeance of her cruel son,
511. As Lear reproached the winds--I could almost
512. Have quarrelled with that blameless spectacle
513. For lingering yet an image in my mind
514. To mock me under such a strange reverse.

515. O Friend! few happier moments have been mine
516. Than that which told the downfall of this Tribe
517. So dreaded, so abhorred. The day deserves
518. A separate record. Over the smooth sands
519. Of Leven's ample estuary lay
520. My journey, and beneath a genial sun,
521. With distant prospect among gleams of sky
522. And clouds and intermingling mountain tops,
523. In one inseparable glory clad,
524. Creatures of one ethereal substance met
525. In consistory, like a diadem
526. Or crown of burning seraphs as they sit
527. In the empyrean. Underneath that pomp
528. Celestial, lay unseen the pastoral vales
529. Among whose happy fields I had grown up
530. From childhood. On the fulgent spectacle,
531. That neither passed away nor changed, I gazed
532. Enrapt; but brightest things are wont to draw
533. Sad opposites out of the inner heart,
534. As even their pensive influence drew from mine.
535. How could it otherwise? for not in vain
536. That very morning had I turned aside
537. To seek the ground where, 'mid a throng of graves,
538. An honoured teacher of my youth was laid,
539. And on the stone were graven by his desire
540. Lines from the churchyard elegy of Gray.
541. This faithful guide, speaking from his deathbed,
542. Added no farewell to his parting counsel,
543. But said to me, 'My head will soon lie low;'
544. And when I saw the turf that covered him,
545. After the lapse of full eight years, those words,
546. With sound of voice and countenance of the Man,
547. Came back upon me, so that some few tears
548. Fell from me in my own despite. But now
549. I thought, still traversing that widespread plain,
550. With tender pleasure of the verses graven
551. Upon his tombstone, whispering to myself:
552. He loved the Poets, and, if now alive,
553. Would have loved me, as one not destitute
554. Of promise, nor belying the kind hope
555. That he had formed, when I, at his command,
556. Began to spin, with toil, my earliest songs.

557. As I advanced, all that I saw or felt
558. Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small
559. And rocky island near, a fragment stood,
560. (Itself like a sea rock) the low remains
561. (With shells encrusted, dark with briny weeds)
562. Of a dilapidated structure, once
563. A Romish chapel, where the vested priest
564. Said matins at the hour that suited those
565. Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.
566. Not far from that still ruin all the plain
567. Lay spotted with a variegated crowd
568. Of vehicles and travellers, horse and foot,
569. Wading beneath the conduct of their guide
570. In loose procession through the shallow stream
571. Of inland waters; the great sea meanwhile
572. Heaved at safe distance, far retired. I paused,
573. Longing for skill to paint a scene so bright
574. And cheerful, but the foremost of the band
575. As he approached, no salutation given
576. In the familiar language of the day,
577. Cried, 'Robespierre is dead!' nor was a doubt,
578. After strict question, left within my mind
579. That he and his supporters all were fallen.

580. Great was my transport, deep my gratitude
581. To everlasting Justice, by this fiat
582. Made manifest. 'Come now, ye golden times,'
583. Said I forth-pouring on those open sands
584. A hymn of triumph: 'as the morning comes
585. From out the bosom of the night, come ye:
586. Thus far our trust is verified; behold!
587. They who with clumsy desperation brought
588. A river of Blood, and preached that nothing else
589. Could cleanse the Augean stable, by the might
590. Of their own helper have been swept away;
591. Their madness stands declared and visible;
592. Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and earth
593. March firmly towards righteousness and peace.'--
594. Then schemes I framed more calmly, when and how
595. The madding factions might be tranquillised,
596. And how through hardships manifold and long
597. The glorious renovation would proceed.
598. Thus interrupted by uneasy bursts
599. Of exultation, I pursued my way
600. Along that very shore which I had skimmed
601. In former days, when--spurring from the Vale
602. Of Nightshade, and St. Mary's mouldering fane,
603. And the stone abbot, after circuit made
604. In wantonness of heart, a joyous band
605. Of schoolboys hastening to their distant home
606. Along the margin of the moonlight sea--
607. We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.
