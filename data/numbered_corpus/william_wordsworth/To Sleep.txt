1. FOND words have oft been spoken to thee, Sleep!
2. And thou hast had thy store of tenderest names;
3. The very sweetest, Fancy culls or frames,
4. When thankfulness of heart is strong and deep!
5. Dear Bosom-child we call thee, that dost steep
6. In rich reward all suffering; Balm that tames
7. All anguish; Saint that evil thoughts and aims
8. Takest away, and into souls dost creep,
9. Like to a breeze from heaven. Shall I alone,
10. I surely not a man ungently made,
11. Call thee worst Tyrant by which Flesh is crost?
12. Perverse, self-willed to own and to disown,
13. Mere slave of them who never for thee prayed,
14. Still last to come where thou art wanted most!
