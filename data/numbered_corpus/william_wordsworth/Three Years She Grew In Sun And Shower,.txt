1. Three years she grew in sun and shower,
2. Then Nature said, "A lovelier flower
3. On earth was never sown;
4. This Child I to myself will take;
5. She shall be mine, and I will make
6. A Lady of my own.

7. "Myself will to my darling be
8. Both law and impulse: and with me
9. The Girl, in rock and plain
10. In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,
11. Shall feel an overseeing power
12. To kindle or restrain.

13. "She shall be sportive as the fawn
14. That wild with glee across the lawn
15. Or up the mountain springs;
16. And her's shall be the breathing balm,
17. And her's the silence and the calm
18. Of mute insensate things.

19. "The floating clouds their state shall lend
20. To her; for her the willow bend;
21. Nor shall she fail to see
22. Even in the motions of the Storm
23. Grace that shall mold the Maiden's form
24. By silent sympathy.

25. "The stars of midnight shall be dear
26. To her; and she shall lean her ear
27. In many a secret place
28. Where rivulets dance their wayward round,
29. And beauty born of murmuring sound
30. Shall pass into her face.

31. "And vital feelings of delight
32. Shall rear her form to stately height,
33. Her virgin bosom swell;
34. Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
35. While she and I together live
36. Here in this happy dell."

37. Thus Nature spake---The work was done---
38. How soon my Lucy's race was run!
39. She died, and left to me
40. This heath, this calm, and quiet scene;
41. The memory of what has been,
42. And never more will be.
