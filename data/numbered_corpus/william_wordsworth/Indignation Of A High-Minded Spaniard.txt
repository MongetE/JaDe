1. WE can endure that He should waste our lands,
2. Despoil our temples, and by sword and flame
3. Return us to the dust from which we came;
4. Such food a Tyrant's appetite demands:
5. And we can brook the thought that by his hands
6. Spain may be overpowered, and he possess,
7. For his delight, a solemn wilderness
8. Where all the brave lie dead. But, when of bands
9. Which he will break for us he dares to speak,
10. Of benefits, and of a future day
11. When our enlightened minds shall bless his sway;
12. 'Then', the strained heart of fortitude proves weak;
13. Our groans, our blushes, our pale cheeks declare
14. That he has power to inflict what we lack strength to bear.
