1. IN youth from rock to rock I went
2. From hill to hill in discontent
3. Of pleasure high and turbulent,
4. Most pleased when most uneasy;
5. But now my own delights I make,---
6. Thirst at every rill can slake,
7. And gladly Nature's love partake,
8. Of Thee, sweet Daisy!

9. Thee Winter in the garland wears
10. That thinly decks his few gray hairs;
11. Spring parts the clouds with softest airs,
12. That she may sun thee;
13. Whole Summer-fields are thine by right;
14. And Autumn, melancholy Wight!
15. Doth in thy crimson head delight
16. When rains are on thee.

17. In shoals and bands, a morrice train,
18. Thou greet'st the traveller in the lane;
19. Pleased at his greeting thee again;
20. Yet nothing daunted,
21. Nor grieved if thou be set at nought:
22. And oft alone in nooks remote
23. We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,
24. When such are wanted.

25. Be violets in their secret mews
26. The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose;
27. Proud be the rose, with rains and dew
28. Her head impearling,
29. Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,
30. Yet hast not gone without thy fame;
31. Thou art indeed by many a claim
32. The Poet's darling.

33. If to a rock from rain he fly,
34. Or, some bright day of April sky,
35. Imprisoned by hot sunshine lie
36. Near the green holly,
37. And wearily at length should fare;
38. He need but look about, and there
39. Thou art!---a friend at hand, to care
40. His melancholy.

41. A hundred times, by rock or bower,
42. Ere thus I have lain couched an hour,
43. Have I derived from thy sweet power
44. Some apprehension
45. Some steady love; some brief delight;
46. Some memory that had taken flight;
47. Some chime of fancy wrong or right;
48. Of stray invention.

49. If stately passions in me burn,
50. And one chance look to Thee should turn,
51. I drink out of an humbler urn
52. A lowlier pleasure;
53. The homely sympathy that heeds
54. The common life, our nature breeds;
55. A wisdom fitted to the needs
56. Of hearts at leisure.

57. Fresh-smitten by the morning ray,
58. When thou art up, alert and gay,
59. Then, cheerful Flower! my spirits play
60. With kindred gladness:
61. And when, at dusk, by dews opprest
62. Thou sink'st, the image of thy rest
63. Hath often eased my pensive breast
64. Of careful sadness.

65. And all day long I number yet,
66. All seasons through, another debt,
67. Which I, wherever thou art met,
68. To thee am owing;
69. An instinct call it, a blind sense;
70. A happy, genial influence,
71. Coming one knows not how, nor whence,
72. Nor whither going.

73. Child of the Year! that round dost run
74. Thy pleasant course,---when day's begun
75. As ready to salute the sun
76. As lark or leveret,
77. Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain;
78. Nor be less dear to future men
79. Than in old time;---thou not in vain
80. Art Nature's favourite.
