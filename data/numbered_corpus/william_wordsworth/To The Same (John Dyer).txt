1. ENOUGH of climbing toil!--Ambition treads
2. Here, as 'mid busier scenes, ground steep and rough,
3. Or slippery even to peril! and each step,
4. As we for most uncertain recompence
5. Mount toward the empire of the fickle clouds,
6. Each weary step, dwarfing the world below,
7. Induces, for its old familiar sights,
8. Unacceptable feelings of contempt,
9. With wonder mixed--that Man could e'er be tied,
10. In anxious bondage, to such nice array
11. And formal fellowship of petty things!
12. --Oh! 'tis the 'heart' that magnifies this life,
13. Making a truth and beauty of her own;
14. And moss-grown alleys, circumscribing shades,
15. And gurgling rills, assist her in the work
16. More efficaciously than realms outspread,
17. As in a map, before the adventurer's gaze--
18. Ocean and Earth contending for regard.
19. The umbrageous woods are left--how far beneath!
20. But lo! where darkness seems to guard the mouth
21. Of yon wild cave, whose jagged brows are fringed
22. With flaccid threads of ivy, in the still
23. And sultry air, depending motionless.
24. Yet cool the space within, and not uncheered
25. (As whoso enters shall ere long perceive)
26. By stealthy influx of the timid day
27. Mingling with night, such twilight to compose
28. As Numa loved; when, in the Egerian grot,
29. From the sage Nymph appearing at his wish,
30. He gained whate'er a regal mind might ask,
31. Or need, of counsel breathed through lips divine.
32. Long as the heat shall rage, let that dim cave
33. Protect us, there deciphering as we may
34. Diluvian records; or the sighs of Earth
35. Interpreting; or counting for old Time
36. His minutes, by reiterated drops,
37. Audible tears, from some invisible source
38. That deepens upon fancy--more and more
39. Drawn toward the centre whence those sighs creep forth
40. To awe the lightness of humanity:
41. Or, shutting up thyself within thyself,
42. There let me see thee sink into a mood
43. Of gentler thought, protracted till thine eye
44. Be calm as water when the winds are gone,
45. And no one can tell whither. Dearest Friend!
46. We two have known such happy hours together
47. That, were power granted to replace them (fetched
48. From out the pensive shadows where they lie)
49. In the first warmth of their original sunshine,
50. Loth should I be to use it: passing sweet
51. Are the domains of tender memory!
