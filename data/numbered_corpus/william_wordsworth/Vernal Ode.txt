1. I

2. BENEATH the concave of an April sky,
3. When all the fields with freshest green were dight,
4. Appeared, in presence of the spiritual eye
5. That aids or supersedes our grosser sight,
6. The form and rich habiliments of One
7. Whose countenance bore resemblance to the sun,
8. When it reveals, in evening majesty,
9. Features half lost amid their own pure light.
10. Poised like a weary cloud, in middle air
11. He hung,--then floated with angelic ease
12. (Softening that bright effulgence by degrees)
13. Till he had reached a summit sharp and bare,
14. Where oft the venturous heifer drinks the noontide breeze.
15. Upon the apex of that lofty cone
16. Alighted, there the Stranger stood alone;
17. Fair as a gorgeous Fabric of the east
18. Suddenly raised by some enchanter's power,
19. Where nothing was; and firm as some old Tower
20. Of Britain's realm, whose leafy crest
21. Waves high, embellished by a gleaming shower!

22. II

23. Beneath the shadow of his purple wings
24. Rested a golden harp;--he touched the strings;
25. And, after prelude of unearthly sound
26. Poured through the echoing hills around,
27. He sang--
28. 'No wintry desolations,
29. Scorching blight or noxious dew,
30. Affect my native habitations;
31. Buried in glory, far beyond the scope
32. Of man's inquiring gaze, but to his hope
33. Imaged, though faintly, in the hue
34. Profound of night's ethereal blue;
35. And in the aspect of each radiant orb;--
36. Some fixed, some wandering with no timid curb:
37. But wandering star and fixed, to mortal eye,
38. Blended in absolute serenity,
39. And free from semblance of decline;--
40. Fresh as if Evening brought their natal hour,
41. Her darkness splendour gave, her silence power
42. To testify of Love and Grace divine.

43. III

44. 'What if those bright fires
45. Shine subject to decay,
46. Sons haply of extinguished sires,
47. Themselves to lose their light, or pass away
48. Like clouds before the wind,
49. Be thanks poured out to Him whose hand bestows,
50. Nightly, on human kind
51. That vision of endurance and repose.
52. --And though to every draught of vital breath
53. Renewed throughout the bounds of earth or ocean,
54. The melancholy gates of Death
55. Respond with sympathetic motion;
56. Though all that feeds on nether air,
57. Howe'er magnificent or fair,
58. Grows but to perish, and entrust
59. Its ruins to their kindred dust;
60. Yet, by the Almighty's ever-during care,
61. Her procreant vigils Nature keeps
62. Amid the unfathomable deeps;
63. And saves the peopled fields of earth
64. From dread of emptiness or dearth.
65. Thus, in their stations, lifting tow'rd the sky
66. The foliaged head in cloud-like majesty,
67. The shadow-casting race of trees survive:
68. Thus, in the train of Spring, arrive
69. Sweet flowers;--what living eye hath viewed
70. Their myriads?--endlessly renewed,
71. Wherever strikes the sun's glad ray;
72. Where'er the subtle waters stray;
73. Wherever sportive breezes bend
74. Their course, or genial showers descend!
75. Mortals, rejoice! the very Angels quit
76. Their mansions unsusceptible of change,
77. Amid your pleasant bowers to sit,
78. And through your sweet vicissitudes to range!'

79. IV

80. Oh, nursed at happy distance from the cares
81. Of a too-anxious world, mild pastoral Muse!
82. That, to the sparkling crown Urania wears,
83. And to her sister Clio's laurel wreath,
84. Prefer'st a garland culled from purple heath,
85. Or blooming thicket moist with morning dews;
86. Was such bright Spectacle vouchsafed to me?
87. And was it granted to the simple ear
88. Of thy contented Votary
89. Such melody to hear!
90. 'Him' rather suits it, side by side with thee,
91. Wrapped in a fit of pleasing indolence,
92. While thy tired lute hangs on the hawthorn-tree,
93. To lie and listen--till o'er-drowsed sense
94. Sinks, hardly conscious of the influence--
95. To the soft murmur of the vagrant Bee.
96. --A slender sound! yet hoary Time
97. Doth to the 'Soul' exalt it with the chime
98. Of all his years;--a company
99. Of ages coming, ages gone;
100. (Nations from before them sweeping,
101. Regions in destruction steeping,)
102. But every awful note in unison
103. With that faint utterance, which tells
104. Of treasure sucked from buds and bells,
105. For the pure keeping of those waxen cells;
106. Where She--a statist prudent to confer
107. Upon the common weal; a warrior bold,
108. Radiant all over with unburnished gold,
109. And armed with living spear for mortal fight;
110. A cunning forager
111. That spreads no waste; a social builder; one
112. In whom all busy offices unite
113. With all fine functions that afford delight--
114. Safe through the winter storm in quiet dwells!

115. V

116. And is She brought within the power
117. Of vision?--o'er this tempting flower
118. Hovering until the petals stay
119. Her flight, and take its voice away!--
120. Observe each wing!--a tiny van!
121. The structure of her laden thigh,
122. How fragile! yet of ancestry
123. Mysteriously remote and high;
124. High as the imperial front of man;
125. The roseate bloom on woman's cheek;
126. The soaring eagle's curved beak;
127. The white plumes of the floating swan;
128. Old as the tiger's paw, the lion's mane
129. Ere shaken by that mood of stern disdain
130. At which the desert trembles.--Humming Bee!
131. Thy sting was needless then, perchance unknown,
132. The seeds of malice were not sown;
133. All creatures met in peace, from fierceness free,
134. And no pride blended with their dignity.
135. --Tears had not broken from their source;
136. Nor Anguish strayed from her Tartarean den;
137. The golden years maintained a course
138. Not undiversified though smooth and even;
139. We were not mocked with glimpse and shadow then,
140. Bright Seraphs mixed familiarly with men;
141. And earth and stars composed a universal heaven!
