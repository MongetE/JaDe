1. I

2. 'REST, rest, perturbed Earth!
3. O rest, thou doleful Mother of Mankind!'
4. A Spirit sang in tones more plaintive than the wind:
5. 'From regions where no evil thing has birth
6. I come--thy stains to wash away,
7. Thy cherished fetters to unbind,
8. And open thy sad eyes upon a milder day.
9. The Heavens are thronged with martyrs that have risen
10. From out thy noisome prison;
11. The penal caverns groan
12. With tens of thousands rent from off the tree
13. Of hopeful life,--by battle's whirlwind blown
14. Into the deserts of Eternity.
15. Unpitied havoc! Victims unlamented!
16. But not on high, where madness is resented,
17. And murder causes some sad tears to flow,
18. Though, from the widely-sweeping blow,
19. The choirs of Angels spread, triumphantly augmented.

20. II

21. 'False Parent of Mankind!
22. Obdurate, proud, and blind,
23. I sprinkle thee with soft celestial dews,
24. Thy lost, maternal heart to re-infuse!
25. Scattering this far-fetched moisture from my wings,
26. Upon the act a blessing I implore,
27. Of which the rivers in their secret springs,
28. The rivers stained so oft with human gore,
29. Are conscious;--may the like return no more!
30. May Discord--for a Seraph's care
31. Shall be attended with a bolder prayer--
32. May she, who once disturbed the seats of bliss
33. These mortal spheres above,
34. Be chained for ever to the black abyss.
35. And thou, O rescued Earth, by peace and love,
36. And merciful desires, thy sanctity approve!'
37. The Spirit ended his mysterious rite,
38. And the pure vision closed in darkness infinite.
