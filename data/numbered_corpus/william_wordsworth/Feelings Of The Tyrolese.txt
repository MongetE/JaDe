1. THE Land we from our fathers had in trust,
2. And to our children will transmit, or die:
3. This is our maxim, this our piety;
4. And God and Nature say that it is just.
5. That which we 'would' perform in arms--we must!
6. We read the dictate in the infant's eye;
7. In the wife's smile; and in the placid sky;
8. And, at our feet, amid the silent dust
9. Of them that were before us.--Sing aloud
10. Old songs, the precious music of the heart!
11. Give, herds and flocks, your voices to the wind!
12. While we go forth, a self-devoted crowd,
13. With weapons grasped in fearless hands, to assert
14. Our virtue, and to vindicate mankind.
