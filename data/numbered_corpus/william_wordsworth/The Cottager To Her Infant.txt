1. THE days are cold, the nights are long,
2. The north-wind sings a doleful song;
3. Then hush again upon my breast;
4. All merry things are now at rest,
5. Save thee, my pretty Love!

6. The kitten sleeps upon the hearth,
7. The crickets long have ceased their mirth;
8. There's nothing stirring in the house
9. Save one 'wee', hungry, nibbling mouse,
10. Then why so busy thou?

11. Nay! start not at that sparkling light;
12. 'Tis but the moon that shines so bright
13. On the window pane bedropped with rain:
14. Then, little Darling! sleep again,
15. And wake when it is day.
