1. WHEN, to the attractions of the busy world,
2. Preferring studious leisure, I had chosen
3. A habitation in this peaceful Vale,
4. Sharp season followed of continual storm
5. In deepest winter; and, from week to week,
6. Pathway, and lane, and public road, were clogged
7. With frequent showers of snow. Upon a hill
8. At a short distance from my cottage, stands
9. A stately Fir-grove, whither I was wont
10. To hasten, for I found, beneath the roof
11. Of that perennial shade, a cloistral place
12. Of refuge, with an unincumbered floor.
13. Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow,
14. And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth,
15. The redbreast near me hopped; nor was I loth
16. To sympathise with vulgar coppice birds
17. That, for protection from the nipping blast,
18. Hither repaired.--A single beech-tree grew
19. Within this grove of firs! and, on the fork
20. Of that one beech, appeared a thrush's nest;
21. A last year's nest, conspicuously built
22. At such small elevation from the ground
23. As gave sure sign that they, who in that house
24. Of nature and of love had made their home
25. Amid the fir-trees, all the summer long
26. Dwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes,
27. A few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock,
28. Would watch my motions with suspicious stare,
29. From the remotest outskirts of the grove,--
30. Some nook where they had made their final stand,
31. Huddling together from two fears--the fear
32. Of me and of the storm. Full many an hour
33. Here did I lose. But in this grove the trees
34. Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven
35. In such perplexed and intricate array;
36. That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems
37. A length of open space, where to and fro
38. My feet might move without concern or care;
39. And, baffled thus, though earth from day to day
40. Was fettered, and the air by storm disturbed,
41. I ceased the shelter to frequent,--and prized,
42. Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess.
43. The snows dissolved, and genial Spring returned
44. To clothe the fields with verdure. Other haunts
45. Meanwhile were mine; till, one bright April day,
46. By chance retiring from the glare of noon
47. To this forsaken covert, there I found
48. A hoary pathway traced between the trees,
49. And winding on with such an easy line
50. Along a natural opening, that I stood
51. Much wondering how I could have sought in vain
52. For what was now so obvious. To abide,
53. For an allotted interval of ease,
54. Under my cottage-roof, had gladly come
55. From the wild sea a cherished Visitant;
56. And with the sight of this same path--begun,
57. Begun and ended, in the shady grove,
58. Pleasant conviction flashed upon my mind
59. That, to this opportune recess allured,
60. He had surveyed it with a finer eye,
61. A heart more wakeful; and had worn the track
62. By pacing here, unwearied and alone,
63. In that habitual restlessness of foot
64. That haunts the Sailor measuring o'er and o'er
65. His short domain upon the vessel's deck,
66. While she pursues her course through the dreary sea.
67. When thou hadst quitted Esthwaite's pleasant shore,
68. And taken thy first leave of those green hills
69. And rocks that were the play-ground of thy youth,
70. Year followed year, my Brother! and we two,
71. Conversing not, knew little in what mould
72. Each other's mind was fashioned; and at length,
73. When once again we met in Grasmere Vale,
74. Between us there was little other bond
75. Than common feelings of fraternal love.
76. But thou, a Schoolboy, to the sea hadst carried
77. Undying recollections! Nature there
78. Was with thee; she, who loved us both, she still
79. Was with thee; and even so didst thou become
80. A 'silent' Poet; from the solitude
81. Of the vast sea didst bring a watchful heart
82. Still couchant, an inevitable ear,
83. And an eye practised like a blind man's touch.
84. --Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone;
85. Nor from this vestige of thy musing hours
86. Could I withhold thy honoured name,--and now
87. I love the fir-grove with a perfect love.
88. Thither do I withdraw when cloudless suns
89. Shine hot, or wind blows troublesome and strong;
90. And there I sit at evening, when the steep
91. Of Silver-how, and Grasmere's peaceful lake,
92. And one green island, gleam between the stems
93. Of the dark firs, a visionary scene!
94. And, while I gaze upon the spectacle
95. Of clouded splendour, on this dream-like sight
96. Of solemn loveliness, I think on thee,
97. My Brother, and on all which thou hast lost.
98. Nor seldom, if I rightly guess, while Thou,
99. Muttering the verses which I muttered first
100. Among the mountains, through the midnight watch
101. Art pacing thoughtfully the vessel's deck
102. In some far region, here, while o'er my head,
103. At every impulse of the moving breeze,
104. The fir-grove murmurs with a sea-like sound,
105. Alone I tread this path;--for aught I know,
106. Timing my steps to thine; and, with a store
107. Of undistinguishable sympathies,
108. Mingling most earnest wishes for the day
109. When we, and others whom we love, shall meet
110. A second time, in Grasmere's happy Vale.
