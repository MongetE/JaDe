1. O'ERWEENING Statesmen have full long relied
2. On fleets and armies, and external wealth:
3. But from 'within' proceeds a Nation's health;
4. Which shall not fail, though poor men cleave with pride
5. To the paternal floor; or turn aside,
6. In the thronged city, from the walks of gain,
7. As being all unworthy to detain
8. A Soul by contemplation sanctified.
9. There are who cannot languish in this strife,
10. Spaniards of every rank, by whom the good
11. Of such high course was felt and understood;
12. Who to their Country's cause have bound a life
13. Erewhile, by solemn consecration, given
14. To labour and to prayer, to nature, and to heaven.
