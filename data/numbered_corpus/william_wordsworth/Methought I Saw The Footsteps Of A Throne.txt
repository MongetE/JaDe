1. METHOUGHT I saw the footsteps of a throne
2. Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud--
3. Nor view of who might sit thereon allowed;
4. But all the steps and ground about were strown
5. With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone
6. Ever put on; a miserable crowd,
7. Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud,
8. 'Thou art our king, O Death! to thee we groan.'
9. Those steps I clomb; the mists before me gave
10. Smooth way; and I beheld the face of one
11. Sleeping alone within a mossy cave,
12. With her face up to heaven; that seemed to have
13. Pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone;
14. A lovely Beauty in a summer grave!
