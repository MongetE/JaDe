1. BARD of the Fleece, whose skilful genius made
2. That work a living landscape fair and bright;
3. Nor hallowed less with musical delight
4. Than those soft scenes through which thy childhood strayed,
5. Those southern tracts of Cambria, 'deep embayed,
6. With green hills fenced, with ocean's murmur lulled;'
7. Though hasty Fame hath many a chaplet culled
8. For worthless brows, while in the pensive shade
9. Of cold neglect she leaves thy head ungraced,
10. Yet pure and powerful minds, hearts meek and still,
11. A grateful few, shall love thy modest Lay,
12. Long as the shepherd's bleating flock shall stray
13. O'er naked Snowdon's wide aerial waste;
14. Long as the thrush shall pipe on Grongar Hill!
