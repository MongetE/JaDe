1. By Moscow self-devoted to a blaze
2. Of dreadful sacrifice, by Russian blood
3. Lavished in fight with desperate hardihood;
4. The unfeeling Elements no claim shall raise
5. To rob our Human-nature of just praise
6. For what she did and suffered. Pledges sure
7. Of a deliverance absolute and pure
8. She gave, if Faith might tread the beaten ways
9. Of Providence. But now did the Most High
10. Exalt his still small voice;-to quell that Host
11. Gathered his power, a manifest ally;
12. He, whose heaped waves confounded the proud boast
13. Of Pharaoh, said to Famine, Snow, and Frost,
14. Finish the strife by deadliest victory!'
