1. There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs
2. And islands of Winander!--many a time,
3. At evening, when the earliest stars began
4. To move along the edges of the hills,
5. Rising or setting, would he stand alone,
6. Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;
7. And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
8. Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
9. Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
10. Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,
11. That they might answer him.--And they would shout
12. Across the watery vale, and shout again,
13. Responsive to his call,--with quivering peals,
14. And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud
15. Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
16. Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause
17. Of silence such as baffled his best skill:
18. Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung
19. Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
20. Has carried far into his heart the voice
21. Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene
22. Would enter unawares into his mind
23. With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,
24. Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received
25. Into the bosom of the steady lake.
26. This boy was taken from his mates, and died
27. In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.
28. Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale
29. Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs
30. Upon a slope above the village-school;
31. And, through that church-yard when my way has led
32. On summer-evenings, I believe, that there
33. A long half-hour together I have stood
34. Mute--looking at the grave in which he lies!
