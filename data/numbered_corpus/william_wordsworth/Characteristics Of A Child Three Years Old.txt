1. LOVING she is, and tractable, though wild;
2. And Innocence hath privilege in her
3. To dignify arch looks and laughing eyes;
4. And feats of cunning; and the pretty round
5. Of trespasses, affected to provoke
6. Mock-chastisement and partnership in play.
7. And, as a faggot sparkles on the hearth,
8. Not less if unattended and alone
9. Than when both young and old sit gathered round
10. And take delight in its activity;
11. Even so this happy Creature of herself
12. Is all-sufficient, solitude to her
13. Is blithe society, who fills the air
14. With gladness and involuntary songs.
15. Light are her sallies as the tripping fawn's
16. Forth-startled from the fern where she lay couched;
17. Unthought-of, unexpected, as the stir
18. Of the soft breeze ruffling the meadow-flowers,
19. Or from before it chasing wantonly
20. The many-coloured images imprest
21. Upon the bosom of a placid lake.
