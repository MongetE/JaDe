1. HUNGER, and sultry heat, and nipping blast
2. From bleak hill-top, and length of march by night
3. Through heavy swamp, or over snow-clad height--
4. These hardships ill-sustained, these dangers past,
5. The roving Spanish Bands are reached at last,
6. Charged, and dispersed like foam: but as a flight
7. Of scattered quails by signs do reunite,
8. So these,--and, heard of once again, are chased
9. With combinations of long-practised art
10. And newly-kindled hope; but they are fled--
11. Gone are they, viewless as the buried dead:
12. Where now?--Their sword is at the Foeman's heart;
13. And thus from year to year his walk they thwart,
14. And hang like dreams around his guilty bed.
