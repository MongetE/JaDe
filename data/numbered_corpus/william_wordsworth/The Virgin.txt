1. .   Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost
2. With the least shade of thought to sin allied.
3. Woman! above all women glorified,
4. Our tainted nature's solitary boast;
5. Purer than foam on central ocean tost;
6. Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn
7. With fancied roses, than the unblemished moon
8. Before her wane begins on heaven's blue coast;
9. Thy image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,
10. Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,
11. As to a visible Power, in which did blend
12. All that was mixed and reconciled in thee
13. Of mother's love with maiden purity,
14. Of high with low, celestial with terrene!
