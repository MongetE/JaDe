1. WHAT sounds are those, Helvellyn, that are heard
2. Up to thy summit, through the depth of air
3. Ascending, as if distance had the power
4. To make the sounds more audible? What crowd
5. Covers, or sprinkles o'er, yon village green?
6. Crowd seems it, solitary hill! to thee,
7. Though but a little family of men,
8. Shepherds and tillers of the ground--betimes
9. Assembled with their children and their wives,
10. And here and there a stranger interspersed.
11. They hold a rustic fair--a festival,
12. Such as, on this side now, and now on that,
13. Repeated through his tributary vales,
14. Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest,
15. Sees annually, if clouds towards either ocean
16. Blown from their favourite resting-place, or mists
17. Dissolved, have left him an unshrouded head.
18. Delightful day it is for all who dwell
19. In this secluded glen, and eagerly
20. They give it welcome. Long ere heat of noon,
21. From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheep
22. Are penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun.
23. The heifer lows, uneasy at the voice
24. Of a new master; bleat the flocks aloud.
25. Booths are there none; a stall or two is here;
26. A lame man or a blind, the one to beg,
27. The other to make music; hither, too,
28. From far, with basket, slung upon her arm,
29. Of hawker's wares--books, pictures, combs, and pins--
30. Some aged woman finds her way again,
31. Year after year, a punctual visitant!
32. There also stands a speech-maker by rote,
33. Pulling the strings of his boxed raree-show;
34. And in the lapse of many years may come
35. Prouder itinerant, mountebank, or he
36. Whose wonders in a covered wain lie hid.
37. But one there is, the loveliest of them all,
38. Some sweet lass of the valley, looking out
39. For gains, and who that sees her would not buy?
40. Fruits of her father's orchard are her wares,
41. And with the ruddy produce she walks round
42. Among the crowd, half pleased with, half ashamed
43. Of, her new office, blushing restlessly.
44. The children now are rich, for the old to-day
45. Are generous as the young; and, if content
46. With looking on, some ancient wedded pair
47. Sit in the shade together; while they gaze,
48. 'A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow,
49. The days departed start again to life,
50. And all the scenes of childhood reappear,
51. Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sun
52. To him who slept at noon and wakes at eve.'
53. Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail,
54. Spreading from young to old, from old to young,
55. And no one seems to want his share.--Immense
56. Is the recess, the circumambient world
57. Magnificent, by which they are embraced:
58. They move about upon the soft green turf:
59. How little they, they and their doings, seem,
60. And all that they can further or obstruct!
61. Through utter weakness pitiably dear,
62. As tender infants are: and yet how great!
63. For all things serve them: them the morning light
64. Loves, as it glistens on the silent rocks;
65. And them the silent rocks, which now from high
66. Look down upon them; the reposing clouds;
67. The wild brooks prattling from invisible haunts;
68. And old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir
69. Which animates this day their calm abode.

70. With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel,
71. In that enormous City's turbulent world
72. Of men and things, what benefit I owed
73. To thee, and those domains of rural peace,
74. Where to the sense of beauty first my heart
75. Was opened; tract more exquisitely fair
76. Than that famed paradise of ten thousand trees,
77. Or Gehol's matchless gardens, for delight
78. Of the Tartarian dynasty composed
79. (Beyond that mighty wall, not fabulous,
80. China's stupendous mound) by patient toil
81. Of myriads and boon nature's lavish help;
82. There, in a clime from widest empire chosen,
83. Fulfilling (could enchantment have done more?)
84. A sumptuous dream of flowery lawns, with domes
85. Of pleasure sprinkled over, shady dells
86. For eastern monasteries, sunny mounts
87. With temples crested, bridges, gondolas,
88. Rocks, dens, and groves of foliage taught to melt
89. Into each other their obsequious hues,
90. Vanished and vanishing in subtle chase,
91. Too fine to be pursued; or standing forth
92. In no discordant opposition, strong
93. And gorgeous as the colours side by side
94. Bedded among rich plumes of tropic birds;
95. And mountains over all, embracing all;
96. And all the landscape, endlessly enriched
97. With waters running, falling, or asleep.

98. But lovelier far than this, the paradise
99. Where I was reared; in Nature's primitive gifts
100. Favoured no less, and more to every sense
101. Delicious, seeing that the sun and sky,
102. The elements, and seasons as they change,
103. Do find a worthy fellow-labourer there--
104. Man free, man working for himself, with choice
105. Of time, and place, and object; by his wants,
106. His comforts, native occupations, cares,
107. Cheerfully led to individual ends
108. Or social, and still followed by a train
109. Unwooed, unthought-of even--simplicity,
110. And beauty, and inevitable grace.

111. Yea, when a glimpse of those imperial bowers
112. Would to a child be transport over-great,
113. When but a half-hour's roam through such a place
114. Would leave behind a dance of images,
115. That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks;
116. Even then the common haunts of the green earth,
117. And ordinary interests of man,
118. Which they embosom, all without regard
119. As both may seem, are fastening on the heart
120. Insensibly, each with the other's help.
121. For me, when my affections first were led
122. From kindred, friends, and playmates, to partake
123. Love for the human creature's absolute self,
124. That noticeable kindliness of heart
125. Sprang out of fountains, there abounding most,
126. Where sovereign Nature dictated the tasks
127. And occupations which her beauty adorned,
128. And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;
129. Not such as Saturn ruled 'mid Latian wilds,
130. With arts and laws so tempered, that their lives
131. Left, even to us toiling in this late day,
132. A bright tradition of the golden age;
133. Not such as, 'mid Arcadian fastnesses
134. Sequestered, handed down among themselves
135. Felicity, in Grecian song renowned;
136. Nor such as--when an adverse fate had driven,
137. From house and home, the courtly band whose fortunes
138. Entered, with Shakspeare's genius, the wild woods
139. Of Arden--amid sunshine or in shade
140. Culled the best fruits of Time's uncounted hours,
141. Ere Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede;
142. Or there where Perdita and Florizel
143. Together danced, Queen of the feast, and King;
144. Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is,
145. That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen)
146. Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far
147. Their May-bush, and along the streets in flocks
148. Parading with a song of taunting rhymes,
149. Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors;
150. Had also heard, from those who yet remembered,
151. Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that decked
152. Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; and of youths,
153. Each with his maid, before the sun was up,
154. By annual custom, issuing forth in troops,
155. To drink the waters of some sainted well,
156. And hang it round with garlands. Love survives;
157. But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow:
158. The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped
159. These lighter graces; and the rural ways
160. And manners which my childhood looked upon
161. Were the unluxuriant produce of a life
162. Intent on little but substantial needs,
163. Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt.
164. But images of danger and distress,
165. Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms;
166. Of this I heard, and saw enough to make
167. Imagination restless; nor was free
168. Myself from frequent perils; nor were tales
169. Wanting,--the tragedies of former times,
170. Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks
171. Immutable, and everflowing streams,
172. Where'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.

173. Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time,
174. Long springs and tepid winters, on the banks
175. Of delicate Galesus; and no less
176. Those scattered along Adria's myrtle shores:
177. Smooth life had herdsman, and his snow-white herd
178. To triumphs and to sacrificial rites
179. Devoted, on the inviolable stream
180. Of rich Clitumnus; and the goat-herd lived
181. As calmly, underneath the pleasant brows
182. Of cool Lucretilis, where the pipe was heard
183. Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks
184. With tutelary music, from all harm
185. The fold protecting, I myself, mature
186. In manhood then, have seen a pastoral tract
187. Like one of these, where Fancy might run wild,
188. Though under skies less generous, less serene:
189. There, for her own delight had Nature framed
190. A pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse
191. Of level pasture, islanded with groves
192. And banked with woody risings; but the Plain
193. Endless, here opening widely out, and there
194. Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn
195. And intricate recesses, creek or bay
196. Sheltered within a shelter, where at large
197. The shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home.
198. Thither he comes with spring-time, there abides
199. All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear
200. His flageolet to liquid notes of love
201. Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far.
202. Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast space
203. Where passage opens, but the same shall have
204. In turn its visitant, telling there his hours
205. In unlaborious pleasure, with no task
206. More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl
207. For spring or fountain, which the traveller finds,
208. When through the region he pursues at will
209. His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life
210. I saw when, from the melancholy walls
211. Of Goslar, once imperial, I renewed
212. My daily walk along that wide champaign,
213. That, reaching to her gates, spreads east and west,
214. And northwards, from beneath the mountainous verge
215. Of the Hercynian forest. Yet, hail to you
216. Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales,
217. Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice,
218. Powers of my native region! Ye that seize
219. The heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streams
220. Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds,
221. That howl so dismally for him who treads
222. Companionless your awful solitudes!
223. There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long
224. To wait upon the storms: of their approach
225. Sagacious, into sheltering coves he drives
226. His flock, and thither from the homestead bears
227. A toilsome burden up the craggy ways,
228. And deals it out, their regular nourishment
229. Strewn on the frozen snow. And when the spring
230. Looks out, and all the pastures dance with lambs,
231. And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbs
232. Higher and higher, him his office leads
233. To watch their goings, whatsoever track
234. The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home
235. At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun
236. Begin to strike him with a fire-like heat,
237. Than he lies down upon some shining rock,
238. And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen,
239. As is their wont, a pittance from strict time,
240. For rest not needed or exchange of love,
241. Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet
242. Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers
243. Of lowly thyme, by Nature's skill enwrought
244. In the wild turf: the lingering dews of morn
245. Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies,
246. His staff protending like a hunter's spear,
247. Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag,
248. And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams.
249. Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy's call,
250. Might deign to follow him through what he does
251. Or sees in his day's march; himself he feels,
252. In those vast regions where his service lies,
253. A freeman, wedded to his life of hope
254. And hazard, and hard labour interchanged
255. With that majestic indolence so dear
256. To native man. A rambling schoolboy, thus,
257. I felt his presence in his own domain,
258. As of a lord and master, or a power,
259. Or genius, under Nature, under God,
260. Presiding; and severest solitude
261. Had more commanding looks when he was there.
262. When up the lonely brooks on rainy days
263. Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills
264. By mists bewildered, suddenly mine eyes
265. Have glanced upon him distant a few steps,
266. In size a giant, stalking through thick fog,
267. His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped
268. Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow,
269. His form hath flashed upon me, glorified
270. By the deep radiance of the setting sun:
271. Or him have I descried in distant sky,
272. A solitary object and sublime,
273. Above all height! like an aerial cross
274. Stationed alone upon a spiry rock
275. Of the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was man
276. Ennobled outwardly before my sight,
277. And thus my heart was early introduced
278. To an unconscious love and reverence
279. Of human nature; hence the human form
280. To me became an index of delight,
281. Of grace and honour, power and worthiness.
282. Meanwhile this creature--spiritual almost
283. As those of books, but more exalted far;
284. Far more of an imaginative form
285. Than the gay Corin of the groves, who lives
286. For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour,
287. In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst--
288. Was, for the purposes of kind, a man
289. With the most common; husband, father; learned,
290. Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest
291. From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;
292. Of this I little saw, cared less for it,
293. But something must have felt.
294. Call ye these appearances--
295. Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth,
296. This sanctity of Nature given to man--
297. A shadow, a delusion, ye who pore
298. On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things;
299. Whose truth is not a motion or a shape
300. Instinct with vital functions, but a block
301. Or waxen image which yourselves have made,
302. And ye adore! But blessed be the God
303. Of Nature and of Man that this was so;
304. That men before my inexperienced eyes
305. Did first present themselves thus purified,
306. Removed, and to a distance that was fit:
307. And so we all of us in some degree
308. Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led,
309. And howsoever; were it otherwise,
310. And we found evil fast as we find good
311. In our first years, or think that it is found,
312. How could the innocent heart bear up and live!
313. But doubly fortunate my lot; not here
314. Alone, that something of a better life
315. Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege
316. Of most to move in, but that first I looked
317. At Man through objects that were great or fair;
318. First communed with him by their help. And thus
319. Was founded a sure safeguard and defence
320. Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares,
321. Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in
322. On all sides from the ordinary world
323. In which we traffic. Starting from this point
324. I had my face turned toward the truth, began
325. With an advantage furnished by that kind
326. Of prepossession, without which the soul
327. Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good,
328. No genuine insight ever comes to her.
329. From the restraint of over-watchful eyes
330. Preserved, I moved about, year after year,
331. Happy, and now most thankful that my walk
332. Was guarded from too early intercourse
333. With the deformities of crowded life,
334. And those ensuing laughters and contempts,
335. Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think
336. With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord,
337. Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,
338. Will not permit us; but pursue the mind,
339. That to devotion willingly would rise,
340. Into the temple and the temple's heart.

341. Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me
342. Thus early took a place pre-eminent;
343. Nature herself was, at this unripe time,
344. But secondary to my own pursuits
345. And animal activities, and all
346. Their trivial pleasures; and when these had drooped
347. And gradually expired, and Nature, prized
348. For her own sake, became my joy, even then--
349. And upwards through late youth, until not less
350. Than two-and-twenty summers had been told--
351. Was Man in my affections and regards
352. Subordinate to her, her visible forms
353. And viewless agencies: a passion, she,
354. A rapture often, and immediate love
355. Ever at hand; he, only a delight
356. Occasional, an accidental grace,
357. His hour being not yet come. Far less had then
358. The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned
359. My spirit to that gentleness of love,
360. (Though they had long been carefully observed),
361. Won from me those minute obeisances
362. Of tenderness, which I may number now
363. With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these
364. The light of beauty did not fall in vain,
365. Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.

366. But when that first poetic faculty
367. Of plain Imagination and severe,
368. No longer a mute influence of the soul,
369. Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest call,
370. To try her strength among harmonious words;
371. And to book-notions and the rules of art
372. Did knowingly conform itself; there came
373. Among the simple shapes of human life
374. A wilfulness of fancy and conceit;
375. And Nature and her objects beautified
376. These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,
377. They burnished her. From touch of this new power
378. Nothing was safe: the elder-tree that grew
379. Beside the well-known charnel-house had then
380. A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,
381. That took his station there for ornament:
382. The dignities of plain occurrence then
383. Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point
384. Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.
385. Then, if a widow, staggering with the blow
386. Of her distress, was known to have turned her steps
387. To the cold grave in which her husband slept,
388. One night, or haply more than one, through pain
389. Or half-insensate impotence of mind,
390. The fact was caught at greedily, and there
391. She must be visitant the whole year through,
392. Wetting the turf with never-ending tears.

393. Through quaint obliquities I might pursue
394. These cravings; when the foxglove, one by one,
395. Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,
396. Had shed beside the public way its bells,
397. And stood of all dismantled, save the last
398. Left at the tapering ladder's top, that seemed
399. To bend as doth a slender blade of grass
400. Tipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to seat,
401. Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still
402. With this last relic, soon itself to fall,
403. Some vagrant mother, whose arch little ones,
404. All unconcerned by her dejected plight,
405. Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands
406. Gathered the purple cups that round them lay,
407. Strewing the turfs green slope.
408. A diamond light
409. (Whene'er the summer sun, declining, smote
410. A smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seen
411. Sparkling from out a copse-clad bank that rose
412. Fronting our cottage. Oft beside the hearth
413. Seated, with open door, often and long
414. Upon this restless lustre have I gazed,
415. That made my fancy restless as itself.
416. 'Twas now for me a burnished silver shield
417. Suspended over a knight's tomb, who lay
418. Inglorious, buried in the dusky wood:
419. An entrance now into some magic cave
420. Or palace built by fairies of the rock;
421. Nor could I have been bribed to disenchant
422. The spectacle, by visiting the spot.
423. Thus wilful Fancy, in no hurtful mood,
424. Engrafted far-fetched shapes on feelings bred
425. By pure Imagination: busy Power
426. She was, and with her ready pupil turned
427. Instinctively to human passions, then
428. Least understood. Yet, 'mid the fervent swarm
429. Of these vagaries, with an eye so rich
430. As mine was through the bounty of a grand
431. And lovely region, I had forms distinct
432. To steady me: each airy thought revolved
433. Round a substantial centre, which at once
434. Incited it to motion, and controlled.
435. I did not pine like one in cities bred,
436. As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend!
437. Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams
438. Of sickliness, disjoining, joining, things
439. Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm,
440. If, when the woodman languished with disease
441. Induced by sleeping nightly on the ground
442. Within his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise,
443. I called the pangs of disappointed love,
444. And all the sad etcetera of the wrong,
445. To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,
446. If not already from the woods retired
447. To die at home, was haply, as I knew,
448. Withering by slow degrees, 'mid gentle airs,
449. Birds, running streams, and hills so beautiful
450. On golden evenings, while the charcoal pile
451. Breathed up its smoke, an image of his ghost
452. Or spirit that full soon must take her flight.
453. Nor shall we not be tending towards that point
454. Of sound humanity to which our Tale
455. Leads, though by sinuous ways, if here I show
456. How Fancy, in a season when she wove
457. Those slender cords, to guide the unconscious Boy
458. For the Man's sake, could feed at Nature's call
459. Some pensive musings which might well beseem
460. Maturer years.
461. A grove there is whose boughs
462. Stretch from the western marge of Thurstonmere
463. With length of shade so thick, that whoso glides
464. Along the line of low-roofed water, moves
465. As in a cloister. Once--while, in that shade
466. Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light
467. Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed
468. In silent beauty on the naked ridge
469. Of a high eastern hill--thus flowed my thoughts
470. In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:
471. Dear native Regions, wheresoe'er shall close
472. My mortal course, there will I think on you;
473. Dying, will cast on you a backward look;
474. Even as this setting sun (albeit the Vale
475. Is no where touched by one memorial gleam)
476. Doth with the fond remains of his last power
477. Still linger, and a farewell lustre sheds,
478. On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose.

479. Enough of humble arguments; recall,
480. My Song! those high emotions which thy voice
481. Has heretofore made known; that bursting forth
482. Of sympathy, inspiring and inspired,
483. When everywhere a vital pulse was felt,
484. And all the several frames of things, like stars,
485. Through every magnitude distinguishable,
486. Shone mutually indebted, or half lost
487. Each in the other's blaze, a galaxy
488. Of life and glory. In the midst stood Man,
489. Outwardly, inwardly contemplated,
490. As, of all visible natures, crown, though born
491. Of dust, and kindred to the worm; a Being,
492. Both in perception and discernment, first
493. In every capability of rapture,
494. Through the divine effect of power and love;
495. As, more than anything we know, instinct
496. With godhead, and, by reason and by will,
497. Acknowledging dependency sublime.

498. Ere long, the lonely mountains left, I moved,
499. Begirt, from day to day, with temporal shapes
500. Of vice and folly thrust upon my view,
501. Objects of sport, and ridicule, and scorn,
502. Manners and characters discriminate,
503. And little bustling passions that eclipse,
504. As well they might, the impersonated thought,
505. The idea, or abstraction of the kind.

506. An idler among academic bowers,
507. Such was my new condition, as at large
508. Has been set forth; yet here the vulgar light
509. Of present, actual, superficial life,
510. Gleaming through colouring of other times,
511. Old usages and local privilege,
512. Was welcomed, softened, if not solemnised.
513. This notwithstanding, being brought more near
514. To vice and guilt, forerunning wretchedness,
515. I trembled,--thought, at times, of human life
516. With an indefinite terror and dismay,
517. Such as the storms and angry elements
518. Had bred in me; but gloomier far, a dim
519. Analogy to uproar and misrule,
520. Disquiet, danger, and obscurity.

521. It might be told (but wherefore speak of things
522. Common to all?) that, seeing, I was led
523. Gravely to ponder--judging between good
524. And evil, not as for the mind's delight
525. But for her guidance--one who was to 'act',
526. As sometimes to the best of feeble means
527. I did, by human sympathy impelled:
528. And, through dislike and most offensive pain,
529. Was to the truth conducted; of this faith
530. Never forsaken, that, by acting well,
531. And understanding, I should learn to love
532. The end of life, and everything we know.

533. Grave Teacher, stern Preceptress! for at times
534. Thou canst put on an aspect most severe;
535. London, to thee I willingly return.
536. Erewhile my verse played idly with the flowers
537. Enwrought upon thy mantle; satisfied
538. With that amusement, and a simple look
539. Of child-like inquisition now and then
540. Cast upwards on thy countenance, to detect
541. Some inner meanings which might harbour there.
542. But how could I in mood so light indulge,
543. Keeping such fresh remembrance of the day,
544. When, having thridded the long labyrinth
545. Of the suburban villages, I first
546. Entered thy vast dominion? On the roof
547. Of an itinerant vehicle I sate,
548. With vulgar men about me, trivial forms
549. Of houses, pavement, streets, of men and things,--
550. Mean shapes on every side: but, at the instant,
551. When to myself it fairly might be said,
552. The threshold now is overpast, (how strange
553. That aught external to the living mind
554. Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was),
555. A weight of ages did at once descend
556. Upon my heart; no thought embodied, no
557. Distinct remembrances, but weight and power,--
558. Power growing under weight: alas! I feel
559. That I am trifling: 'twas a moment's pause,--
560. All that took place within me came and went
561. As in a moment; yet with Time it dwells,
562. And grateful memory, as a thing divine.

563. The curious traveller, who, from open day,
564. Hath passed with torches into some huge cave,
565. The Grotto of Antiparos, or the Den
566. In old time haunted by that Danish Witch,
567. Yordas; he looks around and sees the vault
568. Widening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees,
569. Erelong, the massy roof above his head,
570. That instantly unsettles and recedes,--
571. Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all
572. Commingled, making up a canopy
573. Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape
574. That shift and vanish, change and interchange
575. Like spectres,--ferment silent and sublime!
576. That after a short space works less and less,
577. Till, every effort, every motion gone,
578. The scene before him stands in perfect view
579. Exposed, and lifeless as a written book!--
580. But let him pause awhile, and look again,
581. And a new quickening shall succeed, at first
582. Beginning timidly, then creeping fast,
583. Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass,
584. Busies the eye with images and forms
585. Boldly assembled,--here is shadowed forth
586. From the projections, wrinkles, cavities,
587. A variegated landscape,--there the shape
588. Of some gigantic warrior clad in mail,
589. The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk,
590. Veiled nun, or pilgrim resting on his staff:
591. Strange congregation! yet not slow to meet
592. Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.

593. Even in such sort had I at first been moved,
594. Nor otherwise continued to be moved,
595. As I explored the vast metropolis,
596. Fount of my country's destiny and the world's;
597. That great emporium, chronicle at once
598. And burial-place of passions, and their home
599. Imperial, their chief living residence.

600. With strong sensations teeming as it did
601. Of past and present, such a place must needs
602. Have pleased me, seeking knowledge at that time
603. Far less than craving power; yet knowledge came,
604. Sought or unsought, and influxes of power
605. Came, of themselves, or at her call derived
606. In fits of kindliest apprehensiveness,
607. From all sides, when whate'er was in itself
608. Capacious found, or seemed to find, in me
609. A correspondent amplitude of mind;
610. Such is the strength and glory of our youth!
611. The human nature unto which I felt
612. That I belonged, and reverenced with love,
613. Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit
614. Diffused through time and space, with aid derived
615. Of evidence from monuments, erect,
616. Prostrate, or leaning towards their common rest
617. In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime
618. Of vanished nations, or more clearly drawn
619. From books and what they picture and record.

620. 'Tis true, the history of our native land--
621. With those of Greece compared and popular Rome,
622. And in our high-wrought modern narratives
623. Stript of their harmonising soul, the life
624. Of manners and familiar incidents--
625. Had never much delighted me. And less
626. Than other intellects had mine been used
627. To lean upon extrinsic circumstance
628. Of record or tradition; but a sense
629. Of what in the Great City had been done
630. And suffered, and was doing, suffering, still,
631. Weighed with me, could support the test of thought;
632. And, in despite of all that had gone by,
633. Or was departing never to return,
634. There I conversed with majesty and power
635. Like independent natures. Hence the place
636. Was thronged with impregnations like the Wilds
637. In which my early feelings had been nursed--
638. Bare hills and valleys, full of caverns, rocks,
639. And audible seclusions, dashing lakes,
640. Echoes and waterfalls, and pointed crags
641. That into music touch the passing wind.
642. Here then my young imagination found
643. No uncongenial element; could here
644. Among new objects serve or give command,
645. Even as the heart's occasions might require,
646. To forward reason's else too-scrupulous march.
647. The effect was, still more elevated views
648. Of human nature. Neither vice nor guilt,
649. Debasement undergone by body or mind,
650. Nor all the misery forced upon my sight,
651. Misery not lightly passed, but sometimes scanned
652. Most feelingly, could overthrow my trust
653. In what we 'may' become; induce belief
654. That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught,
655. A solitary, who with vain conceits
656. Had been inspired, and walked about in dreams.
657. From those sad scenes when meditation turned,
658. Lo! everything that was indeed divine
659. Retained its purity inviolate,
660. Nay brighter shone, by this portentous gloom
661. Set off; such opposition as aroused
662. The mind of Adam, yet in Paradise
663. Though fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw
664. Darkness ere day's mid course, and morning light
665. More orient in the western cloud, that drew
666. O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,
667. Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.

668. Add also, that among the multitudes
669. Of that huge city, oftentimes was seen
670. Affectingly set forth, more than elsewhere
671. Is possible, the unity of man,
672. One spirit over ignorance and vice
673. Predominant, in good and evil hearts;
674. One sense for moral judgments, as one eye
675. For the sun's light. The soul when smitten thus
676. By a sublime 'idea', whencesoe'er
677. Vouchsafed for union or communion, feeds
678. On the pure bliss, and takes her rest with God.

679. Thus from a very early age, O Friend!
680. My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawn
681. To human-kind, and to the good and ill
682. Of human life: Nature had led me on;
683. And oft amid the 'busy hum' I seemed
684. To travel independent of her help,
685. As if I had forgotten her; but no,
686. The world of human-kind outweighed not hers
687. In my habitual thoughts; the scale of love,
688. Though filling daily, still was light, compared
689. With that in which 'her' mighty objects lay.
