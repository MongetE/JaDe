1. IN due observance of an ancient rite,
2. The rude Biscayans, when their children lie
3. Dead in the sinless time of infancy,
4. Attire the peaceful corse in vestments white;
5. And, in like sign of cloudless triumph bright,
6. They bind the unoffending creature's brows
7. With happy garlands of the pure white rose:
8. Then do a festal company unite
9. In choral song; and, while the uplifted cross
10. Of Jesus goes before, the child is borne
11. Uncovered to his grave: 'tis closed,--her loss
12. The Mother 'then' mourns, as she needs must mourn;
13. But soon, through Christian faith, is grief subdued;
14. And joy returns, to brighten fortitude.
