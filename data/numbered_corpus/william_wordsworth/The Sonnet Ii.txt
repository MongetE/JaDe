1. SCORN not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frown'd,
2. Mindless of its just honours; with this key
3. Shakespeare unlock'd his heart; the melody
4. Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;
5. A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
6. With it Cam√∂ens sooth'd an exile's grief;
7. The Sonnet glitter'd a gay myrtle leaf
8. Amid the cypress with which Dante crown'd
9. His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,
10. It cheer'd mild Spenser, call'd from Faery-land
11. To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp
12. Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
13. The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew
14. Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!
