1. DEAR native regions, I foretell,
2. From what I feel at this farewell,
3. That, wheresoe'er my steps may tend,
4. And whensoe'er my course shall end,
5. If in that hour a single tie
6. Survive of local sympathy,
7. My soul will cast the backward view,
8. The longing look alone on you.

9. Thus, while the Sun sinks down to rest
10. Far in the regions of the west,
11. Though to the vale no parting beam
12. Be given, not one memorial gleam,
13. A lingering light he fondly throws
14. On the dear hills where first he rose.
