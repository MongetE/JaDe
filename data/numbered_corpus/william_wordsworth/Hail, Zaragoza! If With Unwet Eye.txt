1. HAIL, Zaragoza! If with unwet eye
2. We can approach, thy sorrow to behold,
3. Yet is the heart not pitiless nor cold;
4. Such spectacle demands not tear or sigh.
5. These desolate remains are trophies high
6. Of more than martial courage in the breast
7. Of peaceful civic virtue: they attest
8. Thy matchless worth to all posterity.
9. Blood flowed before thy sight without remorse;
10. Disease consumed thy vitals; War upheaved
11. The ground beneath thee with volcanic force:
12. Dread trials! yet encountered and sustained
13. Till not a wreck of help or hope remained,
14. And law was from necessity received.
