1. Composed upon the Thames near Richmond

2. Glide gently, thus for ever glide,
3. O Thames! that other bards may see
4. As lovely visions by thy side
5. As now, fair river! come to me.
6. O glide, fair stream! for ever so,
7. Thy quiet soul on all bestowing,
8. Till all our minds for ever flow
9. As thy deep waters now are flowing.

10. Vain thought!--Yet be as now thou art,
11. That in thy waters may be seen
12. The image of a poet's heart,
13. How bright, how solemn, how serene!
14. Such as did once the Poet bless,
15. Who murmuring here a later ditty,
16. Could find no refuge from distress
17. But in the milder grief of pity.

18. Now let us, as we float along,
19. For 'him' suspend the dashing oar;
20. And pray that never child of song
21. May know that Poet's sorrows more.
22. How calm! how still! the only sound,
23. The dripping of the oar suspended!
24. --The evening darkness gathers round
25. By virtue's holiest Powers attended.
