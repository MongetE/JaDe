1. DARK and more dark the shades of evening fell;
2. The wished-for point was reached--but at an hour
3. When little could be gained from that rich dower
4. Of prospect, whereof many thousands tell.
5. Yet did the glowing west with marvellous power
6. Salute us; there stood Indian citadel,
7. Temple of Greece, and minster with its tower
8. Substantially expressed--a place for bell
9. Or clock to toll from! Many a tempting isle,
10. With groves that never were imagined, lay
11. 'Mid seas how steadfast! objects all for the eye
12. Of silent rapture; but we felt the while
13. We should forget them; they are of the sky,
14. And from our earthly memory fade away.
