1. BRIGHT was the summer's noon when quickening steps
2. Followed each other till a dreary moor
3. Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon whose top
4. Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge,
5. I overlooked the bed of Windermere,
6. Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.
7. With exultation, at my feet I saw
8. Lake, islands, promontories, gleaming bays,
9. A universe of Nature's fairest forms
10. Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,
11. Magnificent, and beautiful, and gay.
12. I bounded down the hill shouting amain
13. For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks
14. Replied, and when the Charon of the flood
15. Had staid his oars, and touched the jutting pier,
16. I did not step into the well-known boat
17. Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed
18. Up the familiar hill I took my way
19. Towards that sweet Valley where I had been reared;
20. 'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round
21. I saw the snow-white church upon her hill
22. Sit like a throned Lady, sending out
23. A gracious look all over her domain.
24. Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;
25. With eager footsteps I advance and reach
26. The cottage threshold where my journey closed.
27. Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,
28. From my old Dame, so kind and motherly,
29. While she perused me with a parent's pride.
30. The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew
31. Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heart
32. Can beat never will I forget thy name.
33. Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest
34. After thy innocent and busy stir
35. In narrow cares, thy little daily growth
36. Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years,
37. And more than eighty, of untroubled life;
38. Childless, yet by the strangers to thy blood
39. Honoured with little less than filial love.
40. What joy was mine to see thee once again,
41. Thee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things
42. About its narrow precincts all beloved,
43. And many of them seeming yet my own!
44. Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts
45. Have felt, and every man alive can guess?
46. The rooms, the court, the garden were not left
47. Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat
48. Round the stone table under the dark pine,
49. Friendly to studious or to festive hours;
50. Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,
51. The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed
52. Within our garden, found himself at once,
53. As if by trick insidious and unkind,
54. Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down
55. (Without an effort and without a will)
56. A channel paved by man's officious care.
57. I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,
58. And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts,
59. 'Ha,' quoth I, 'pretty prisoner, are you there!'
60. Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,
61. 'An emblem here behold of thy own life;
62. In its late course of even days with all
63. Their smooth enthralment;' but the heart was full,
64. Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame
65. Walked proudly at my side: she guided me;
66. I willing, nay--nay, wishing to be led.
67. --The face of every neighbour whom I met
68. Was like a volume to me; some were hailed
69. Upon the road, some busy at their work,
70. Unceremonious greetings interchanged
71. With half the length of a long field between.
72. Among my schoolfellows I scattered round
73. Like recognitions, but with some constraint
74. Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,
75. But with more shame, for my habiliments,
76. The transformation wrought by gay attire.
77. Not less delighted did I take my place
78. At our domestic table: and, dear Friend!
79. In this endeavour simply to relate
80. A Poet's history, may I leave untold
81. The thankfulness with which I laid me down
82. In my accustomed bed, more welcome now
83. Perhaps than if it had been more desired
84. Or been more often thought of with regret;
85. That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind
86. Roar, and the rain beat hard; where I so oft
87. Had lain awake on summer nights to watch
88. The moon in splendour couched among the leaves
89. Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood;
90. Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro
91. In the dark summit of the waving tree
92. She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.

93. Among the favourites whom it pleased me well
94. To see again, was one by ancient right
95. Our inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;
96. By birth and call of nature pre-ordained
97. To hunt the badger and unearth the fox
98. Among the impervious crags, but having been
99. From youth our own adopted, he had passed
100. Into a gentler service. And when first
101. The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day
102. Along my veins I kindled with the stir,
103. The fermentation, and the vernal heat
104. Of poesy, affecting private shades
105. Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used
106. To watch me, an attendant and a friend,
107. Obsequious to my steps early and late,
108. Though often of such dilatory walk
109. Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.
110. A hundred times when, roving high and low,
111. I have been harassed with the toil of verse,
112. Much pains and little progress, and at once
113. Some lovely Image in the song rose up
114. Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;
115. Then have I darted forwards to let loose
116. My hand upon his back with stormy joy,
117. Caressing him again and yet again.
118. And when at evening on the public way
119. I sauntered, like a river murmuring
120. And talking to itself when all things else
121. Are still, the creature trotted on before;
122. Such was his custom; but whene'er he met
123. A passenger approaching, he would turn
124. To give me timely notice, and straightway,
125. Grateful for that admonishment, I hushed
126. My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air
127. And mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced
128. To give and take a greeting that might save
129. My name from piteous rumours, such as wait
130. On men suspected to be crazed in brain.

131. Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved--
132. Regretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,
133. But they were richly laden with all good,
134. And cannot be remembered but with thanks
135. And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart--
136. Those walks in all their freshness now came back
137. Like a returning Spring. When first I made
138. Once more the circuit of our little lake,
139. If ever happiness hath lodged with man,
140. That day consummate happiness was mine,
141. Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.
142. The sun was set, or setting, when I left
143. Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on
144. A sober hour, not winning or serene,
145. For cold and raw the air was, and untuned:
146. But as a face we love is sweetest then
147. When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look
148. It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart
149. Have fulness in herself; even so with me
150. It fared that evening. Gently did my soul
151. Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood
152. Naked, as in the presence of her God.
153. While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch
154. A heart that had not been disconsolate:
155. Strength came where weakness was not known to be,
156. At least not felt; and restoration came
157. Like an intruder knocking at the door
158. Of unacknowledged weariness. I took
159. The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.
160. --Of that external scene which round me lay,
161. Little, in this abstraction, did I see;
162. Remembered less; but I had inward hopes
163. And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,
164. Conversed with promises, had glimmering views
165. How life pervades the undecaying mind;
166. How the immortal soul with God-like power
167. Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep
168. That time can lay upon her; how on earth,
169. Man, if he do but live within the light
170. Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad
171. His being armed with strength that cannot fail.
172. Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love,
173. Of innocence, and holiday repose;
174. And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir
175. Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end
176. At last, or glorious, by endurance won.
177. Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down
178. Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes
179. And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread
180. With darkness, and before a rippling breeze
181. The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,
182. And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,
183. Around me from among the hazel leaves,
184. Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,
185. Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,
186. Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,
187. The off and on companion of my walk;
188. And such, at times, believing them to be,
189. I turned my head to look if he were there;
190. Then into solemn thought I passed once more.

191. A freshness also found I at this time
192. In human Life, the daily life of those
193. Whose occupations really I loved;
194. The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise
195. Changed like a garden in the heat of spring
196. After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit
197. The things which were the same and yet appeared
198. Far otherwise) amid this rural solitude,
199. A narrow Vale where each was known to all,
200. 'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind
201. To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook
202. Where an old man had used to sit alone,
203. Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left
204. In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet
205. Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;
206. And growing girls whose beauty, filched away
207. With all its pleasant promises, was gone
208. To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.

209. Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,
210. And often looking round was moved to smiles
211. Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;
212. I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,
213. Of those plain-living people now observed
214. With clearer knowledge; with another eye
215. I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,
216. The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,
217. This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;
218. Saw her go forth to church or other work
219. Of state equipped in monumental trim;
220. Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like),
221. A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers
222. Wore in old times. Her smooth domestic life,
223. Affectionate without disquietude,
224. Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less
225. Her clear though shallow stream of piety
226. That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;
227. With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read
228. Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,
229. And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep
230. And made of it a pillow for her head.

231. Nor less do I remember to have felt,
232. Distinctly manifested at this time,
233. A human-heartedness about my love
234. For objects hitherto the absolute wealth
235. Of my own private being and no more;
236. Which I had loved, even as a blessed spirit
237. Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,
238. Might love in individual happiness.
239. But now there opened on me other thoughts
240. Of change, congratulation or regret,
241. A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;
242. The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,
243. The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts--
244. White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,
245. Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,
246. Acquaintances of every little child,
247. And Jupiter, my own beloved star!
248. Whatever shadings of mortality,
249. Whatever imports from the world of death
250. Had come among these objects heretofore,
251. Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,
252. Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings
253. Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way
254. In later youth to yearnings of a love
255. Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.

256. As one who hangs down-bending from the side
257. Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast
258. Of a still water, solacing himself
259. With such discoveries as his eye can make
260. Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,
261. Sees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers,
262. Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,
263. Yet often is perplexed, and cannot part
264. The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,
265. Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth
266. Of the clear flood, from things which there abide
267. In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam
268. Of his own image, by a sunbeam now,
269. And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,
270. Impediments that make his task more sweet;
271. Such pleasant office have we long pursued
272. Incumbent o'er the surface of past time
273. With like success, nor often have appeared
274. Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned
275. Than these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!
276. Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite
277. Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,
278. There was an inner falling off--I loved,
279. Loved deeply all that had been loved before,
280. More deeply even than ever: but a swarm
281. Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds
282. And feast and dance, and public revelry,
283. And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,
284. Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,
285. Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh
286. Of manliness and freedom) all conspired
287. To lure my mind from firm habitual quest
288. Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal
289. And damp those yearnings which had once been mine--
290. A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up
291. To his own eager thoughts. It would demand
292. Some skill, and longer time than may be spared
293. To paint these vanities, and how they wrought
294. In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.
295. It seemed the very garments that I wore
296. Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream
297. Of self-forgetfulness.
298. Yes, that heartless chase
299. Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange
300. For books and nature at that early age.
301. 'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained
302. Of character or life; but at that time,
303. Of manners put to school I took small note,
304. And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.
305. Far better had it been to exalt the mind
306. By solitary study, to uphold
307. Intense desire through meditative peace;
308. And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,
309. The memory of one particular hour
310. Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng
311. Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,
312. A medley of all tempers, I had passed
313. The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,
314. With din of instruments and shuffling feet,
315. And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,
316. And unaimed prattle flying up and down;
317. Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there
318. Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,
319. Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,
320. And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,
321. The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky
322. Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse
323. And open field, through which the pathway wound,
324. And homeward led my steps. Magnificent
325. The morning rose, in memorable pomp,
326. Glorious as e'er I had beheld--in front,
327. The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,
328. The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,
329. Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;
330. And in the meadows and the lower grounds
331. Was all the sweetness of a common dawn--
332. Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds,
333. And labourers going forth to till the fields.
334. Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim
335. My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows
336. Were then made for me; bond unknown to me
337. Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,
338. A dedicated Spirit. On I walked
339. In thankful blessedness, which yet survives.

340. Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time
341. A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,
342. Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;
343. Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,
344. Consorting in one mansion unreproved.
345. The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,
346. Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,
347. That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts
348. Transient and idle, lacked not intervals
349. When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time
350. Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself
351. Conformity as just as that of old
352. To the end and written spirit of God's works,
353. Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,
354. Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.

355. When from our better selves we have too long
356. Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,
357. Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,
358. How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;
359. How potent a mere image of her sway;
360. Most potent when impressed upon the mind
361. With an appropriate human centre--hermit,
362. Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;
363. Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot
364. Is treading, where no other face is seen)
365. Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top
366. Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;
367. Or as the soul of that great Power is met
368. Sometimes embodied on a public road,
369. When, for the night deserted, it assumes
370. A character of quiet more profound
371. Than pathless wastes.
372. Once, when those summer months
373. Were flown, and autumn brought its annual show
374. Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,
375. Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced
376. That--after I had left a flower-decked room
377. (Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived
378. To a late hour), and spirits overwrought
379. Were making night do penance for a day
380. Spent in a round of strenuous idleness--
381. My homeward course led up a long ascent,
382. Where the road's watery surface, to the top
383. Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon
384. And bore the semblance of another stream
385. Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook
386. That murmured in the vale. All else was still;
387. No living thing appeared in earth or air,
388. And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,
389. Sound there was none--but, lo! an uncouth shape,
390. Shown by a sudden turning of the road,
391. So near that, slipping back into the shade
392. Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,
393. Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,
394. A span above man's common measure, tall,
395. Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man
396. Was never seen before by night or day.
397. Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth
398. Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,
399. A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken
400. That he was clothed in military garb,
401. Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,
402. No dog attending, by no staff sustained,
403. He stood, and in his very dress appeared
404. A desolation, a simplicity,
405. To which the trappings of a gaudy world
406. Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,
407. Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain
408. Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form
409. Kept the same awful steadiness--at his feet
410. His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame
411. Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length
412. Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,
413. I left the shady nook where I had stood
414. And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place
415. He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm
416. In measured gesture lifted to his head
417. Returned my salutation; then resumed
418. His station as before; and when I asked
419. His history, the veteran, in reply,
420. Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,
421. And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,
422. A stately air of mild indifference,
423. He told in few plain words a soldier's tale--
424. That in the Tropic Islands he had served,
425. Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past;
426. That on his landing he had been dismissed,
427. And now was travelling towards his native home.
428. This heard, I said, in pity, 'Come with me.'
429. He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up
430. An oaken staff by me yet unobserved--
431. A staff which must have dropped from his slack hand
432. And lay till now neglected in the grass.
433. Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared
434. To travel without pain, and I beheld,
435. With an astonishment but ill suppressed,
436. His ghostly figure moving at my side;
437. Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear
438. To turn from present hardships to the past,
439. And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,
440. Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,
441. On what he might himself have seen or felt.
442. He all the while was in demeanour calm,
443. Concise in answer; solemn and sublime
444. He might have seemed, but that in all he said
445. There was a strange half-absence, as of one
446. Knowing too well the importance of his theme,
447. But feeling it no longer. Our discourse
448. Soon ended, and together on we passed
449. In silence through a wood gloomy and still.
450. Up-turning, then, along an open field,
451. We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,
452. And earnestly to charitable care
453. Commended him as a poor friendless man,
454. Belated and by sickness overcome.
455. Assured that now the traveller would repose
456. In comfort, I entreated that henceforth
457. He would not linger in the public ways,
458. But ask for timely furtherance and help
459. Such as his state required. At this reproof,
460. With the same ghastly mildness in his look,
461. He said, 'My trust is in the God of Heaven,
462. And in the eye of him who passes me!'

463. The cottage door was speedily unbarred,
464. And now the soldier touched his hat once more
465. With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,
466. Whose tone bespake reviving interests
467. Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned
468. The farewell blessing of the patient man,
469. And so we parted. Back I cast a look,
470. And lingered near the door a little space,
471. Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.
