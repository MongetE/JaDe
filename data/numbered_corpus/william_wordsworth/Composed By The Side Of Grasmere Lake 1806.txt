1. CLOUDS, lingering yet, extend in solid bars
2. Through the grey west; and lo! these waters, steeled
3. By breezeless air to smoothest polish, yield
4. A vivid repetition of the stars;
5. Jove, Venus, and the ruddy crest of Mars
6. Amid his fellows beauteously revealed
7. At happy distance from earth's groaning field,
8. Where ruthless mortals wage incessant wars.
9. Is it a mirror?--or the nether Sphere
10. Opening to view the abyss in which she feeds
11. Her own calm fires?--But list! a voice is near;
12. Great Pan himself low-whispering through the reeds,
13. 'Be thankful, thou; for, if unholy deeds
14. Ravage the world, tranquillity is here!'
