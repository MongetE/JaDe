1. LADY! the songs of Spring were in the grove
2. While I was shaping beds for winter flowers;
3. While I was planting green unfading bowers,
4. And shrubs--to hang upon the warm alcove,
5. And sheltering wall; and still, as Fancy wove
6. The dream, to time and nature's blended powers
7. I gave this paradise for winter hours,
8. A labyrinth, Lady! which your feet shall rove.
9. Yes! when the sun of life more feebly shines,
10. Becoming thoughts, I trust, of solemn gloom
11. Or of high gladness you shall hither bring;
12. And these perennial bowers and murmuring pines
13. Be gracious as the music and the bloom
14. And all the mighty ravishment of spring.
