1. WHEN Contemplation, like the night-calm felt
2. Through earth and sky, spreads widely, and sends deep
3. Into the soul its tranquillising power,
4. Even then I sometimes grieve for thee, O Man,
5. Earth's paramount Creature! not so much for woes
6. That thou endurest; heavy though that weight be,
7. Cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine
8. Doth melt away; but for those palms achieved
9. Through length of time, by patient exercise
10. Of study and hard thought; there, there, it is
11. That sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto,
12. In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked
13. Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven
14. As her prime teacher, intercourse with man
15. Established by the sovereign Intellect,
16. Who through that bodily image hath diffused,
17. As might appear to the eye of fleeting time,
18. A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought,
19. For commerce of thy nature with herself,
20. Things that aspire to unconquerable life;
21. And yet we feel--we cannot choose but feel--
22. That they must perish. Tremblings of the heart
23. It gives, to think that our immortal being
24. No more shall need such garments; and yet man,
25. As long as he shall be the child of earth,
26. Might almost 'weep to have' what he may lose,
27. Nor be himself extinguished, but survive,
28. Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.
29. A thought is with me sometimes, and I say,--
30. Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes
31. Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch
32. Her pleasant habitations, and dry up
33. Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare,
34. Yet would the living Presence still subsist
35. Victorious, and composure would ensue,
36. And kindlings like the morning--presage sure
37. Of day returning and of life revived.
38. But all the meditations of mankind,
39. Yea, all the adamantine holds of truth
40. By reason built, or passion, which itself
41. Is highest reason in a soul sublime;
42. The consecrated works of Bard and Sage,
43. Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men,
44. Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes;
45. Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the Mind
46. Some element to stamp her image on
47. In nature somewhat nearer to her own?
48. Why, gifted with such powers to send abroad
49. Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail?

50. One day, when from my lips a like complaint
51. Had fallen in presence of a studious friend,
52. He with a smile made answer, that in truth
53. 'Twas going far to seek disquietude;
54. But on the front of his reproof confessed
55. That he himself had oftentimes given way
56. To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,
57. That once in the stillness of a summer's noon,
58. While I was seated in a rocky cave
59. By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,
60. The famous history of the errant knight
61. Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts
62. Beset me, and to height unusual rose,
63. While listlessly I sate, and, having closed
64. The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea.
65. On poetry and geometric truth,
66. And their high privilege of lasting life,
67. From all internal injury exempt,
68. I mused; upon these chiefly: and at length,
69. My senses yielding to the sultry air,
70. Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream.
71. I saw before me stretched a boundless plain
72. Of sandy wilderness, all black and void,
73. And as I looked around, distress and fear
74. Came creeping over me, when at my side,
75. Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared
76. Upon a dromedary, mounted high.
77. He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:
78. A lance he bore, and underneath one arm
79. A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell
80. Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight
81. Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide
82. Was present, one who with unerring skill
83. Would through the desert lead me; and while yet
84. I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight
85. Which the new-comer carried through the waste
86. Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone
87. (To give it in the language of the dream)
88. Was 'Euclid's Elements,' and 'This,' said he,
89. 'Is something of more worth;' and at the word
90. Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,
91. In colour so resplendent, with command
92. That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,
93. And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,
94. Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,
95. A loud prophetic blast of harmony;
96. An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold
97. Destruction to the children of the earth
98. By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased
99. The song, than the Arab with calm look declared
100. That all would come to pass of which the voice
101. Had given forewarning, and that he himself
102. Was going then to bury those two books:
103. The one that held acquaintance with the stars,
104. And wedded soul to soul in purest bond
105. Of reason, undisturbed by space or time;
106. The other that was a god, yea many gods,
107. Had voices more than all the winds, with power
108. To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,
109. Through every clime, the heart of human kind.
110. While this was uttering, strange as it may seem,
111. I wondered not, although I plainly saw
112. The one to be a stone, the other a shell;
113. Nor doubted once but that they both were books,
114. Having a perfect faith in all that passed.
115. Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt
116. To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed
117. To share his enterprise, he hurried on
118. Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen,
119. For oftentimes he cast a backward look,
120. Grasping his twofold treasure.--Lance in rest,
121. He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now
122. He, to my fancy, had become the knight
123. Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,
124. But was an Arab of the desert too;
125. Of these was neither, and was both at once.
126. His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;
127. And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes
128. Saw, over half the wilderness diffused,
129. A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:
130. 'It is,' said he, 'the waters of the deep
131. Gathering upon us;' quickening then the pace
132. Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,
133. He left me: I called after him aloud;
134. He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge
135. Still in his grasp, before me, full in view,
136. Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,
137. With the fleet waters of a drowning world
138. In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,
139. And saw the sea before me, and the book,
140. In which I had been reading, at my side.

141. Full often, taking from the world of sleep
142. This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,
143. This semi-Quixote, I to him have given
144. A substance, fancied him a living man,
145. A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed
146. By love and feeling, and internal thought
147. Protracted among endless solitudes;
148. Have shaped him wandering upon this quest!
149. Nor have I pitied him; but rather felt
150. Reverence was due to a being thus employed;
151. And thought that, in the blind and awful lair
152. Of such a madness, reason did lie couched.
153. Enow there are on earth to take in charge
154. Their wives, their children, and their virgin loves,
155. Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;
156. Enow to stir for these; yea, will I say,
157. Contemplating in soberness the approach
158. Of an event so dire, by signs in earth
159. Or heaven made manifest, that I could share
160. That maniac's fond anxiety, and go
161. Upon like errand. Oftentimes at least
162. Me hath such strong entrancement overcome,
163. When I have held a volume in my hand,
164. Poor earthly casket of immortal verse,
165. Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine!

166. Great and benign, indeed, must be the power
167. Of living nature, which could thus so long
168. Detain me from the best of other guides
169. And dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,
170. Even in the time of lisping infancy;
171. And later down, in prattling childhood even,
172. While I was travelling back among those days,
173. How could I ever play an ingrate's part?
174. Once more should I have made those bowers resound,
175. By intermingling strains of thankfulness
176. With their own thoughtless melodies; at least
177. It might have well beseemed me to repeat
178. Some simply fashioned tale, to tell again,
179. In slender accents of sweet verse, some tale
180. That did bewitch me then, and soothes me now.
181. O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul,
182. Think not that I could pass along untouched
183. By these remembrances. Yet wherefore speak?
184. Why call upon a few weak words to say
185. What is already written in the hearts
186. Of all that breathe?--what in the path of all
187. Drops daily from the tongue of every child,
188. Wherever man is found? The trickling tear
189. Upon the cheek of listening Infancy
190. Proclaims it, and the insuperable look
191. That drinks as if it never could be full.

192. That portion of my story I shall leave
193. There registered: whatever else of power
194. Or pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may be
195. Peculiar to myself, let that remain
196. Where still it works, though hidden from all search
197. Among the depths of time. Yet is it just
198. That here, in memory of all books which lay
199. Their sure foundations in the heart of man,
200. Whether by native prose, or numerous verse,
201. That in the name of all inspired souls--
202. From Homer the great Thunderer, from the voice
203. That roars along the bed of Jewish song,
204. And that more varied and elaborate,
205. Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake
206. Our shores in England,--from those loftiest notes
207. Down to the low and wren-like warblings, made
208. For cottagers and spinners at the wheel,
209. And sun-burnt travellers resting their tired limbs,
210. Stretched under wayside hedge-rows, ballad tunes,
211. Food for the hungry ears of little ones,
212. And of old men who have survived their joys--
213. 'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works,
214. And of the men that framed them, whether known
215. Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves,
216. That I should here assert their rights, attest
217. Their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce
218. Their benediction; speak of them as Powers
219. For ever to be hallowed; only less,
220. For what we are and what we may become,
221. Than Nature's self, which is the breath of God,
222. Or His pure Word by miracle revealed.

223. Rarely and with reluctance would I stoop
224. To transitory themes; yet I rejoice,
225. And, by these thoughts admonished, will pour out
226. Thanks with uplifted heart, that I was reared
227. Safe from an evil which these days have laid
228. Upon the children of the land, a pest
229. That might have dried me up, body and soul.
230. This verse is dedicate to Nature's self,
231. And things that teach as Nature teaches: then,
232. Oh! where had been the Man, the Poet where,
233. Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!
234. If in the season of unperilous choice,
235. In lieu of wandering, as we did, through vales
236. Rich with indigenous produce, open ground
237. Of Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,
238. We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed,
239. Each in his several melancholy walk
240. Stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed,
241. Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude;
242. Or rather like a stalled ox debarred
243. From touch of growing grass, that may not taste
244. A flower till it have yielded up its sweets
245. A prelibation to the mower's scythe.

246. Behold the parent hen amid her brood,
247. Though fledged and feathered, and well pleased to part
248. And straggle from her presence, still a brood,
249. And she herself from the maternal bond
250. Still undischarged; yet doth she little more
251. Than move with them in tenderness and love,
252. A centre to the circle which they make;
253. And now and then, alike from need of theirs
254. And call of her own natural appetites,
255. She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food,
256. Which they partake at pleasure. Early died
257. My honoured Mother, she who was the heart
258. And hinge of all our learnings and our loves:
259. She left us destitute, and, as we might,
260. Trooping together. Little suits it me
261. To break upon the sabbath of her rest
262. With any thought that looks at others' blame;
263. Nor would I praise her but in perfect love.
264. Hence am I checked: but let me boldly say,
265. In gratitude, and for the sake of truth,
266. Unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught,
267. Fetching her goodness rather from times past,
268. Than shaping novelties for times to come,
269. Had no presumption, no such jealousy,
270. Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust
271. Our nature, but had virtual faith that He
272. Who fills the mother's breast with innocent milk,
273. Doth also for our nobler part provide,
274. Under His great correction and control,
275. As innocent instincts, and as innocent food;
276. Or draws, for minds that are left free to trust
277. In the simplicities of opening life,
278. Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds.
279. This was her creed, and therefore she was pure
280. From anxious fear of error or mishap,
281. And evil, overweeningly so called;
282. Was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes,
283. Nor selfish with unnecessary cares,
284. Nor with impatience from the season asked
285. More than its timely produce; rather loved
286. The hours for what they are, than from regard
287. Glanced on their promises in restless pride.
288. Such was she--not from faculties more strong
289. Than others have, but from the times, perhaps,
290. And spot in which she lived, and through a grace
291. Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness,
292. A heart that found benignity and hope,
293. Being itself benign.
294. My drift I fear
295. Is scarcely obvious; but, that common sense
296. May try this modern system by its fruits,
297. Leave let me take to place before her sight
298. A specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand.
299. Full early trained to worship seemliness,
300. This model of a child is never known
301. To mix in quarrels; that were far beneath
302. Its dignity; with gifts he bubbles o'er
303. As generous as a fountain; selfishness
304. May not come near him, nor the little throng
305. Of flitting pleasures tempt him from his path;
306. The wandering beggars propagate his name,
307. Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun,
308. And natural or supernatural fear,
309. Unless it leap upon him in a dream,
310. Touches him not. To enhance the wonder, see
311. How arch his notices, how nice his sense
312. Of the ridiculous; not blind is he
313. To the broad follies of the licensed world,
314. Yet innocent himself withal, though shrewd,
315. And can read lectures upon innocence;
316. A miracle of scientific lore,
317. Ships he can guide across the pathless sea,
318. And tell you all their cunning; he can read
319. The inside of the earth, and spell the stars;
320. He knows the policies of foreign lands;
321. Can string you names of districts, cities, towns,
322. The whole world over, tight as beads of dew
323. Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs;
324. All things are put to question; he must live
325. Knowing that he grows wiser every day
326. Or else not live at all, and seeing too
327. Each little drop of wisdom as it falls
328. Into the dimpling cistern of his heart:
329. For this unnatural growth the trainer blame,
330. Pity the tree.--Poor human vanity,
331. Wert thou extinguished, little would be left
332. Which he could truly love; but how escape?
333. For, ever as a thought of purer birth
334. Rises to lead him toward a better clime,
335. Some intermeddler still is on the watch
336. To drive him back, and pound him, like a stray,
337. Within the pinfold of his own conceit.
338. Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find
339. The playthings, which her love designed for him,
340. Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowers
341. Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn.
342. Oh! give us once again the wishing-cap
343. Of Fortunatus, and the invisible coat
344. Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood,
345. And Sabra in the forest with St. George!
346. The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap
347. One precious gain, that he forgets himself.

348. These mighty workmen of our later age,
349. Who, with a broad highway, have overbridged
350. The froward chaos of futurity,
351. Tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill
352. To manage books, and things, and make them act
353. On infant minds as surely as the sun
354. Deals with a flower; the keepers of our time,
355. The guides and wardens of our faculties,
356. Sages who in their prescience would control
357. All accidents, and to the very road
358. Which they have fashioned would confine us down,
359. Like engines; when will their presumption learn,
360. That in the unreasoning progress of the world
361. A wiser spirit is at work for us,
362. A better eye than theirs, most prodigal
363. Of blessings, and most studious of our good,
364. Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours?

365. There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs
366. And islands of Winander!--many a time
367. At evening, when the earliest stars began
368. To move along the edges of the hills,
369. Rising or setting, would he stand alone
370. Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,

371. And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
372. Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth
373. Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
374. Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,
375. That they might answer him; and they would shout
376. Across the watery vale, and shout again,
377. Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,
378. And long halloos and screams, and echoes loud,
379. Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild
380. Of jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause
381. Of silence came and baffled his best skill,
382. Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung
383. Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise
384. Has carried far into his heart the voice
385. Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene
386. Would enter unawares into his mind,
387. With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,
388. Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received
389. Into the bosom of the steady lake.

390. This Boy was taken from his mates, and died
391. In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.
392. Fair is the spot, most beautiful the vale
393. Where he was born; the grassy churchyard hangs
394. Upon a slope above the village school,
395. And through that churchyard when my way has led
396. On summer evenings, I believe that there
397. A long half hour together I have stood
398. Mute, looking at the grave in which he lies!
399. Even now appears before the mind's clear eye
400. That self-same village church; I see her sit
401. (The throned Lady whom erewhile we hailed)
402. On her green hill, forgetful of this Boy
403. Who slumbers at her feet,--forgetful, too,
404. Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves,
405. And listening only to the gladsome sounds
406. That, from the rural school ascending, play
407. Beneath her and about her. May she long
408. Behold a race of young ones like to those
409. With whom I herded!--(easily, indeed,
410. We might have fed upon a fatter soil
411. Of arts and letters--but be that forgiven)--
412. A race of real children; not too wise,
413. Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,
414. And bandied up and down by love and hate;
415. Not unresentful where self-justified;
416. Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;
417. Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;
418. Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft
419. Bending beneath our life's mysterious weight
420. Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not
421. In happiness to the happiest upon earth.
422. Simplicity in habit, truth in speech,
423. Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;
424. May books and Nature be their early joy!
425. And knowledge, rightly honoured with that name--
426. Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power!

427. Well do I call to mind the very week
428. When I was first intrusted to the care
429. Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores,
430. And brooks were like a dream of novelty
431. To my half-infant thoughts; that very week,
432. While I was roving up and down alone,
433. Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross
434. One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,
435. Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake:
436. Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom
437. Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore
438. A heap of garments, as if left by one
439. Who might have there been bathing. Long I watched,
440. But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake
441. Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,
442. And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped
443. The breathless stillness. The succeeding day,
444. Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale
445. Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked
446. In passive expectation from the shore,
447. While from a boat others hung o'er the deep,
448. Sounding with grappling irons and long poles.
449. At last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene
450. Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright
451. Rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape
452. Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,
453. Young as I was, a child not nine years old,
454. Possessed me, for my inner eye had seen
455. Such sights before, among the shining streams
456. Of faery land, the forest of romance.
457. Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle
458. With decoration of ideal grace;
459. A dignity, a smoothness, like the works
460. Of Grecian art, and purest poesy.

461. A precious treasure had I long possessed,
462. A little yellow, canvas-covered book,
463. A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;
464. And, from companions in a new abode,
465. When first I learnt, that this dear prize of mine
466. Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry--
467. That there were four large volumes, laden all
468. With kindred matter, 'twas to me, in truth,
469. A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,
470. With one not richer than myself, I made
471. A covenant that each should lay aside
472. The moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,
473. Till our joint savings had amassed enough
474. To make this book our own. Through several months,
475. In spite of all temptation, we preserved
476. Religiously that vow; but firmness failed,
477. Nor were we ever masters of our wish.

478. And when thereafter to my father's house
479. The holidays returned me, there to find
480. That golden store of books which I had left,
481. What joy was mine! How often in the course
482. Of those glad respites, though a soft west wind
483. Ruffled the waters to the angler's wish,
484. For a whole day together, have I lain
485. Down by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream,
486. On the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,
487. And there have read, devouring as I read,
488. Defrauding the day's glory, desperate!
489. Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach,
490. Such as an idler deals with in his shame,
491. I to the sport betook myself again.

492. A gracious spirit o'er this earth presides,
493. And o'er the heart of man; invisibly
494. It comes, to works of unreproved delight,
495. And tendency benign, directing those
496. Who care not, know not, think not, what they do.
497. The tales that charm away the wakeful night
498. In Araby, romances; legends penned
499. For solace by dim light of monkish lamps;
500. Fictions, for ladies of their love, devised
501. By youthful squires; adventures endless, spun
502. By the dismantled warrior in old age,
503. Out of the bowels of those very schemes
504. In which his youth did first extravagate;
505. These spread like day, and something in the shape
506. Of these will live till man shall be no more.
507. Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,
508. And 'they must' have their food. Our childhood sits,
509. Our simple childhood, sits upon a throne
510. That hath more power than all the elements.
511. I guess not what this tells of Being past,
512. Nor what it augurs of the life to come;
513. But so it is; and, in that dubious hour--
514. That twilight--when we first begin to see
515. This dawning earth, to recognise, expect,
516. And, in the long probation that ensues,
517. The time of trial, ere we learn to live
518. In reconcilement with our stinted powers;
519. To endure this state of meagre vassalage,
520. Unwilling to forego, confess, submit,
521. Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows
522. To custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamed
523. And humbled down--oh! then we feel, we feel,
524. We know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then,
525. Forgers of daring tales! we bless you then,
526. Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape
527. Philosophy will call you: 'then' we feel
528. With what, and how great might ye are in league,
529. Who make our wish, our power, our thought a deed,
530. An empire, a possession,--ye whom time
531. And seasons serve; all Faculties to whom
532. Earth crouches, the elements are potter's clay,
533. Space like a heaven filled up with northern lights,
534. Here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once.

535. Relinquishing this lofty eminence
536. For ground, though humbler, not the less a tract
537. Of the same isthmus, which our spirits cross
538. In progress from their native continent
539. To earth and human life, the Song might dwell
540. On that delightful time of growing youth,
541. When craving for the marvellous gives way
542. To strengthening love for things that we have seen;
543. When sober truth and steady sympathies,
544. Offered to notice by less daring pens,
545. Take firmer hold of us, and words themselves
546. Move us with conscious pleasure.
547. I am sad
548. At thought of rapture now for ever flown;
549. Almost to tears I sometimes could be sad
550. To think of, to read over, many a page,
551. Poems withal of name, which at that time
552. Did never fail to entrance me, and are now
553. Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre
554. Fresh emptied of spectators. Twice five years
555. Or less I might have seen, when first my mind
556. With conscious pleasure opened to the charm
557. Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet
558. For their own 'sakes', a passion, and a power;
559. And phrases pleased me chosen for delight,
560. For pomp, or love. Oft, in the public roads
561. Yet unfrequented, while the morning light
562. Was yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad
563. With a dear friend, and for the better part
564. Of two delightful hours we strolled along
565. By the still borders of the misty lake,
566. Repeating favourite verses with one voice,
567. Or conning more, as happy as the birds
568. That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad,
569. Lifted above the ground by airy fancies,
570. More bright than madness or the dreams of wine;
571. And, though full oft the objects of our love
572. Were false, and in their splendour overwrought,
573. Yet was there surely then no vulgar power
574. Working within us,--nothing less, in truth,
575. Than that most noble attribute of man,
576. Though yet untutored and inordinate,
577. That wish for something loftier, more adorned,
578. Than is the common aspect, daily garb,
579. Of human life. What wonder, then, if sounds
580. Of exultation echoed through the groves!
581. For, images, and sentiments, and words,
582. And everything encountered or pursued
583. In that delicious world of poesy,
584. Kept holiday, a never-ending show,
585. With music, incense, festival, and flowers!

586. Here must we pause: this only let me add,
587. From heart-experience, and in humblest sense
588. Of modesty, that he, who in his youth
589. A daily wanderer among woods and fields
590. With living Nature hath been intimate,
591. Not only in that raw unpractised time
592. Is stirred to ecstasy, as others are,
593. By glittering verse; but further, doth receive,
594. In measure only dealt out to himself,
595. Knowledge and increase of enduring joy
596. From the great Nature that exists in works
597. Of mighty Poets. Visionary power
598. Attends the motions of the viewless winds,
599. Embodied in the mystery of words:
600. There, darkness makes abode, and all the host
601. Of shadowy things work endless changes,--there,
602. As in a mansion like their proper home,
603. Even forms and substances are circumfused
604. By that transparent veil with light divine,
605. And, through the turnings intricate of verse,
606. Present themselves as objects recognised,
607. In flashes, and with glory not their own.
