1. LOOK now on that Adventurer who hath paid
2. His vows to Fortune; who, in cruel slight
3. Of virtuous hope, of liberty, and right,
4. Hath followed wheresoe'er a way was made
5. By the blind Goddess,--ruthless, undismayed;
6. And so hath gained at length a prosperous height,
7. Round which the elements of worldly might
8. Beneath his haughty feet, like clouds, are laid.
9. O joyless power that stands by lawless force!
10. Curses are 'his' dire portion, scorn, and hate,
11. Internal darkness and unquiet breath;
12. And, if old judgments keep their sacred course,
13. Him from that height shall Heaven precipitate
14. By violent and ignominious death.
