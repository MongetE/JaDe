1. I

2. In distant countries have I been,
3. And yet I have not often seen
4. A healthy man, a man full grown,
5. Weep in the public roads, alone.
6. But such a one, on English ground,
7. And in the broad highway, I met;
8. Along the broad highway he came,
9. His cheeks with tears were wet:
10. Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad;
11. And in his arms a Lamb he had.

12. II

13. He saw me, and he turned aside,
14. As if he wished himself to hide:
15. And with his coat did then essay
16. To wipe those briny tears away.
17. I followed him, and said, 'My friend,
18. What ails you? wherefore weep you so?'
19. --'Shame on me, Sir! this lusty Lamb,
20. He makes my tears to flow.
21. To-day I fetched him from the rock;
22. He is the last of all my flock,

23. III

24. 'When I was young, a single man,
25. And after youthful follies ran,
26. Though little given to care and thought,
27. Yet, so it was, an ewe I bought;
28. And other sheep from her I raised,
29. As healthy sheep as you might see;
30. And then I married, and was rich
31. As I could wish to be;
32. Of sheep I numbered a full score,
33. And every year increased my store.

34. IV

35. 'Year after year my stock it grew;
36. And from this one, this single ewe,
37. Full fifty comely sheep I raised,
38. As fine a flock as ever grazed!
39. Upon the Quantock hills they fed;
40. They throve, and we at home did thrive:
41. --This lusty Lamb of all my store
42. Is all that is alive;
43. And now I care not if we die,
44. And perish all of poverty.

45. V

46. 'Six Children, Sir! had I to feed;
47. Hard labour in a time of need!
48. My pride was tamed, and in our grief
49. I of the Parish asked relief.
50. They said, I was a wealthy man;
51. My sheep upon the uplands fed,
52. And it was fit that thence I took
53. Whereof to buy us bread.
54. 'Do this: how can we give to you,'
55. They cried, 'what to the poor is due?'

56. VI

57. 'I sold a sheep, as they had said,
58. And bought my little children bread,
59. And they were healthy with their food
60. For me--it never did me good.
61. A woeful time it was for me,
62. To see the end of all my gains,
63. The pretty flock which I had reared
64. With all my care and pains,
65. To see it melt like snow away--
66. For me it was a woeful day.

67. VII

68. 'Another still! and still another!
69. A little lamb, and then its mother!
70. It was a vein that never stopped--
71. Like blood-drops from my heart they dropped.
72. 'Till thirty were not left alive
73. They dwindled, dwindled, one by one
74. And I may say, that many a time
75. I wished they all were gone--
76. Reckless of what might come at last
77. Were but the bitter struggle past.

78. VIII

79. 'To wicked deeds I was inclined,
80. And wicked fancies crossed my mind;
81. And every man I chanced to see,
82. I thought he knew some ill of me:
83. No peace, no comfort could I find,
84. No ease, within doors or without;
85. And, crazily and wearily
86. I went my work about;
87. And oft was moved to flee from home,
88. And hide my head where wild beasts roam.

89. IX

90. 'Sir! 'twas a precious flock to me,
91. As dear as my own children be;
92. For daily with my growing store
93. I loved my children more and more.
94. Alas! it was an evil time;
95. God cursed me in my sore distress;
96. I prayed, yet every day I thought
97. I loved my children less;
98. And every week, and every day,
99. My flock it seemed to melt away.

100. X

101. 'They dwindled, Sir, sad sight to see!
102. From ten to five, from five to three,
103. A lamb, a wether, and a ewe;--
104. And then at last from three to two;
105. And, of my fifty, yesterday
106. I had but only one:
107. And here it lies upon my arm,
108. Alas! and I have none;--
109. To-day I fetched it from the rock;
110. It is the last of all my flock.'
