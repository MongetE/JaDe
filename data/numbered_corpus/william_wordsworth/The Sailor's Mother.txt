1. ONE morning (raw it was and wet---
2. A foggy day in winter time)
3. A Woman on the road I met,
4. Not old, though something past her prime:
5. Majestic in her person, tall and straight;
6. And like a Roman matron's was her mien and gait.

7. The ancient spirit is not dead;
8. Old times, thought I, are breathing there;
9. Proud was I that my country bred
10. Such strength, a dignity so fair:
11. She begged an alms, like one in poor estate;
12. I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate.

13. When from these lofty thoughts I woke,
14. 'What is it,' said I, 'that you bear,
15. Beneath the covert of your Cloak,
16. Protected from this cold damp air? '
17. She anwered, soon as she the question heard,
18. 'A simple burthen, Sir, a little Singing-bird.'

19. And, thus continuing, she said,
20. 'I had a Son, who many a day
21. Sailed on the seas, but he is dead;
22. In Denmark he was cast away:
23. And I have travelled weary miles to see
24. If aught which he had owned might still remain for me.

25. The bird and cage they both were his:
26. 'Twas my Son's bird; and neat and trim
27. He kept it: many voyages
28. The singing-bird had gone with him;
29. When last he sailed, he left the bird behind;
30. From bodings, as might be, that hung upon his mind.

31. He to a fellow-lodger's care
32. Had left it, to be watched and fed,
33. And pipe its song in safety;---there
34. I found it when my Son was dead;
35. And now, God help me for my little wit!
36. I bear it with me, Sir;---he took so much delight in it.'
