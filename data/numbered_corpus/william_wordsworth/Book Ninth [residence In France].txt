1. EVEN as a river,--partly (it might seem)
2. Yielding to old remembrances, and swayed
3. In part by fear to shape a way direct,
4. That would engulph him soon in the ravenous sea--
5. Turns, and will measure back his course, far back,
6. Seeking the very regions which he crossed
7. In his first outset; so have we, my Friend!
8. Turned and returned with intricate delay.
9. Or as a traveller, who has gained the brow
10. Of some aerial Down, while there he halts
11. For breathing-time, is tempted to review
12. The region left behind him; and, if aught
13. Deserving notice have escaped regard,
14. Or been regarded with too careless eye,
15. Strives, from that height, with one and yet one more
16. Last look, to make the best amends he may:
17. So have we lingered. Now we start afresh
18. With courage, and new hope risen on our toil.
19. Fair greetings to this shapeless eagerness,
20. Whene'er it comes! needful in work so long,
21. Thrice needful to the argument which now
22. Awaits us! Oh, how much unlike the past!

23. Free as a colt at pasture on the hill,
24. I ranged at large, through London's wide domain,
25. Month after month. Obscurely did I live,
26. Not seeking frequent intercourse with men,
27. By literature, or elegance, or rank,
28. Distinguished. Scarcely was a year thus spent
29. Ere I forsook the crowded solitude,
30. With less regret for its luxurious pomp,
31. And all the nicely-guarded shows of art,
32. Than for the humble book-stalls in the streets,
33. Exposed to eye and hand where'er I turned.

34. France lured me forth; the realm that I had crossed
35. So lately, journeying toward the snow-clad Alps.
36. But now, relinquishing the scrip and staff,
37. And all enjoyment which the summer sun
38. Sheds round the steps of those who meet the day
39. With motion constant as his own, I went
40. Prepared to sojourn in a pleasant town,
41. Washed by the current of the stately Loire.

42. Through Paris lay my readiest course, and there
43. Sojourning a few days, I visited
44. In haste, each spot of old or recent fame,
45. The latter chiefly, from the field of Mars
46. Down to the suburbs of St. Antony,
47. And from Mont Martre southward to the Dome
48. Of Genevieve. In both her clamorous Halls,
49. The National Synod and the Jacobins,
50. I saw the Revolutionary Power
51. Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms;
52. The Arcades I traversed, in the Palace huge
53. Of Orleans; coasted round and round the line
54. Of Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop,
55. Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk
56. Of all who had a purpose, or had not;
57. I stared and listened, with a stranger's ears,
58. To Hawkers and Haranguers, hubbub wild!
59. And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes,
60. In knots, or pairs, or single. Not a look
61. Hope takes, or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear,
62. But seemed there present; and I scanned them all,
63. Watched every gesture uncontrollable,
64. Of anger, and vexation, and despite,
65. All side by side, and struggling face to face,
66. With gaiety and dissolute idleness.

67. Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust
68. Of the Bastille, I sate in the open sun,
69. And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,
70. And pocketed the relic, in the guise
71. Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth,
72. I looked for something that I could not find,
73. Affecting more emotion than I felt;
74. For 'tis most certain, that these various sights,
75. However potent their first shock, with me
76. Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains
77. Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun,
78. A beauty exquisitely wrought, with hair
79. Dishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheek
80. Pale and bedropped with overflowing tears.

81. But hence to my more permanent abode
82. I hasten; there, by novelties in speech,
83. Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks,
84. And all the attire of ordinary life,
85. Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,
86. I stood 'mid those concussions, unconcerned,
87. Tranquil almost, and careless as a flower
88. Glassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrub
89. That spreads its leaves in unmolested peace,
90. While every bush and tree, the country through,
91. Is shaking to the roots: indifference this
92. Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared
93. With needful knowledge, had abruptly passed
94. Into a theatre, whose stage was filled
95. And busy with an action far advanced.
96. Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read
97. With care, the master pamphlets of the day;
98. Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild
99. Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk
100. And public news; but having never seen
101. A chronicle that might suffice to show
102. Whence the main organs of the public power
103. Had sprung, their transmigrations, when and how
104. Accomplished, giving thus unto events
105. A form and body; all things were to me
106. Loose and disjointed, and the affections left
107. Without a vital interest. At that time,
108. Moreover, the first storm was overblown,
109. And the strong hand of outward violence
110. Locked up in quiet. For myself, I fear
111. Now, in connection with so great a theme,
112. To speak (as I must be compelled to do)
113. Of one so unimportant; night by night
114. Did I frequent the formal haunts of men,
115. Whom, in the city, privilege of birth
116. Sequestered from the rest, societies
117. Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed;
118. Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourse
119. Of good and evil of the time was shunned
120. With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon
121. Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew
122. Into a noisier world, and thus ere long
123. Became a patriot; and my heart was all
124. Given to the people, and my love was theirs.

125. A band of military Officers,
126. Then stationed in the city, were the chief
127. Of my associates: some of these wore swords
128. That had been seasoned in the wars, and all
129. Were men well-born; the chivalry of France.
130. In age and temper differing, they had yet
131. One spirit ruling in each heart; alike
132. (Save only one, hereafter to be named)
133. Were bent upon undoing what was done:
134. This was their rest and only hope; therewith
135. No fear had they of bad becoming worse,
136. For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,
137. Or deemed it worth a moment's thought to stir,
138. In anything, save only as the act
139. Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,
140. Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile
141. He had sate lord in many tender hearts;
142. Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:
143. His temper was quite mastered by the times,
144. And they had blighted him, had eaten away
145. The beauty of his person, doing wrong
146. Alike to body and to mind: his port,
147. Which once had been erect and open, now
148. Was stooping and contracted, and a face,
149. Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts
150. Of symmetry and light and bloom, expressed,
151. As much as any that was ever seen,
152. A ravage out of season, made by thoughts
153. Unhealthy and vexatious. With the hour,
154. That from the press of Paris duly brought
155. Its freight of public news, the fever came,
156. A punctual visitant, to shake this man,
157. Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek
158. Into a thousand colours; while he read,
159. Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch
160. Continually, like an uneasy place
161. In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour
162. Of universal ferment; mildest men
163. Were agitated, and commotions, strife
164. Of passion and opinion, filled the walls
165. Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds.
166. The soil of common life was, at that time,
167. Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,
168. And not then only, 'What a mockery this
169. Of history, the past and that to come!
170. Now do I feel how all men are deceived,
171. Reading of nations and their works, in faith,
172. Faith given to vanity and emptiness;
173. Oh! laughter for the page that would reflect
174. To future times the face of what now is!'
175. The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain
176. Devoured by locusts,--Carra, Gorsas,--add
177. A hundred other names, forgotten now,
178. Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers,
179. Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,
180. And felt through every nook of town and field.

181. Such was the state of things. Meanwhile the chief
182. Of my associates stood prepared for flight
183. To augment the band of emigrants in arms
184. Upon the borders of the Rhine, and leagued
185. With foreign foes mustered for instant war.
186. This was their undisguised intent, and they
187. Were waiting with the whole of their desires
188. The moment to depart.
189. An Englishman,
190. Born in a land whose very name appeared
191. To license some unruliness of mind;
192. A stranger, with youth's further privilege,
193. And the indulgence that a half-learnt speech
194. Wins from the courteous; I, who had been else
195. Shunned and not tolerated, freely lived
196. With these defenders of the Crown, and talked,
197. And heard their notions; nor did they disdain
198. The wish to bring me over to their cause.

199. But though untaught by thinking or by books
200. To reason well of polity or law,
201. And nice distinctions, then on every tongue,
202. Of natural rights and civil; and to acts
203. Of nations and their passing interests,
204. (If with unworldly ends and aims compared)
205. Almost indifferent, even the historian's tale
206. Prizing but little otherwise than I prized
207. Tales of the poets, as it made the heart
208. Beat high, and filled the fancy with fair forms,
209. Old heroes and their sufferings and their deeds;
210. Yet in the regal sceptre, and the pomp
211. Of orders and degrees, I nothing found
212. Then, or had ever, even in crudest youth,
213. That dazzled me, but rather what I mourned
214. And ill could brook, beholding that the best
215. Ruled not, and feeling that they ought to rule.

216. For, born in a poor district, and which yet
217. Retaineth more of ancient homeliness,
218. Than any other nook of English ground,
219. It was my fortune scarcely to have seen,
220. Through the whole tenor of my school-day time,
221. The face of one, who, whether boy or man,
222. Was vested with attention or respect
223. Through claims of wealth or blood; nor was it least
224. Of many benefits, in later years
225. Derived from academic institutes
226. And rules, that they held something up to view
227. Of a Republic, where all stood thus far
228. Upon equal ground; that we were brothers all
229. In honour, as in one community,
230. Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,
231. Distinction open lay to all that came,
232. And wealth and titles were in less esteem
233. Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry,
234. Add unto this, subservience from the first
235. To presences of God's mysterious power
236. Made manifest in Nature's sovereignty,
237. And fellowship with venerable books,
238. To sanction the proud workings of the soul,
239. And mountain liberty. It could not be
240. But that one tutored thus should look with awe
241. Upon the faculties of man, receive
242. Gladly the highest promises, and hail,
243. As best, the government of equal rights
244. And individual worth. And hence, O Friend!
245. If at the first great outbreak I rejoiced
246. Less than might well befit my youth, the cause
247. In part lay here, that unto me the events
248. Seemed nothing out of nature's certain course,
249. A gift that was come rather late than soon.
250. No wonder, then, if advocates like these,
251. Inflamed by passion, blind with prejudice,
252. And stung with injury, at this riper day,
253. Were impotent to make my hopes put on
254. The shape of theirs, my understanding bend
255. In honour to their honour: zeal, which yet
256. Had slumbered, now in opposition burst
257. Forth like a Polar summer: every word
258. They uttered was a dart, by counter-winds
259. Blown back upon themselves; their reason seemed
260. Confusion-stricken by a higher power
261. Than human understanding, their discourse
262. Maimed, spiritless; and, in their weakness strong,
263. I triumphed.
264. Meantime, day by day, the roads
265. Were crowded with the bravest youth of France,
266. And all the promptest of her spirits, linked
267. In gallant soldiership, and posting on
268. To meet the war upon her frontier bounds.
269. Yet at this very moment do tears start
270. Into mine eyes: I do not say I weep--
271. I wept not then,--but tears have dimmed my sight,
272. In memory of the farewells of that time,
273. Domestic severings, female fortitude
274. At dearest separation, patriot love
275. And self-devotion, and terrestrial hope,
276. Encouraged with a martyr's confidence;
277. Even files of strangers merely seen but once,
278. And for a moment, men from far with sound
279. Of music, martial tunes, and banners spread,
280. Entering the city, here and there a face,
281. Or person, singled out among the rest,
282. Yet still a stranger and beloved as such;
283. Even by these passing spectacles my heart
284. Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemed
285. Arguments sent from Heaven to prove the cause
286. Good, pure, which no one could stand up against,
287. Who was not lost, abandoned, selfish, proud,
288. Mean, miserable, wilfully depraved,
289. Hater perverse of equity and truth.

290. Among that band of Officers was one,
291. Already hinted at, of other mould--
292. A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,
293. And with an oriental loathing spurned,
294. As of a different caste. A meeker man
295. Than this lived never, nor a more benign,
296. Meek though enthusiastic. Injuries
297. Made 'him' more gracious, and his nature then
298. Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,
299. As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,
300. When foot hath crushed them. He through the events
301. Of that great change wandered in perfect faith,
302. As through a book, an old romance, or tale
303. Of Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought
304. Behind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked
305. With the most noble, but unto the poor
306. Among mankind he was in service bound,
307. As by some tie invisible, oaths professed
308. To a religious order. Man he loved
309. As man; and, to the mean and the obscure,
310. And all the homely in their homely works,
311. Transferred a courtesy which had no air
312. Of condescension; but did rather seem
313. A passion and a gallantry, like that
314. Which he, a soldier, in his idler day
315. Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,
316. Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,
317. But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy
318. Diffused around him, while he was intent
319. On works of love or freedom, or revolved
320. Complacently the progress of a cause,
321. Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek
322. And placid, and took nothing from the man
323. That was delightful. Oft in solitude
324. With him did I discourse about the end
325. Of civil government, and its wisest forms;
326. Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,
327. Custom and habit, novelty and change;
328. Of self-respect, and virtue in the few
329. For patrimonial honour set apart,
330. And ignorance in the labouring multitude.
331. For he, to all intolerance indisposed,
332. Balanced these contemplations in his mind;
333. And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped
334. Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment
335. Than later days allowed; carried about me,
336. With less alloy to its integrity,
337. The experience of past ages, as, through help
338. Of books and common life, it makes sure way
339. To youthful minds, by objects over near
340. Not pressed upon, nor dazzled or misled
341. By struggling with the crowd for present ends.

342. But though not deaf, nor obstinate to find
343. Error without excuse upon the side
344. Of them who strove against us, more delight
345. We took, and let this freely be confessed,
346. In painting to ourselves the miseries
347. Of royal courts, and that voluptuous life
348. Unfeeling, where the man who is of soul
349. The meanest thrives the most; where dignity,
350. True personal dignity, abideth not;
351. A light, a cruel, and vain world cut off
352. From the natural inlets of just sentiment,
353. From lowly sympathy and chastening truth;
354. Where good and evil interchange their names,
355. And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired
356. With vice at home. We added dearest themes--
357. Man and his noble nature, as it is
358. The gift which God has placed within his power,
359. His blind desires and steady faculties
360. Capable of clear truth, the one to break
361. Bondage, the other to build liberty
362. On firm foundations, making social life,
363. Through knowledge spreading and imperishable,
364. As just in regulation, and as pure
365. As individual in the wise and good.

366. We summoned up the honourable deeds
367. Of ancient Story, thought of each bright spot,
368. That would be found in all recorded time,
369. Of truth preserved and error passed away;
370. Of single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,
371. And how the multitudes of men will feed
372. And fan each other; thought of sects, how keen
373. They are to put the appropriate nature on,
374. Triumphant over every obstacle
375. Of custom, language, country, love, or hate,
376. And what they do and suffer for their creed;
377. How far they travel, and how long endure;
378. How quickly mighty Nations have been formed,
379. From least beginnings; how, together locked
380. By new opinions, scattered tribes have made
381. One body, spreading wide as clouds in heaven.
382. To aspirations then of our own minds
383. Did we appeal; and, finally, beheld
384. A living confirmation of the whole
385. Before us, in a people from the depth
386. Of shameful imbecility uprisen,
387. Fresh as the morning star. Elate we looked
388. Upon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,
389. Self-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,
390. And continence of mind, and sense of right,
391. Uppermost in the midst of fiercest strife.

392. Oh, sweet it is, in academic groves,
393. Or such retirement, Friend! as we have known
394. In the green dales beside our Rotha's stream,
395. Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,
396. To ruminate, with interchange of talk,
397. On rational liberty, and hope in man,
398. Justice and peace. But far more sweet such toil--
399. Toil, say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse--
400. If nature then be standing on the brink
401. Of some great trial, and we hear the voice
402. Of one devoted,--one whom circumstance
403. Hath called upon to embody his deep sense
404. In action, give it outwardly a shape,
405. And that of benediction, to the world.
406. Then doubt is not, and truth is more than truth,--
407. A hope it is, and a desire; a creed
408. Of zeal, by an authority Divine
409. Sanctioned, of danger, difficulty, or death.
410. Such conversation, under Attic shades,
411. Did Dion hold with Plato; ripened thus
412. For a Deliverer's glorious task,--and such
413. He, on that ministry already bound,
414. Held with Eudemus and Timonides,
415. Surrounded by adventurers in arms,
416. When those two vessels with their daring freight,
417. For the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow,
418. Sailed from Zacynthus,--philosophic war,
419. Led by Philosophers. With harder fate,
420. Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend!
421. Of whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the name
422. Stand near the worthiest of Antiquity)
423. Fashioned his life; and many a long discourse,
424. With like persuasion honoured, we maintained:
425. He, on his part, accoutred for the worst,
426. He perished fighting, in supreme command,
427. Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,
428. For liberty, against deluded men,
429. His fellow-countrymen; and yet most blessed
430. In this, that he the fate of later times
431. Lived not to see, nor what we now behold,
432. Who have as ardent hearts as he had then.

433. Along that very Loire, with festal mirth
434. Resounding at all hours, and innocent yet
435. Of civil slaughter, was our frequent walk;
436. Or in wide forests of continuous shade,
437. Lofty and over-arched, with open space
438. Beneath the trees, clear footing many a mile--
439. A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts,
440. From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,
441. And let remembrance steal to other times,
442. When, o'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad,
443. And smooth as marble or a waveless sea,
444. Some Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace
445. In sylvan meditation undisturbed;
446. As on the pavement of a Gothic church
447. Walks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,
448. In peace and silence. But if e'er was heard,--
449. Heard, though unseen,--a devious traveller,
450. Retiring or approaching from afar
451. With speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs
452. From the hard floor reverberated, then
453. It was Angelica thundering through the woods
454. Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maid
455. Erminia, fugitive as fair as she.
456. Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knights
457. Joust underneath the trees, that as in storm
458. Rocked high above their heads; anon, the din
459. Of boisterous merriment, and music's roar,
460. In sudden proclamation, burst from haunt
461. Of Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance
462. Rejoicing o'er a female in the midst,
463. A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall.
464. The width of those huge forests, unto me
465. A novel scene, did often in this way
466. Master my fancy while I wandered on
467. With that revered companion. And sometimes--
468. When to a convent in a meadow green,
469. By a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,
470. And not by reverential touch of Time
471. Dismantled, but by violence abrupt--
472. In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies,
473. In spite of real fervour, and of that
474. Less genuine and wrought up within myself--
475. I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh,
476. And for the Matin-bell to sound no more
477. Grieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross
478. High on the topmost pinnacle, a sign
479. (How welcome to the weary traveller's eyes!)
480. Of hospitality and peaceful rest.
481. And when the partner of those varied walks
482. Pointed upon occasion to the site
483. Of Romorentin, home of ancient kings,
484. To the imperial edifice of Blois,
485. Or to that rural castle, name now slipped
486. From my remembrance, where a lady lodged,
487. By the first Francis wooed, and bound to him
488. In chains of mutual passion, from the tower,
489. As a tradition of the country tells,
490. Practised to commune with her royal knight
491. By cressets and love-beacons, intercourse
492. 'Twixt her high-seated residence and his
493. Far off at Chambord on the plain beneath;
494. Even here, though less than with the peaceful house
495. Religious, 'mid those frequent monuments
496. Of Kings, their vices and their better deeds,
497. Imagination, potent to inflame
498. At times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn,
499. Did also often mitigate the force
500. Of civic prejudice, the bigotry,
501. So call it, of a youthful patriot's mind;
502. And on these spots with many gleams I looked
503. Of chivalrous delight. Yet not the less,
504. Hatred of absolute rule, where will of one
505. Is law for all, and of that barren pride
506. In them who, by immunities unjust,
507. Between the sovereign and the people stand,
508. His helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold
509. Daily upon me, mixed with pity too
510. And love; for where hope is, there love will be
511. For the abject multitude, And when we chanced
512. One day to meet a hunger-bitten girl,
513. Who crept along fitting her languid gait
514. Unto a heifer's motion, by a cord
515. Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane
516. Its sustenance, while the girl with pallid hands
517. Was busy knitting in a heartless mood
518. Of solitude, and at the sight my friend
519. In agitation said, ''Tis against 'that'
520. That we are fighting,' I with him believed
521. That a benignant spirit was abroad
522. Which might not be withstood, that poverty
523. Abject as this would in a little time
524. Be found no more, that we should see the earth
525. Unthwarted in her wish to recompense
526. The meek, the lowly, patient child of toil,
527. All institutes for ever blotted out
528. That legalised exclusion, empty pomp
529. Abolished, sensual state and cruel power
530. Whether by edict of the one or few;
531. And finally, as sum and crown of all,
532. Should see the people having a strong hand
533. In framing their own laws; whence better days
534. To all mankind. But, these things set apart,
535. Was not this single confidence enough
536. To animate the mind that ever turned
537. A thought to human welfare? That henceforth
538. Captivity by mandate without law
539. Should cease; and open accusation lead
540. To sentence in the hearing of the world,
541. And open punishment, if not the air
542. Be free to breathe in, and the heart of man
543. Dread nothing. From this height I shall not stoop
544. To humbler matter that detained us oft
545. In thought or conversation, public acts,
546. And public persons, and emotions wrought
547. Within the breast, as ever-varying winds
548. Of record or report swept over us;
549. But I might here, instead, repeat a tale,
550. Told by my Patriot friend, of sad events,
551. That prove to what low depth had struck the roots,
552. How widely spread the boughs, of that old tree
553. Which, as a deadly mischief, and a foul
554. And black dishonour, France was weary of.

555. Oh, happy time of youthful lovers, (thus
556. The story might begin,) oh, balmy time,
557. In which a love-knot, on a lady's brow,
558. Is fairer than the fairest star in Heaven!
559. So might--and with that prelude 'did' begin
560. The record; and, in faithful verse, was given
561. The doleful sequel.
562. But our little bark
563. On a strong river boldly hath been launched;
564. And from the driving current should we turn
565. To loiter wilfully within a creek,
566. Howe'er attractive, Fellow voyager!
567. Would'st thou not chide? Yet deem not my pains lost:
568. For Vaudracour and Julia (so were named
569. The ill-fated pair) in that plain tale will draw
570. Tears from the hearts of others, when their own
571. Shall beat no more. Thou, also, there may'st read,
572. At leisure, how the enamoured youth was driven,
573. By public power abased, to fatal crime,
574. Nature's rebellion against monstrous law;
575. How, between heart and heart, oppression thrust
576. Her mandates, severing whom true love had joined,
577. Harassing both; until he sank and pressed
578. The couch his fate had made for him; supine,
579. Save when the stings of viperous remorse,
580. Trying their strength, enforced him to start up,
581. Aghast and prayerless. Into a deep wood
582. He fled, to shun the haunts of human kind;
583. There dwelt, weakened in spirit more and more;
584. Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France
585. Full speedily resounded, public hope,
586. Or personal memory of his own worst wrongs,
587. Rouse him; but, hidden in those gloomy shades,
588. His days he wasted,--an imbecile mind.
