1. Bright Flower! whose home is everywhere,
2. Bold in maternal Nature's care,
3. And all the long year through the heir
4. Of joy or sorrow;
5. Methinks that there abides in thee
6. Some concord with humanity,
7. Given to no other flower I see
8. The forest thorough!

9. Is it that Man is soon deprest?
10. A thoughtless Thing! who, once unblest,
11. Does little on his memory rest,
12. Or on his reason,
13. And Thou would'st teach him how to find
14. A shelter under every wind,
15. A hope for times that are unkind
16. And every season?

17. Thou wander'st the wide world about,
18. Uncheck'd by pride or scrupulous doubt,
19. With friend to greet thee, or without,
20. Yet pleased and willing;
21. Meek, yielding to the occasion's call,
22. And all things suffering from all,
23. Thy function apostolical
24. In peace fulfilling.
