1. DEGENERATE Douglas! oh, the unworthy Lord!
2. Whom mere despite of heart could so far please,
3. And love of havoc, (for with such disease
4. Fame taxes him,) that he could send forth word
5. To level with the dust a noble horde,
6. A brotherhood of venerable Trees,
7. Leaving an ancient dome, and towers like these,
8. Beggared and outraged!--Many hearts deplored
9. The fate of those old Trees; and oft with pain
10. The traveller, at this day, will stop and gaze
11. On wrongs, which Nature scarcely seems to heed:
12. For sheltered places, bosoms, nooks, and bays,
13. And the pure mountains, and the gentle Tweed,
14. And the green silent pastures, yet remain.
