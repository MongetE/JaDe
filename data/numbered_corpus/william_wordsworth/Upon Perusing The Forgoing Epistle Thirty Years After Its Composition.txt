1. SOON did he Almighty Giver of all rest
2. Take those dear young Ones to a fearless nest;
3. And in Death's arms has long reposed the Friend
4. For whom this simple Register was penned.
5. Thanks to the moth that spared it for our eyes;
6. And Strangers even the slighted Scroll may prize,
7. Moved by the touch of kindred sympathies.
8. For--save the calm, repentance sheds o'er strife
9. Raised by remembrances of misused life,
10. The light from past endeavours purely willed
11. And by Heaven's favour happily fulfilled;
12. Save hope that we, yet bound to Earth, may share
13. The joys of the Departed--what so fair
14. As blameless pleasure, not without some tears,
15. Reviewed through Love's transparent veil of years?
