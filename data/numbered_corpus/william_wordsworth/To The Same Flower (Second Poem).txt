1. With little here to do or see
2. Of things that in the great world be,
3. Daisy! again I talk to thee,
4. For thou art worthy,
5. Thou unassuming Common-place
6. Of Nature, with that homely face,
7. And yet with something of a grace,
8. Which Love makes for thee!

9. Oft on the dappled turf at ease
10. I sit, and play with similies,
11. Loose types of things through all degrees,
12. Thoughts of thy raising:
13. And many a fond and idle name
14. I give to thee, for praise or blame,
15. As is the humour of the game,
16. While I am gazing.

17. A nun demure of lowly port;
18. Or sprightly maiden, of Love's court,
19. In thy simplicity the sport
20. Of all temptations;
21. A queen in crown of rubies drest;
22. A starveling in a scanty vest;
23. Are all, as seems to suit thee best,
24. Thy appellations.

25. A little cyclops, with one eye
26. Staring to threaten and defy,
27. That thought comes next--and instantly
28. The freak is over,
29. The shape will vanish--and behold
30. A silver shield with boss of gold,
31. That spreads itself, some faery bold
32. In fight to cover!

33. I see thee glittering from afar--
34. And then thou art a pretty star;
35. Not quite so fair as many are
36. In heaven above thee!
37. Yet like a star, with glittering crest,
38. Self-poised in air thou seem'st to rest;--
39. May peace come never to his nest,
40. Who shall reprove thee!

41. Bright 'Flower'! for by that name at last,
42. When all my reveries are past,
43. I call thee, and to that cleave fast,
44. Sweet silent creature!
45. That breath'st with me in sun and air,
46. Do thou, as thou art wont, repair
47. My heart with gladness, and a share
48. Of thy meek nature!
