1. IN trellised shed with clustering roses gay,
2. And, MARY! oft beside our blazing fire,
3. When yeas of wedded life were as a day
4. Whose current answers to the heart's desire,
5. Did we together read in Spenser's Lay
6. How Una, sad of soul--in sad attire,
7. The gentle Una, of celestial birth,
8. To seek her Knight went wandering o'er the earth.

9. Ah, then, Beloved! pleasing was the smart,
10. And the tear precious in compassion shed
11. For Her, who, pierced by sorrow's thrilling dart,
12. Did meekly bear the pang unmerited;
13. Meek as that emblem of her lowly heart
14. The milk-white Lamb which in a line she led,--
15. And faithful, loyal in her innocence,
16. Like the brave Lion slain in her defence.

17. Notes could we hear as of a faery shell
18. Attuned to words with sacred wisdom fraught;
19. Free Fancy prized each specious miracle,
20. And all its finer inspiration caught;
21. Till in the bosom of our rustic Cell,
22. We by a lamentable change were taught
23. That 'bliss with mortal Man may not abide:'
24. How nearly joy and sorrow are allied!

25. For us the stream of fiction ceased to flow,
26. For us the voice of melody was mute.
27. --But, as soft gales dissolve the dreary snow,
28. And give the timid herbage leave to shoot,
29. Heaven's breathing influence failed not to bestow
30. A timely promise of unlooked-for fruit,
31. Fair fruit of pleasure and serene content
32. From blossoms wild of fancies innocent.

33. It soothed us--it beguiled us--then, to hear
34. Once more of troubles wrought by magic spell;
35. And griefs whose aery motion comes not near
36. The pangs that tempt the Spirit to rebel:
37. Then, with mild Una in her sober cheer,
38. High over hill and low adown the dell
39. Again we wandered, willing to partake
40. All that she suffered for her dear Lord's sake.

41. Then, too, this Song 'of mine' once more could please,
42. Where anguish, strange as dreams of restless sleep,
43. Is tempered and allayed by sympathies
44. Aloft ascending, and descending deep,
45. Even to the inferior Kinds; whom forest-trees
46. Protect from beating sunbeams, and the sweep
47. Of the sharp winds;--fair Creatures!--to whom Heaven
48. A calm and sinless life, with love, hath given.

49. This tragic Story cheered us; for it speaks
50. Of female patience winning firm repose;
51. And, of the recompense that conscience seeks,
52. A bright, encouraging, example shows;
53. Needful when o'er wide realms the tempest breaks,
54. Needful amid life's ordinary woes;--
55. Hence, not for them unfitted who would bless
56. A happy hour with holier happiness.

57. He serves the Muses erringly and ill,
58. Whose aim is pleasure light and fugitive:
59. Oh, that my mind were equal to fulfil
60. The comprehensive mandate which they give--
61. Vain aspiration of an earnest will!
62. Yet in this moral Strain a power may live,
63. Beloved Wife! such solace to impart
64. As it hath yielded to thy tender heart.

65. RYDAL MOUNT, WESTMORELAND,
66. April , 1815.

68. 'Action is transitory--a step, a blow,
69. The motion of a muscle--this way or that--
70. 'Tis done; and in the after-vacancy
71. We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed:
72. Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,
73. And has the nature of infinity.
74. Yet through that darkness (infinite though it seem
75. And irremoveable) gracious openings lie,
76. By which the soul--with patient steps of thought
77. Now toiling, waked now on wings of prayer--
78. May pass in hope, and, though from mortal bonds
79. Yet undelivered, rise with sure ascent
80. Even to the fountain-head of peace divine.'
