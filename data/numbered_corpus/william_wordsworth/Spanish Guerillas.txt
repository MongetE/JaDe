1. THEY seek, are sought; to daily battle led,
2. Shrink not, though far outnumbered by their Foes,
3. For they have learnt to open and to close
4. The ridges of grim war; and at their head
5. Are captains such as erst their country bred
6. Or fostered, self-supported chiefs,--like those
7. Whom hardy Rome was fearful to oppose;
8. Whose desperate shock the Carthaginian fled.
9. In One who lived unknown a shepherd's life
10. Redoubted Viriatus breathes again;
11. And Mina, nourished in the studious shade,
12. With that great Leader vies, who, sick of strife
13. And bloodshed, longed in quiet to be laid
14. In some green island of the western main.
