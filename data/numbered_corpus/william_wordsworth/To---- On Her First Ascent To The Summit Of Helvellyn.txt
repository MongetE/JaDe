1. INMATE of a mountain-dwelling,
2. Thou hast clomb aloft, and gazed
3. From the watch-towers of Helvellyn;
4. Awed, delighted, and amazed!

5. Potent was the spell that bound thee
6. Not unwilling to obey;
7. For blue Ether's arms, flung round thee,
8. Stilled the pantings of dismay.

9. Lo! the dwindled woods and meadows;
10. What a vast abyss is there!
11. Lo! the clouds, the solemn shadows,
12. And the glistenings--heavenly fair!

13. And a record of commotion
14. Which a thousand ridges yield;
15. Ridge, and gulf, and distant ocean
16. Gleaming like a silver shield!

17. Maiden! now take flight;--inherit
18. Alps or Andes--they are thine!
19. With the morning's roseate Spirit,
20. Sweep their length of snowy line;

21. Or survey their bright dominions
22. In the gorgeous colours drest
23. Flung from off the purple pinions,
24. Evening spreads throughout the west!

25. Thine are all the coral fountains
26. Warbling in each sparry vault
27. Of the untrodden lunar mountains;
28. Listen to their songs!--or halt,

29. To Niphates' top invited,
30. Whither spiteful Satan steered;
31. Or descend where the ark alighted,
32. When the green earth re-appeared;

33. For the power of hills is on thee,
34. As was witnessed through thine eye
35. Then, when old Helvellyn won thee
36. To confess their majesty!
