1. THOUGH many suns have risen and set
2. Since thou, blithe May, wert born,
3. And Bards, who hailed thee, may forget
4. Thy gift, thy beauty scorn;
5. There are who to a birthday strain
6. Confine not harp and voice,
7. But evermore throughout thy reign
8. Are grateful and rejoice!

9. Delicious odor! music sweet,
10. Too sweet to pass away!
11. Oh for a deathless song to meet
12. The soul's desire---a lay
13. That, when a thousand year are told,
14. Should praise thee, genial Power!
15. Through summer heat, autumnal cold,
16. And winter's dreariest hour.

17. Earth, sea, thy presence feel---nor less,
18. If yon ethereal blue
19. With its soft smile the truth express,
20. The heavens have felt it too.
21. The inmost heart of man if glad
22. Partakes a livelier cheer;
23. And eye that cannot but be sad
24. Let fall a brightened tear.

25. Since thy return, through days and weeks
26. Of hope that grew by stealth,
27. How many wan and faded cheeks
28. Have kindled into health!
29. The Old, by thee revived, have said,
30. 'Another year is ours;'
31. And wayworn Wanderers, poorly fed,
32. Have smiled upon thy flowers.

33. Who tripping lisps a merry song
34. Amid his playful peers?
35. The tender Infant who was long
36. A prisoner of fond fears;
37. But now, when every sharp-edged blast
38. Is quiet in its sheath,
39. His Mother leaves him free to taste
40. Earth's sweetness in thy breath.

41. Thy help is with the weed that creeps
42. Along the humblest ground;
43. No cliff so bare but on its steeps
44. Thy favors may be found;
45. But most on some peculiar nook
46. That our own hands have drest,
47. Thou and thy train are proud to look,
48. And seem to love it best.

49. And yet how pleased we wander forth
50. When May is whispering, 'Come!
51. 'Choose from the bowers of virgin earth
52. The happiest for your home;
53. Heaven√ïs bounteous love through me is spread
54. From sunshine, clouds, winds, waves,
55. Drops on the mouldering turret's head,
56. And on your turf-clad graves!'

57. Such greeting heard, away with sighs
58. For lilies that must fade,
59. Or ' the rathe primrose as it dies
60. Forsaken' in the shade!
61. Vernal fruitions and desires
62. Are linked in endless chase;
63. While, as one kindly growth retires,
64. Another takes its place.

65. And what if thou, sweet May, hast known
66. Mishap by worm and blight;
67. If expectations newly blown
68. Have perished in thy sight;
69. If loves and joys, while up they sprung,
70. Were caught as in a snare;
71. Such is the lot of all the young,
72. However bright and fair.

73. Lo! Streams that April could not check
74. Are patient of thy rule;
75. Gurgling in foamy water-break,
76. Loitering in glassy pool:
77. By thee, thee only, could be sent
78. Such gentle mists as glide,
79. Curling with unconfirmed intent,
80. On that green mountain's side.

81. How delicate the leafy veil
82. Through which yon house of God
83. Gleams 'mid the peace of this deep dale
84. By few but shepherds trod!
85. And lowly huts, near beaten ways,
86. No sooner stand attired
87. In thy fresh wreaths, than they for praise
88. Peep forth, and are admired.

89. Season of fancy and of hope,
90. Permit not for one hour,
91. A blossom from thy crown to drop,
92. Nor add to it a flower!
93. Keep, lovely May, as if by touch
94. Of self restraining art,
95. This modest charm of not too much,
96. Part seen, imagined part!
