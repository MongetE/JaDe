1. SMILE of the Moon!---for I so name
2. That silent greeting from above;
3. A gentle flash of light that came
4. From her whom drooping captives love;
5. Or art thou of still higher birth?
6. Thou that didst part the clouds of earth,
7. My torpor to reprove!

8. Bright boon of pitying Heaven!---alas,
9. I may not trust thy placid cheer!
10. Pondering that Time tonight will pass
11. The threshold of another year;
12. For years to me are sad and dull;
13. My very moments are too full
14. Of hopelessness and fear.

15. And yet, the soul-awakening gleam,
16. That struck perchance the farthest cone
17. Of Scotland's rocky wilds, did seem
18. To visit me, and me alone;
19. Me, unapproached by any friend,
20. Save those who to my sorrow lend
21. Tears due unto their own.

22. To night the church-tower bells will ring
23. Through these wide realms a festire peal;
24. To the new year a welcoming;
25. A tuneful offering for the weal
26. Of happy millions lulled in deep;
27. While I am forced to watch and weep,
28. By wounds that may not heal.

29. Born all too high, by wedlock raised
30. Still higher to be cast thus low!
31. Would that mine eyes had never gazed
32. On aught of more ambitious show
33. Than the sweet flowerets of the fields
34. ---It is my royal state that yields
35. This bitterness of woe.

36. Yet how?---for I, if there be truth
37. In the world's voice, was passing fair;
38. And beauty, for confiding youth,
39. Those shocks of passion can prepare
40. That kill the bloom before its time;
41. And blanch, without the owner's crime,
42. The most resplendent hair.

43. Unblest distinction! showered on me
44. To bind a lingering life in chains:
45. All that could quit my grasp, or flee,
46. Is gone;---but not the subtle stains
47. Fixed in the spirit; for even here
48. Can I be proud that jealous fear
49. Of what I was remains.

50. A Woman rules my prison's key;
51. A sister Queen, against the bent
52. OÂ£ law and holiest sympathy,
53. Detains me, doubtful of the event;
54. Great God, who feel'st for my distress,
55. My thoughts are all that I possess,
56. O keep them innocent!

57. Farewell desire of human aid,
58. Which abject mortals vainly court!
59. By friends deceived, by foes betrayed,
60. Of fears the prey, of hopes the sport;
61. Nought but the world-redeeming Cross
62. Is able to support my loss,
63. My burthen to support.

64. Hark! the death-note of the year
65. Sounded by the castle-clock!
66. From her sunk eyes a stagnant tear
67. Stole forth, unsettled by the shock;
68. But oft the woods renewed their green,
69. Ere the tired head of Scotland's Queen
70. Reposed upon the block!
