1. THE leaves were fading when to Esthwaite's banks
2. And the simplicities of cottage life
3. I bade farewell; and, one among the youth
4. Who, summoned by that season, reunite
5. As scattered birds troop to the fowler's lure,
6. Went back to Granta's cloisters, not so prompt
7. Or eager, though as gay and undepressed
8. In mind, as when I thence had taken flight
9. A few short months before. I turned my face
10. Without repining from the coves and heights
11. Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern;
12. Quitted, not loth, the mild magnificence
13. Of calmer lakes and louder streams; and you,
14. Frank-hearted maids of rocky Cumberland,
15. You and your not unwelcome days of mirth,
16. Relinquished, and your nights of revelry,
17. And in my own unlovely cell sate down
18. In lightsome mood--such privilege has youth
19. That cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts.

20. The bonds of indolent society
21. Relaxing in their hold, henceforth I lived
22. More to myself. Two winters may be passed
23. Without a separate notice: many books
24. Were skimmed, devoured, or studiously perused,
25. But with no settled plan. I was detached
26. Internally from academic cares;
27. Yet independent study seemed a course
28. Of hardy disobedience toward friends
29. And kindred, proud rebellion and unkind.
30. This spurious virtue, rather let it bear
31. A name it now deserves, this cowardice,
32. Gave treacherous sanction to that over-love
33. Of freedom which encouraged me to turn
34. From regulations even of my own
35. As from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell--
36. Who knows what thus may have been gained, both then
37. And at a later season, or preserved;
38. What love of nature, what original strength
39. Of contemplation, what intuitive truths
40. The deepest and the best, what keen research,
41. Unbiassed, unbewildered, and unawed?

42. The Poet's soul was with me at that time;
43. Sweet meditations, the still overflow
44. Of present happiness, while future years
45. Lacked not anticipations, tender dreams,
46. No few of which have since been realised;
47. And some remain, hopes for my future life.
48. Four years and thirty, told this very week,
49. Have I been now a sojourner on earth,
50. By sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me
51. Life's morning radiance hath not left the hills,
52. Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the days
53. Which also first emboldened me to trust
54. With firmness, hitherto but slightly touched
55. By such a daring thought, that I might leave
56. Some monument behind me which pure hearts
57. Should reverence. The instinctive humbleness,
58. Maintained even by the very name and thought
59. Of printed books and authorship, began
60. To melt away; and further, the dread awe
61. Of mighty names was softened down and seemed
62. Approachable, admitting fellowship
63. Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now,
64. Though not familiarly, my mind put on,
65. Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.

66. All winter long, whenever free to choose,
67. Did I by night frequent the College grove
68. And tributary walks; the last, and oft
69. The only one, who had been lingering there
70. Through hours of silence, till the porter's bell,
71. A punctual follower on the stroke of nine,
72. Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice;
73. Inexorable summons! Lofty elms,
74. Inviting shades of opportune recess,
75. Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood
76. Unpeaceful in itself. A single tree
77. With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,
78. Grew there; an ash which Winter for himself
79. Decked out with pride, and with outlandish grace:
80. Up from the ground, and almost to the top,
81. The trunk and every master branch were green
82. With clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigs
83. And outer spray profusely tipped with seeds
84. That hung in yellow tassels, while the air
85. Stirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stood
86. Foot-bound uplooking at this lovely tree
87. Beneath a frosty moon. The hemisphere
88. Of magic fiction, verse of mine perchance
89. May never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self
90. Could have more tranquil visions in his youth,
91. Or could more bright appearances create
92. Of human forms with superhuman powers,
93. Than I beheld, loitering on calm clear nights
94. Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth.

95. On the vague reading of a truant youth
96. 'Twere idle to descant. My inner judgment
97. Not seldom differed from my taste in books,
98. As if it appertained to another mind,
99. And yet the books which then I valued most
100. Are dearest to me 'now'; for, having scanned,
101. Not heedlessly, the laws, and watched the forms
102. Of Nature, in that knowledge I possessed
103. A standard, often usefully applied,
104. Even when unconsciously, to things removed
105. From a familiar sympathy.--In fine,
106. I was a better judge of thoughts than words,
107. Misled in estimating words, not only
108. By common inexperience of youth,
109. But by the trade in classic niceties,
110. The dangerous craft, of culling term and phrase
111. From languages that want the living voice
112. To carry meaning to the natural heart;
113. To tell us what is passion, what is truth,
114. What reason, what simplicity and sense.

115. Yet may we not entirely overlook
116. The pleasure gathered from the rudiments
117. Of geometric science. Though advanced
118. In these enquiries, with regret I speak,
119. No farther than the threshold, there I found
120. Both elevation and composed delight:
121. With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance pleased
122. With its own struggles, did I meditate
123. On the relation those abstractions bear
124. To Nature's laws, and by what process led,
125. Those immaterial agents bowed their heads
126. Duly to serve the mind of earth-born man;
127. From star to star, from kindred sphere to sphere,
128. From system on to system without end.

129. More frequently from the same source I drew
130. A pleasure quiet and profound, a sense
131. Of permanent and universal sway,
132. And paramount belief; there, recognised
133. A type, for finite natures, of the one
134. Supreme Existence, the surpassing life
135. Which--to the boundaries of space and time,
136. Of melancholy space and doleful time,
137. Superior and incapable of change,
138. Nor touched by welterings of passion--is,
139. And hath the name of, God. Transcendent peace
140. And silence did await upon these thoughts
141. That were a frequent comfort to my youth.

142. 'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,
143. With fellow-sufferers by the shipwreck spared,
144. Upon a desert coast, that having brought
145. To land a single volume, saved by chance,
146. A treatise of Geometry, he wont,
147. Although of food and clothing destitute,
148. And beyond common wretchedness depressed,
149. To part from company and take this book
150. (Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)
151. To spots remote, and draw his diagrams
152. With a long staff upon the sand, and thus
153. Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost
154. Forget his feeling: so (if like effect
155. From the same cause produced, 'mid outward things
156. So different, may rightly be compared),
157. So was it then with me, and so will be
158. With Poets ever. Mighty is the charm
159. Of those abstractions to a mind beset
160. With images and haunted by herself,
161. And specially delightful unto me
162. Was that clear synthesis built up aloft
163. So gracefully; even then when it appeared
164. Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy
165. To sense embodied: not the thing it is
166. In verity, an independent world,
167. Created out of pure intelligence.

168. Such dispositions then were mine unearned
169. By aught, I fear, of genuine desert--
170. Mine, through heaven's grace and inborn aptitudes.
171. And not to leave the story of that time
172. Imperfect, with these habits must be joined,
173. Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that loved
174. A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,
175. The twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring;
176. A treasured and luxurious gloom of choice
177. And inclination mainly, and the mere
178. Redundancy of youth's contentedness.
179. --To time thus spent, add multitudes of hours
180. Pilfered away, by what the Bard who sang
181. Of the Enchanter Indolence hath called
182. 'Good-natured lounging,' and behold a map
183. Of my collegiate life--far less intense
184. Than duty called for, or, without regard
185. To duty, 'might' have sprung up of itself
186. By change of accidents, or even, to speak
187. Without unkindness, in another place.
188. Yet why take refuge in that plea?--the fault,
189. This I repeat, was mine; mine be the blame.

190. In summer, making quest for works of art,
191. Or scenes renowned for beauty, I explored
192. That streamlet whose blue current works its way
193. Between romantic Dovedale's spiry rocks;
194. Pried into Yorkshire dales, or hidden tracts
195. Of my own native region, and was blest
196. Between these sundry wanderings with a joy
197. Above all joys, that seemed another morn
198. Risen on mid noon; blest with the presence, Friend
199. Of that sole Sister, her who hath been long
200. Dear to thee also, thy true friend and mine,
201. Now, after separation desolate,
202. Restored to me--such absence that she seemed
203. A gift then first bestowed. The varied banks
204. Of Emont, hitherto unnamed in song,
205. And that monastic castle, 'mid tall trees,
206. Low standing by the margin of the stream,
207. A mansion visited (as fame reports)
208. By Sidney, where, in sight of our Helvellyn,
209. Or stormy Cross-fell, snatches he might pen
210. Of his Arcadia, by fraternal love
211. Inspired;--that river and those mouldering towers
212. Have seen us side by side, when, having clomb
213. The darksome windings of a broken stair,
214. And crept along a ridge of fractured wall,
215. Not without trembling, we in safety looked
216. Forth, through some Gothic window's open space,
217. And gathered with one mind a rich reward
218. From the far-stretching landscape, by the light
219. Of morning beautified, or purple eve;
220. Or, not less pleased, lay on some turret's head,
221. Catching from tufts of grass and hare-bell flowers
222. Their faintest whisper to the passing breeze,
223. Given out while mid-day heat oppressed the plains.

224. Another maid there was, who also shed
225. A gladness o'er that season, then to me,
226. By her exulting outside look of youth
227. And placid under-countenance, first endeared;
228. That other spirit, Coleridge! who is now
229. So near to us, that meek confiding heart,
230. So reverenced by us both. O'er paths and fields
231. In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanes
232. Of eglantine, and through the shady woods,
233. And o'er the Border Beacon, and the waste
234. Of naked pools, and common crags that lay
235. Exposed on the bare fell, were scattered love,
236. The spirit of pleasure, and youth's golden gleam.
237. O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time,
238. And yet a power is on me, and a strong
239. Confusion, and I seem to plant thee there.
240. Far art thou wandered now in search of health
241. And milder breezes,--melancholy lot!
242. But thou art with us, with us in the past,
243. The present, with us in the times to come.
244. There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,
245. No languor, no dejection, no dismay,
246. No absence scarcely can there be, for those
247. Who love as we do. Speed thee well! divide
248. With us thy pleasure; thy returning strength,
249. Receive it daily as a joy of ours;
250. Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift
251. Of gales Etesian or of tender thoughts.

252. I, too, have been a wanderer; but, alas!
253. How different the fate of different men.
254. Though mutually unknown, yea nursed and reared
255. As if in several elements, we were framed
256. To bend at last to the same discipline,
257. Predestined, if two beings ever were,
258. To seek the same delights, and have one health,
259. One happiness. Throughout this narrative,
260. Else sooner ended, I have borne in mind
261. For whom it registers the birth, and marks the growth,
262. Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth,
263. And joyous loves, that hallow innocent days
264. Of peace and self-command. Of rivers, fields,
265. And groves I speak to thee, my Friend! to thee,
266. Who, yet a liveried schoolboy, in the depths
267. Of the huge city, on the leaded roof
268. Of that wide edifice, thy school and home,
269. Wert used to lie and gaze upon the clouds
270. Moving in heaven; or, of that pleasure tired,
271. To shut thine eyes, and by internal light
272. See trees, and meadows, and thy native stream,
273. Far distant, thus beheld from year to year
274. Of a long exile. Nor could I forget,
275. In this late portion of my argument,
276. That scarcely, as my term of pupilage
277. Ceased, had I left those academic bowers
278. When thou wert thither guided. From the heart
279. Of London, and from cloisters there, thou camest.
280. And didst sit down in temperance and peace,
281. A rigorous student. What a stormy course
282. Then followed. Oh! it is a pang that calls
283. For utterance, to think what easy change
284. Of circumstances might to thee have spared
285. A world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,
286. For ever withered. Through this retrospect
287. Of my collegiate life I still have had
288. Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place
289. Present before my eyes, have played with times
290. And accidents as children do with cards,
291. Or as a man, who, when his house is built,
292. A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,
293. As impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,
294. Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought
295. Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,
296. And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,
297. Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse
298. Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms
299. Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out
300. From things well-matched or ill, and words for things,
301. The self-created sustenance of a mind
302. Debarred from Nature's living images,
303. Compelled to be a life unto herself,
304. And unrelentingly possessed by thirst
305. Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,
306. Ah! surely not in singleness of heart
307. Should I have seen the light of evening fade
308. From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met,
309. Even at that early time, needs must I trust
310. In the belief, that my maturer age,
311. My calmer habits, and more steady voice,
312. Would with an influence benign have soothed,
313. Or chased away, the airy wretchedness
314. That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod
315. A march of glory, which doth put to shame
316. These vain regrets; health suffers in thee, else
317. Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought
318. That ever harboured in the breast of man.

319. A passing word erewhile did lightly touch
320. On wanderings of my own, that now embraced
321. With livelier hope a region wider far.

322. When the third summer freed us from restraint,
323. A youthful friend, he too a mountaineer,
324. Not slow to share my wishes, took his staff,
325. And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,
326. Bound to the distant Alps. A hardy slight,
327. Did this unprecedented course imply,
328. Of college studies and their set rewards;
329. Nor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me
330. Without uneasy forethought of the pain,
331. The censures, and ill-omening, of those
332. To whom my worldly interests were dear.
333. But Nature then was sovereign in my mind,
334. And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,
335. Had given a charter to irregular hopes.
336. In any age of uneventful calm
337. Among the nations, surely would my heart
338. Have been possessed by similar desire;
339. But Europe at that time was thrilled with joy,
340. France standing on the top of golden hours,
341. And human nature seeming born again.

342. Lightly equipped, and but a few brief looks
343. Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore
344. From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced
345. To land at Calais on the very eve
346. Of that great federal day; and there we saw,
347. In a mean city, and among a few,
348. How bright a face is worn when joy of one
349. Is joy for tens of millions. Southward thence
350. We held our way, direct through hamlets, towns,
351. Gaudy with reliques of that festival,
352. Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,
353. And window-garlands. On the public roads,
354. And, once, three days successively, through paths
355. By which our toilsome journey was abridged,
356. Among sequestered villages we walked
357. And found benevolence and blessedness
358. Spread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring
359. Hath left no corner of the land untouched;
360. Where elms for many and many a league in files
361. With their thin umbrage, on the stately roads
362. Of that great kingdom, rustled o'er our heads,
363. For ever near us as we paced along:
364. How sweet at such a time, with such delight
365. On every side, in prime of youthful strength,
366. To feed a Poet's tender melancholy
367. And fond conceit of sadness, with the sound
368. Of undulations varying as might please
369. The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,
370. Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw
371. Dances of liberty, and, in late hours
372. Of darkness, dances in the open air
373. Deftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on
374. Might waste their breath in chiding.
375. Under hills--
376. The vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,
377. Upon the bosom of the gentle Saone
378. We glided forward with the flowing stream.
379. Swift Rhone! thou wert the 'wings' on which we cut
380. A winding passage with majestic ease
381. Between thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show
382. Those woods and farms and orchards did present,
383. And single cottages and lurking towns,
384. Reach after reach, succession without end
385. Of deep and stately vales! A lonely pair
386. Of strangers, till day closed, we sailed along
387. Clustered together with a merry crowd
388. Of those emancipated, a blithe host
389. Of travellers, chiefly delegates, returning
390. From the great spousals newly solemnised
391. At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.
392. Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;
393. Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,
394. And with their swords flourished as if to fight
395. The saucy air. In this proud company
396. We landed--took with them our evening meal,
397. Guests welcome almost as the angels were
398. To Abraham of old. The supper done,
399. With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts
400. We rose at signal given, and formed a ring
401. And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;
402. All hearts were open, every tongue was loud
403. With amity and glee; we bore a name
404. Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,
405. And hospitably did they give us hail,
406. As their forerunners in a glorious course;
407. And round and round the board we danced again.
408. With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed
409. At early dawn. The monastery bells
410. Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;
411. The rapid river flowing without noise,
412. And each uprising or receding spire
413. Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals
414. Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew
415. By whom we were encompassed. Taking leave
416. Of this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,
417. Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued
418. Our journey, and ere twice the sun had set
419. Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there
420. Rested within an awful 'solitude':
421. Yes, for even then no other than a place
422. Of soul-affecting 'solitude' appeared
423. That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,
424. As toward the sacred mansion we advanced,
425. Arms flashing, and a military glare
426. Of riotous men commissioned to expel
427. The blameless inmates, and belike subvert
428. That frame of social being, which so long
429. Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things
430. In silence visible and perpetual calm.
431. --'Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!'--The voice
432. Was Nature's, uttered from her Alpine throne;
433. I heard it then and seem to hear it now--
434. 'Your impious work forbear, perish what may,
435. Let this one temple last, be this one spot
436. Of earth devoted to eternity!'
437. She ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno's pines
438. Waved their dark tops, not silent as they waved,
439. And while below, along their several beds,
440. Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death,
441. Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart
442. Responded; 'Honour to the patriot's zeal!
443. Glory and hope to new-born Liberty!
444. Hail to the mighty projects of the time!
445. Discerning sword that Justice wields, do thou
446. Go forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires,
447. Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,
448. Fanned by the breath of angry Providence.
449. But oh! if Past and Future be the wings
450. On whose support harmoniously conjoined
451. Moves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare
452. These courts of mystery, where a step advanced
453. Between the portals of the shadowy rocks
454. Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities,
455. For penitential tears and trembling hopes
456. Exchanged--to equalise in God's pure sight
457. Monarch and peasant: be the house redeemed
458. With its unworldly votaries, for the sake
459. Of conquest over sense, hourly achieved
460. Through faith and meditative reason, resting
461. Upon the word of heaven-imparted truth,
462. Calmly triumphant; and for humbler claim
463. Of that imaginative impulse sent
464. From these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,
465. The untransmuted shapes of many worlds,
466. Cerulean ether's pure inhabitants,
467. These forests unapproachable by death,
468. That shall endure as long as man endures,
469. To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,
470. To struggle, to be lost within himself
471. In trepidation, from the blank abyss
472. To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled.'
473. Not seldom since that moment have I wished
474. That thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calm
475. Hadst shared, when, from profane regards apart,
476. In sympathetic reverence we trod
477. The floors of those dim cloisters, till that hour,
478. From their foundation, strangers to the presence
479. Of unrestricted and unthinking man.
480. Abroad, how cheeringly the sunshine lay
481. Upon the open lawns! Vallombre's groves
482. Entering, we fed the soul with darkness; thence
483. Issued, and with uplifted eyes beheld,
484. In different quarters of the bending sky,
485. The cross of Jesus stand erect, as if
486. Hands of angelic powers had fixed it there,
487. Memorial reverenced by a thousand storms;
488. Yet then, from the undiscriminating sweep
489. And rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure.

490. 'Tis not my present purpose to retrace
491. That variegated journey step by step.
492. A march it was of military speed,
493. And Earth did change her images and forms
494. Before us, fast as clouds are changed in heaven.
495. Day after day, up early and down late,
496. From hill to vale we dropped, from vale to hill
497. Mounted--from province on to province swept,
498. Keen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks,
499. Eager as birds of prey, or as a ship
500. Upon the stretch, when winds are blowing fair:
501. Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life,
502. Enticing valleys, greeted them and left
503. Too soon, while yet the very flash and gleam
504. Of salutation were not passed away.
505. Oh! sorrow for the youth who could have seen,
506. Unchastened, unsubdued, unawed, unraised
507. To patriarchal dignity of mind,
508. And pure simplicity of wish and will,
509. Those sanctified abodes of peaceful man,
510. Pleased (though to hardship born, and compassed round
511. With danger, varying as the seasons change),
512. Pleased with his daily task, or, if not pleased,
513. Contented, from the moment that the dawn
514. (Ah! surely not without attendant gleams
515. Of soul-illumination) calls him forth
516. To industry, by glistenings flung on rocks,
517. Whose evening shadows lead him to repose.

518. Well might a stranger look with bounding heart
519. Down on a green recess, the first I saw
520. Of those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,
521. Quiet and lorded over and possessed
522. By naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tents
523. Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns
524. And by the river side.
525. That very day,
526. From a bare ridge we also first beheld
527. Unveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and grieved
528. To have a soulless image on the eye
529. That had usurped upon a living thought
530. That never more could be. The wondrous Vale
531. Of Chamouny stretched far below, and soon
532. With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice,
533. A motionless array of mighty waves,
534. Five rivers broad and vast, made rich amends,
535. And reconciled us to realities;
536. There small birds warble from the leafy trees,
537. The eagle soars high in the element,
538. There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,
539. The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,
540. While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,
541. Descending from the mountain to make sport
542. Among the cottages by beds of flowers.

543. Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,
544. Or heard, was fitted to our unripe state
545. Of intellect and heart. With such a book
546. Before our eyes, we could not choose but read
547. Lessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain
548. And universal reason of mankind,
549. The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side
550. Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone
551. Each with his humour, could we fail to abound
552. In dreams and fictions, pensively composed:
553. Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake,
554. And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,
555. And sober posies of funereal flowers,
556. Gathered among those solitudes sublime
557. From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,
558. Did sweeten many a meditative hour.

559. Yet still in me with those soft luxuries
560. Mixed something of stern mood, an underthirst
561. Of vigour seldom utterly allayed:
562. And from that source how different a sadness
563. Would issue, let one incident make known.
564. When from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb
565. Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road,
566. Following a band of muleteers, we reached
567. A halting-place, where all together took
568. Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,
569. Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,
570. Then paced the beaten downward way that led
571. Right to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off;
572. The only track now visible was one
573. That from the torrent's further brink held forth
574. Conspicuous invitation to ascend
575. A lofty mountain. After brief delay
576. Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,
577. And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears
578. Intruded, for we failed to overtake
579. Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,
580. While every moment added doubt to doubt,
581. A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned
582. That to the spot which had perplexed us first
583. We must descend, and there should find the road,
584. Which in the stony channel of the stream
585. Lay a few steps, and then along its banks;
586. And, that our future course, all plain to sight,
587. Was downwards, with the current of that stream.
588. Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear,
589. For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,
590. We questioned him again, and yet again;
591. But every word that from the peasant's lips
592. Came in reply, translated by our feelings,
593. Ended in this,--'that we had crossed the Alps'.

594. Imagination--here the Power so called
595. Through sad incompetence of human speech,
596. That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss
597. Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,
598. At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;
599. Halted without an effort to break through;
600. But to my conscious soul I now can say--
601. 'I recognise thy glory:' in such strength
602. Of usurpation, when the light of sense
603. Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed
604. The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,
605. There harbours; whether we be young or old,
606. Our destiny, our being's heart and home,
607. Is with infinitude, and only there;
608. With hope it is, hope that can never die,
609. Effort, and expectation, and desire,
610. And something evermore about to be.
611. Under such banners militant, the soul
612. Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils
613. That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts
614. That are their own perfection and reward,
615. Strong in herself and in beatitude
616. That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile
617. Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds
618. To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.

619. The melancholy slackening that ensued
620. Upon those tidings by the peasant given
621. Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,
622. And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,
623. Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road
624. Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait,
625. And with them did we journey several hours
626. At a slow pace. The immeasurable height
627. Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,
628. The stationary blasts of waterfalls,
629. And in the narrow rent at every turn
630. Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,
631. The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,
632. The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,
633. Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side
634. As if a voice were in them, the sick sight
635. And giddy prospect of the raving stream,
636. The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,
637. Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light--
638. Were all like workings of one mind, the features
639. Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;
640. Characters of the great Apocalypse,
641. The types and symbols of Eternity,
642. Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.

643. That night our lodging was a house that stood
644. Alone within the valley, at a point
645. Where, tumbling from aloft, a torrent swelled
646. The rapid stream whose margin we had trod;
647. A dreary mansion, large beyond all need,
648. With high and spacious rooms, deafened and stunned
649. By noise of waters, making innocent sleep
650. Lie melancholy among weary bones.

651. Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,
652. Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified
653. Into a lordly river, broad and deep,
654. Dimpling along in silent majesty,
655. With mountains for its neighbours, and in view
656. Of distant mountains and their snowy tops,
657. And thus proceeding to Locarno's Lake,
658. Fit resting-place for such a visitant.
659. Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,
660. How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart,
661. Bask in the sunshine of the memory;
662. And Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth
663. Keeps to herself, confined as in a depth
664. Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake
665. Of thee, thy chestnut woods, and garden plots
666. Of Indian corn tended by dark-eyed maids;
667. Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines,
668. Winding from house to house, from town to town,
669. Sole link that binds them to each other; walks,
670. League after league, and cloistral avenues,
671. Where silence dwells if music be not there:
672. While yet a youth undisciplined in verse,
673. Through fond ambition of that hour I strove
674. To chant your praise; nor can approach you now
675. Ungreeted by a more melodious Song,
676. Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art
677. May flow in lasting current. Like a breeze
678. Or sunbeam over your domain I passed
679. In motion without pause; but ye have left
680. Your beauty with me, a serene accord
681. Of forms and colours, passive, yet endowed
682. In their submissiveness with power as sweet
683. And gracious, almost, might I dare to say,
684. As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,
685. Or the remembrance of a generous deed,
686. Or mildest visitations of pure thought,
687. When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked
688. Religiously, in silent blessedness;
689. Sweet as this last herself, for such it is.

690. With those delightful pathways we advanced,
691. For two days' space, in presence of the Lake,
692. That, stretching far among the Alps, assumed
693. A character more stern. The second night,
694. From sleep awakened, and misled by sound
695. Of the church clock telling the hours with strokes
696. Whose import then we had not learned, we rose
697. By moonlight, doubting not that day was nigh,
698. And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,
699. Along the winding margin of the lake,
700. Led, as before, we should behold the scene
701. Hushed in profound repose. We left the town
702. Of Gravedona with this hope; but soon
703. Were lost, bewildered among woods immense,
704. And on a rock sate down, to wait for day.
705. An open place it was, and overlooked,
706. From high, the sullen water far beneath,
707. On which a dull red image of the moon
708. Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form
709. Like an uneasy snake. From hour to hour
710. We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night
711. Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock
712. At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep,
713. But 'could not' sleep, tormented by the stings
714. Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,
715. Filled all the woods: the cry of unknown birds;
716. The mountains more by blackness visible
717. And their own size, than any outward light;
718. The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock
719. That told, with unintelligible voice,
720. The widely parted hours; the noise of streams,
721. And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,
722. That did not leave us free from personal fear;
723. And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that set
724. Before us, while she still was high in heaven;--
725. These were our food; and such a summer's night
726. Followed that pair of golden days that shed
727. On Como's Lake, and all that round it lay,
728. Their fairest, softest, happiest influence.

729. But here I must break off, and bid farewell
730. To days, each offering some new sight, or fraught
731. With some untried adventure, in a course
732. Prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow
733. Checked our unwearied steps. Let this alone
734. Be mentioned as a parting word, that not
735. In hollow exultation, dealing out
736. Hyperboles of praise comparative,
737. Not rich one moment to be poor for ever;
738. Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mind
739. Herself were nothing, a mere pensioner
740. On outward forms--did we in presence stand
741. Of that magnificent region. On the front
742. Of this whole Song is written that my heart
743. Must, in such Temple, needs have offered up
744. A different worship. Finally, whate'er
745. I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream
746. That flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,
747. Confederate with the current of the soul,
748. To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,
749. In its degree of power, administered
750. To grandeur or to tenderness,--to the one
751. Directly, but to tender thoughts by means
752. Less often instantaneous in effect;
753. Led me to these by paths that, in the main,
754. Were more circuitous, but not less sure
755. Duly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.

756. Oh, most beloved Friend! a glorious time,
757. A happy time that was; triumphant looks
758. Were then the common language of all eyes;
759. As if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailed
760. Their great expectancy: the fife of war
761. Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,
762. A blackbird's whistle in a budding grove.
763. We left the Swiss exulting in the fate
764. Of their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast
765. Our pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,
766. We crossed the Brabant armies on the fret
767. For battle in the cause of Liberty.
768. A stripling, scarcely of the household then
769. Of social life, I looked upon these things
770. As from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,
771. Was touched, but with no intimate concern;
772. I seemed to move along them, as a bird
773. Moves through the air, or as a fish pursues
774. Its sport, or feeds in its proper element;
775. I wanted not that joy, I did not need
776. Such help; the ever-living universe,
777. Turn where I might, was opening out its glories,
778. And the independent spirit of pure youth
779. Called forth, at every season, new delights,
780. Spread round my steps like sunshine o'er green fields.
