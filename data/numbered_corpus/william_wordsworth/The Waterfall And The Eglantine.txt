1. 'Begone, thou fond presumptuous Elf,'
2. Exclaimed an angry Voice,
3. 'Nor dare to thrust thy foolish self
4. Between me and my choice!'
5. A small Cascade fresh swoln with snows
6. Thus threatened a poor Briar-rose,
7. That, all bespattered with his foam,
8. And dancing high and dancing low,
9. Was living, as a child might know,
10. In an unhappy home.

11. II

12. 'Dost thou presume my course to block?
13. Off, off! or, puny Thing!
14. I'll hurl thee headlong with the rock
15. To which thy fibres cling.'
16. The Flood was tyrannous and strong;
17. The patient Briar suffered long,
18. Nor did he utter groan or sigh,
19. Hoping the danger would be past;
20. But, seeing no relief, at last,
21. He ventured to reply.

22. III

23. 'Ah!' said the Briar, 'blame me not;
24. Why should we dwell in strife?
25. We who in this sequestered spot
26. Once lived a happy life!
27. You stirred me on my rocky bed--
28. What pleasure through my veins you spread
29. The summer long, from day to day,
30. My leaves you freshened and bedewed;
31. Nor was it common gratitude
32. That did your cares repay.

33. IV

34. 'When spring came on with bud and bell,
35. Among these rocks did I
36. Before you hang my wreaths to tell
37. That gentle days were nigh!
38. And in the sultry summer hours,
39. I sheltered you with leaves and flowers;
40. And in my leaves--now shed and gone,
41. The linnet lodged, and for us two
42. Chanted his pretty songs, when you
43. Had little voice or none.

44. V

45. 'But now proud thoughts are in your breast--
46. What grief is mine you see,
47. Ah! would you think, even yet how blest
48. Together we might be!
49. Though of both leaf and flower bereft,
50. Some ornaments to me are left--
51. Rich store of scarlet hips is mine,
52. With which I, in my humble way,
53. Would deck you many a winter day,
54. A happy Eglantine!'

55. VI

56. What more he said I cannot tell,
57. The Torrent down the rocky dell
58. Came thundering loud and fast;
59. I listened, nor aught else could hear;
60. The Briar quaked--and much I fear
61. Those accents were his last.
