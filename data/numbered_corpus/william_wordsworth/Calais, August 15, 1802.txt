1. FESTIVALS have I seen that were not names:
2. This is young Buonaparte's natal day,
3. And his is henceforth an established sway-
4. Consul for life. With worship France proclaims
5. Her approbation, and with pomps and games.
6. Heaven grant that other Cities may be gay!
7. Calais is not: and I have bent my way
8. To the sea-coast, noting that each man frames
9. His business as he likes. Far other show
10. My youth here witnessed, in a prouder time;
11. The senselessness of joy was then sublime!
12. Happy is he, who, caring not for Pope,
13. Consul, or King, can sound himself to know
14. The destiny of Man, and live in hope.
