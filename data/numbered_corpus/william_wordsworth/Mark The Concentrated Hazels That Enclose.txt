1. MARK the concentred hazels that enclose
2. Yon old grey Stone, protected from the ray
3. Of noontide suns:--and even the beams that play
4. And glance, while wantonly the rough wind blows,
5. Are seldom free to touch the moss that grows
6. Upon that roof, amid embowering gloom,
7. The very image framing of a Tomb,
8. In which some ancient Chieftain finds repose
9. Among the lonely mountains.--Live, ye trees!
10. And thou, grey Stone, the pensive likeness keep
11. Of a dark chamber where the Mighty sleep:
12. For more than Fancy to the influence bends
13. When solitary Nature condescends
14. To mimic Time's forlorn humanities.
