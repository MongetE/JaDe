1. SAY, what is Honour?--'Tis the finest sense
2. Of 'justice' which the human mind can frame,
3. Intent each lurking frailty to disclaim,
4. And guard the way of life from all offence
5. Suffered or done. When lawless violence
6. Invades a Realm, so pressed that in the scale
7. Of perilous war her weightiest armies fail,
8. Honour is hopeful elevation,--whence
9. Glory, and triumph. Yet with politic skill
10. Endangered States may yield to terms unjust;
11. Stoop their proud heads, but not unto the dust--
12. A Foe's most favourite purpose to fulfil:
13. Happy occasions oft by self-mistrust
14. Are forfeited; but infamy doth kill.
