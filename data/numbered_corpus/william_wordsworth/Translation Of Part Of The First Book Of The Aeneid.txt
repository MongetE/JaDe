2. BUT Cytherea, studious to invent
3. Arts yet untried, upon new counsels bent,
4. Resolves that Cupid, changed in form and face
5. To young Ascanius, should assume his place;
6. Present the maddening gifts, and kindle heat
7. Of passion at the bosom's inmost seat.
8. She dreads the treacherous house, the double tongue;
9. She burns, she frets--by Juno's rancour stung;
10. The calm of night is powerless to remove
11. These cares, and thus she speaks to winged Love:

12. 'O son, my strength, my power! who dost despise
13. (What, save thyself, none dares through earth and skies)
14. The giant-quelling bolts of Jove, I flee,
15. O son, a suppliant to thy deity!
16. What perils meet Aeneas in his course,
17. How Juno's hate with unrelenting force
18. Pursues thy brother--this to thee is known;
19. And oft-times hast thou made my griefs thine own.
20. Him now the generous Dido by soft chains
21. Of bland entreaty at her court detains;
22. Junonian hospitalities prepare
23. Such apt occasion that I dread a snare.
24. Hence, ere some hostile God can intervene,
25. Would I, by previous wiles, inflame the queen
26. With passion for Aeneas, such strong love
27. That at my beck, mine only, she shall move.
28. Hear, and assist;--the father's mandate calls
29. His young Ascanius to the Tyrian walls;
30. He comes, my dear delight,--and costliest things
31. Preserved from fire and flood for presents brings.
32. Him will I take, and in close covert keep,
33. 'Mid groves Idalian, lulled to gentle sleep,
34. Or on Cythera's far-sequestered steep,
35. That he may neither know what hope is mine,
36. Nor by his presence traverse the design.
37. Do thou, but for a single night's brief space,
38. Dissemble; be that boy in form and face!
39. And when enraptured Dido shall receive
40. Thee to her arms, and kisses interweave
41. With many a fond embrace, while joy runs high,
42. And goblets crown the proud festivity,
43. Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire,
44. At every touch, an unsuspected fire.'

45. Love, at the word, before his mother's sight
46. Puts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight,
47. Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dews
48. Of slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuse
49. The true Ascanius steeped in placid rest;
50. Then wafts him, cherished on her careful breast,
51. Through upper air to an Idalian glade,
52. Where he on soft 'amaracus' is laid,
53. With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade.
54. But Cupid, following cheerily his guide
55. Achates, with the gifts to Carthage hied;
56. And, as the hall he entered, there, between
57. The sharers of her golden couch, was seen
58. Reclined in festal pomp the Tyrian queen.
59. The Trojans, too (Aeneas at their head),
60. On conches lie, with purple overspread:
61. Meantime in canisters is heaped the bread,
62. Pellucid water for the hands is borne,
63. And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn.
64. Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare,
65. As they in order stand, the dainty fare;
66. And fume the household deities with store
67. Of odorous incense; while a hundred more
68. Matched with an equal number of like age,
69. But each of manly sex, a docile page,
70. Marshal the banquet, giving with due grace
71. To cup or viand its appointed place.
72. The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band,
73. Their painted couches seek, obedient to command.
74. They look with wonder on the gifts--they gaze
75. Upon Iulus, dazzled with the rays
76. That from his ardent countenance are flung,
77. And charmed to hear his simulating tongue;
78. Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine,
79. Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.

80. But chiefly Dido, to the coming ill
81. Devoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill;
82. She views the gifts; upon the child then turns
83. Insatiable looks, and gazing burns.
84. To ease a father's cheated love he hung
85. Upon Aeneas, and around him clung;
86. Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries;
87. She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes,
88. Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!)
89. How great a God, incumbent o'er her breast,
90. Would fill it with his spirit. He, to please
91. His Acidalian mother, by degrees
92. Blots out Sichaeus, studious to remove
93. The dead, by influx of a living love,
94. By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest.
95. Troubling a heart that had been long at rest.

96. Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceased
97. The first division of the splendid feast,
98. While round a vacant board the chiefs recline,
99. Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine;
100. Voices of gladness roll the walls around;
101. Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound;
102. From gilded rafters many a blazing light
103. Depends, and torches overcome the night.
104. The minutes fly--till, at the queen's command,
105. A bowl of state is offered to her hand:
106. Then she, as Belus wont, and all the line
107. From Belus, filled it to the brim with wine;
108. Silence ensued. 'O Jupiter, whose care
109. Is hospitable dealing, grant my prayer!
110. Productive day be this of lasting joy
111. To Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy;
112. A day to future generations dear!
113. Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick'ning cheer,
114. Be present; kindly Juno, be thou near!
115. And, Tyrians, may your choicest favours wait
116. Upon this hour, the bond to celebrate!'
117. She spake and shed an offering on the board;
118. Then sipped the bowl whence she the wine had poured
119. And gave to Bitias, urging the prompt lord;
120. He raised the bowl, and took a long deep draught;
121. Then every chief in turn the beverage quaffed.

122. Graced with redundant hair, Iopas sings
123. The lore of Atlas, to resounding strings,
124. The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings;
125. When human kind, and brute; what natural powers
126. Engender lightning, whence are falling showers.
127. He haunts Arcturus,--that fraternal twain
128. The glittering Bears,--the Pleiads fraught with rain;
129. --Why suns in winter, shunning heaven's steep heights
130. Post seaward,--what impedes the tardy nights.
131. The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws
132. Loud shouts,--the Trojans echo the applause.
133. --But, lengthening out the night with converse new,
134. Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew;
135. Of Priam asked, of Hector--o'er and o'er--
136. What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;--
137. What steeds the car of Diomed could boast;
138. Among the leaders of the Grecian host.
139. How looked Achilles, their dread paramount--
140. 'But nay--the fatal wiles, O guest, recount,
141. Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source,
142. Your own grief and your friends?--your wandering course;
143. For now, till this seventh summer have ye ranged
144. The sea, or trod the earth, to peace estranged.'
