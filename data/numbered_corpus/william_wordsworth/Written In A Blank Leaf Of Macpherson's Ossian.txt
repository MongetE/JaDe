1. OFT have I caught, upon a fitful breeze,
2. Fragments of far-off melodies,
3. With ear not coveting the whole,
4. A part so charmed the pensive soul.
5. While a dark storm before my sight
6. Was yielding, on a mountain height
7. Loose vapours have I watched, that won
8. Prismatic colours from the sun;
9. Nor felt a wish that heaven would show
10. The image of its perfect bow.
11. What need, then, of these finished Strains?
12. Away with counterfeit Remains!
13. An abbey in its lone recess,
14. A temple of the wilderness,
15. Wrecks though they be, announce with feeling
16. The majesty of honest dealing.
17. Spirit of Ossian! if imbound
18. In language thou may'st yet be found,
19. If aught (intrusted to the pen
20. Or floating on the tongues of men,
21. Albeit shattered and impaired)
22. Subsist thy dignity to guard,
23. In concert with memorial claim
24. Of old grey stone, and high-born name
25. That cleaves to rock or pillared cave
26. Where moans the blast, or beats the wave,
27. Let Truth, stern arbitress of all,
28. Interpret that Original,
29. And for presumptuous wrongs atone;--
30. Authentic words be given, or none!
31. Time is not blind;--yet He, who spares
32. Pyramid pointing to the stars,
33. Hath preyed with ruthless appetite
34. On all that marked the primal flight
35. Of the poetic ecstasy
36. Into the land of mystery.
37. No tongue is able to rehearse
38. One measure, Orpheus! of thy verse;
39. Musaeus, stationed with his lyre
40. Supreme among the Elysian quire,
41. Is, for the dwellers upon earth,
42. Mute as a lark ere morning's birth.
43. Why grieve for these, though past away
44. The music, and extinct the lay?
45. When thousands, by severer doom,
46. Full early to the silent tomb
47. Have sunk, at Nature's call; or strayed
48. From hope and promise, self-betrayed;
49. The garland withering on their brows;
50. Stung with remorse for broken vows;
51. Frantic--else how might they rejoice?
52. And friendless, by their own sad choice!
53. Hail, Bards of mightier grasp! on you
54. I chiefly call, the chosen Few,
55. Who cast not off the acknowledged guide,
56. Who faltered not, nor turned aside;
57. Whose lofty genius could survive
58. Privation, under sorrow thrive;
59. In whom the fiery Muse revered
60. The symbol of a snow-white beard,
61. Bedewed with meditative tears
62. Dropped from the lenient cloud of years.
63. Brothers in soul! though distant times
64. Produced you nursed in various climes,
65. Ye, when the orb of life had waned,
66. A plenitude of love retained:
67. Hence, while in you each sad regret
68. By corresponding hope was met,
69. Ye lingered among human kind,
70. Sweet voices for the passing wind,
71. Departing sunbeams, loth to stop,
72. Though smiling on the last hill top!
73. Such to the tender-hearted maid
74. Even ere her joys begin to fade;
75. Such, haply, to the rugged chief
76. By fortune crushed, or tamed by grief;
77. Appears, on Morven's lonely shore,
78. Dim-gleaming through imperfect lore,
79. The Son of Fingal; such was blind
80. Maeonides of ampler mind;
81. Such Milton, to the fountain head
82. Of glory by Urania led!
