1. There's George Fisher, Charles Fleming, and Reginald Shore,
2. Three rosy-cheeked school-boys, the highest not more
3. Than the height of a counsellor's bag;
4. To the top of GREAT HOW did it please them to climb:
5. And there they built up, without mortar or lime,
6. A Man on the peak of the crag.

7. They built him of stones gathered up as they lay:
8. They built him and christened him all in one day,
9. An urchin both vigorous and hale;
10. And so without scruple they called him Ralph Jones.
11. Now Ralph is renowned for the length of his bones;
12. The Magog of Legberthwaite dale.

13. Just half a week after, the wind sallied forth,
14. And, in anger or merriment, out of the north,
15. Coming on with a terrible pother,
16. From the peak of the crag blew the giant away.
17. And what did these school-boys?--The very next day
18. They went and they built up another.

19. --Some little I've seen of blind boisterous works
20. By Christian disturbers more savage than Turks,
21. Spirits busy to do and undo:
22. At remembrance whereof my blood sometimes will flag;
23. Then, light-hearted Boys, to the top of the crag!
24. And I'll build up giant with you.
