1. THAT way look, my Infant, lo!
2. What a pretty baby-show!
3. See the kitten on the wall,
4. Sporting with the leaves that fall,
5. Withered leaves---one---two---and three---
6. From the lofty elder-tree!
7. Through the calm and frosty air
8. Of this morning bright and fair,
9. Eddying round and round they sink
10. Softly, slowly: one might think,
11. From the motions that are made,
12. Every little leaf conveyed
13. Sylph or Faery hither tending,---
14. To this lower world descending,
15. Each invisible and mute,
16. In his wavering parachute.
17. ---But the Kitten, how she starts,
18. Crouches, stretches, paws, and darts!
19. First at one, and then its fellow
20. Just as light and just as yellow;
21. There are many now---now one---
22. Now they stop and there are none
23. What intenseness of desire
24. In her upward eye of fire!
25. With a tiger-leap half way
26. Now she meets the coming prey,
27. Lets it go as fast, and then
28. Has it in her power again:
29. Now she works with three or four,
30. Like an Indian conjurer;
31. Quick as he in feats of art,
32. Far beyond in joy of heart.
33. Were her antics played in the eye
34. Of a thousand standers-by,
35. Clapping hands with shout and stare,
36. What would little Tabby care
37. For the plaudits of the crowd?
38. Over happy to be proud,
39. Over wealthy in the treasure
40. Of her own exceeding pleasure!
41. 'Tis a pretty baby-treat;
42. Nor, I deem, for me unmeet;
43. Here, for neither Babe nor me,
44. Other play-mate can I see.
45. Of the countless living things,
46. That with stir of feet and wings
47. (In the sun or under shade,
48. Upon bough or grassy blade)
49. And with busy revellings,
50. Chirp and song, and murmurings,
51. Made this orchard's narrow space,
52. And this vale so blithe a place;
53. Multitudes are swept away
54. Never more to breathe the day:
55. Some are sleeping; some in bands
56. Travelled into distant lands;
57. Others slunk to moor and wood,
58. Far from human neighborhood;
59. And, among the Kinds that keep
60. With us closer fellowship,
61. With us openly abide,
62. All have laid their mirth aside.
63. Where is he that giddy Sprite,
64. Blue-cap, with his colors bright,
65. Who was blest as bird could be,
66. Feeding in the apple-tree;
67. Made such wanton spoil and rout,
68. Turning blossoms inside out;
69. Hung---head pointing towards the ground---
70. Fluttered, perched, into a round
71. Bound himself, and then unbound;
72. Lithest, gaudiest Harlequin!
73. Prettiest Tumbler ever seen!
74. Light of heart and light of limb;
75. What is now become of Him?
76. Lambs, that through the mountains went
77. Frisking, bleating merriment,
78. When the year was in its prime,
79. They are sobered by this time.
80. If you look to vale or hill,
81. If you listen, all is still,
82. Save a little neighboring rill,
83. That from out the rocky ground
84. Strikes a solitary sound.
85. Vainly glitter hill and plain,
86. And the air is calm in vain;
87. Vainly Morning spreads the lure
88. Of a sky serene and pure;
89. Creature none can she decoy
90. Into open sign of joy:
91. Is it that they have a fear
92. Of the dreary season near?
93. Or that other pleasures be
94. Sweeter even than gaiety ?
95. Yet, whate'er enjoyments dwell
96. In the impenetrable cell
97. Of the silent heart which Nature
98. Furnishes to every creature;
99. Whatsoe'er we feel and know
100. Too sedate for outward show,
101. Such a light of gladness breaks,
102. Pretty Kitten! from thy freaks,---
103. Spreads with such a living grace
104. O'er my little Dora's face;
105. Yes, the sight so stirs and charms
106. Thee, Baby, laughing in my arms,
107. That almost I could repine
108. That your transports are not mine,
109. That I do not wholly fare
110. Even as ye do, thoughtless pair!
111. And I will have my careless season
112. Spite of melancholy reason,
113. Will walk through life in such a way
114. That, when time brings on decay,
115. Now and then I may possess
116. Hours of perfect gladsomeness.
117. ---Pleased by any random toy;
118. By a kitten's busy joy,
119. Or an infant's laughing eye
120. Sharing in the ecstasy;
121. I would fare like that or this,
122. Find my wisdom in my bliss;
123. Keep the sprightly soul awake,
124. And have faculties to take,
125. Even from things by sorrow wrought,
126. Matter for a jocund thought,
127. Spite of care, and spite of grief,
128. To gambol with Life's falling Leaf.
