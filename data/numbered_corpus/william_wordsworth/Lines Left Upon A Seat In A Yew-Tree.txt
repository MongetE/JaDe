1. Nay, Traveller! rest. This lonely Yew-tree stands
2. Far from all human dwelling: what if here
3. No sparkling rivulet spread the verdant herb?
4. What if the bee love not these barren boughs?
5. Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves,
6. That break against the shore, shall lull thy mind
7. By one soft impulse saved from vacancy.
8. --------------------Who he was
9. That piled these stones and with the mossy sod
10. First covered, and here taught this aged Tree
11. With its dark arms to form a circling bower,
12. I well remember.--He was one who owned
13. No common soul. In youth by science nursed,
14. And led by nature into a wild scene
15. Of lofty hopes, he to the world went forth
16. A favoured Being, knowing no desire
17. Which genius did not hallow; 'gainst the taint
18. Of dissolute tongues, and jealousy, and hate,
19. And scorn,--against all enemies prepared,
20. All but neglect. The world, for so it thought,
21. Owed him no service; wherefore he at once
22. With indignation turned himself away,
23. And with the food of pride sustained his soul
24. In solitude.--Stranger! these gloomy boughs
25. Had charms for him; and here he loved to sit,
26. His only visitants a straggling sheep,
27. The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper:
28. And on these barren rocks, with fern and heath,
29. And juniper and thistle, sprinkled o'er,
30. Fixing his downcast eye, he many an hour
31. A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here
32. An emblem of his own unfruitful life:
33. And, lifting up his head, he then would gaze
34. On the more distant scene,--how lovely 'tis
35. Thou seest,--and he would gaze till it became
36. Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain
37. The beauty, still more beauteous! Nor, that time,
38. When nature had subdued him to herself,
39. Would he forget those Beings to whose minds,
40. Warm from the labours of benevolence,
41. The world, and human life, appeared a scene
42. Of kindred loveliness: then he would sigh,
43. Inly disturbed, to think that others felt
44. What he must never feel: and so, lost Man!
45. On visionary views would fancy feed,
46. Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale
47. He died,--this seat his only monument.
48. If Thou be one whose heart the holy forms
49. Of young imagination have kept pure,
50. Stranger! henceforth be warned; and know that pride,
51. Howe'er disguised in its own majesty,
52. Is littleness; that he, who feels contempt
53. For any living thing, hath faculties
54. Which he has never used; that thought with him
55. Is in its infancy. The man whose eye
56. Is ever on himself doth look on one,
57. The least of Nature's works, one who might move
58. The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds
59. Unlawful, ever. O be wiser, Thou!
60. Instructed that true knowledge leads to love;
61. True dignity abides with him alone
62. Who, in the silent hour of inward thought,
63. Can still suspect, and still revere himself
64. In lowliness of heart.
