1. YE brood of conscience--Spectres! that frequent
2. The bad Man's restless walk, and haunt his bed--
3. Fiends in your aspect, yet beneficent
4. In act, as hovering Angels when they spread
5. Their wings to guard the unconscious Innocent--
6. Slow be the Statutes of the land to share
7. A laxity that could not but impair
8. 'Your' power to punish crime, and so prevent.
9. And ye, Beliefs! coiled serpent-like about
10. The adage on all tongues, 'Murder will out,'
11. How shall your ancient warnings work for good
12. In the full might they hitherto have shown,
13. If for deliberate shedder of man's blood
14. Survive not Judgment that requires his own?
