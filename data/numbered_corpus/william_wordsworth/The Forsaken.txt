1. The peace which other seek they find;
2. The heaviest storms not longet last;
3. Heaven grants even to the guiltiest mind
4. An amnesty for what is past;
5. When will my sentence be reversed?
6. I only pray to know the worst;
7. And wish as if my heart would burst.

8. O weary struggle! silent year
9. Tell seemingly no doubtful tale;
10. And yet they leave it short, and fear
11. And hopes are strong and will prevail.
12. My calmest faith escapes not pain;
13. And, feeling that the hope in vain,
14. I think that he will come again.
