1. --HAST thou then survived-
2. Mild Offspring of infirm humanity,
3. Meek Infant! among all forlornest things
4. The most forlorn-one life of that bright star,
5. The second glory of the Heavens?-Thou hast,
6. Already hast survived that great decay,
7. That transformation through the wide earth felt,
8. And by all nations. In that Being's sight
9. From whom the Race of human kind proceed,
10. A thousand years are but as yesterday;
11. And one day's narrow circuit is to Him
12. Not less capacious than a thousand years.
13. But what is time? What outward glory? neither
14. A measure is of Thee, whose claims extend
15. Through 'heaven's eternal year.'-Yet hail to Thee,
16. Frail, feeble Monthling!-by that name, methinks,
17. Thy scanty breathing-time is portioned out
18. Not idly.-Hadst thou been of Indian birth,
19. Couched on a casual bed of moss and leaves,
20. And rudely canopied by leafy boughs,
21. Or to the churlish elements exposed
22. On the blank plains,-the coldness of the night,
23. Or the night's darkness, or its cheerful face
24. Of beauty, by the changing moon adorned,
25. Would, with imperious admonition, then
26. Have scored thine age, and punctually timed
27. Thine infant history, on the minds of those
28. Who might have wandered with thee.-Mother's love,
29. Nor less than mother's love in other breasts,
30. Will, among us warm-clad and warmly housed,
31. Do for thee what the finger of the heavens
32. Doth all too often harshly execute
33. For thy unblest coevals, amid wilds
34. Where fancy hath small liberty to grace
35. The affections, to exalt them or refine;
36. And the maternal sympathy itself,
37. Though strong, is, in the main, a joyless tie
38. Of naked instinct, wound about the heart.
39. Happier, far happier is thy lot and ours!
40. Even now-to solemnise thy helpless state,
41. And to enliven in the mind's regard
42. Thy passive beauty-parallels have risen,
43. Resemblances, or contrasts, that connect,
44. Within the region of a father's thoughts,
45. Thee and thy mate and sister of the sky.
46. And first;-thy sinless progress, through a world
47. By sorrow darkened and by care disturbed,
48. Apt likeness bears to hers, through gathered clouds,
49. Moving untouched in silver purity,
50. And cheering oft-times their reluctant gloom.
51. Fair are ye both, and both are free from stain:
52. But thou, how leisurely thou fill'st thy horn
53. With brightness! leaving her to post along,
54. And range about, disquieted in change,
55. And still impatient of the shape she wears.
56. Once up, once down the hill, one journey, Babe
57. That will suffice thee; and it seems that now
58. Thou hast fore-knowledge that such task is thine;
59. Thou travellest so contentedly, and sleep'st
60. In such a heedless peace. Alas! full soon
61. Hath this conception, grateful to behold,
62. Changed countenance, like an object sullied o'er
63. By breathing mist; and thine appears to be
64. A mournful labour, while to her is given
65. Hope, and a renovation without end.
66. -That smile forbids the thought; for on thy face
67. Smiles are beginning, like the beams of dawn,
68. To shoot and circulate; smiles have there been seen
69. Tranquil assurances that Heaven supports
70. The feeble motions of thy life, and cheers
71. Thy loneliness: or shall those smiles be called
72. Feelers of love, put forth as if to explore
73. This untried world, and to prepare thy way
74. Through a strait passage intricate and dim?
75. Such are they; and the same are tokens, signs,
76. Which, when the appointed season hath arrived,
77. Joy, as her holiest language, shall adopt;
78. And Reason's godlike Power be proud to own.
