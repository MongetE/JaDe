1. WITHIN our happy castle there dwelt One
2. Whom without blame I may not overlook;
3. For never sun on living creature shone
4. Who more devout enjoyment with us took:
5. Here on his hours he hung as on a book,
6. On his own time here would he float away,
7. As doth a fly upon a summer brook;
8. But go tomorrow, or belike today,
9. Seek for him,---he is fled; and whither none can say.

10. Thus often would he leave our peaceful home,
11. And find elsewhere his business or delight;
12. Out of our Valley's limit did he roam:
13. Full many a time, upon a stormy night,
14. His voice came to us from the neighbouring height:
15. Oft could we see him driving full in view
16. At mid-day when the sun was shining bright;
17. What ill was on him, what he had to do,
18. A mighty wonder bred among our quiet crew.

19. Ah! piteous sight it was to see this Man
20. When he came back to us, a withered flower,---
21. Or like a sinful creature, pale and wan.
22. Down would he sit; and without strength or power
23. Look at the common grass from hour to hour:
24. And oftentimes, how long I fear to say,
25. Where apple-trees in blossom made a bower,
26. Retired in that sunshiny shade he lay;
27. And, like a naked Indian, slept himself away.

28. Great wonder to our gentle tribe it was
29. Whenever from our Valley he withdrew;
30. For happier soul no living creature has
31. Than he had, beiug here the long day through.
32. Some thought he was a lover, and did woo:
33. Some thought far worse of him, and judged him wrong;
34. But verse was what he had been wedded to;
35. And his own mind did like a tempest strong
36. Come to him thus, and drove the weary Wight along.

37. With him there often walked in friendly guise,
38. Or lay upon the moss by brook or tree,
39. A noticeable Man with large grey eyes,
40. And a pale face that seemed undoubtedly
41. As if a blooming face it ought to be;
42. Heavy his low-hung lip did oft appear,
43. Deprest by weight of musing Phantasy;
44. Profound his forehead was, though not severe;
45. Yet some did think that he had little business here:

46. Sweet heaven forfend! his was a lawful right;
47. Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy;
48. His limbs would toss about him with delight
49. Like branches when strong winds the trees annoy.
50. Nor lacked his calmer hours device or toy
51. To banish listlessness and irksome care;
52. He would have taught you how you might employ
53. Yourself; and many did to him repair,---
54. And certes not in vain; he had inventions rare.

55. Expedients, too, of simplest sort he tried:
56. Long blades of grass, plucked round him as he lay,
57. Made, to his ear attentively applied,
58. A pipe on which the wind would deftly play;
59. Glasses he had, that little things display,
60. The beetle panoplied in gems and gold,
61. A mailed angel on a battle-day;
62. The mysteries that cups of flowers enfold,
63. And all the gorgeous sights which fairies do behold.

64. He would entice that other Man to hear
65. His music, and to view his imagery:
66. And, sooth, these two were each to the other dear:
67. No livelier love in such a place could be:
68. There did they dwell â€• from earthly labour free,
69. As happy spirits as were ever seen;
70. If but a bird, to keep them company,
71. Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween,
72. As pleased as if the same had been a Maiden-queen.
