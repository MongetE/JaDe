1. CALVERT! it must not be unheard by them
2. Who may respect my name, that I to thee
3. Owed many years of early liberty.
4. This care was thine when sickness did condemn
5. Thy youth to hopeless wasting, root and stem--
6. That I, if frugal and severe, might stray
7. Where'er I liked; and finally array
8. My temples with the Muse's diadem.
9. Hence, if in freedom I have loved the truth;
10. If there be aught of pure, or good, or great,
11. In my past verse; or shall be, in the lays
12. Of higher mood, which now I meditate;--
13. It gladdens me, O worthy, short-lived, Youth!
14. To think how much of this will be thy praise.
