1. When Ruth was left half desolate,
2. Her Father took another Mate;
3. And Ruth, not seven years old,
4. A slighted child, at her own will
5. Went wandering over dale and hill,
6. In thoughtless freedom, bold.

7. And she had made a pipe of straw,
8. And music from that pipe could draw
9. Like sounds of winds and floods;
10. Had built a bower upon the green,
11. As if she from her birth had been
12. An infant of the woods.

13. Beneath her father's roof, alone
14. She seemed to live; her thoughts her own;
15. Herself her own delight;
16. Pleased with herself, nor sad, nor gay;
17. And, passing thus the live-long day,
18. She grew to woman's height.

19. There came a Youth from Georgia's shore--
20. A military casque he wore,
21. With splendid feathers drest;
22. He brought them from the Cherokees;
23. The feathers nodded in the breeze,
24. And made a gallant crest.

25. From Indian blood you deem him sprung:
26. But no! he spake the English tongue,
27. And bore a soldier's name;
28. And, when America was free
29. From battle and from jeopardy,
30. He 'cross the ocean came.

31. With hues of genius on his cheek
32. In finest tones the Youth could speak:
33. --While he was yet a boy,
34. The moon, the glory of the sun,
35. And streams that murmur as they run,
36. Had been his dearest joy.

37. He was a lovely Youth! I guess
38. The panther in the wilderness
39. Was not so fair as he;
40. And, when he chose to sport and play,
41. No dolphin ever was so gay
42. Upon the tropic sea.

43. Among the Indians he had fought,
44. And with him many tales he brought
45. Of pleasure and of fear;
46. Such tales as told to any maid
47. By such a Youth, in the green shade,
48. Were perilous to hear.

49. He told of girls--a happy rout!
50. Who quit their fold with dance and shout,
51. Their pleasant Indian town,
52. To gather strawberries all day long;
53. Returning with a choral song
54. When daylight is gone down.

55. He spake of plants that hourly change
56. Their blossoms, through a boundless range
57. Of intermingling hues;
58. With budding, fading, faded flowers
59. They stand the wonder of the bowers
60. From morn to evening dews.

61. He told of the magnolia, spread
62. High as a cloud, high over head!
63. The cypress and her spire;
64. --Of flowers that with one scarlet gleam
65. Cover a hundred leagues, and seem
66. To set the hills on fire.

67. The Youth of green savannahs spake,
68. And many an endless, endless lake,
69. With all its fairy crowds
70. Of islands, that together lie
71. As quietly as spots of sky
72. Among the evening clouds.

73. "How pleasant," then he said, "it were
74. A fisher or a hunter there,
75. In sunshine or in shade
76. To wander with an easy mind;
77. And build a household fire, and find
78. A home in every glade!

79. "What days and what bright years! Ah me!
80. Our life were life indeed, with thee
81. So passed in quiet bliss,
82. And all the while," said he, "to know
83. That we were in a world of woe,
84. On such an earth as this!"

85. And then he sometimes interwove
86. Fond thoughts about a father's love
87. "For there," said he, "are spun
88. Around the heart such tender ties,
89. That our own children to our eyes
90. Are dearer than the sun.

91. "Sweet Ruth! and could you go with me
92. My helpmate in the woods to be,
93. Our shed at night to rear;
94. Or run, my own adopted bride,
95. A sylvan huntress at my side,
96. And drive the flying deer!

97. "Beloved Ruth!"--No more he said,
98. The wakeful Ruth at midnight shed
99. A solitary tear:
100. She thought again--and did agree 0
101. With him to sail across the sea,
102. And drive the flying deer.

103. "And now, as fitting is and right,
104. We in the church our faith will plight,
105. A husband and a wife."
106. Even so they did; and I may say
107. That to sweet Ruth that happy day
108. Was more than human life.

109. Through dream and vision did she sink,
110. Delighted all the while to think
111. That on those lonesome floods,
112. And green savannahs, she should share
113. His board with lawful joy, and bear
114. His name in the wild woods.

115. But, as you have before been told,
116. This Stripling, sportive, gay, and bold,
117. And, with his dancing crest,
118. So beautiful, through savage lands
119. Had roamed about, with vagrant bands
120. Of Indians in the West.

121. The wind, the tempest roaring high,
122. The tumult of a tropic sky,
123. Might well be dangerous food
124. For him, a Youth to whom was given
125. So much of earth--so much of heaven,
126. And such impetuous blood.

127. Whatever in those climes he found
128. Irregular in sight or sound
129. Did to his mind impart
130. A kindred impulse, seemed allied
131. To his own powers, and justified
132. The workings of his heart.

133. Nor less, to feed voluptuous thought,
134. The beauteous forms of nature wrought,
135. Fair trees and gorgeous flowers;
136. The breezes their own languor lent;
137. The stars had feelings, which they sent
138. Into those favoured bowers.

139. Yet, in his worst pursuits, I ween
140. That sometimes there did intervene
141. Pure hopes of high intent:
142. For passions linked to forms so fair
143. And stately, needs must have their share
144. Of noble sentiment.

145. But ill he lived, much evil saw,
146. With men to whom no better law
147. Nor better life was known;
148. Deliberately, and undeceived,
149. Those wild men's vices he received,
150. And gave them back his own.

151. His genius and his moral frame
152. Were thus impaired, and he became
153. The slave of low desires:
154. A Man who without self-control
155. Would seek what the degraded soul
156. Unworthily admires.

157. And yet he with no feigned delight
158. Had wooed the Maiden, day and night
159. Had loved her, night and morn:
160. What could he less than love a Maid
161. Whose heart with so much nature played?
162. So kind and so forlorn!

163. Sometimes, most earnestly, he said,
164. "O Ruth! I have been worse than dead;
165. False thoughts, thoughts bold and vain,
166. Encompassed me on every side
167. When I, in confidence and pride,
168. Had crossed the Atlantic main.

169. "Before me shone a glorious world--
170. Fresh as a banner bright, unfurled
171. To music suddenly:
172. I looked upon those hills and plains,
173. And seemed as if let loose from chains,
174. To live at liberty.

175. "No more of this; for now, by thee
176. Dear Ruth! more happily set free
177. With nobler zeal I burn;
178. My soul from darkness is released,
179. Like the whole sky when to the east
180. The morning doth return."

181. Full soon that better mind was gone;
182. No hope, no wish remained, not one,--
183. They stirred him now no more;
184. New objects did new pleasure give,
185. And once again he wished to live
186. As lawless as before.

187. Meanwhile, as thus with him it fared,
188. They for the voyage were prepared,
189. And went to the sea-shore,
190. But, when they thither came the Youth
191. Deserted his poor Bride, and Ruth
192. Could never find him more.

193. God help thee, Ruth!--Such pains she had,
194. That she in half a year was mad,
195. And in a prison housed;
196. And there, with many a doleful song
197. Made of wild words, her cup of wrong
198. She fearfully caroused.

199. Yet sometimes milder hours she knew,
200. Nor wanted sun, nor rain, nor dew, 0
201. Nor pastimes of the May;
202. --They all were with her in her cell;
203. And a clear brook with cheerful knell
204. Did o'er the pebbles play.

205. When Ruth three seasons thus had lain,
206. There came a respite to her pain;
207. She from her prison fled;
208. But of the Vagrant none took thought;
209. And where it liked her best she sought
210. Her shelter and her bread.

211. Among the fields she breathed again:
212. The master-current of her brain
213. Ran permanent and free;
214. And, coming to the Banks of Tone,
215. There did she rest; and dwell alone
216. Under the greenwood tree.

217. The engines of her pain, the tools
218. That shaped her sorrow, rocks and pools,
219. And airs that gently stir
220. The vernal leaves--she loved them still;
221. Nor ever taxed them with the ill
222. Which had been done to her.

223. A Barn her 'winter' bed supplies;
224. But, till the warmth of summer skies
225. And summer days is gone,
226. (And all do in this tale agree)
227. She sleeps beneath the greenwood tree,
228. And other home hath none.

229. An innocent life, yet far astray!
230. And Ruth will, long before her day,
231. Be broken down and old:
232. Sore aches she needs must have! but less
233. Of mind, than body's wretchedness,
234. From damp, and rain, and cold.

235. If she is prest by want of food,
236. She from her dwelling in the wood
237. Repairs to a road-side;
238. And there she begs at one steep place
239. Where up and down with easy pace
240. The horsemen-travellers ride.

241. That oaten pipe of hers is mute,
242. Or thrown away; but with a flute
243. Her loneliness she cheers:
244. This flute, made of a hemlock stalk,
245. At evening in his homeward walk
246. The Quantock woodman hears.

247. I, too, have passed her on the hills
248. Setting her little water-mills
249. By spouts and fountains wild--
250. Such small machinery as she turned
251. Ere she had wept, ere she had mourned,
252. A young and happy Child!

253. Farewell! and when thy days are told,
254. Ill-fated Ruth, in hallowed mould
255. Thy corpse shall buried be,
256. For thee a funeral bell shall ring,
257. And all the congregation sing
258. A Christian psalm for thee.
