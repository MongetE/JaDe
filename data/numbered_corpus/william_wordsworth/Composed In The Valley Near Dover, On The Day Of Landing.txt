1. HERE, on our native soil, we breathe once more.
2. The cock that crows, the smoke that curls, that sound
3. Of bells; those boys who in yon meadow-ground
4. In white-sleeved shirts are playing; and the roar
5. Of the waves breaking on the chalky shore;--
6. All, all are English. Oft have I looked round
7. With joy in Kent's green vales; but never found
8. Myself so satisfied in heart before.
9. Europe is yet in bonds; but let that pass,
10. Thought for another moment. Thou art free,
11. My Country! and 'tis joy enough and pride
12. For one hour's perfect bliss, to tread the grass
13. Of England once again, and hear and see,
14. With such a dear Companion at my side.
