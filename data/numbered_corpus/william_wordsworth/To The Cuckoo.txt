1. O BLITHE New-comer! I have heard,
2. I hear thee and rejoice.
3. O Cuckoo! Shall I call thee Bird,
4. Or but a wandering Voice?

5. While I am lying on the grass
6. Thy twofold shout I hear,
7. From hill to hill it seems to pass,
8. At once far off, and near.

9. Though babbling only to the Vale,
10. Of Sunshine and of flowers,
11. Thou bringest unto me a tale
12. Of visionary hours.

13. Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring!
14. Even yet thou art to me
15. No bird, but an invisible thing,
16. A voice, a mystery;

17. The same whom in my school-boy days
18. I listened to; that Cry
19. Which made me look a thousand ways
20. In bush, and tree, and sky.

21. To seek thee did I often rove
22. Through woods and on the green;
23. And thou wert still a hope, a love;
24. Still longed for, never seen.

25. And I can listen to thee yet;
26. Can lie upon the plain
27. And listen, till I do beget
28. That golden time again.

29. O blessed Bird! the earth we pace
30. Again appears to be
31. An unsubstantial, faery place;
32. That is fit home for Thee!
