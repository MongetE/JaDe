1. O FRIEND! I know not which way I must look
2. For comfort, being, as I am, opprest,
3. To think that now our life is only drest
4. For show; mean handy-work of craftsman, cook,
5. Or groom!--We must run glittering like a brook
6. In the open sunshine, or we are unblest:
7. The wealthiest man among us is the best:
8. No grandeur now in nature or in book
9. Delights us. Rapine, avarice, expense,
10. This is idolatry; and these we adore:
11. Plain living and high thinking are no more:
12. The homely beauty of the good old cause
13. Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence,
14. And pure religion breathing household laws.
