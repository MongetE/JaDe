1. THE prayers I make will then be sweet indeed
2. If Thou the spirit give by which I pray:
3. My unassisted heart is barren clay,
4. That of its native self can nothing feed:
5. Of good and pious works thou art the seed,
6. That quickens only where thou say'st it may:
7. Unless Thou show to us thine own true way
8. No man can find it: Father! Thou must lead.
9. Do Thou, then, breathe those thoughts into my mind
10. By which such virtue may in me be bred
11. That in thy holy footsteps I may tread;
12. The fetters of my tongue do Thou unbind,
13. That I may have the power to sing of thee,
14. And sound thy praises everlastingly.
