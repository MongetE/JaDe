1. WHAT need of clamorous bells, or ribands gay,
2. These humble nuptials to proclaim or grace?
3. Angels of love, look down upon the place;
4. Shed on the chosen vale a sun-bright day!
5. Yet no proud gladness would the Bride display
6. Even for such promise:--serious is her face,
7. Modest her mien; and she, whose thoughts keep pace
8. With gentleness, in that becoming way
9. Will thank you. Faultless does the Maid appear;
10. No disproportion in her soul, no strife:
11. But, when the closer view of wedded life
12. Hath shown that nothing human can be clear
13. From frailty, for that insight may the Wife
14. To her indulgent Lord become more dear.
