1. LONG time have human ignorance and guilt
2. Detained us, on what spectacles of woe
3. Compelled to look, and inwardly oppressed
4. With sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts,
5. Confusion of the judgment, zeal decayed,
6. And, lastly, utter loss of hope itself
7. And things to hope for! Not with these began
8. Our song, and not with these our song must end.
9. Ye motions of delight, that haunt the sides
10. Of the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs,
11. Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,
12. Feelingly watched, might teach Man's haughty race
13. How without Injury to take, to give
14. Without offence; ye who, as if to show
15. The wondrous influence of power gently used,
16. Bend the complying heads of lordly pines,
17. And, with a touch, shift the stupendous clouds
18. Through the whole compass of the sky; ye brooks,
19. Muttering along the stones, a busy noise
20. By day, a quiet sound in silent night;
21. Ye waves, that out of the great deep steal forth
22. In a calm hour to kiss the pebbly shore,
23. Not mute, and then retire, fearing no storm;
24. And you, ye groves, whose ministry it is
25. To interpose the covert of your shades,
26. Even as a sleep, between the heart of man
27. And outward troubles, between man himself,
28. Not seldom, and his own uneasy heart:
29. Oh! that I had a music and a voice
30. Harmonious as your own, that I might tell
31. What ye have done for me. The morning shines,
32. Nor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring returns,--
33. I saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,
34. In common with the children of her love,
35. Piping on boughs, or sporting on fresh fields,
36. Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer heaven
37. On wings that navigate cerulean skies.
38. So neither were complacency, nor peace,
39. Nor tender yearnings, wanting for my good
40. Through these distracted times; in Nature still
41. Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her,
42. Which, when the spirit of evil reached its height,
43. Maintained for me a secret happiness.

44. This narrative, my Friend! hath chiefly told
45. Of intellectual power, fostering love,
46. Dispensing truth, and, over men and things,
47. Where reason yet might hesitate, diffusing
48. Prophetic sympathies of genial faith:
49. So was I favoured--such my happy lot--
50. Until that natural graciousness of mind
51. Gave way to overpressure from the times
52. And their disastrous issues. What availed,
53. When spells forbade the voyager to land,
54. That fragrant notice of a pleasant shore
55. Wafted, at intervals, from many a bower
56. Of blissful gratitude and fearless love?
57. Dare I avow that wish was mine to see,
58. And hope that future times 'would' surely see,
59. The man to come, parted, as by a gulph,
60. From him who had been; that I could no more
61. Trust the elevation which had made me one
62. With the great family that still survives
63. To illuminate the abyss of ages past,
64. Sage, warrior, patriot, hero; for it seemed
65. That their best virtues were not free from taint
66. Of something false and weak, that could not stand
67. The open eye of Reason. Then I said,
68. 'Go to the Poets, they will speak to thee
69. More perfectly of purer creatures;--yet
70. If reason be nobility in man,
71. Can aught be more ignoble than the man
72. Whom they delight in, blinded as he is
73. By prejudice, the miserable slave
74. Of low ambition or distempered love?'

75. In such strange passion, if I may once more
76. Review the past, I warred against myself--
77. A bigot to a new idolatry--
78. Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world,
79. Zealously laboured to cut off my heart
80. From all the sources of her former strength;
81. And as, by simple waving of a wand,
82. The wizard instantaneously dissolves
83. Palace or grove, even so could I unsoul
84. As readily by syllogistic words
85. Those mysteries of being which have made,
86. And shall continue evermore to make,
87. Of the whole human race one brotherhood.

88. What wonder, then, if, to a mind so far
89. Perverted, even the visible Universe
90. Fell under the dominion of a taste
91. Less spiritual, with microscopic view
92. Was scanned, as I had scanned the moral world?

93. O Soul of Nature! excellent and fair!
94. That didst rejoice with me, with whom I, too,
95. Rejoiced through early youth, before the winds
96. And roaring waters, and in lights and shades
97. That marched and countermarched about the hills
98. In glorious apparition, Powers on whom
99. I daily waited, now all eye and now
100. All ear; but never long without the heart
101. Employed, and man's unfolding intellect:
102. O Soul of Nature! that, by laws divine
103. Sustained and governed, still dost overflow
104. With an impassioned life, what feeble ones
105. Walk on this earth! how feeble have I been
106. When thou wert in thy strength! Nor this through stroke
107. Of human suffering, such as justifies
108. Remissness and inaptitude of mind,
109. But through presumption; even in pleasure pleased
110. Unworthily, disliking here, and there
111. Liking; by rules of mimic art transferred
112. To things above all art; but more,--for this,
113. Although a strong infection of the age,
114. Was never much my habit--giving way
115. To a comparison of scene with scene,
116. Bent overmuch on superficial things,
117. Pampering myself with meagre novelties
118. Of colour and proportion; to the moods
119. Of time and season, to the moral power,
120. The affections and the spirit of the place,
121. Insensible. Nor only did the love
122. Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt
123. My deeper feelings, but another cause,
124. More subtle and less easily explained,
125. That almost seems inherent in the creature,
126. A twofold frame of body and of mind.
127. I speak in recollection of a time
128. When the bodily eye, in every stage of life
129. The most despotic of our senses, gained
130. Such strength in 'me' as often held my mind
131. In absolute dominion. Gladly here,
132. Entering upon abstruser argument,
133. Could I endeavour to unfold the means
134. Which Nature studiously employs to thwart
135. This tyranny, summons all the senses each
136. To counteract the other, and themselves,
137. And makes them all, and the objects with which all
138. Are conversant, subservient in their turn
139. To the great ends of Liberty and Power.
140. But leave we this: enough that my delights
141. (Such as they were) were sought insatiably.
142. Vivid the transport, vivid though not profound;
143. I roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock,
144. Still craving combinations of new forms,
145. New pleasure, wider empire for the sight,
146. Proud of her own endowments, and rejoiced
147. To lay the inner faculties asleep.
148. Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife
149. And various trials of our complex being,
150. As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense
151. Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid,
152. A young enthusiast, who escaped these bonds;
153. Her eye was not the mistress of her heart;
154. Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste,
155. Or barren intermeddling subtleties,
156. Perplex her mind; but, wise as women are
157. When genial circumstance hath favoured them,
158. She welcomed what was given, and craved no more;
159. Whate'er the scene presented to her view
160. That was the best, to that she was attuned
161. By her benign simplicity of life,
162. And through a perfect happiness of soul,
163. Whose variegated feelings were in this
164. Sisters, that they were each some new delight.
165. Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field,
166. Could they have known her, would have loved; methought
167. Her very presence such a sweetness breathed,
168. That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,
169. And everything she looked on, should have had
170. An intimation how she bore herself
171. Towards them and to all creatures. God delights
172. In such a being; for, her common thoughts
173. Are piety, her life is gratitude.

174. Even like this maid, before I was called forth
175. From the retirement of my native hills,
176. I loved whate'er I saw: nor lightly loved,
177. But most intensely; never dreamt of aught
178. More grand, more fair, more exquisitely framed
179. Than those few nooks to which my happy feet
180. Were limited. I had not at that time
181. Lived long enough, nor in the least survived
182. The first diviner influence of this world,
183. As it appears to unaccustomed eyes.
184. Worshipping them among the depth of things,
185. As piety ordained, could I submit
186. To measured admiration, or to aught
187. That should preclude humility and love?
188. I felt, observed, and pondered; did not judge,
189. Yea, never thought of judging; with the gift
190. Of all this glory filled and satisfied.
191. And afterwards, when through the gorgeous Alps
192. Roaming, I carried with me the same heart:
193. In truth, the degradation--howsoe'er
194. Induced, effect, in whatsoe'er degree,
195. Of custom that prepares a partial scale
196. In which the little oft outweighs the great;
197. Or any other cause that hath been named;
198. Or lastly, aggravated by the times
199. And their impassioned sounds, which well might make
200. The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes
201. Inaudible--was transient; I had known
202. Too forcibly, too early in my life,
203. Visitings of imaginative power
204. For this to last: I shook the habit off
205. Entirely and for ever, and again
206. In Nature's presence stood, as now I stand,
207. A sensitive being, a 'creative' soul.

208. There are in our existence spots of time,
209. That with distinct pre-eminence retain
210. A renovating virtue, whence--depressed
211. By false opinion and contentious thought,
212. Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,
213. In trivial occupations, and the round
214. Of ordinary intercourse--our minds
215. Are nourished and invisibly repaired;
216. A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,
217. That penetrates, enables us to mount,
218. When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.
219. This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks
220. Among those passages of life that give
221. Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,
222. The mind is lord and master--outward sense
223. The obedient servant of her will. Such moments
224. Are scattered everywhere, taking their date
225. From our first childhood. I remember well,
226. That once, while yet my inexperienced hand
227. Could scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes
228. I mounted, and we journeyed towards the hills:
229. An ancient servant of my father's house
230. Was with me, my encourager and guide:
231. We had not travelled long, ere some mischance
232. Disjoined me from my comrade; and, through fear
233. Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor
234. I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length
235. Came to a bottom, where in former times
236. A murderer had been hung in iron chains.
237. The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones
238. And iron case were gone; but on the turf,
239. Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought,
240. Some unknown hand had carved the murderer's name.
241. The monumental letters were inscribed
242. In times long past; but still, from year to year
243. By superstition of the neighbourhood,
244. The grass is cleared away, and to this hour
245. The characters are fresh and visible:
246. A casual glance had shown them, and I fled,
247. Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:
248. Then, reascending the bare common, saw
249. A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,
250. The beacon on the summit, and, more near,
251. A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,
252. And seemed with difficult steps to force her way
253. Against the blowing wind. It was, in truth,
254. An ordinary sight; but I should need
255. Colours and words that are unknown to man,
256. To paint the visionary dreariness
257. Which, while I looked all round for my lost guide,
258. Invested moorland waste and naked pool,
259. The beacon crowning the lone eminence,
260. The female and her garments vexed and tossed
261. By the strong wind. When, in the blessed hours
262. Of early love, the loved one at my side,
263. I roamed, in daily presence of this scene,
264. Upon the naked pool and dreary crags,
265. And on the melancholy beacon, fell
266. A spirit of pleasure and youth's golden gleam;
267. And think ye not with radiance more sublime
268. For these remembrances, and for the power
269. They had left behind? So feeling comes in aid
270. Of feeling, and diversity of strength
271. Attends us, if but once we have been strong.
272. Oh! mystery of man, from what a depth
273. Proceed thy honours. I am lost, but see
274. In simple childhood something of the base
275. On which thy greatness stands; but this I feel,
276. That from thyself it comes, that thou must give,
277. Else never canst receive. The days gone by
278. Return upon me almost from the dawn
279. Of life: the hiding-places of man's power
280. Open; I would approach them, but they close.
281. I see by glimpses now; when age comes on,
282. May scarcely see at all; and I would give,
283. While yet we may, as far as words can give,
284. Substance and life to what I feel, enshrining,
285. Such is my hope, the spirit of the Past
286. For future restoration.--Yet another
287. Of these memorials:--
288. One Christmas-time,
289. On the glad eve of its dear holidays,
290. Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth
291. Into the fields, impatient for the sight
292. Of those led palfreys that should bear us home;
293. My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,
294. That, from the meeting-point of two highways
295. Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched;
296. Thither, uncertain on which road to fix
297. My expectation, thither I repaired,
298. Scout-like, and gained the summit; 'twas a day
299. Tempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass
300. I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;
301. Upon my right hand couched a single sheep,
302. Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;
303. With those companions at my side, I watched
304. Straining my eyes intensely, as the mist
305. Gave intermitting prospect of the copse
306. And plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,--
307. That dreary time,--ere we had been ten days
308. Sojourners in my father's house, he died;
309. And I and my three brothers, orphans then,
310. Followed his body to the grave. The event,
311. With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared
312. A chastisement; and when I called to mind
313. That day so lately past, when from the crag
314. I looked in such anxiety of hope;
315. With trite reflections of morality,
316. Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low
317. To God, Who thus corrected my desires;
318. And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,
319. And all the business of the elements,
320. The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,
321. And the bleak music from that old stone wall,
322. The noise of wood and water, and the mist
323. That on the line of each of those two roads
324. Advanced in such indisputable shapes;
325. All these were kindred spectacles and sounds
326. To which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,
327. As at a fountain; and on winter nights,
328. Down to this very time, when storm and rain
329. Beat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,
330. While in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees,
331. Laden with summer's thickest foliage, rock
332. In a strong wind, some working of the spirit,
333. Some inward agitations thence are brought,
334. Whate'er their office, whether to beguile
335. Thoughts over busy in the course they took,
336. Or animate an hour of vacant ease.
