1. Where holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,
2. Is marked by no distinguishable line;
3. The turf unites, the pathways intertwine;
4. And, wheresoe'er the stealing footstep tends,
5. Garden, and that domain where kindred, friends,
6. And neighbours rest together, here confound
7. Their several features, mingled like the sound
8. Of many waters, or as evening blends
9. With shady night. Soft airs, from shrub and flower,
10. Waft fragrant greetings to each silent grave;
11. And while those lofty poplars gently wave
12. Their tops, between them comes and goes a sky
13. Bright as the glimpses of eternity,
14. To saints accorded in their mortal hour.
