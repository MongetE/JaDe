1. .   Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,
2. With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned--
3. Albeit labouring for a scanty band
4. Of white-robed Scholars only--this immense
5. And glorious Work of fine intelligence!
6. Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore
7. Of nicely-calculated less or more;
8. So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense
9. These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof
10. Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,
11. Where light and shade repose, where music dwells
12. Lingering--and wandering on as loth to die;
13. Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof
14. That they were born for immortality.
