1. PRAISED be the Art whose subtle power could stay
2. Yon cloud, and fix it in that glorious shape;
3. Nor would permit the thin smoke to escape,
4. Nor those bright sunbeams to forsake the day;
5. Which stopped that band of travellers on their way,
6. Ere they were lost within the shady wood;
7. And showed the Bark upon the glassy flood
8. For ever anchored in her sheltering bay.
9. Soul-soothing Art! whom Morning, Noontide, Even,
10. Do serve with all their changeful pageantry;
11. Thou, with ambition modest yet sublime,
12. Here, for the sight of mortal man, hast given
13. To one brief moment caught from fleeting time
14. The appropriate calm of blest eternity.
