1. I.
2. STRANGE fits of passion have I known:
3. And I will dare to tell,
4. But in the lover's ear alone,
5. What once to me befell.

6. When she I loved look'd every day
7. Fresh as a rose in June,
8. I to her cottage bent my way,
9. Beneath an evening moon.

10. Upon the moon I fix'd my eye,
11. All over the wide lea;
12. With quickening pace my horse drew nigh
13. Those paths so dear to me.

14. And now we reach'd the orchard-plot;
15. And, as we climb'd the hill,
16. The sinking moon to Lucy's cot
17. Came near and nearer still.

18. In one of those sweet dreams I slept,
19. Kind Nature's gentlest boon!
20. And all the while my eyes I kept
21. On the descending moon.

22. My horse moved on; hoof after hoof
23. He raised, and never stopp'd:
24. When down behind the cottage roof,
25. At once, the bright moon dropp'd.

26. What fond and wayward thoughts will slide
27. Into a lover's head!
28. 'O mercy! ' to myself I cried,
29. 'If Lucy should be dead! '

30. II.

31. HE dwelt among the untrodden ways
32. Beside the springs of Dove,
33. A Maid whom there were none to praise
34. And very few to love:

35. A violet by a mossy stone
36. Half hidden from the eye!
37. Fair as a star, when only one
38. Is shining in the sky.

39. She lived unknown, and few could know
40. When Lucy ceased to be;
41. But she is in her grave, and oh,
42. The difference to me!

43. III.

44. TRAVELL'D among unknown men,
45. In lands beyond the sea;
46. Nor, England! did I know till then
47. What love I bore to thee.

48. 'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
49. Nor will I quit thy shore
50. A second time; for still I seem
51. To love thee more and more.

52. Among the mountains did I feel
53. The joy of my desire;
54. And she I cherish'd turn'd her wheel
55. Beside an English fire.

56. Thy mornings show'd, thy nights conceal'd,
57. The bowers where Lucy play'd;
58. And thine too is the last green field
59. That Lucy's eyes survey'd.

60. IV.

61. HREE years she grew in sun and shower;
62. Then Nature said, 'A lovelier flower
63. On earth was never sown;
64. This child I to myself will take;
65. She shall be mine, and I will make
66. A lady of my own.

67. 'Myself will to my darling be
68. Both law and impulse; and with me
69. The girl, in rock and plain,
70. In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,
71. Shall feel an overseeing power
72. To kindle or restrain.

73. 'She shall be sportive as the fawn
74. That wild with glee across the lawn
75. Or up the mountain springs;
76. And hers shall be the breathing balm,
77. And hers the silence and the calm
78. Of mute insensate things.

79. 'The floating clouds their state shall lend
80. To her; for her the willow bend;
81. Nor shall she fail to see
82. Even in the motions of the storm
83. Grace that shall mould the maiden's form
84. By silent sympathy.

85. 'The stars of midnight shall be dear
86. To her; and she shall lean her ear
87. In many a secret place
88. Where rivulets dance their wayward round,
89. And beauty born of murmuring sound
90. Shall pass into her face.

91. 'And vital feelings of delight
92. Shall rear her form to stately height,
93. Her virgin bosom swell;
94. Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
95. While she and I together live
96. Here in this happy dell.'

97. Thus Nature spake -  The work was done -
98. How soon my Lucy's race was run!
99. She died, and left to me
100. This heath, this calm and quiet scene;
101. The memory of what has been,
102. And never more will be.

103. V.

104. SLUMBER did my spirit seal;
105. I had no human fears:
106. She seem'd a thing that could not feel
107. The touch of earthly years.

108. No motion has she now, no force;
109. She neither hears nor sees;
110. Roll'd round in earth's diurnal course,
111. With rocks, and stones, and trees.
