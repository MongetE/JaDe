1. At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears,
2. Hangs a Thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years:
3. Poor Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard
4. In the silence of morning the song of the Bird.

5. Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees
6. A mountain ascending, a vision of trees;
7. Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide,
8. And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside.

9. Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,
10. Down which she so often has tripped with her pail;
11. And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's,
12. The one only dwelling on earth that she loves.

13. She looks, and her heart is in heaven: but they fade,
14. The mist and the river, the hill and the shade:
15. The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise,
16. And the colours have all passed away from her eyes!
