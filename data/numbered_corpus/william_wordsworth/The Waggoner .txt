1. 'TIS spent--this burning day of June!
2. Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;
3. The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,--
4. That solitary bird
5. Is all that can be heard
6. In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!
7. Confiding Glow-worms, 'tis a night
8. Propitious to your earth-born light!
9. But, where the scattered stars are seen
10. In hazy straits the clouds between,
11. Each, in his station twinkling not,
12. Seems changed into a pallid spot.
13. The mountains against heaven's grave weight
14. Rise up, and grow to wondrous height.
15. The air, as in a lion's den,
16. Is close and hot;--and now and then
17. Comes a tired and sultry breeze
18. With a haunting and a panting,
19. Like the stifling of disease;
20. But the dews allay the heat,
21. And the silence makes it sweet.
22. Hush, there is some one on the stir!
23. 'Tis Benjamin the Waggoner;
24. Who long hath trod this toilsome way,
25. Companion of the night and day.
26. That far-off tinkling's drowsy cheer,
27. Mixed with a faint yet grating sound
28. In a moment lost and found,
29. The Wain announces--by whose side
30. Along the banks of Rydal Mere
31. He paces on, a trusty Guide,--
32. Listen! you can scarcely hear!
33. Hither he his course is bending;--
34. Now he leaves the lower ground,
35. And up the craggy hill ascending
36. Many a stop and stay he makes,
37. Many a breathing-fit he takes;--
38. Steep the way and wearisome,
39. Yet all the while his whip is dumb!
40. The Horses have worked with right good-will,
41. And so have gained the top of the hill;
42. He was patient, they were strong,
43. And now they smoothly glide along,
44. Recovering breath, and pleased to win
45. The praises of mild Benjamin.
46. Heaven shield him from mishap and snare!
47. But why so early with this prayer?--
48. Is it for threatenings in the sky?
49. Or for some other danger nigh?
50. No; none is near him yet, though he
51. Be one of much infirmity;
52. For at the bottom of the brow,
53. Where once the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
54. Offered a greeting of good ale
55. To all who entered Grasmere Vale;
56. And called on him who must depart
57. To leave it with a jovial heart;
58. There, where the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
59. Once hung, a Poet harbours now,
60. A simple water-drinking Bard;
61. Why need our Hero then (though frail
62. His best resolves) be on his guard?
63. He marches by, secure and bold;
64. Yet while he thinks on times of old,
65. It seems that all looks wondrous cold;
66. He shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head,
67. And, for the honest folk within,
68. It is a doubt with Benjamin
69. Whether they be alive or dead!
70. 'Here' is no danger,--none at all!
71. Beyond his wish he walks secure;
72. But pass a mile--and 'then' for trial,---
73. Then for the pride of self-denial;
74. If he resist that tempting door,
75. Which with such friendly voice will call;
76. If he resist those casement panes,
77. And that bright gleam which thence will fall
78. Upon his Leaders' bells and manes,
79. Inviting him with cheerful lure:
80. For still, though all be dark elsewhere,
81. Some shining notice will be 'there',
82. Of open house and ready fare.
83. The place to Benjamin right well
84. Is known, and by as strong a spell
85. As used to be that sign of love
86. And hope--the OLIVE-BOUGH and DOVE;
87. He knows it to his cost, good Man!
88. Who does not know the famous SWAN?
89. Object uncouth! and yet our boast,
90. For it was painted by the Host;
91. His own conceit the figure planned,
92. 'Twas coloured all by his own hand;
93. And that frail Child of thirsty clay,
94. Of whom I sing this rustic lay,
95. Could tell with self-dissatisfaction
96. Quaint stories of the bird's attraction!
97. Well! that is past--and in despite
98. Of open door and shining light.
99. And now the conqueror essays
100. The long ascent of Dunmail-raise;
101. And with his team is gentle here
102. As when he clomb from Rydal Mere;
103. His whip they do not dread--his voice
104. They only hear it to rejoice.
105. To stand or go is at 'their' pleasure;
106. Their efforts and their time they measure
107. By generous pride within the breast;
108. And, while they strain, and while they rest,
109. He thus pursues his thoughts at leisure.
110. Now am I fairly safe to-night--
111. And with proud cause my heart is light:
112. I trespassed lately worse than ever--
113. But Heaven has blest a good endeavour;
114. And, to my soul's content, I find
115. The evil One is left behind.
116. Yes, let my master fume and fret,
117. Here am I--with my horses yet!
118. My jolly team, he finds that ye
119. Will work for nobody but me!
120. Full proof of this the Country gained;
121. It knows how ye were vexed and strained,
122. And forced unworthy stripes to bear,
123. When trusted to another's care.
124. Here was it--on this rugged slope,
125. Which now ye climb with heart and hope,
126. I saw you, between rage and fear,
127. Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear,
128. And ever more and more confused,
129. As ye were more and more abused:
130. As chance would have it, passing by
131. I saw you in that jeopardy:
132. A word from me was like a charm;
133. Ye pulled together with one mind;
134. And your huge burthen, safe from harm,
135. Moved like a vessel in the wind!
136. --Yes, without me, up hills so high
137. 'Tis vain to strive for mastery.
138. Then grieve not, jolly team! though tough
139. The road we travel, steep, and rough;
140. Though Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise,
141. And all their fellow banks and braes,
142. Full often make you stretch and strain,
143. And halt for breath and halt again,
144. Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing
145. That side by side we still are going!
146. While Benjamin in earnest mood
147. His meditations thus pursued,
148. A storm, which had been smothered long,
149. Was growing inwardly more strong;
150. And, in its struggles to get free,
151. Was busily employed as he.
152. The thunder had begun to growl--
153. He heard not, too intent of soul;
154. The air was now without a breath--
155. He marked not that 'twas still as death.
156. But soon large rain-drops on his head
157. Fell with the weight of drops of lead;--
158. He starts--and takes, at the admonition,
159. A sage survey of his condition.
160. The road is black before his eyes,
161. Glimmering faintly where it lies;
162. Black is the sky--and every hill,
163. Up to the sky, is blacker still--
164. Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,
165. Hung round and overhung with gloom;
166. Save that above a single height
167. Is to be seen a lurid light,
168. Above Helm-crag--a streak half dead,
169. A burning of portentous red;
170. And near that lurid light, full well
171. The ASTROLOGER, sage Sidrophel,
172. Where at his desk and book he sits,
173. Puzzling aloft his curious wits;
174. He whose domain is held in common
175. With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN,
176. Cowering beside her rifted cell,
177. As if intent on magic spell;--
178. Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,
179. Still sit upon Helm-crag together!
180. The ASTROLOGER was not unseen
181. By solitary Benjamin;
182. But total darkness came anon,
183. And he and everything was gone:
184. And suddenly a ruffling breeze,
185. (That would have rocked the sounding trees
186. Had aught of sylvan growth been there)
187. Swept through the Hollow long and bare:
188. The rain rushed down--the road was battered,
189. As with the force of billows shattered;
190. The horses are dismayed, nor know
191. Whether they should stand or go;
192. And Benjamin is groping near them
193. Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them.
194. He is astounded,--wonder not,--
195. With such a charge in such a spot;
196. Astounded in the mountain gap
197. With thunder-peals, clap after clap,
198. Close-treading on the silent flashes--
199. And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes
200. Among the rocks; with weight of rain,
201. And sullen motions long and slow,
202. That to a dreary distance go--
203. Till, breaking in upon the dying strain,
204. A rending o'er his head begins the fray again.
205. Meanwhile, uncertain what to do,
206. And oftentimes compelled to halt,
207. The horses cautiously pursue
208. Their way, without mishap or fault;
209. And now have reached that pile of stones,
210. Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;
211. His who had once supreme command,
212. Last king of rocky Cumberland;
213. His bones, and those of all his Power
214. Slain here in a disastrous hour!
215. When, passing through this narrow strait,
216. Stony, and dark, and desolate,
217. Benjamin can faintly hear
218. A voice that comes from some one near,
219. A female voice--Whoe'er you be,
220. Stop,' it exclaimed, 'and pity me!'
221. And, less in pity than in wonder,
222. Amid the darkness and the thunder,
223. The Waggoner, with prompt command,
224. Summons his horses to a stand.
225. While, with increasing agitation,
226. The Woman urged her supplication,
227. In rueful words, with sobs between--
228. The voice of tears that fell unseen;
229. There came a flash--a startling glare,
230. And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare!
231. 'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,
232. And Benjamin, without a question,
233. Taking her for some way-worn rover,
234. Said, 'Mount, and get you under cover!'
235. Another voice, in tone as hoarse
236. As a swoln brook with rugged course,
237. Cried out, 'Good brother, why so fast?
238. I've had a glimpse of you--'avast!'
239. Or, since it suits you to be civil,
240. Take her at once--for good and evil!'
241. 'It is my Husband,' softly said
242. The Woman, as if half afraid:
243. By this time she was snug within,
244. Through help of honest Benjamin;
245. She and her Babe, which to her breast
246. With thankfulness the Mother pressed;
247. And now the same strong voice more near
248. Said cordially, 'My Friend, what cheer?
249. Rough doings these! as God's my judge,
250. The sky owes somebody a grudge!
251. We've had in half an hour or less
252. A twelvemonth's terror and distress!'
253. Then Benjamin entreats the Man
254. Would mount, too, quickly as he can:
255. The Sailor--Sailor now no more,
256. But such he had been heretofore--
257. To courteous Benjamin replied,
258. 'Go you your way, and mind not me;
259. For I must have, whate'er betide,
260. My Ass and fifty things beside,--
261. Go, and I'll follow speedily!'
262. The Waggon moves--and with its load
263. Descends along the sloping road;
264. And the rough Sailor instantly
265. Turns to a little tent hard by:
266. For when, at closing-in of day,
267. The family had come that way,
268. Green pasture and the soft warm air
269. Tempted them to settle there.--
270. Green is the grass for beast to graze,
271. Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!
272. The Sailor gathers up his bed,
273. Takes down the canvas overhead;
274. And, after farewell to the place,
275. A parting word--though not of grace,
276. Pursues, with Ass and all his store,
277. The way the Waggon went before.
