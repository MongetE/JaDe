1. HIGH deeds, O Germans, are to come from you!
2. Thus in your books the record shall be found,
3. 'A watchword was pronounced, a potent sound--
4. ARMINIUS!--all the people quaked like dew
5. Stirred by the breeze; they rose, a Nation, true,
6. True to herself--the mighty Germany,
7. She of the Danube and the Northern Sea,
8. She rose, and off at once the yoke she threw.
9. All power was given her in the dreadful trance;
10. Those new-born Kings she withered like a flame.'
11. --Woe to them all! but heaviest woe and shame
12. To that Bavarian who could first advance
13. His banner in accursed league with France,
14. First open traitor to the German name!
