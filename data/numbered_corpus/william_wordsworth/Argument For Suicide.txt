1. Send this man to the mine, this to the battle,
2. Famish an aged beggar at your gates,
3. And let him die by inches- but for worlds
4. Lift not your hand against him- Live, live on,
5. As if this earth owned neither steel nor arsenic,
6. A rope, a river, or a standing pool.
7. Live, if you dread the pains of hell, or think
8. Your corpse would quarrel with a stake- alas
9. Has misery then no friend?- if you would die
10. By license, call the dropsy and the stone
11. And let them end you- strange it is;
12. And most fantastic are the magic circles
13. Drawn round the thing called life- till we have learned
14. To prize it less, we ne'er shall learn to prize
15. The things worth living for.-
