1. The little hedgerow birds,
2. That peck along the road, regard him not.
3. He travels on, and in his face, his step,
4. His gait, is one expression; every limb,
5. His look and bending figure, all bespeak
6. A man who does not move with pain, but moves
7. With thought. -He is insensibly subdued
8. To settled quiet: he is one by whom
9. All effort seems forgotten; one to whom
10. Long patience hath such mild composure given
11. That patience now doth seem a thing of which
12. He hath no need. He is by nature led
13. To peace so perfect, that the young behold
14. With envy what the Old Man hardly feels.
