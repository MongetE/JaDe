1. I

2. ENOUGH of rose-bud lips, and eyes
3. Like harebells bathed in dew,
4. Of cheek that with carnation vies,
5. And veins of violet hue;
6. Earth wants not beauty that may scorn
7. A likening to frail flowers;
8. Yea, to the stars, if they were born
9. For seasons and for hours.

10. Through Moscow's gates, with gold unbarred,
11. Stepped One at dead of night,
12. Whom such high beauty could not guard
13. From meditated blight;
14. By stealth she passed, and fled as fast
15. As doth the hunted fawn,
16. Nor stopped, till in the dappling east
17. Appeared unwelcome dawn.

18. Seven days she lurked in brake and field,
19. Seven nights her course renewed,
20. Sustained by what her scrip might yield,
21. Or berries of the wood;
22. At length, in darkness travelling on,
23. When lowly doors were shut,
24. The haven of her hope she won,
25. Her foster-mother's hut.

26. 'To put your love to dangerous proof
27. I come,' said she, 'from far;
28. For I have left my Father's roof,
29. In terror of the czar.'
30. No answer did the Matron give,
31. No second look she cast,
32. But hung upon the fugitive,
33. Embracing and embraced.

34. She led the Lady to a seat
35. Beside the glimmering fire,
36. Bathed duteously her wayworn feet,
37. Prevented each desire:---
38. The cricket chirped, the house-dog dozed,
39. And on that simple bed,
40. Where she in childhood had reposed,
41. Now rests her weary head.

42. When she, whose couch had been the sod,
43. Whose curtain, pine or thorn,
44. Had breathed a sigh of thanks to God,
45. Who comforts the forlorn;
46. While over her the Matron bent
47. Sleep sealed her eyes, and stole
48. Feeling from limbs with travel spent,
49. And trouble from the soul.

50. Refreshed, the Wanderer rose at morn,
51. And soon again was dight
52. In those unworthy vestments worn
53. Through long and perilous flight;
54. And 'O beloved Nurse,' she said,
55. 'My thanks with silent tears
56. Have unto Heaven and You been paid:
57. Now listen to my fears !

58. 'Have you forgot'---and here she smiled---
59. 'The babbling flatteries
60. You lavished on me when a child
61. Disporting round your knees?
62. I was your lambkin, and your bird,
63. Your star, your gem, your flower;
64. Light words, that were more lightly heard
65. In many a cloudless hour!

66. 'The blossom you so fondly praised
67. Is come to bitter fruit;
68. A mighty One upon me gazed;
69. I spurned his lawless suit,
70. And must be hidden from his wrath:
71. You, Foster-father dear,
72. Will guide me in my forward path;
73. I may not tarry here!

74. 'I cannot bring to utter woe
75. Your proved fidelity.'---
76. 'Dear Child, sweet Mistress, say not so!
77. For you we both would die.'
78. 'Nay, nay, I come with semblance feigned
79. And cheek embrowned by art;
80. Yet, being inwardly unstained,
81. With courage will depart.'

82. 'But whither would you, could you, flee?
83. A poor Man's counsel take;
84. The Holy Virgin gives to me
85. A thought for your dear sake;
86. Rest, shielded by our Lady's grace,
87. And soon shall you be led
88. Forth to a safe abiding-place,
89. Where never foot doth tread.'

90. II
91. THE dwelling of this faithful pair
92. In a straggling village stood,
93. For One who breathed unquiet air
94. A dangerous neighbourhood;
95. But wide around lay forest ground
96. With thickets rough and blind;
97. And pine-trees made a heavy shade
98. Impervious to the wind.

99. And there, sequestered from the eight,
100. Was spread a treacherous swamp,
101. On which the noonday sun shed light
102. As from a lonely lamp;
103. And midway in the unsafe morass,
104. A single Island rose
105. Of firm dry ground, with healthful grass
106. Adorned, and shady boughs.

107. The Woodman knew, for such the craft
108. This Russian vassal plied,
109. That never fowler's gun, nor shaft
110. Of archer, there was tried;
111. A sanctuary seemed the spot
112. From all intrusion free;
113. And there he planned an artful Cot
114. For perfect secrecy.

115. With earnest pains unchecked by dread
116. Of Power's far-stretching hand,
117. The bold good Man his labor sped
118. At nature's pure command;
119. Heart-soothed, and busy as a wren,
120. While, in a hollow nook,
121. She moulds her sight-eluding den
122. Above a murmuring brook.

123. His task accomplished to his mind,
124. The twain ere break of day
125. Creep forth, and through the forest wind
126. Their solitary way;
127. Few words they speak, nor dare to slack
128. Their pace from mile to mile,
129. Till they have crossed the quaking marsh,
130. And reached the lonely Isle.

131. The sun above the pine-trees showed
132. A bright and cheerful face;
133. And Ina looked for her abode,
134. The promised hiding-place;
135. She sought in vain, the Woodman smiled;
136. No threshold could be seen,
137. Nor roof, nor window; all seemed wild
138. As it had ever been.

139. Advancing, you might guess an hour,
140. The front with such nice care
141. Is masked, 'if house it be or bower,'
142. But in they entered are;
143. As shaggy as were wall and roof
144. With branches intertwined,
145. So smooth was all within, air-proof,
146. And delicately lined:

147. And hearth was there, and maple dish,
148. And cups in seemly rows,
149. And couch---all ready to a wish
150. For nurture or repose;
151. And Heaven doth to her virtue grant
152. That here she may abide
153. In solitude, with every want
154. By cautious love supplied.

155. No queen, before a shouting crowd,
156. Led on in bridal state,
157. E'er struggled with a heart so proud,
158. Entering her palace gate:
159. Rejoiced to bid the world farewell,
160. No saintly anchoress
161. E'er took possession of her cell
162. With deeper thankfulness.

163. 'Father of all, upon thy care
164. And mercy am I thrown;
165. Be thou my safeguard!'---such her prayer
166. When she was left alone,
167. Kneeling amid the wilderness
168. When joy had passed away,
169. And smiles, fond efforts of distress
170. To hide what they betray!

171. The prayer is heard, the Saints have seen,
172. Diffused through form and face,
173. Resolves devotedly serene;
174. That monumental grace
175. Of Faith, which doth all passions tame
176. That Reason should control;
177. And shows in the untrembling frame
178. A statue of the soul.

179. III
180. 'TIS sung in ancient minstrelsy
181. That Phoebus wont to wear
182. The leaves of any pleasant tree
183. Around his golden hair;
184. Till Daphne, desperate with pursuit
185. Of his imperious love,
186. At her own prayer transformed, took root,
187. A laurel in the grove.

188. Then did the Penitent adorn
189. His brow with laurel green;
190. And 'mid his bright locks never shorn
191. No meaner leaf was seen;
192. And poets sage, through every age,
193. About their temples wound
194. The bay; and conquerors thanked the Gods,
195. With laurel chaplets crowned,

196. Into the mists of fabling Time
197. So far runs back the praise
198. Of Beauty, that disdains to climb
199. Along forbidden ways;
200. That scorns temptation; power defies
201. Where mutual love is not;
202. And to the tomb for rescue flies
203. When life would be a blot.

204. To this fair Votaress, a fate
205. More mild doth Heaven ordain
206. Upon her Island desolate;
207. And word, not breathed in vain,
208. Might tell what intercourse she found,
209. Her silence to endear;
210. What birds she tamed, what flowers the ground
211. Sent forth her peace to cheer.

212. To one mute Presence, above all,
213. Her soothed affections clung,
214. A picture on the cabin wall
215. By Russian usage hung---
216. The Mother-maid, whose countenance bright
217. With love abridged the day;
218. And, communed with by taper light,
219. Chased spectral fears away.

220. And oft as either Guardian came,
221. The joy in that retreat
222. Might any common friendship shame,
223. So high their heart would beat;
224. And to the lone Recluse, whate'er
225. They brought, each visiting
226. Was like the crowding of the year
227. With a new burst of spring.

228. But, when she of her Parents thought,
229. The pang was hard to bear;
230. And, if with all things not enwrought,
231. That trouble still is near.
232. Before her flight she had not dared
233. Their constancy to prove,
234. Too much the heroic Daughter feared
235. The weakness of their love.

236. Dark is the past to them, and dark
237. The future still must be,
238. Till pitying Saints conduct her bark
239. Into a safer sea---
240. Or gentle Nature close her eyes,
241. And set her Spirit free
242. From the altar of this sacrifice,
243. In vestal purity.

244. Yet, when above the forest-glooms
245. The white swans southward passed,
246. High as the pitch of their swift plume
247. Her fancy rode the blast;
248. And bore her toward the fields of France
249. Her Father's native land,
250. To mingle in the rustic dance,
251. The happiest of the band!

252. Of those beloved fields she oft
253. Had heard her Father tell
254. In phrase that now with echoes soft
255. Haunted her lonely cell;
256. She saw the hereditary bowers,
257. She heard the ancestral stream;
258. The Kremlin and its haughty towers
259. Forgotten like a dream !

260. IV
261. THE ever-changing Moon had traced
262. Twelve times her monthly round,
263. When through the unfrequented Waste
264. Was heard a startling sound;
265. A shout thrice sent from one who chased
266. At speed a wounded deer,
267. Bounding through branches interlaced,
268. And where the wood was clear.

269. The fainting creature took the marsh,
270. And toward the Island fled,
271. While plovers screamed with tumult harsh
272. Above his antlered head;
273. This, Ina saw; and, pale with fear,
274. Shrunk to her citadel;
275. The desperate deer rushed on, and near
276. The tangled covert fell.

277. Across the marsh, the game in view,
278. The Hunter followed fast,
279. Nor paused, till o'er the stag he blew
280. A death-proclaiming blast;
281. Then, resting on her upright mind,
282. Came forth the Maid---'In me
283. Behold,' she said, ' a stricken Hind
284. Pursued by destiny!

285. 'From your deportment, Sir! I deem
286. That you have worn a sword,
287. And will not hold in light esteem
288. A suffering woman's word;
289. There is my covert, there perchance
290. I might have lain concealed,
291. My fortunes hid, my countenance
292. Not even to you revealed.

293. 'Tears might be shed, and I might pray,
294. Crouching and terrified,
295. That what has been unveiled to day,
296. You would in mystery hide;
297. But I will not defile with dust
298. The knee that bend to adore
299. The God in heaven;---attend, be just;
300. This ask I, and no more!

301. 'I speak not of the winter's cold,
302. For summer's heat exchanged,
303. While I have lodged in this rough hold,
304. From social life estranged;
305. Nor yet of trouble and alarms:
306. High Heaven is my defence;
307. And every season has soft arms
308. For injured Innocence.

309. 'From Moscow to the Wilderness
310. It was my choice to come,
311. Lest virtue should be harborless,
312. And honor want a home;
313. And happy were I, if the Czar
314. Retain his lawless will,
315. To end life here like this poor deer,
316. Or a lamb on a green hill.'

317. 'Are you the Maid,' the Stranger cried,
318. 'From Gallic parents sprung,
319. Whose vanishing was rumored wide,
320. Sad theme for every tongue;
321. Who foiled an Emperor's eager quest?
322. You, Lady, forced to wear
323. These rude habiliments, and rest
324. Your head in this dark lair!'

325. But wonder, pity, soon were quelled;
326. And in her face and mien
327. The soul's pure brightness she beheld
328. Without a veil between:
329. He loved, he hoped,---a holy flame
330. Kindled 'mid rapturous tears;
331. The passion of a moment came
332. As on the wings of years.

333. 'Such bounty is no gift of chance,'
334. Exclaimed he; 'righteous Heaven,
335. Preparing your deliverance,
336. To me the charge hath given.
337. The Czar full oft in words, and deeds
338. Is stormy and self-willed;
339. But, when the Lady Catherine pleads,
340. His violence is stilled.

341. 'Leave open to my wish the course,
342. And I to her will go;
343. From that humane and heavenly source,
344. Good, only good, can flow.''
345. Faint sanction given, the Cavalier
346. Was eager to depart,
347. Though question followed question, dear
348. To the Maiden's filial heart.

349. Light was his step,---his hopes, more light,
350. Kept pace with his desires;
351. And the fifth morning gave him sight
352. Of Moscow's glittering spires.
353. He sued:---heart-smitten by the wrong,
354. To the lorn Fugitive
355. The Emperor sent a pledge as strong
356. As sovereign power could give.

357. O more than mighty change! If e'er
358. Amazement rose to pain,
359. And joy's excess produced a fear
360. Of something void and vain;
361. 'Twas when the Parents, who had mourned
362. So long the lost as dead,
363. Beheld their only Child returned,
364. The household floor to tread.

365. Soon gratitude gave way to love
366. Within the Maiden's breast:
367. Delivered and Deliverer move
368. In bridal garments drest;
369. Meek Catherine had her own reward;
370. The Czar bestowed a dower;
371. And universal Moscow shared
372. The triumph of that hour.


373. Flowers strewed the ground; the nuptial feast
374. Was held with costly state;
375. And there, 'mid many a noble guest,
376. The foster-parent sate;
377. Encouraged by the imperial eye,
378. They shrank not into shade;
379. Great as their bliss, the honor high
380. To them and nature paid!
