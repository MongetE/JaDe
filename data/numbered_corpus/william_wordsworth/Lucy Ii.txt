1. SHE dwelt among the untrodden ways
2. Beside the springs of Dove,
3. A Maid whom there were none to praise
4. And very few to love:

5. A violet by a mossy stone
6. Half hidden from the eye!
7. Fair as a star, when only one
8. Is shining in the sky.

9. She lived unknown, and few could know
10. When Lucy ceased to be;
11. But she is in her grave, and oh,
12. The difference to me!
