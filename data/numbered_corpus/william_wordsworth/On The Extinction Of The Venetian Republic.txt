1. ONCE did she hold the gorgeous East in fee;
2. And was the safeguard of the West: the worth
3. Of Venice did not fall below her birth,
4. Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.
5. She was a maiden City, bright and free;
6. No guile seduced, no force could violate;
7. And, when she took unto herself a mate,
8. She must espouse the everlasting Sea.
9. And what if she had seen those glories fade,
10. Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;
11. Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
12. When her long life hath reach'd its final day:
13. Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade
14. Of that which once was great is pass'd away.
