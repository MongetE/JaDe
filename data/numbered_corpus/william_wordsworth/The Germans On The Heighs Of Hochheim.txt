1. ABRUPTLY paused the strife;--the field throughout
2. Resting upon his arms each warrior stood,
3. Checked in the very act and deed of blood,
4. With breath suspended, like a listening scout.
5. O Silence! thou wert mother of a shout
6. That through the texture of yon azure dome
7. Cleaves its glad way, a cry of harvest home
8. Uttered to Heaven in ecstasy devout!
9. The barrier Rhine hath flashed, through battle-smoke,
10. On men who gaze heart-smitten by the view,
11. As if all Germany had felt the shock!
12. --Fly, wretched Gauls! ere they the charge renew
13. Who have seen--themselves now casting off the yoke--
14. The unconquerable Stream his course pursue.
