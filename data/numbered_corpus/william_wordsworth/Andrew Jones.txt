1. I hate that Andrew Jones; he'll breed
2. His children up to waste and pillage.
3. I wish the press-gang or the drum
4. With its tantara sound would come,
5. And sweep him from the village!

6. I said not this, because he loves
7. Through the long day to swear and tipple;
8. But for the poor dear sake of one
9. To whom a foul deed he had done,
10. A friendless man, a travelling cripple!

11. For this poor crawling helpless wretch,
12. Some horseman who was passing by,
13. A penny on the ground had thrown;
14. But the poor cripple was alone
15. And could not stoop--no help was nigh.

16. Inch-thick the dust lay on the ground
17. For it had long been droughty weather;
18. So with his staff the cripple wrought
19. Among the dust till he had brought
20. The half-pennies together.

21. It chanced that Andrew passed that way
22. Just at the time; and there he found
23. The cripple in the mid-day heat
24. Standing alone, and at his feet
25. He saw the penny on the ground.

26. He stopped and took the penny up:
27. And when the cripple nearer drew,
28. Quoth Andrew, "Under half-a-crown,
29. What a man finds is all his own,
30. And so, my Friend, good-day to you."

31. And 'hence' I said, that Andrew's boys
32. Will all be trained to waste and pillage;
33. And wished the press-gang, or the drum
34. With its tantara sound, would come
35. And sweep him from the village.
