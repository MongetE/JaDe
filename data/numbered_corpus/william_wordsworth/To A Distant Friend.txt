1. Why art thou silent! Is thy love a plant
2. Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
3. Of absence withers what was once so fair?
4. Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?

5. Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant,
6. Bound to thy service with unceasing care--
7. The mind's least generous wish a mendicant
8. For nought but what thy happiness could spare.

9. Speak!--though this soft warm heart, once free to hold
10. A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,
11. Be left more desolate, more dreary cold
12. Than a forsaken bird's-nest fill'd with snow
13. 'Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine--
14. Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know!
