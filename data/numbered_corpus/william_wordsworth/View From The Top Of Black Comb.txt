1. THIS Height a ministering Angel might select:
2. For from the summit of BLACK COMB (dread name
3. Derived from clouds and storms!) the amplest range
4. Of unobstructed prospect may be seen
5. That British ground commands:--low dusky tracts,
6. Where Trent is nursed, far southward! Cambrian hills
7. To the south-west, a multitudinous show;
8. And, in a line of eye-sight linked with these,
9. The hoary peaks of Scotland that give birth
10. To Tiviot's stream, to Annan, Tweed, and Clyde:--
11. Crowding the quarter whence the sun comes forth
12. Gigantic mountains rough with crags; beneath,
13. Right at the imperial station's western base
14. Main ocean, breaking audibly, and stretched
15. Far into silent regions blue and pale;--
16. And visibly engirding Mona's Isle
17. That, as we left the plain, before our sight
18. Stood like a lofty mount, uplifting slowly
19. (Above the convex of the watery globe)
20. Into clear view the cultured fields that streak
21. Her habitable shores, but now appears
22. A dwindled object, and submits to lie
23. At the spectator's feet.--Yon azure ridge,
24. Is it a perishable cloud? Or there
25. Do we behold the line of Erin's coast?
26. Land sometimes by the roving shepherdswain
27. (Like the bright confines of another world)
28. Not doubtfully perceived.--Look homeward now!
29. In depth, in height, in circuit, how serene
30. The spectacle, how pure!--Of Nature's works,
31. In earth, and air, and earth-embracing sea,
32. A revelation infinite it seems;
33. Display august of man's inheritance,
34. Of Britain's calm felicity and power!
