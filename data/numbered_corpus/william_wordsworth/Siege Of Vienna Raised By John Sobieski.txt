1. FEBRUARY 1

2. Oh, for a kindling touch from that pure flame
3. Which ministered, erewhile, to a sacrifice
4. Of gratitude, beneath Italian skies,
5. In words like these: 'Up, Voice of song! proclaim
6. 'Thy saintly rapture with celestial aim:
7. 'For lo! the Imperial City stands released
8. 'From bondage threatened by the embattled East,
9. 'And Christendom respires; from guilt and shame
10. 'Redeemed, from miserable fear set free
11. 'By one day's feat, one mighty victory.
12. '--Chant the Deliverer's praise in every tongue!
13. 'The cross shall spread, the crescent hath waxed dim;
14. 'He conquering, as in joyful Heaven is sung,
15. 'HE CONQUERING THROUGH GOD, AND GOD BY HIM.'
