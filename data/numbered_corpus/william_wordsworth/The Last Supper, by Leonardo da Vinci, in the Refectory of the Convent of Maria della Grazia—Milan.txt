1. Tho' searching damps and many an envious flaw
2. Have marred this Work, the calm ethereal grace,
3. The love deep-seated in the Saviour's face,
4. The mercy, goodness, have not failed to awe
5. The Elements; as they do melt and thaw
6. The heart of the Beholder- and erase
7. (At least for one rapt moment) every trace
8. Of disobedience to the primal law.
9. The annunciation of the dreadful truth
10. Made to the Twelve, survives: lips, forehead, cheek,
11. And hand reposing on the board in ruth
12. Of what it utters, while the unguilty seek
13. Unquestionable meanings, still bespeak
14. A labour worthy of eternal youth!
