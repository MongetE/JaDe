1. Rude is this Edifice, and Thou hast seen
2. Buildings, albeit rude, that have maintained
3. Proportions more harmonious, and approached
4. To closer fellowship with ideal grace.
5. But take it in good part:--alas! the poor
6. Vitruvius of our village had no help
7. From the great City; never, upon leaves
8. Of red Morocco folio, saw displayed,
9. In long succession, pre-existing ghosts
10. Of Beauties yet unborn--the rustic Lodge
11. Antique, and Cottage with verandah graced,
12. Nor lacking, for fit company, alcove,
13. Green-house, shell-grot, and moss-lined hermitage.
14. Thou see'st a homely Pile, yet to these walls
15. The heifer comes in the snow-storm, and here
16. The new-dropped lamb finds shelter from the wind.
17. And hither does one Poet sometimes row
18. His pinnace, a small vagrant barge, up-piled
19. With plenteous store of heath and withered fern,
20. (A lading which he with his sickle cuts,
21. Among the mountains) and beneath this roof
22. He makes his summer couch, and here at noon
23. Spreads out his limbs, while, yet unshorn, the Sheep,
24. Panting beneath the burthen of their wool,
25. Lie round him, even as if they were a part
26. Of his own Household: nor, while from his bed
27. He looks, through the open door-place, toward the lake
28. And to the stirring breezes, does he want
29. Creations lovely as the work of sleep--
30. Fair sights, and visions of romantic joy!
