1. I

2. WEEP not, beloved Friends! nor let the air
3. For me with sighs be troubled. Not from life
4. Have I been taken; this is genuine life
5. And this alone--the life which now I live
6. In peace eternal; where desire and joy
7. Together move in fellowship without end.--
8. Francesco Ceni willed that, after death,
9. His tombstone thus should speak for him. And surely
10. Small cause there is for that fond wish of ours
11. Long to continue in this world; a world
12. That keeps not faith, nor yet can point a hope
13. To good, whereof itself is destitute.

14. II

15. PERHAPS some needful service of the State
16. Drew TITUS from the depth of studious bowers,
17. And doomed him to contend in faithless courts,
18. Where gold determines between right and wrong.
19. Yet did at length his loyalty of heart,
20. And his pure native genius, lead him back
21. To wait upon the bright and gracious Muses,
22. Whom he had early loved. And not in vain
23. Such course he held! Bologna's learned schools
24. Were gladdened by the Sage's voice, and hung
25. With fondness on those sweet Nestorian strains.
26. There pleasure crowned his days; and all his thoughts
27. A roseate fragrance breathed.--O human life,
28. That never art secure from dolorous change!
29. Behold a high injunction suddenly
30. To Arno's side hath brought him, and he charmed
31. A Tuscan audience: but full soon was called
32. To the perpetual silence of the grave.
33. Mourn, Italy, the loss of him who stood
34. A Champion stedfast and invincible,
35. To quell the rage of literary War!

36. III

37. O THOU who movest onward with a mind
38. Intent upon thy way, pause, though in haste!
39. 'Twill be no fruitless moment. I was born
40. Within Savona's walls, of gentle blood.
41. On Tiber's banks my youth was dedicate
42. To sacred studies; and the Roman Shepherd
43. Gave to my charge Urbino's numerous flock.
44. Well did I watch, much laboured, nor had power
45. To escape from many and strange indignities;
46. Was smitten by the great ones of the world,
47. But did not fall; for Virtue braves all shocks,
48. Upon herself resting immoveably.
49. Me did a kindlier fortune then invite
50. To serve the glorious Henry, King of France,
51. And in his hands I saw a high reward
52. Stretched out for my acceptance,--but Death came.
53. Now, Reader, learn from this my fate, how false,
54. How treacherous to her promise, is the world;
55. And trust in God--to whose eternal doom
56. Must bend the sceptred Potentates of earth.

57. IV

58. THERE never breathed a man who, when his life
59. Was closing, might not of that life relate
60. Toils long and hard.--The warrior will report
61. Of wounds, and bright swords flashing in the field,
62. And blast of trumpets. He who hath been doomed
63. To bow his forehead in the courts of kings,
64. Will tell of fraud and never-ceasing hate,
65. Envy and heart-inquietude, derived
66. From intricate cabals of treacherous friends.
67. I, who on shipboard lived from earliest youth,
68. Could represent the countenance horrible
69. Of the vexed waters, and the indignant rage
70. Of Auster and Bootes. Fifty years
71. Over the well-steered galleys did I rule:--
72. From huge Pelorus to the Atlantic pillars,
73. Rises no mountain to mine eyes unknown;
74. And the broad gulfs I traversed oft and oft:
75. Of every cloud which in the heavens might stir
76. I knew the force; and hence the rough sea's pride
77. Availed not to my Vessel's overthrow.
78. What noble pomp and frequent have not I
79. On regal decks beheld! yet in the end
80. I learned that one poor moment can suffice
81. To equalise the lofty and the low.
82. We sail the sea of life--a 'Calm' One finds,
83. And One a 'Tempest'--and, the voyage o'er,
84. Death is the quiet haven of us all.
85. If more of my condition ye would know,
86. Savona was my birth-place, and I sprang
87. Of noble parents; seventy years and three
88. Lived I--then yielded to a slow disease.

89. V

90. TRUE is it that Ambrosio Salinero
91. With an untoward fate was long involved
92. In odious litigation; and full long,
93. Fate harder still! had he to endure assaults
94. Of racking malady. And true it is
95. That not the less a frank courageous heart
96. And buoyant spirit triumphed over pain;
97. And he was strong to follow in the steps
98. Of the fair Muses. Not a covert path
99. Leads to the dear Parnassian forest's shade,
100. That might from him be hidden; not a track
101. Mounts to pellucid Hippocrene, but he
102. Had traced its windings.--This Savona knows,
103. Yet no sepulchral honours to her Son
104. She paid, for in our age the heart is ruled
105. Only by gold. And now a simple stone
106. Inscribed with this memorial here is raised
107. By his bereft, his lonely, Chiabrera.
108. Think not, O Passenger! who read'st the lines,
109. That an exceeding love hath dazzled me;
110. No--he was One whose memory ought to spread
111. Where'er Permessus bears an honoured name,
112. And live as long as its pure stream shall flow.

113. VI

114. DESTINED to war from very infancy
115. Was I, Roberto Dati, and I took
116. In Malta the white symbol of the Cross:
117. Nor in life's vigorous season did I shun
118. Hazard or toil; among the sands was seen
119. Of Libya; and not seldom, on the banks
120. Of wide Hungarian Danube, 'twas my lot
121. To hear the sanguinary trumpet sounded.
122. So lived I, and repined not at such fate:
123. This only grieves me, for it seems a wrong,
124. That stripped of arms I to my end am brought
125. On the soft down of my paternal home.
126. Yet haply Arno shall be spared all cause
127. To blush for me. Thou, loiter not nor halt
128. In thy appointed way, and bear in mind
129. How fleeting and how frail is human life!

130. VII

131. O FLOWER of all that springs from gentle blood,
132. And all that generous nurture breeds to make
133. Youth amiable; O friend so true of soul
134. To fair Aglaia; by what envy moved,
135. Lelius! has death cut short thy brilliant day
136. In its sweet opening? and what dire mishap
137. Has from Savona torn her best delight?
138. For thee she mourns, nor e'er will cease to mourn;
139. And, should the out-pourings of her eyes suffice not
140. For her heart's grief, she will entreat Sebeto
141. Not to withhold his bounteous aid, Sebeto
142. Who saw thee, on his margin, yield to death,
143. In the chaste arms of thy beloved Love!
144. What profit riches? what does youth avail?
145. Dust are our hopes;--I, weeping bitterly,
146. Penned these sad lines, nor can forbear to pray
147. That every gentle Spirit hither led
148. May read them, not without some bitter tears.

149. VIII

150. NOT without heavy grief of heart did He
151. On whom the duty fell (for at that time
152. The father sojourned in a distant land)
153. Deposit in the hollow of this tomb
154. A brother's Child, most tenderly beloved!
155. FRANCESCO was the name the Youth had borne,
156. POZZOBONNELLI his illustrious house;
157. And, when beneath this stone the Corse was laid,
158. The eyes of all Savona streamed with tears.
159. Alas! the twentieth April of his life
160. Had scarcely flowered: and at this early time,
161. By genuine virtue he inspired a hope
162. That greatly cheered his country: to his kin
163. He promised comfort; and the flattering thoughts
164. His friends had in their fondness entertained,
165. He suffered not to languish or decay.
166. Now is there not good reason to break forth
167. Into a passionate lament?--O Soul!
168. Short while a Pilgrim in our nether world,
169. Do thou enjoy the calm empyreal air;
170. And round this earthly tomb let roses rise,
171. An everlasting spring! in memory
172. Of that delightful fragrance which was once
173. From thy mild manners quietly exhaled.

174. IX

175. PAUSE, courteous Spirit!--Balbi supplicates
176. That Thou, with no reluctant voice, for him
177. Here laid in mortal darkness, wouldst prefer
178. A prayer to the Redeemer of the world.
179. This to the dead by sacred right belongs;
180. All else is nothing.--Did occasion suit
181. To tell his worth, the marble of this tomb
182. Would ill suffice: for Plato's lore sublime,
183. And all the wisdom of the Stagyrite,
184. Enriched and beautified his studious mind:
185. With Archimedes also he conversed
186. As with a chosen friend, nor did he leave
187. Those laureat wreaths ungathered which the Nymphs
188. Twine near their loved Permessus.--Finally,
189. Himself above each lower thought uplifting,
190. His ears he closed to listen to the songs
191. Which Sion's Kings did consecrate of old;
192. And his Permessus found on Lebanon.
193. A blessed Man! who of protracted days
194. Made not, as thousands do, a vulgar sleep;
195. But truly did 'He' live his life. Urbino,
196. Take pride in him!--O Passenger, farewell!
