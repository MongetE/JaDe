1. IN this still place, remote from men,
2. Sleeps Ossian, in the NARROW GLEN;
3. In this still place, where murmurs on
4. But one meek streamlet, only one:
5. He sang of battles, and the breath
6. Of stormy war, and violent death;
7. And should, methinks, when all was past,
8. Have rightfully been laid at last
9. Where rocks were rudely heaped, and rent
10. As by a spirit turbulent;
11. Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild,
12. And everything unreconciled;
13. In some complaining, dim retreat,
14. For fear and melancholy meet;
15. But this is calm; there cannot be
16. A more entire tranquillity.
17. Does then the Bard sleep here indeed?
18. Or is it but a groundless creed?
19. What matters it?--I blame them not
20. Whose Fancy in this lonely Spot
21. Was moved; and in such way expressed
22. Their notion of its perfect rest.
23. A convent, even a hermit's cell,
24. Would break the silence of this Dell:
25. It is not quiet, is not ease;
26. But something deeper far than these:
27. The separation that is here
28. Is of the grave; and of austere
29. Yet happy feelings of the dead:
30. And, therefore, was it rightly said
31. That Ossian, last of all his race!
32. Lies buried in this lonely place.
