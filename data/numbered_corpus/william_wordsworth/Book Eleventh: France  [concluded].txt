1. FROM that time forth, Authority in France
2. Put on a milder face; Terror had ceased,
3. Yet everything was wanting that might give
4. Courage to them who looked for good by light
5. Of rational Experience, for the shoots
6. And hopeful blossoms of a second spring:
7. Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired;
8. The Senate's language, and the public acts
9. And measures of the Government, though both
10. Weak, and of heartless omen, had not power
11. To daunt me; in the People was my trust:
12. And, in the virtues which mine eyes had seen,
13. I knew that wound external could not take
14. Life from the young Republic; that new foes
15. Would only follow, in the path of shame,
16. Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end
17. Great, universal, irresistible.
18. This intuition led me to confound
19. One victory with another, higher far,--
20. Triumphs of unambitious peace at home,
21. And noiseless fortitude. Beholding still
22. Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought
23. That what was in degree the same was likewise
24. The same in quality,--that, as the worse
25. Of the two spirits then at strife remained
26. Untired, the better, surely, would preserve
27. The heart that first had roused him. Youth maintains,
28. In all conditions of society,
29. Communion more direct and intimate
30. With Nature,--hence, ofttimes, with reason too--
31. Than age or manhood, even. To Nature, then,
32. Power had reverted: habit, custom, law,
33. Had left an interregnum's open space
34. For 'her' to move about in, uncontrolled.
35. Hence could I see how Babel-like their task,
36. Who, by the recent deluge stupified,
37. With their whole souls went culling from the day
38. Its petty promises, to build a tower
39. For their own safety; laughed with my compeers
40. At gravest heads, by enmity to France
41. Distempered, till they found, in every blast
42. Forced from the street-disturbing newsman's horn,
43. For her great cause record or prophecy
44. Of utter ruin. How might we believe
45. That wisdom could, in any shape, come near
46. Men clinging to delusions so insane?
47. And thus, experience proving that no few
48. Of our opinions had been just, we took
49. Like credit to ourselves where less was due,
50. And thought that other notions were as sound
51. Yea, could not but be right, because we saw
52. That foolish men opposed them.
53. To a strain
54. More animated I might here give way,
55. And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme,
56. What in those days, through Britain, was performed
57. To turn 'all' judgments out of their right course;
58. But this is passion over-near ourselves,
59. Reality too close and too intense,
60. And intermixed with something, in my mind,
61. Of scorn and condemnation personal,
62. That would profane the sanctity of verse.
63. Our Shepherds, this say merely, at that time
64. Acted, or seemed at least to act, like men
65. Thirsting to make the guardian crook of law
66. A tool of murder; they who ruled the State--
67. Though with such awful proof before their eyes
68. That he, who would sow death, reaps death, or worse,
69. And can reap nothing better--child-like longed
70. To imitate, not wise enough to avoid;
71. Or left (by mere timidity betrayed)
72. The plain straight road, for one no better chosen
73. Than if their wish had been to undermine
74. Justice, and make an end of Liberty.

75. But from these bitter truths I must return
76. To my own history. It hath been told
77. That I was led to take an eager part
78. In arguments of civil polity,
79. Abruptly, and indeed before my time:
80. I had approached, like other youths, the shield
81. Of human nature from the golden side,
82. And would have fought, even to the death, to attest
83. The quality of the metal which I saw.
84. What there is best in individual man,
85. Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,
86. Benevolent in small societies,
87. And great in large ones, I had oft revolved,
88. Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understood
89. By reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,
90. As cause was given me afterwards to learn,
91. Not proof against the injuries of the day;
92. Lodged only at the sanctuary's door,
93. Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,
94. And with such general insight into evil,
95. And of the bounds which sever it from good,
96. As books and common intercourse with life
97. Must needs have given--to the inexperienced mind,
98. When the world travels in a beaten road,
99. Guide faithful as is needed--I began
100. To meditate with ardour on the rule
101. And management of nations; what it is
102. And ought to be; and strove to learn how far
103. Their power or weakness, wealth or poverty,
104. Their happiness or misery, depends
105. Upon their laws, and fashion of the State.

106. O pleasant exercise of hope and joy!
107. For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood
108. Upon our side, us who were strong in love!
109. Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
110. But to be young was very Heaven! O times,
111. In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways
112. Of custom, law, and statute, took at once
113. The attraction of a country in romance!
114. When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights
115. When most intent on making of herself
116. A prime enchantress--to assist the work,
117. Which then was going forward in her name!
118. Not favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,
119. The beauty wore of promise--that which sets
120. (As at some moments might not be unfelt
121. Among the bowers of Paradise itself)
122. The budding rose above the rose full blown.
123. What temper at the prospect did not wake
124. To happiness unthought of? The inert
125. Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!
126. They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,
127. The play-fellows of fancy, who had made
128. All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength
129. Their ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred
130. Among the grandest objects of the sense,
131. And dealt with whatsoever they found there
132. As if they had within some lurking right
133. To wield it;--they, too, who of gentle mood
134. Had watched all gentle motions, and to these
135. Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,
136. And in the region of their peaceful selves;--
137. Now was it that 'both' found, the meek and lofty
138. Did both find, helpers to their hearts' desire,
139. And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,--
140. Were called upon to exercise their skill,
141. Not in Utopia,--subterranean fields,--
142. Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!
143. But in the very world, which is the world
144. Of all of us,--the place where, in the end,
145. We find our happiness, or not at all!

146. Why should I not confess that Earth was then
147. To me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,
148. Seems, when the first time visited, to one
149. Who thither comes to find in it his home?
150. He walks about and looks upon the spot
151. With cordial transport, moulds it and remoulds,
152. And is half-pleased with things that are amiss,
153. 'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.

154. An active partisan, I thus convoked
155. From every object pleasant circumstance
156. To suit my ends; I moved among mankind
157. With genial feelings still predominant;
158. When erring, erring on the better part,
159. And in the kinder spirit; placable,
160. Indulgent, as not uninformed that men
161. See as they have been taught--Antiquity
162. Gives rights to error; and aware, no less
163. That throwing off oppression must be work
164. As well of License as of Liberty;
165. And above all--for this was more than all--
166. Not caring if the wind did now and then
167. Blow keen upon an eminence that gave
168. Prospect so large into futurity;
169. In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,
170. Diffusing only those affections wider
171. That from the cradle had grown up with me,
172. And losing, in no other way than light
173. Is lost in light, the weak in the more strong.

174. In the main outline, such it might be said
175. Was my condition, till with open war
176. Britain opposed the liberties of France.
177. This threw me first out of the pale of love;
178. Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source,
179. My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,
180. A swallowing up of lesser things in great,
181. But change of them into their contraries;
182. And thus a way was opened for mistakes
183. And false conclusions, in degree as gross,
184. In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,
185. Was now a shame; my likings and my loves
186. Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry;
187. And hence a blow that, in maturer age,
188. Would but have touched the judgment, struck more deep
189. Into sensations near the heart: meantime,
190. As from the first, wild theories were afloat,
191. To whose pretensions, sedulously urged,
192. I had but lent a careless ear, assured
193. That time was ready to set all things right,
194. And that the multitude, so long oppressed,
195. Would be oppressed no more.
196. But when events
197. Brought less encouragement, and unto these
198. The immediate proof of principles no more
199. Could be entrusted, while the events themselves,
200. Worn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,
201. Less occupied the mind, and sentiments
202. Could through my understanding's natural growth
203. No longer keep their ground, by faith maintained
204. Of inward consciousness, and hope that laid
205. Her hand upon her object--evidence
206. Safer, of universal application, such
207. As could not be impeached, was sought elsewhere.

208. But now, become oppressors in their turn,
209. Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence
210. For one of conquest, losing sight of all
211. Which they had struggled for: up mounted now,
212. Openly in the eye of earth and heaven,
213. The scale of liberty. I read her doom,
214. With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,
215. But not dismayed, nor taking to the shame
216. Of a false prophet. While resentment rose
217. Striving to hide, what nought could heal, the wounds
218. Of mortified presumption, I adhered
219. More firmly to old tenets, and, to prove
220. Their temper, strained them more; and thus, in heat
221. Of contest, did opinions every day
222. Grow into consequence, till round my mind
223. They clung, as if they were its life, nay more,
224. The very being of the immortal soul.

225. This was the time, when, all things tending fast
226. To depravation, speculative schemes--
227. That promised to abstract the hopes of Man
228. Out of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth
229. For ever in a purer element--
230. Found ready welcome. Tempting region 'that'
231. For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,
232. Where passions had the privilege to work,
233. And never hear the sound of their own names.
234. But, speaking more in charity, the dream
235. Flattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least
236. With that which makes our Reason's naked self
237. The object of its fervour. What delight!
238. How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,
239. To look through all the frailties of the world,
240. And, with a resolute mastery shaking off
241. Infirmities of nature, time, and place,
242. Build social upon personal Liberty,
243. Which, to the blind restraints of general laws,
244. Superior, magisterially adopts
245. One guide, the light of circumstances, flashed
246. Upon an independent intellect.
247. Thus expectation rose again; thus hope,
248. From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.
249. Oft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,
250. I scorned indifference; but, inflamed with thirst
251. Of a secure intelligence, and sick
252. Of other longing, I pursued what seemed
253. A more exalted nature; wished that Man
254. Should start out of his earthy, worm-like state,
255. And spread abroad the wings of Liberty,
256. Lord of himself, in undisturbed delight--
257. A noble aspiration! 'yet' I feel
258. (Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)
259. The aspiration, nor shall ever cease
260. To feel it;--but return we to our course.

261. Enough, 'tis true--could such a plea excuse
262. Those aberrations--had the clamorous friends
263. Of ancient Institutions said and done
264. To bring disgrace upon their very names;
265. Disgrace, of which, custom and written law,
266. And sundry moral sentiments as props
267. Or emanations of those institutes,
268. Too justly bore a part. A veil had been
269. Uplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,
270. 'Twas even so; and sorrow for the man
271. Who either had not eyes wherewith to see,
272. Or, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock
273. Was given to old opinions; all men's minds
274. Had felt its power, and mine was both let loose,
275. Let loose and goaded. After what hath been
276. Already said of patriotic love,
277. Suffice it here to add, that, somewhat stern
278. In temperament, withal a happy man,
279. And therefore bold to look on painful things,
280. Free likewise of the world, and thence more bold,
281. I summoned my best skill, and toiled, intent
282. To anatomise the frame of social life;
283. Yea, the whole body of society
284. Searched to its heart. Share with me, Friend! the wish
285. That some dramatic tale, endued with shapes
286. Livelier, and flinging out less guarded words
287. Than suit the work we fashion, might set forth
288. What then I learned, or think I learned, of truth,
289. And the errors into which I fell, betrayed
290. By present objects, and by reasonings false
291. From their beginnings, inasmuch as drawn
292. Out of a heart that had been turned aside
293. From Nature's way by outward accidents,
294. And which was thus confounded, more and more
295. Misguided, and misguiding. So I fared,
296. Dragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,
297. Like culprits to the bar; calling the mind,
298. Suspiciously, to establish in plain day
299. Her titles and her honours; now believing,
300. Now disbelieving; endlessly perplexed
301. With impulse, motive, right and wrong, the ground
302. Of obligation, what the rule and whence
303. The sanction; till, demanding formal 'proof',
304. And seeking it in every thing, I lost
305. All feeling of conviction, and, in fine,
306. Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,
307. Yielded up moral questions in despair.

308. This was the crisis of that strong disease,
309. This the soul's last and lowest ebb; I drooped,
310. Deeming our blessed reason of least use
311. Where wanted most: 'The lordly attributes
312. Of will and choice,' I bitterly exclaimed
313. 'What are they but a mockery of a Being
314. Who hath in no concerns of his a test
315. Of good and evil; knows not what to fear
316. Or hope for, what to covet or to shun;
317. And who, if those could be discerned, would yet
318. Be little profited, would see, and ask
319. Where is the obligation to enforce?
320. And, to acknowledged law rebellious, still,
321. As selfish passion urged, would act amiss;
322. The dupe of folly, or the slave of crime.'

323. Depressed, bewildered thus, I did not walk
324. With scoffers, seeking light and gay revenge
325. From indiscriminate laughter, nor sate down
326. In reconcilement with an utter waste
327. Of intellect; such sloth I could not brook,
328. (Too well I loved, in that my spring of life,
329. Pains-taking thoughts, and truth, their dear reward)
330. But turned to abstract science, and there sought
331. Work for the reasoning faculty enthroned
332. Where the disturbances of space and time--
333. Whether in matters various, properties
334. Inherent, or from human will and power
335. Derived--find no admission. Then it was--
336. Thanks to the bounteous Giver of all good!--
337. That the beloved Sister in whose sight
338. Those days were passed, now speaking in a voice
339. Of sudden admonition--like a brook
340. That did but 'cross' a lonely road, and now
341. Is seen, heard, felt, and caught at every turn,
342. Companion never lost through many a league--
343. Maintained for me a saving intercourse
344. With my true self; for, though bedimmed and changed
345. Much, as it seemed, I was no further changed
346. Than as a clouded and a waning moon:
347. She whispered still that brightness would return;
348. She, in the midst of all, preserved me still
349. A Poet, made me seek beneath that name,
350. And that alone, my office upon earth;
351. And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown,
352. If willing audience fail not, Nature's self,
353. By all varieties of human love
354. Assisted, led me back through opening day
355. To those sweet counsels between head and heart
356. Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace,
357. Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,
358. Hath still upheld me, and upholds me now
359. In the catastrophe (for so they dream,
360. And nothing less), when, finally to close
361. And seal up all the gains of France, a Pope
362. Is summoned in, to crown an Emperor--
363. This last opprobrium, when we see a people,
364. That once looked up in faith, as if to Heaven
365. For manna, take a lesson from the dog
366. Returning to his vomit; when the sun
367. That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved
368. In exultation with a living pomp
369. Of clouds--his glory's natural retinue--
370. Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed,
371. And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine,
372. Sets like an Opera phantom.
373. Thus, O Friend!
374. Through times of honour and through times of shame
375. Descending, have I faithfully retraced
376. The perturbations of a youthful mind
377. Under a long-lived storm of great events--
378. A story destined for thy ear, who now,
379. Among the fallen of nations, dost abide
380. Where Etna, over hill and valley, casts
381. His shadow stretching towards Syracuse,
382. The city of Timoleon! Righteous Heaven!
383. How are the mighty prostrated! They first,
384. They first of all that breathe should have awaked
385. When the great voice was heard from out the tombs
386. Of ancient heroes. If I suffered grief
387. For ill-requited France, by many deemed
388. A trifler only in her proudest day;
389. Have been distressed to think of what she once
390. Promised, now is; a far more sober cause
391. Thine eyes must see of sorrow in a land,
392. To the reanimating influence lost
393. Of memory, to virtue lost and hope,
394. Though with the wreck of loftier years bestrewn.

395. But indignation works where hope is not,
396. And thou, O Friend! wilt be refreshed. There is
397. One great society alone on earth:
398. The noble Living and the noble Dead.

399. Thine be such converse strong and sanative,
400. A ladder for thy spirit to reascend
401. To health and joy and pure contentedness;
402. To me the grief confined, that thou art gone
403. From this last spot of earth, where Freedom now
404. Stands single in her only sanctuary;
405. A lonely wanderer, art gone, by pain
406. Compelled and sickness, at this latter day,
407. This sorrowful reverse for all mankind.
408. I feel for thee, must utter what I feel:
409. The sympathies erewhile in part discharged,
410. Gather afresh, and will have vent again:
411. My own delights do scarcely seem to me
412. My own delights; the lordly Alps themselves,
413. Those rosy peaks, from which the Morning looks
414. Abroad on many nations, are no more
415. For me that image of pure gladsomeness
416. Which they were wont to be. Through kindred scenes,
417. For purpose, at a time, how different!
418. Thou tak'st thy way, carrying the heart and soul
419. That Nature gives to Poets, now by thought
420. Matured, and in the summer of their strength.
421. Oh! wrap him in your shades, ye giant woods,
422. On Etna's side; and thou, O flowery field
423. Of Enna! is there not some nook of thine,
424. From the first play-time of the infant world
425. Kept sacred to restorative delight,
426. When from afar invoked by anxious love?

427. Child of the mountains, among shepherds reared,
428. Ere yet familiar with the classic page,
429. I learnt to dream of Sicily; and lo,
430. The gloom, that, but a moment past, was deepened
431. At thy command, at her command gives way;
432. A pleasant promise, wafted from her shores,
433. Comes o'er my heart: in fancy I behold
434. Her seas yet smiling, her once happy vales;
435. Nor can my tongue give utterance to a name
436. Of note belonging to that honoured isle,
437. Philosopher or Bard, Empedocles,
438. Or Archimedes, pure abstracted soul!
439. That doth not yield a solace to my grief:
440. And, O Theocritus, so far have some
441. Prevailed among the powers of heaven and earth,
442. By their endowments, good or great, that they
443. Have had, as thou reportest, miracles
444. Wrought for them in old time: yea, not unmoved,
445. When thinking on my own beloved friend,
446. I hear thee tell how bees with honey fed
447. Divine Comates, by his impious lord
448. Within a chest imprisoned; how they came
449. Laden from blooming grove or flowery field,
450. And fed him there, alive, month after month,
451. Because the goatherd, blessed man! had lips
452. Wet with the Muses' nectar.
453. Thus I soothe
454. The pensive moments by this calm fire-side,
455. And find a thousand bounteous images
456. To cheer the thoughts of those I love, and mine.
457. Our prayers have been accepted; thou wilt stand
458. On Etna's summit, above earth and sea,
459. Triumphant, winning from the invaded heavens
460. Thoughts without bound, magnificent designs,
461. Worthy of poets who attuned their harps
462. In wood or echoing cave, for discipline
463. Of heroes; or, in reverence to the gods,
464. 'Mid temples, served by sapient priests, and choirs
465. Of virgins crowned with roses. Not in vain
466. Those temples, where they in their ruins yet
467. Survive for inspiration, shall attract
468. Thy solitary steps: and on the brink
469. Thou wilt recline of pastoral Arethuse;
470. Or, if that fountain be in truth no more,
471. Then, near some other spring--which, by the name
472. Thou gratulatest, willingly deceived--
473. I see thee linger a glad votary,
474. And not a captive pining for his home.
