1. FAIR Star of evening, Splendour of the west,
2. Star of my Country!--on the horizon's brink
3. Thou hangest, stooping, as might seem, to sink
4. On England's bosom; yet well pleased to rest,
5. Meanwhile, and be to her a glorious crest
6. Conspicuous to the Nations. Thou, I think,
7. Should'st be my Country's emblem; and should'st wink,
8. Bright Star! with laughter on her banners, drest
9. In thy fresh beauty. There! that dusky spot
10. Beneath thee, that is England; there she lies.
11. Blessings be on you both! one hope, one lot,
12. One life, one glory!--I, with many a fear
13. For my dear Country, many heartfelt sighs,
14. Among men who do not love her, linger here.
