1. THE LARGEST OF A HEAP LYING NEAR A DESERTED QUARRY, UPON ONE OF THE ISLANDS AT RYDAL

2. Stranger! this hillock of mis-shapen stones
3. Is not a Ruin spared or made by time,
4. Nor, as perchance thou rashly deem'st, the Cairn
5. Of some old British Chief: 'tis nothing more
6. Than the rude embryo of a little Dome
7. Or Pleasure-house, once destined to be built
8. Among the birch-trees of this rocky isle.
9. But, as it chanced, Sir William having learned
10. That from the shore a full-grown man might wade,
11. And make himself a freeman of this spot
12. At any hour he chose, the prudent Knight
13. Desisted, and the quarry and the mound
14. Are monuments of his unfinished task.
15. The block on which these lines are traced, perhaps,
16. Was once selected as the corner-stone
17. Of that intended Pile, which would have been
18. Some quaint odd plaything of elaborate skill,
19. So that, I guess, the linnet and the thrush,
20. And other little builders who dwell here,
21. Had wondered at the work. But blame him not,
22. For old Sir William was a gentle Knight,
23. Bled in this vale, to which he appertained
24. With all his ancestry. Then peace to him,
25. And for the outrage which he had devised
26. Entire forgiveness!--But if thou art one
27. On fire with thy impatience to become
28. An inmate of these mountains,--if, disturbed
29. By beautiful conceptions, thou hast hewn
30. Out of the quiet rock the elements
31. Of thy trim Mansion destined soon to blaze
32. In snow-white splendour,--think again; and, taught
33. By old Sir William and his quarry, leave
34. Thy fragments to the bramble and the rose;
35. There let the vernal slow-worm sun himself,
36. And let the redbreast hop from stone to stone.
