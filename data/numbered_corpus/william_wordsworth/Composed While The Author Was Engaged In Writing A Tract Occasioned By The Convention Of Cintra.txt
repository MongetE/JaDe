1. NOT 'mid the world's vain objects that enslave
2. The free-born Soul--that World whose vaunted skill
3. In selfish interest perverts the will,
4. Whose factions lead astray the wise and brave--
5. Not there; but in dark wood and rocky cave,
6. And hollow vale which foaming torrents fill
7. With omnipresent murmur as they rave
8. Down their steep beds, that never shall be still:
9. Here, mighty Nature! in this school sublime
10. I weigh the hopes and fears of suffering Spain;
11. For her consult the auguries of time,
12. And through the human heart explore my way;
13. And look and listen--gathering, whence I may,
14. Triumph, and thoughts no bondage can restrain.
