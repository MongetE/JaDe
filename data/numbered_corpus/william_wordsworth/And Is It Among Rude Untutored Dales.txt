1. AND is it among rude untutored Dales,
2. There, and there only, that the heart is true?
3. And, rising to repel or to subdue,
4. Is it by rocks and woods that man prevails?
5. Ah no! though Nature's dread protection fails,
6. There is a bulwark in the soul. This knew
7. Iberian Burghers when the sword they drew
8. In Zaragoza, naked to the gales
9. Of fiercely-breathing war. The truth was felt
10. By Palafox, and many a brave compeer,
11. Like him of noble birth and noble mind;
12. By ladies, meek-eyed women without fear;
13. And wanderers of the street, to whom is dealt
14. The bread which without industry they find.
