1. WELL may'st thou halt-and gaze with brightening eye!
2. The lovely Cottage in the guardian nook
3. Hath stirred thee deeply; with its own dear brook,
4. Its own small pasture, almost its own sky!
5. But covet not the Abode;-forbear to sigh,
6. As many do, repining while they look;
7. Intruders-who would tear from Nature's book
8. This precious leaf, with harsh impiety.
9. Think what the home must be if it were thine,
10. Even thine, though few thy wants!-Roof, window, door,
11. The very flowers are sacred to the Poor,
12. The roses to the porch which they entwine:
13. Yea, all, that now enchants thee, from the day
14. On which it should be touched, would melt away.
