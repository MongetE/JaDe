1. WHILE from the purpling east departs
2. The star that led the dawn,
3. Blithe Flora from her couch upstarts,
4. For May is on the lawn.
5. A quickening hope, a freshening glee,
6. Foreran the expected Power,
7. Whose first-drawn breath, from bush and tree,
8. Shakes off that pearly shower.

9. All Nature welcomes Her whose sway
10. Tempers the year's extremes;
11. Who scattereth lustres o'er noon-day,
12. Like morning's dewy gleams;
13. While mellow warble, sprightly trill,
14. The tremulous heart excite;
15. And hums the balmy air to still
16. The balance of delight.

17. Time was, blest Power! when youth and maids
18. At peep of dawn would rise,
19. And wander forth, in forest glades
20. Thy birth to solemnize.
21. Though mute the song---to grace the rite
22. Untouched the hawthorn bough,
23. Thy Spirit triumphs o'er the slight;
24. Man changes, but not Thou!

25. Thy feathered Lieges bill and wings
26. In love's disport employ;
27. Warmed by thy influence, creeping things
28. Awake to silent joy:
29. Queen art thou still for each gay plant
30. Where the slim wild deer roves;
31. And served in depths where fishes haunt
32. Their own mysterious groves.

33. Cloud-piercing peak, and trackless heath,
34. Instinctive homage pay;
35. Nor wants the dim-lit cave a wreath
36. To honor thee, sweet May!
37. Where cities fanned by thy brisk airs
38. Behold a smokeless sky,
39. Their puniest flower-pot-nursling dares
40. To open a bright eye.

41. And if, on this thy natal morn,
42. The pole, from which thy name
43. Hath not departed, stands forlorn
44. Of song and dance and game;
45. Still from the village-green a vow
46. Aspires to thee addrest,
47. Wherever peace is on the brow,
48. Or love within the breast.

49. Yes! where Love nestles thou canst teach
50. The soul to love the more;
51. Hearts also shall thy lessons reach
52. That never loved before.
53. Stript is the haughty one of pride,
54. The bashful freed from fear,
55. While rising, like the ocean-tide,
56. In flow the joyous year.

57. Hush, feeble lyre! weak words refuse
58. The service to prolong!
59. To yon exulting thrush the Muse
60. Entrusts the imperfect song;
61. His voice shall chant, in accents clear,
62. Throughout the live-long day,
63. Till the first silver star appear,
64. The sovereignty of May.
