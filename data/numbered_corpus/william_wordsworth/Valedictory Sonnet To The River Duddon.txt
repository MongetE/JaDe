1. I THOUGHT of Thee, my partner and my guide,
2. As being pass'd away.--Vain sympathies!
3. For, backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,
4. I see what was, and is, and will abide;
5. Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;
6. The Form remains, the Function never dies;
7. While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,
8. We Men, who in our morn of youth defied
9. The elements, must vanish;--be it so!
10. Enough, if something from our hands have power
11. To live, and act, and serve the future hour;
12. And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,
13. Through love, through hope, and faith's transcendent dower,
14. We feel that we are greater than we know.
