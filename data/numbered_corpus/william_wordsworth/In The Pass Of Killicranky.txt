1. SIX thousand veterans practised in war's game,
2. Tried men, at Killicranky were arrayed
3. Against an equal host that wore the plaid,
4. Shepherds and herdsmen.--Like a whirlwind came
5. The Highlanders, the slaughter spread like flame;
6. And Garry, thundering down his mountain-road,
7. Was stopped, and could not breathe beneath the load
8. Of the dead bodies.--'Twas a day of shame
9. For them whom precept and the pedantry
10. Of cold mechanic battle do enslave.
11. O for a single hour of that Dundee,
12. Who on that day the word of onset gave!
13. Like conquest would the Men of England see;
14. And her Foes find a like inglorious grave.
