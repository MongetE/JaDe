1. Though the torrents from their fountains
2. Roar down many a craggy steep,
3. Yet they find among the mountains
4. Resting-places calm and deep.

5. Clouds that love through air to hasten,
6. Ere the storm its fury stills,
7. Helmet-like themselves will fasten
8. On the heads of towering hills.

9. What, if through the frozen centre
10. Of the Alps the Chamois bound,
11. Yet he has a home to enter
12. In some nook of chosen ground:

13. And the Sea-horse, though the ocean
14. Yield him no domestic cave,
15. Slumbers without sense of motion,
16. Couched upon the rocking wave.

17. If on windy days the Raven
18. Gambol like a dancing skiff,
19. Not the less she loves her haven
20. In the bosom of the cliff.

21. The fleet Ostrich, till day closes,
22. Vagrant over desert sands,
23. Brooding on her eggs reposes
24. When chill night that care demands.

25. Day and night my toils redouble,
26. Never nearer to the goal;
27. Night and day, I feel the trouble
28. Of the Wanderer in my soul.
