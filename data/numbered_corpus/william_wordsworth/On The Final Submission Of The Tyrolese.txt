1. IT was a 'moral' end for which they fought;
2. Else how, when mighty Thrones were put to shame,
3. Could they, poor Shepherds, have preserved an aim,
4. A resolution, or enlivening thought?
5. Nor hath that moral good been 'vainly' sought;
6. For in their magnanimity and fame
7. Powers have they left, an impulse, and a claim
8. Which neither can be overturned nor bought.
9. Sleep, Warriors, sleep! among your hills repose!
10. We know that ye, beneath the stern control
11. Of awful prudence, keep the unvanquished soul:
12. And when, impatient of her guilt and woes,
13. Europe breaks forth; then, Shepherds! shall ye rise
14. For perfect triumph o'er your Enemies.
