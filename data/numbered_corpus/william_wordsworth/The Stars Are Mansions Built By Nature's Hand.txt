1. The stars are mansions built by Nature's hand,
2. And, haply, there the spirits of the blest
3. Dwell, clothed in radiance, their immortal vest;
4. Huge Ocean shows, within his yellow strand,
5. A habitation marvellously planned,
6. For life to occupy in love and rest;
7. All that we see--is dome, or vault, or nest,
8. Or fortress, reared at Nature's sage command.
9. Glad thought for every season! but the Spring
10. Gave it while cares were weighing on my heart,
11. 'Mid song of birds, and insects murmuring;
12. And while the youthful year's prolific art--
13. Of bud, leaf, blade, and flower--was fashioning
14. Abodes where self-disturbance hath no part.
