1. EVEN as a dragon's eye that feels the stress
2. Of a bedimming sleep, or as a lamp
3. Suddenly glaring through sepulchral damp,
4. So burns yon Taper 'mid a black recess
5. Of mountains, silent, dreary, motionless:
6. The lake below reflects it not; the sky,
7. Muffled in clouds, affords no company
8. To mitigate and cheer its loneliness.
9. Yet, round the body of that joyless Thing
10. Which sends so far its melancholy light,
11. Perhaps are seated in domestic ring
12. A gay society with faces bright,
13. Conversing, reading, laughing;--or they sing,
14. While hearts and voices in the song unite.
