1. THERE 's not a nook within this solemn Pass,
2. But were an apt confessional for one
3. Taught by his summer spent, his autumn gone,
4. That Life is but a tale of morning grass
5. Wither'd at eve. From scenes of art which chase
6. That thought away, turn, and with watchful eyes
7. Feed it 'mid Nature's old felicities,
8. Rocks, rivers, and smooth lakes more clear than glass
9. Untouch'd, unbreathed upon. Thrice happy quest,
10. If from a golden perch of aspen spray
11. (October's workmanship to rival May)
12. The pensive warbler of the ruddy breast
13. That moral sweeten by a heaven-taught lay,
14. Lulling the year, with all its cares, to rest!
