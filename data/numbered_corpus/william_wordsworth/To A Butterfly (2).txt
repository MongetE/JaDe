1. I'VE watched you now a full half-hour,
2. Self-poised upon that yellow flower;
3. And, little Butterfly! indeed
4. I know not if you sleep or feed.
5. How motionless!---not frozen seas
6. More motionless! and then
7. What joy awaits you, when the breeze
8. Hath found you out among the trees,
9. And calls you forth again !

10. This plot of orchard-ground is ours;
11. My trees they are, my Sister's flowers;
12. Here rest your wing when they are weary;
13. Here lodge as in a sanctuary!
14. Come often to us, fear no wrong;
15. Sit near us on the bough!
16. We'll talk of sunshine and of song,
17. And summer days, when we were young;
18. Sweet childish days, that were as long
19. As twenty days are now.
