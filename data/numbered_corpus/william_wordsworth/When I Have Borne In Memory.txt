1. WHEN I have borne in memory what has tamed
2. Great Nations, how ennobling thoughts depart
3. When men change swords for ledgers, and desert
4. The student's bower for gold, some fears unnamed
5. I had, my Country!--am I to be blamed?
6. Now, when I think of thee, and what thou art,
7. Verily, in the bottom of my heart,
8. Of those unfilial fears I am ashamed.
9. For dearly must we prize thee; we who find
10. In thee a bulwark for the cause of men:
11. And I by my affection was beguiled:
12. What wonder if a Poet now and then,
13. Among the many movements of his mind,
14. Felt for thee as a lover or a child!
