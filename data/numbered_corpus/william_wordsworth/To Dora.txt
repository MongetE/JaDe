1. ''A little onward lend thy guiding hand
2. To these dark steps, a little further on!''
3. --What trick of memory to 'my' voice hath brought
4. This mournful iteration? For though Time,
5. The Conqueror, crowns the Conquered, on this brow
6. Planting his favourite silver diadem,
7. Nor he, nor minister of his--intent
8. To run before him--hath enrolled me yet,
9. Though not unmenaced, among those who lean
10. Upon a living staff, with borrowed sight.
11. --O my own Dora, my beloved child!
12. Should that day come--but hark! the birds salute
13. The cheerful dawn, brightening for me the east;
14. For me, thy natural leader, once again
15. Impatient to conduct thee, not as erst
16. A tottering infant, with compliant stoop
17. From flower to flower supported; but to curb
18. Thy nymph-like step swift-bounding o'er the lawn,
19. Along the loose rocks, or the slippery verge
20. Of foaming torrents.--From thy orisons
21. Come forth; and, while the morning air is yet
22. Transparent as the soul of innocent youth,
23. Let me, thy happy guide, now point thy way,
24. And now precede thee, winding to and fro,
25. Till we by perseverance gain the top
26. Of some smooth ridge, whose brink precipitous
27. Kindles intense desire for powers withheld
28. From this corporeal frame; whereon who stands,
29. Is seized with strong incitement to push forth
30. His arms, as swimmers use, and plunge--dread thought,
31. For pastime plunge--into the 'abrupt abyss,'--
32. Where ravens spread their plumy vans, at ease!
33. And yet more gladly thee would I conduct
34. Through woods and spacious forests,--to behold
35. There, how the Original of human art,
36. Heaven-prompted Nature, measures and erects
37. Her temples, fearless for the stately work,
38. Though waves, to every breeze, its high-arched roof,
39. And storms the pillars rock. But we such schools
40. Of reverential awe will chiefly seek
41. In the still summer noon, while beams of light,
42. Reposing here, and in the aisles beyond
43. Traceably gliding through the dusk, recall
44. To mind the living presences of nuns;
45. A gentle, pensive, white-robed sisterhood,
46. Whose saintly radiance mitigates the gloom
47. Of those terrestrial fabrics, where they serve,
48. To Christ, the Sun of righteousness, espoused.
49. Now also shall the page of classic lore,
50. To these glad eyes from bondage freed, again
51. Lie open; and the book of Holy Writ,
52. Again unfolded, passage clear shall yield
53. To heights more glorious still, and into shades
54. More awful, where, advancing hand in hand,
55. We may be taught, O Darling of my care!
56. To calm the affections, elevate the soul,
57. And consecrate our lives to truth and love.
