1. There is a Yew-tree, pride of Lorton Vale,
2. Which to this day stands single, in the midst
3. Of its own darkness, as it stood of yore:
4. Not loathe to furnish weapons for the Bands
5. Of Umfraville or Percy ere they marched
6. To Scotland's heaths; or those that crossed the sea
7. And drew their sounding bows at Azincour,
8. Perhaps at earlier Crecy, or Poictiers.
9. Of vast circumference and gloom profound
10. This solitary Tree! -a living thing
11. Produced too slowly ever to decay;
12. Of form and aspect too magnificent
13. To be destroyed. But worthier still of note
14. Are those fraternal Four of Borrowdale,
15. Joined in one solemn and capacious grove;
16. Huge trunks! -and each particular trunk a growth
17. Of intertwisted fibres serpentine
18. Up-coiling, and inveteratley convolved, -
19. Nor uninformed with Fantasy, and looks
20. That threaten the profane; -a pillared shade,
21. Upon whose grassless floor of red-brown hue,
22. By sheddings from the pining umbrage tinged
23. Perennially -beneath whose sable roof
24. Of boughs, as if for festal purpose decked
25. With unrejoicing berries -ghostly Shapes
26. May meet at noontide: Fear and trembling Hope,
27. Silence and Foresight, Death the Skeleton
28. And Time the Shadow; there to celebrate,
29. As in a natural temple scattered o'er
30. With altars undisturbed of mossy stone,
31. United worship; or in mute repose
32. To lie, and listen to the mountain flood
33. Murmuring from Glaramara's inmost caves.
