1. O HAPPY time of youthful lovers (thus
2. My story may begin) O balmy time,
3. In which a love-knot on a lady's brow
4. Is fairer than the fairest star in heaven!
5. To such inheritance of blessed fancy
6. (Fancy that sports more desperately with minds
7. Than ever fortune hath been known to do)
8. The high-born Vaudracour was brought, by years
9. Whose progress had a little overstepped
10. His stripling prime. A town of small repute,
11. Among the vine-clad mountains of Auvergne,
12. Was the Youth's birth-place. There he wooed a Maid
13. Who heard the heart-felt music of his suit
14. With answering vows. Plebeian was the stock,
15. Plebeian, though ingenuous, the stock,
16. From which her graces and her honours sprung:
17. And hence the father of the enamoured Youth,
18. With haughty indignation, spurned the thought
19. Of such alliance.--From their cradles up,
20. With but a step between their several homes,
21. Twins had they been in pleasure; after strife
22. And petty quarrels, had grown fond again;
23. Each other's advocate, each other's stay;
24. And, in their happiest moments, not content,
25. If more divided than a sportive pair
26. Of sea-fowl, conscious both that they are hovering
27. Within the eddy of a common blast,
28. Or hidden only by the concave depth
29. Of neighbouring billows from each other's sight.
30. Thus, not without concurrence of an age
31. Unknown to memory, was an earnest given
32. By ready nature for a life of love,
33. For endless constancy, and placid truth;
34. But whatsoe'er of such rare treasure lay
35. Reserved, had fate permitted, for support
36. Of their maturer years, his present mind
37. Was under fascination;--he beheld
38. A vision, and adored the thing he saw.
39. Arabian fiction never filled the world
40. With half the wonders that were wrought for him.
41. Earth breathed in one great presence of the spring;
42. Life turned the meanest of her implements,
43. Before his eyes, to price above all gold;
44. The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine;
45. Her chamber-window did surpass in glory
46. The portals of the dawn; all paradise
47. Could, by the simple opening of a door,
48. Let itself in upon him:--pathways, walks,
49. Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirit sank,
50. Surcharged, within him, overblest to move
51. Beneath a sun that wakes a weary world
52. To its dull round of ordinary cares;
53. A man too happy for mortality!
54. So passed the time, till whether through effect
55. Of some unguarded moment that dissolved
56. Virtuous restraint--ah, speak it, think it, not!
57. Deem rather that the fervent Youth, who saw
58. So many bars between his present state
59. And the dear haven where he wished to be
60. In honourable wedlock with his Love,
61. Was in his judgment tempted to decline
62. To perilous weakness, and entrust his cause
63. To nature for a happy end of all;
64. Deem that by such fond hope the Youth was swayed,
65. And bear with their transgression, when I add
66. That Julia, wanting yet the name of wife,
67. Carried about her for a secret grief
68. The promise of a mother.
69. To conceal
70. The threatened shame, the parents of the Maid
71. Found means to hurry her away by night,
72. And unforewarned, that in some distant spot
73. She might remain shrouded in privacy,
74. Until the babe was born. When morning came
75. The Lover, thus bereft, stung with his loss,
76. And all uncertain whither he should turn,
77. Chafed like a wild beast in the toils; but soon
78. Discovering traces of the fugitives,
79. Their steps he followed to the Maid's retreat.
80. Easily may the sequel be divined--
81. Walks to and fro--watchings at every hour;
82. And the fair Captive, who, whene'er she may,
83. Is busy at her casement as the swallow
84. Fluttering its pinions, almost within reach,
85. About the pendent nest, did thus espy
86. Her Lover!--thence a stolen interview,
87. Accomplished under friendly shade of night.
88. I pass the raptures of the pair;--such theme
89. Is, by innumerable poets, touched
90. In more delightful verse than skill of mine
91. Could fashion; chiefly by that darling bard
92. Who told of Juliet and her Romeo,
93. And of the lark's note heard before its time,
94. And of the streaks that laced the severing clouds
95. In the unrelenting east.--Through all her courts
96. The vacant city slept; the busy winds,
97. That keep no certain intervals of rest,
98. Moved not; meanwhile the galaxy displayed
99. Her fires, that like mysterious pulses beat
100. Aloft;--momentous but uneasy bliss!
101. To their full hearts the universe seemed hung
102. On that brief meeting's slender filament!
103. They parted; and the generous Vaudracour
104. Reached speedily the native threshold, bent
105. On making (so the Lovers had agreed)
106. A sacrifice of birthright to attain
107. A final portion from his father's hand;
108. Which granted, Bride and Bridegroom then would flee
109. To some remote and solitary place,
110. Shady as night, and beautiful as heaven,
111. Where they may live, with no one to behold
112. Their happiness, or to disturb their love.
113. But 'now' of this no whisper; not the less,
114. If ever an obtrusive word were dropped
115. Touching the matter of his passion, still,
116. In his stern father's hearing, Vaudracour
117. Persisted openly that death alone
118. Should abrogate his human privilege
119. Divine, of swearing everlasting truth,
120. Upon the altar, to the Maid he loved.
121. 'You shall be baffled in your mad intent
122. If there be justice in the court of France,'
123. Muttered the Father.--From these words the Youth
124. Conceived a terror; and, by night or day,
125. Stirred nowhere without weapons, that full soon
126. Found dreadful provocation: for at night
127. When to his chamber he retired, attempt
128. Was made to seize him by three armed men,
129. Acting, in furtherance of the father's will,
130. Under a private signet of the State.
131. One the rash Youth's ungovernable hand
132. Slew, and as quickly to a second gave
133. A perilous wound--he shuddered to behold
134. The breathless corse; then peacefully resigned
135. His person to the law, was lodged in prison,
136. And wore the fetters of a criminal.
137. Have you observed a tuft of winged seed
138. That, from the dandelion's naked stalk,
139. Mounted aloft, is suffered not to use
140. Its natural gifts for purposes of rest,
141. Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro
142. Through the wide element? or have you marked
143. The heavier substance of a leaf-clad bough,
144. Within the vortex of a foaming flood,
145. Tormented? by such aid you may conceive
146. The perturbation that ensued;--ah, no!
147. Desperate the Maid--the Youth is stained with blood;
148. Unmatchable on earth is their disquiet!
149. Yet as the troubled seed and tortured bough
150. Is Man, subjected to despotic sway.
151. For him, by private influence with the Court,
152. Was pardon gained, and liberty procured;
153. But not without exaction of a pledge,
154. Which liberty and love dispersed in air.
155. He flew to her from whom they would divide him--
156. He clove to her who could not give him peace--
157. Yea, his first word of greeting was,--'All right
158. Is gone from me; my lately-towering hopes,
159. To the least fibre of their lowest root,
160. Are withered; thou no longer canst be mine,
161. I thine--the conscience-stricken must not woo
162. The unruffled Innocent,--I see thy face,
163. Behold thee, and my misery is complete!'
164. 'One, are we not?' exclaimed the Maiden--'One,
165. For innocence and youth, for weal and woe?'
166. Then with the father's name she coupled words
167. Of vehement indignation; but the Youth
168. Checked her with filial meekness; for no thought
169. Uncharitable crossed his mind, no sense
170. Of hasty anger rising in the eclipse
171. Of true domestic loyalty, did e'er
172. Find place within his bosom.--Once again
173. The persevering wedge of tyranny
174. Achieved their separation: and once more
175. Were they united,--to be yet again
176. Disparted, pitiable lot! But here
177. A portion of the tale may well be left
178. In silence, though my memory could add
179. Much how the Youth, in scanty space of time,
180. Was traversed from without; much, too, of thoughts
181. That occupied his days in solitude
182. Under privation and restraint; and what,
183. Through dark and shapeless fear of things to come,
184. And what, through strong compunction for the past,
185. He suffered--breaking down in heart and mind!
186. Doomed to a third and last captivity,
187. His freedom he recovered on the eve
188. Of Julia's travail. When the babe was born,
189. Its presence tempted him to cherish schemes
190. Of future happiness. 'You shall return,
191. Julia,' said he, 'and to your father's house
192. Go with the child.--You have been wretched; yet
193. The silver shower, whose reckless burthen weighs
194. Too heavily upon the lily's head,
195. Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root.
196. Malice, beholding you, will melt away.
197. Go!--'tis a town where both of us were born;
198. None will reproach you, for our truth is known;
199. And if, amid those once-bright bowers, our fate
200. Remain unpitied, pity is not in man.
201. With ornaments--the prettiest, nature yields
202. Or art can fashion, shall you deck our boy,
203. And feed his countenance with your own sweet looks
204. Till no one can resist him.--Now, even now,
205. I see him sporting on the sunny lawn;
206. My father from the window sees him too;
207. Startled, as if some new-created thing
208. Enriched the earth, or Faery of the woods
209. Bounded before him;--but the unweeting Child
210. Shall by his beauty win his grandsire's heart
211. So that it shall be softened, and our loves
212. End happily, as they began!'
213. These gleams
214. Appeared but seldom; oftener was he seen
215. Propping a pale and melancholy face
216. Upon the Mother's bosom; resting thus
217. His head upon one breast, while from the other
218. The Babe was drawing in its quiet food.
219. --That pillow is no longer to be thine,
220. Fond Youth! that mournful solace now must pass
221. Into the list of things that cannot be!
222. Unwedded Julia, terror-smitten, hears
223. The sentence, by her mother's lip pronounced,
224. That dooms her to a convent.--Who shall tell,
225. Who dares report, the tidings to the lord
226. Of her affections? so they blindly asked
227. Who knew not to what quiet depths a weight
228. Of agony had pressed the Sufferer down:
229. The word, by others dreaded, he can hear
230. Composed and silent, without visible sign
231. Of even the least emotion. Noting this,
232. When the impatient object of his love
233. Upbraided him with slackness, he returned
234. No answer, only took the mother's hand
235. And kissed it; seemingly devoid of pain,
236. Or care, that what so tenderly he pressed,
237. Was a dependant on the obdurate heart
238. Of one who came to disunite their lives
239. For ever--sad alternative! preferred,
240. By the unbending Parents of the Maid,
241. To secret 'spousals meanly disavowed.
242. --So be it!
243. In the city he remained
244. A season after Julia had withdrawn
245. To those religious walls. He, too, departs--
246. Who with him?--even the senseless Little-one.
247. With that sole charge he passed the city-gates,
248. For the last time, attendant by the side
249. Of a close chair, a litter, or sedan,
250. In which the Babe was carried. To a hill,
251. That rose a brief league distant from the town,
252. The dwellers in that house where he had lodged
253. Accompanied his steps, by anxious love
254. Impelled;--they parted from him there, and stood
255. Watching below till he had disappeared
256. On the hill top. His eyes he scarcely took,
257. Throughout that journey, from the vehicle
258. (Slow-moving ark of all his hopes!) that veiled
259. The tender infant: and, at every inn,
260. And under every hospitable tree
261. At which the bearers halted or reposed,
262. Laid him with timid care upon his knees,
263. And looked, as mothers ne'er were known to look,
264. Upon the nursling which his arms embraced.
265. This was the manner in which Vaudracour
266. Departed with his infant; and thus reached
267. His father's house, where to the innocent child
268. Admittance was denied. The young man spake
269. No word of indignation or reproof,
270. But of his father begged, a last request,
271. That a retreat might be assigned to him
272. Where in forgotten quiet he might dwell,
273. With such allowance as his wants required;
274. For wishes he had none. To a lodge that stood
275. Deep in a forest, with leave given, at the age
276. Of four-and-twenty summers he withdrew;
277. And thither took with him his motherless Babe,
278. And one domestic for their common needs,
279. An aged woman. It consoled him here
280. To attend upon the orphan, and perform
281. Obsequious service to the precious child,
282. Which, after a short time, by some mistake
283. Or indiscretion of the Father, died.--
284. The Tale I follow to its last recess
285. Of suffering or of peace, I know not which:
286. Theirs be the blame who caused the woe, not mine!
287. From this time forth he never shared a smile
288. With mortal creature. An Inhabitant
289. Of that same town, in which the pair had left
290. So lively a remembrance of their griefs,
291. By chance of business, coming within reach
292. Of his retirement, to the forest lodge
293. Repaired, but only found the matron there,
294. Who told him that his pains were thrown away,
295. For that her Master never uttered word
296. To living thing--not even to her.--Behold!
297. While they were speaking, Vaudracour approached;
298. But, seeing some one near, as on the latch
299. Of the garden-gate his hand was laid, he shrunk--
300. And, like a shadow, glided out of view.
301. Shocked at his savage aspect, from the place
302. The visitor retired.
303. Thus lived the Youth
304. Cut off from all intelligence with man,
305. And shunning even the light of common day;
306. Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France
307. Full speedily resounded, public hope,
308. Or personal memory of his own deep wrongs,
309. Rouse him: but in those solitary shades
310. His days he wasted, an imbecile mind!
