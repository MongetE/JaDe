1. I

2. AN age hath been when Earth was proud
3. Of lustre too intense
4. To be sustained; and Mortals bowed
5. The front in self-defence.
6. Who 'then', if Dian's crescent gleamed,
7. Or Cupid's sparkling arrow streamed
8. While on the wing the Urchin played,
9. Could fearlessly approach the shade?
10. --Enough for one soft vernal day,
11. If I, a bard of ebbing time,
12. And nurtured in a fickle clime,
13. May haunt this horned bay;
14. Whose amorous water multiplies
15. The flitting halcyon's vivid dyes;
16. And smooths her liquid breast--to show
17. These swan-like specks of mountain snow,
18. White as the pair that slid along the plains
19. Of heaven, when Venus held the reins!

20. II

21. In youth we love the darksome lawn
22. Brushed by the owlet's wing;
23. Then, Twilight is preferred to Dawn,
24. And Autumn to the Spring.
25. Sad fancies do we then affect,
26. In luxury of disrespect
27. To our own prodigal excess
28. Of too familiar happiness.
29. Lycoris (if such name befit
30. Thee, thee my life's celestial sign!)
31. When Nature marks the year's decline,
32. Be ours to welcome it;
33. Pleased with the harvest hope that runs
34. Before the path of milder suns;
35. Pleased while the sylvan world displays
36. Its ripeness to the feeding gaze;
37. Pleased when the sullen winds resound the knell
38. Of the resplendent miracle.

39. III

40. But something whispers to my heart
41. That, as we downward tend,
42. Lycoris! life requires an 'art'
43. To which our souls must bend;
44. A skill--to balance and supply;
45. And, ere the flowing fount be dry,
46. As soon it must, a sense to sip,
47. Or drink, with no fastidious lip.
48. Then welcome, above all, the Guest
49. Whose smiles, diffused o'er land and sea,
50. Seem to recall the Deity
51. Of youth into the breast:
52. May pensive Autumn ne'er present
53. A claim to her disparagement!
54. While blossoms and the budding spray
55. Inspire us in our own decay;
56. Still, as we nearer draw to life's dark goal,
57. Be hopeful Spring the favourite of the Soul!
