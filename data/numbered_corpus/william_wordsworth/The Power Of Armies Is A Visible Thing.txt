1. The power of Armies is a visible thing,
2. Formal, and circumscribed in time and space;
3. But who the limits of that power shall trace
4. Which a brave People into light can bring
5. Or hide, at will,--for freedom combating
6. By just revenge inflamed? No foot may chase,
7. No eye can follow, to a fatal place
8. That power, that spirit, whether on the wing
9. Like the strong wind, or sleeping like the wind
10. Within its awful caves.--From year to year
11. Springs this indigenous produce far and near;
12. No craft this subtle element can bind,
13. Rising like water from the soil, to find
14. In every nook a lip that it may cheer.
