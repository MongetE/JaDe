1. Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
2. Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought!
3. And giv'st to forms and images a breath
4. And everlasting motion! not in vain,
5. By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn
6. Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
7. The passions that build up our human soul;
8. Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man;
9. But with high objects, with enduring things,
10. With life and nature; purifying thus
11. The elements of feeling and of thought,
12. And sanctifying by such discipline
13. Both pain and fear,--until we recognise
14. A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.
15. Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
16. With stinted kindness. In November days,
17. When vapours rolling down the valleys made
18. A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
19. At noon; and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
20. When, by the margin of the trembling lake,
21. Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward I went
22. In solitude, such intercourse was mine:
23. Mine was it in the fields both day and night,
24. And by the waters, all the summer long.
25. And in the frosty season, when the sun
26. Was set, and, visible for many a mile,
27. The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed,
28. I heeded not the summons: happy time
29. It was indeed for all of us; for me
30. It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud
31. The village-clock tolled six--I wheeled about,
32. Proud and exulting like an untired horse
33. That cares not for his home.--All shod with steel
34. We hissed along the polished ice, in games
35. Confederate, imitative of the chase
36. And woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,
37. The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare.
38. So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
39. And not a voice was idle: with the din
40. Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;
41. The leafless trees and every icy crag
42. Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills
43. Into the tumult sent an alien sound
44. Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars,
45. Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west
46. The orange sky of evening died away.
47. Not seldom from the uproar I retired
48. Into a silent bay, or sportively
49. Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
50. To cut across the reflex of a star;
51. Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed
52. Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes,
53. When we had given our bodies to the wind,
54. And all the shadowy banks on either side
55. Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
56. The rapid line of motion, then at once
57. Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
58. Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
59. Wheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled
60. With visible motion her diurnal round!
61. Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,
62. Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched
63. Till all was tranquil as a summer sea.
