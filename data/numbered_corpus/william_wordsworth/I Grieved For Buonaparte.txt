1. I GRIEVED for Buonaparte, with a vain
2. And an unthinking grief! The tenderest mood
3. Of that Man's mind--what can it be? what food
4. Fed his first hopes? what knowledge could 'he' gain?
5. 'Tis not in battles that from youth we train
6. The Governor who must be wise and good,
7. And temper with the sternness of the brain
8. Thoughts motherly, and meek as womanhood.
9. Wisdom doth live with children round her knees:
10. Books, leisure, perfect freedom, and the talk
11. Man holds with week-day man in the hourly walk
12. Of the mind's business: these are the degrees
13. By which true Sway doth mount; this is the stalk
14. True Power doth grow on; and her rights are these.
