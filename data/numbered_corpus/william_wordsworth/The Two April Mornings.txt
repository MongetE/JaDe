1. We walked along, while bright and red
2. Uprose the morning sun;
3. And Matthew stopped, he looked, and said,
4. 'The will of God be done!'

5. A village schoolmaster was he,
6. With hair of glittering grey;
7. As blithe a man as yon could see
8. On a spring holiday.

9. And on that morning, through the grass,
10. And by the steaming rills,
11. We travelled merrily, to pass
12. A day among the hills.

13. 'Our work,' said I, 'was well begun,
14. Then, from thy breast what thought,
15. Beneath so beautiful a sun,
16. So sad a sigh has brought?'

17. A second time did Matthew stop;
18. And fixing still his eye
19. Upon the eastern mountain-top,
20. To me he made reply:

21. 'Yon cloud with that long purple cleft
22. Brings fresh into my mind
23. A day like this which I have left
24. Full thirty years behind.

25. 'And just above yon slope of corn
26. Such colours, and no other,
27. Were in the sky, that April morn,
28. Of this the very brother.

29. 'With rod and line I sued the sport
30. Which that sweet season gave,
31. And, to the church-yard come, stopped short
32. Beside my daughter's grave.

33. 'Nine summers had she scarcely seen,
34. The pride of all the vale;
35. And then she sang;--she would have been
36. A very nightingale.

37. 'Six feet in earth my Emma lay;
38. And yet I loved her more,
39. For so it seemed, than till that day
40. I e'er had loved before.

41. 'And, turning from her grave, I met,
42. Beside the church-yard yew,
43. A blooming Girl, whose hair was wet
44. With points of morning dew.

45. 'A basket on her head she bare;
46. Her brow was smooth and white:
47. To see a child so very fair,
48. It was a pure delight!

49. 'No fountain from its rocky cave
50. E'er tripped with foot so free;
51. She seemed as happy as a wave
52. That dances on the sea.

53. 'There came from me a sigh of pain
54. Which I could ill confine;
55. I looked at her, and looked again:
56. And did not wish her mine!'

57. Matthew is in his grave, yet now,
58. Methinks, I see him stand,
59. As at that moment, with a bough
60. Of wilding in his hand.
