1. I

2. To barren heath, bleak moor, and quaking fen,
3. Or depth of labyrinthine glen;
4. Or into trackless forest set
5. With trees, whose lofty umbrage met;
6. World-wearied Men withdrew of yore;
7. (Penance their trust, and prayer their store
8. And in the wilderness were bound
9. To such apartments as they found,
10. Or with a new ambition raised;
11. That God might suitably be praised.

12. II

13. High lodged the 'Warrior', like a bird of prey;
14. Or where broad waters round him lay:
15. But this wild Ruin is no ghost
16. Of his devices--buried, lost!
17. Within this little lonely isle
18. There stood a consecrated Pile;
19. Where tapers burned, and mass was sung,
20. For them whose timid Spirits clung
21. To mortal succour, though the tomb
22. Had fixed, for ever fixed, their doom!

23. III

24. Upon those servants of another world
25. When madding Power her bolts had hurled,
26. Their habitation shook;--it fell,
27. And perished, save one narrow cell;
28. Whither, at length, a Wretch retired
29. Who neither grovelled nor aspired:
30. He, struggling in the net of pride,
31. The future scorned, the past defied;
32. Still tempering, from the unguilty forge
33. Of vain conceit, an iron scourge!

34. IV

35. Proud Remnant was he of a fearless Race,
36. Who stood and flourished face to face
37. With their perennial hills;--but Crime,
38. Hastening the stern decrees of Time,
39. Brought low a Power, which from its home
40. Burst, when repose grew wearisome;
41. And, taking impulse from the sword,
42. And, mocking its own plighted word,
43. Had found, in ravage widely dealt,
44. Its warfare's bourn, its travel's belt!

45. V

46. All, all were dispossessed, save him whose smile
47. Shot lightning through this lonely Isle!
48. No right had he but what he made
49. To this small spot, his leafy shade;
50. But the ground lay within that ring
51. To which he only dared to cling;
52. Renouncing here, as worse than dead,
53. The craven few who bowed the head
54. Beneath the change; who heard a claim
55. How loud! yet lived in peace with shame.

56. VI

57. From year to year this shaggy Mortal went
58. (So seemed it) down a strange descent:
59. Till they, who saw his outward frame,
60. Fixed on him an unhallowed name;
61. Him, free from all malicious taint,
62. And guiding, like the Patmos Saint,
63. A pen unwearied--to indite,
64. In his lone Isle, the dreams of night;
65. Impassioned dreams, that strove to span
66. The faded glories of his Clan!

67. VII

68. Suns that through blood their western harbour sought,
69. And stars that in their courses fought;
70. Towers rent, winds combating with woods,
71. Lands deluged by unbridled floods;
72. And beast and bird that from the spell
73. Of sleep took import terrible;--
74. These types mysterious (if the show
75. Of battle and the routed foe
76. Had failed) would furnish an array
77. Of matter for the dawning day!

78. VIII

79. How disappeared He?--ask the newt and toad,
80. Inheritors of his abode;
81. The otter crouching undisturbed,
82. In her dank cleft;--but be thou curbed,
83. O froward Fancy! 'mid a scene
84. Of aspect winning and serene;
85. For those offensive creatures shun
86. The inquisition of the sun!
87. And in this region flowers delight,
88. And all is lovely to the sight.

89. IX

90. Spring finds not here a melancholy breast,
91. When she applies her annual test
92. To dead and living; when her breath
93. Quickens, as now, the withered heath;--
94. Nor flaunting Summer--when he throws
95. His soul into the briar-rose;
96. Or calls the lily from her sleep
97. Prolonged beneath the bordering deep;
98. Nor Autumn, when the viewless wren
99. Is warbling near the BROWNIE'S Den.

100. X

101. Wild Relique! beauteous as the chosen spot
102. In Nysa's isle, the embellished grot;
103. Whither, by care of Libyan Jove,
104. (High Servant of paternal Love)
105. Young Bacchus was conveyed--to lie
106. Safe from his step-dame Rhea's eye;
107. Where bud, and bloom, and fruitage, glowed,
108. Close-crowding round the infant-god;
109. All colours,--and the liveliest streak
110. A foil to his celestial cheek!
