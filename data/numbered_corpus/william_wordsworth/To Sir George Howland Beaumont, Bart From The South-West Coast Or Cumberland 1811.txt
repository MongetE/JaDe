1. FAR from our home by Grasmere's quiet Lake,
2. From the Vale's peace which all her fields partake,
3. Here on the bleakest point of Cumbria's shore
4. We sojourn stunned by Ocean's ceaseless roar;
5. While, day by day, grim neighbour! huge Black Comb
6. Frowns deepening visibly his native gloom,
7. Unless, perchance rejecting in despite
8. What on the Plain 'we' have of warmth and light,
9. In his own storms he hides himself from sight.
10. Rough is the time; and thoughts, that would be free
11. From heaviness, oft fly, dear Friend, to thee;
12. Turn from a spot where neither sheltered road
13. Nor hedge-row screen invites my steps abroad;
14. Where one poor Plane-tree, having as it might
15. Attained a stature twice a tall man's height,
16. Hopeless of further growth, and brown and sere
17. Through half the summer, stands with top cut sheer,
18. Like an unshifting weathercock which proves
19. How cold the quarter that the wind best loves,
20. Or like a Centinel that, evermore
21. Darkening the window, ill defends the door
22. Of this unfinished house--a Fortress bare,
23. Where strength has been the Builder's only care;
24. Whose rugged walls may still for years demand
25. The final polish of the Plasterer's hand.
26. --This Dwelling's Inmate more than three weeks space
27. And oft a Prisoner in the cheerless place,
28. I--of whose touch the fiddle would complain,
29. Whose breath would labour at the flute in vain,
30. In music all unversed, nor blessed with skill
31. A bridge to copy, or to paint a mill,
32. Tired of my books, a scanty company!
33. And tired of listening to the boisterous sea--
34. Pace between door and window muttering rhyme,
35. An old resource to cheat a froward time!
36. Though these dull hours (mine is it, or their shame?)
37. Would tempt me to renounce that humble aim.
38. --But if there be a Muse who, free to take
39. Her seat upon Olympus, doth forsake
40. Those heights (like Phoebus when his golden locks
41. He veiled, attendant on Thessalian flocks)
42. And, in disguise, a Milkmaid with her pail
43. Trips down the pathways of some winding dale;
44. Or, like a Mermaid, warbles on the shores
45. To fishers mending nets beside their doors;
46. Or, Pilgrim-like, on forest moss reclined,
47. Gives plaintive ditties to the heedless wind,
48. Or listens to its play among the boughs
49. Above her head and so forgets her vows--
50. If such a Visitant of Earth there be
51. And she would deign this day to smile on me
52. And aid my verse, content with local bounds
53. Of natural beauty and life's daily rounds,
54. Thoughts, chances, sights, or doings, which we tell
55. Without reserve to those whom we love well--
56. Then haply, Beaumont! words in current clear
57. Will flow, and on a welcome page appear
58. Duly before thy sight, unless they perish here.
59. What shall I treat of? News from Mona's Isle?
60. Such have we, but unvaried in its style;
61. No tales of Runagates fresh landed, whence
62. And wherefore fugitive or on what pretence;
63. Of feasts, or scandal, eddying like the wind
64. Most restlessly alive when most confined.
65. Ask not of me, whose tongue can best appease
66. The mighty tumults of the HOUSE OF KEYS;
67. The last year's cup whose Ram or Heifer gained,
68. What slopes are planted, or what mosses drained:
69. An eye of fancy only can I cast
70. On that proud pageant now at hand or past,
71. When full five hundred boats in trim array,
72. With nets and sails outspread and streamers gay,
73. And chanted hymns and stiller voice of prayer,
74. For the old Manx-harvest to the Deep repair,
75. Soon as the herring-shoals at distance shine
76. Like beds of moonlight shifting on the brine.
77. Mona from our Abode is daily seen,
78. But with a wilderness of waves between;
79. And by conjecture only can we speak
80. Of aught transacted there in bay or creek;
81. No tidings reach us thence from town or field,
82. Only faint news her mountain sunbeams yield,
83. And some we gather from the misty air,
84. And some the hovering clouds, our telegraph, declare.
85. But these poetic mysteries I withhold;
86. For Fancy hath her fits both hot and cold,
87. And should the colder fit with You be on
88. When You might read, my credit would be gone.
89. Let more substantial themes the pen engage,
90. And nearer interests culled from the opening stage
91. Of our migration.--Ere the welcome dawn
92. Had from the east her silver star withdrawn,
93. The Wain stood ready, at our Cottage-door,
94. Thoughtfully freighted with a various store;
95. And long or ere the uprising of the Sun
96. O'er dew-damped dust our journey was begun,
97. A needful journey, under favouring skies,
98. Through peopled Vales; yet something in the guise
99. Of those old Patriarchs when from well to well
100. They roamed through Wastes where now the tented Arabs
101. dwell.
102. Say first, to whom did we the charge confide,
103. Who promptly undertook the Wain to guide
104. Up many a sharply-twining road and down,
105. And over many a wide hill's craggy crown,
106. Through the quick turns of many a hollow nook,
107. And the rough bed of many an unbridged brook?
108. A blooming Lass--who in her better hand
109. Bore a light switch, her sceptre of command
110. When, yet a slender Girl, she often led,
111. Skilful and bold, the horse and burthened sled
112. From the peat-yielding Moss on Gowdar's head.
113. What could go wrong with such a Charioteer
114. For goods and chattels, or those Infants dear,
115. A Pair who smilingly sate side by side,
116. Our hope confirming that the salt-sea tide
117. Whose free embraces we were bound to seek,
118. Would their lost strength restore and freshen the pale cheek?
119. Such hope did either Parent entertain
120. Pacing behind along the silent lane.
121. Blithe hopes and happy musings soon took flight,
122. For lo! an uncouth melancholy sight--
123. On a green bank a creature stood forlorn
124. Just half protruded to the light of morn,
125. Its hinder part concealed by hedge-row thorn
126. The Figure called to mind a beast of prey
127. Stript of its frightful powers by slow decay,
128. And, though no longer upon rapine bent,
129. Dim memory keeping of its old intent.
130. We started, looked again with anxious eyes,
131. And in that griesly object recognise
132. The Curate's Dog--his long-tried friend, for they,
133. As well we knew, together had grown grey.
134. The Master died, his drooping servant's grief
135. Found at the Widow's feet some sad relief;
136. Yet still he lived in pining discontent,
137. Sadness which no indulgence could prevent;
138. Hence whole day wanderings, broken nightly sleeps
139. And lonesome watch that out of doors he keeps;
140. Not oftentimes, I trust, as we, poor brute!
141. Espied him on his legs sustained, blank, mute,
142. And of all visible motion destitute,
143. So that the very heaving of his breath
144. Seemed stopt, though by some other power than death.
145. Long as we gazed upon the form and face,
146. A mild domestic pity kept its place,
147. Unscared by thronging fancies of strange hue
148. That haunted us in spite of what we knew.
149. Even now I sometimes think of him as lost
150. In second-sight appearances, or crost
151. By spectral shapes of guilt, or to the ground,
152. On which he stood, by spells unnatural bound,
153. Like a gaunt shaggy Porter forced to wait
154. In days of old romance at Archimago's gate.
155. Advancing Summer, Nature's law fulfilled,
156. The choristers in every grove had stilled;
157. But we, we lacked not music of our own,
158. For lightsome Fanny had thus early thrown,
159. Mid the gay prattle of those infant tongues,
160. Some notes prelusive, from the round of songs
161. With which, more zealous than the liveliest bird
162. That in wild Arden's brakes was ever heard,
163. Her work and her work's partners she can cheer,
164. The whole day long, and all days of the year.
165. Thus gladdened from our own dear Vale we pass
166. And soon approach Diana's Looking-glass!
167. To Loughrigg-tarn, round clear and bright as heaven,
168. Such name Italian fancy would have given,
169. Ere on its banks the few grey cabins rose
170. That yet disturb not its concealed repose
171. More than the feeblest wind that idly blows.
172. Ah, Beaumont! when an opening in the road
173. Stopped me at once by charm of what it showed,
174. The encircling region vividly exprest
175. Within the mirror's depth, a world at rest--
176. Sky streaked with purple, grove and craggy bield,
177. And the smooth green of many a pendent field,
178. And, quieted and soothed, a torrent small,
179. A little daring would-be waterfall,
180. One chimney smoking and its azure wreath,
181. Associate all in the calm Pool beneath,
182. With here and there a faint imperfect gleam
183. Of water-lilies veiled in misty steam--
184. What wonder at this hour of stillness deep,
185. A shadowy link 'tween wakefulness and sleep,
186. When Nature's self, amid such blending, seems
187. To render visible her own soft dreams,
188. If, mixed with what appeared of rock, lawn, wood,
189. Fondly embosomed in the tranquil flood,
190. A glimpse I caught of that Abode, by Thee
191. Designed to rise in humble privacy,
192. A lowly Dwelling, here to be outspread,
193. Like a small Hamlet, with its bashful head
194. Half hid in native trees. Alas 'tis not,
195. Nor ever was; I sighed, and left the spot
196. Unconscious of its own untoward lot,
197. And thought in silence, with regret too keen,
198. Of unexperienced joys that might have been;
199. Of neighbourhood and intermingling arts,
200. And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts.
201. But time, irrevocable time, is flown.
202. And let us utter thanks for blessings sown
203. And reaped--what hath been, and what is, our own.
204. Not far we travelled ere a shout of glee,
205. Startling us all, dispersed my reverie;
206. Such shout as many a sportive echo meeting
207. Oft-times from Alpine 'chalets' sends a greeting.
208. Whence the blithe hail? behold a Peasant stand
209. On high, a kerchief waving in her hand!
210. Not unexpectant that by early day
211. Our little Band would thrid this mountain way,
212. Before her cottage on the bright hill side
213. She hath advanced with hope to be descried.
214. Right gladly answering signals we displayed,
215. Moving along a tract of morning shade,
216. And vocal wishes sent of like good will
217. To our kind Friend high on the sunny hill--
218. Luminous region, fair as if the prime
219. Were tempting all astir to look aloft or climb;
220. Only the centre of the shining cot
221. With door left open makes a gloomy spot,
222. Emblem of those dark corners sometimes found
223. Within the happiest breast on earthly ground.
224. Rich prospect left behind of stream and vale,
225. And mountain-tops, a barren ridge we scale;
226. Descend, and reach, in Yewdale's depths, a plain
227. With haycocks studded, striped with yellowing grain--
228. An area level as a Lake and spread
229. Under a rock too steep for man to tread,
230. Where sheltered from the north and bleak northwest
231. Aloft the Raven hangs a visible nest,
232. Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest.
233. Hot sunbeams fill the steaming vale; but hark,
234. At our approach, a jealous watch-dog's bark,
235. Noise that brings forth no liveried Page of state,
236. But the whole household, that our coming wait.
237. With Young and Old warm greetings we exchange,
238. And jocund smiles, and toward the lowly Grange
239. Press forward by the teasing dogs unscared.
240. Entering, we find the morning meal prepared:
241. So down we sit, though not till each had cast
242. Pleased looks around the delicate repast--
243. Rich cream, and snow-white eggs fresh from the nest,
244. With amber honey from the mountain's breast;
245. Strawberries from lane or woodland, offering wild
246. Of children's industry, in hillocks piled;
247. Cakes for the nonce, and butter fit to lie
248. Upon a lordly dish; frank hospitality
249. Where simple art with bounteous nature vied,
250. And cottage comfort shuned not seemly pride.
251. Kind Hostess! Handmaid also of the feast,
252. If thou be lovelier than the kindling East,
253. Words by thy presence unrestrained may speak
254. Of a perpetual dawn from brow and cheek
255. Instinct with light whose sweetest promise lies,
256. Never retiring, in thy large dark eyes,
257. Dark but to every gentle feeling true,
258. As if their lustre flowed from ether's purest blue.
259. Let me not ask what tears may have been wept
260. By those bright eyes, what weary vigils kept,
261. Beside that hearth what sighs may have been heaved
262. For wounds inflicted, nor what toil relieved
263. By fortitude and patience, and the grace
264. Of heaven in pity visiting the place.
265. Not unadvisedly those secret springs
266. I leave unsearched: enough that memory clings,
267. Here as elsewhere, to notices that make
268. Their own significance for hearts awake,
269. To rural incidents, whose genial powers
270. Filled with delight three summer morning hours.
271. More cold my pen report of grave or gay
272. That through our gipsy travel cheered the way;
273. But, bursting forth above the waves, the Sun
274. Laughs at my pains, and seems to say, 'Be done.'
275. Yet, Beaumont, thou wilt not, I trust, reprove
276. This humble offering made by Truth to Love,
277. Nor chide the Muse that stooped to break a spell
278. Which might have else been on me yet:--
279. FAREWELL.
