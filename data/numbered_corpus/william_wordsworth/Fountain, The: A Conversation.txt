1. We talked with open heart, and tongue
2. Affectionate and true,
3. A pair of friends, though I was young,
4. And Matthew seventy-two.

5. We lay beneath a spreading oak,
6. Beside a mossy seat;
7. And from the turf a fountain broke,
8. And gurgled at our feet.

9. "Now, Matthew!" said I, "let us match
10. This water's pleasant tune
11. With some old border-song, or catch
12. That suits a summer's noon;

13. "Or of the church-clock and the chimes
14. Sing here beneath the shade,
15. That half-mad thing of witty rhymes
16. Which you last April made!"

17. In silence Matthew lay, and eyed
18. The spring beneath the tree;
19. And thus the dear old Man replied,
20. The grey-haired man of glee:

21. "No check, no stay, this Streamlet fears;
22. How merrily it goes!
23. 'Twill murmur on a thousand years,
24. And flow as now it flows.

25. "And here, on this delightful day,
26. I cannot choose but think
27. How oft, a vigorous man, I lay
28. Beside this fountain's brink.

29. "My eyes are dim with childish tears,
30. My heart is idly stirred,
31. For the same sound is in my ears
32. Which in those days I heard.

33. "Thus fares it still in our decay:
34. And yet the wiser mind
35. Mourns less for what age takes away
36. Than what it leaves behind.

37. "The blackbird amid leafy trees,
38. The lark above the hill,
39. Let loose their carols when they please
40. Are quiet when they will.

41. "With Nature never do 'they' wage
42. A foolish strife; they see
43. A happy youth, and their old age
44. Is beautiful and free:

45. "But we are pressed by heavy laws;
46. And often, glad no more,
47. We wear a face of joy, because
48. We have been glad of yore.

49. "If there be one who need bemoan
50. His kindred laid in earth,
51. The household hearts that were his own;
52. It is the man of mirth.

53. "My days, my Friend, are almost gone,
54. My life has been approved,
55. And many love me; but by none
56. Am I enough beloved."

57. "Now both himself and me he wrongs,
58. The man who thus complains;
59. I live and sing my idle songs
60. Upon these happy plains;

61. "And, Matthew, for thy children dead
62. I'll be a son to thee!"
63. At this he grasped my hand, and said,
64. "Alas! that cannot be."

65. We rose up from the fountain-side;
66. And down the smooth descent
67. Of the green sheep-track did we glide;
68. And through the wood we went;

69. And, ere we came to Leonard's rock,
70. He sang those witty rhymes
71. About the crazy old church-clock,
72. And the bewildered chimes.
