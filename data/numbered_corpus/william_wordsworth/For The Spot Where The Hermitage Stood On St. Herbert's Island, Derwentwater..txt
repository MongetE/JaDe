1. If thou in the dear love of some one Friend
2. Hast been so happy that thou know'st what thoughts
3. Will sometimes in the happiness of love
4. Make the heart sink, then wilt thou reverence
5. This quiet spot; and, Stranger! not unmoved
6. Wilt thou behold this shapeless heap of stones,
7. The desolate ruins of St. Herbert's Cell.
8. Here stood his threshold; here was spread the roof
9. That sheltered him, a self-secluded Man,
10. After long exercise in social cares
11. And offices humane, intent to adore
12. The Deity, with undistracted mind,
13. And meditate on everlasting things,
14. In utter solitude.--But he had left
15. A Fellow-labourer, whom the good Man loved
16. As his own soul. And, when with eye upraised
17. To heaven he knelt before the crucifix,
18. While o'er the lake the cataract of Lodore
19. Pealed to his orisons, and when he paced
20. Along the beach of this small isle and thought
21. Of his Companion, he would pray that both
22. (Now that their earthly duties were fulfilled)
23. Might die in the same moment. Nor in vain
24. So prayed he:--as our chronicles report,
25. Though here the Hermit numbered his last day
26. Far from St. Cuthbert his beloved Friend,
27. Those holy Men both died in the same hour.
