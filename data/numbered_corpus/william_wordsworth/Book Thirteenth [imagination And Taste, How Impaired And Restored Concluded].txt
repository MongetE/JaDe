1. FROM Nature doth emotion come, and moods
2. Of calmness equally are Nature's gift:
3. This is her glory; these two attributes
4. Are sister horns that constitute her strength.
5. Hence Genius, born to thrive by interchange
6. Of peace and excitation, finds in her
7. His best and purest friend; from her receives
8. That energy by which he seeks the truth,
9. From her that happy stillness of the mind
10. Which fits him to receive it when unsought.

11. Such benefit the humblest intellects
12. Partake of, each in their degree; 'tis mine
13. To speak, what I myself have known and felt;
14. Smooth task! for words find easy way, inspired
15. By gratitude, and confidence in truth.
16. Long time in search of knowledge did I range
17. The field of human life, in heart and mind
18. Benighted; but, the dawn beginning now
19. To re-appear, 'twas proved that not in vain
20. I had been taught to reverence a Power
21. That is the visible quality and shape
22. And image of right reason; that matures
23. Her processes by steadfast laws; gives birth
24. To no impatient or fallacious hopes,
25. No heat of passion or excessive zeal,
26. No vain conceits; provokes to no quick turns
27. Of self-applauding intellect; but trains
28. To meekness, and exalts by humble faith;
29. Holds up before the mind intoxicate
30. With present objects, and the busy dance
31. Of things that pass away, a temperate show
32. Of objects that endure; and by this course
33. Disposes her, when over-fondly set
34. On throwing off incumbrances, to seek
35. In man, and in the frame of social life,
36. Whate'er there is desirable and good
37. Of kindred permanence, unchanged in form
38. And function, or, through strict vicissitude
39. Of life and death, revolving. Above all
40. Were re-established now those watchful thoughts
41. Which, seeing little worthy or sublime
42. In what the Historian's pen so much delights
43. To blazon--power and energy detached
44. From moral purpose--early tutored me
45. To look with feelings of fraternal love
46. Upon the unassuming things that hold
47. A silent station in this beauteous world.

48. Thus moderated, thus composed, I found
49. Once more in Man an object of delight,
50. Of pure imagination, and of love;
51. And, as the horizon of my mind enlarged,
52. Again I took the intellectual eye
53. For my instructor, studious more to see
54. Great truths, than touch and handle little ones.
55. Knowledge was given accordingly; my trust
56. Became more firm in feelings that had stood
57. The test of such a trial; clearer far
58. My sense of excellence--of right and wrong:
59. The promise of the present time retired
60. Into its true proportion; sanguine schemes,
61. Ambitious projects, pleased me less; I sought
62. For present good in life's familiar face,
63. And built thereon my hopes of good to come.

64. With settling judgments now of what would last
65. And what would disappear; prepared to find
66. Presumption, folly, madness, in the men
67. Who thrust themselves upon the passive world
68. As Rulers of the world; to see in these,
69. Even when the public welfare is their aim,
70. Plans without thought, or built on theories
71. Vague and unsound; and having brought the books
72. Of modern statists to their proper test,
73. Life, human life, with all its sacred claims
74. Of sex and age, and heaven-descended rights,
75. Mortal, or those beyond the reach of death;
76. And having thus discerned how dire a thing
77. Is worshipped in that idol proudly named
78. 'The Wealth of Nations,' 'where' alone that wealth
79. Is lodged, and how increased; and having gained
80. A more judicious knowledge of the worth
81. And dignity of individual man,
82. No composition of the brain, but man
83. Of whom we read, the man whom we behold
84. With our own eyes--I could not but inquire--
85. Not with less interest than heretofore,
86. But greater, though in spirit more subdued--
87. Why is this glorious creature to be found
88. One only in ten thousand? What one is,
89. Why may not millions be? What bars are thrown
90. By Nature in the way of such a hope?
91. Our animal appetites and daily wants,
92. Are these obstructions insurmountable?
93. If not, then others vanish into air.
94. 'Inspect the basis of the social pile:
95. Inquire,' said I, 'how much of mental power
96. And genuine virtue they possess who live
97. By bodily toil, labour exceeding far
98. Their due proportion, under all the weight
99. Of that injustice which upon ourselves
100. Ourselves entail.' Such estimate to frame
101. I chiefly looked (what need to look beyond?)
102. Among the natural abodes of men,
103. Fields with their rural works; recalled to mind
104. My earliest notices; with these compared
105. The observations made in later youth,
106. And to that day continued.--For, the time
107. Had never been when throes of mighty Nations
108. And the world's tumult unto me could yield,
109. How far soe'er transported and possessed,
110. Full measure of content; but still I craved
111. An intermingling of distinct regards
112. And truths of individual sympathy
113. Nearer ourselves. Such often might be gleaned
114. From the great City, else it must have proved
115. To me a heart-depressing wilderness;
116. But much was wanting: therefore did I turn
117. To you, ye pathways, and ye lonely roads;
118. Sought you enriched with everything I prized,
119. With human kindnesses and simple joys.

120. Oh! next to one dear state of bliss, vouchsafed,
121. Alas! to few in this untoward world,
122. The bliss of walking daily in life's prime
123. Through field or forest with the maid we love,
124. While yet our hearts are young, while yet we breathe
125. Nothing but happiness, in some lone nook,
126. Deep vale, or anywhere, the home of both,
127. From which it would be misery to stir:
128. Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth,
129. In my esteem, next to such dear delight,
130. Was that of wandering on from day to day
131. Where I could meditate in peace, and cull
132. Knowledge that step by step might lead me on
133. To wisdom; or, as lightsome as a bird
134. Wafted upon the wind from distant lands,
135. Sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves,
136. Which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn:
137. And, when that pleasant toil had ceased to please,
138. Converse with men, where if we meet a face
139. We almost meet a friend, on naked heaths
140. With long long ways before, by cottage bench,
141. Or well-spring where the weary traveller rests.

142. Who doth not love to follow with his eye
143. The windings of a public way? the sight,
144. Familiar object as it is, hath wrought
145. On my imagination since the morn
146. Of childhood, when a disappearing line,
147. One daily present to my eyes, that crossed
148. The naked summit of a far-off hill
149. Beyond the limits that my feet had trod,
150. Was like an invitation into space
151. Boundless, or guide into eternity.
152. Yes, something of the grandeur which invests
153. The mariner, who sails the roaring sea
154. Through storm and darkness, early in my mind
155. Surrounded, too, the wanderers of the earth;
156. Grandeur as much, and loveliness far more.
157. Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites;
158. From many other uncouth vagrants (passed
159. In fear) have walked with quicker step; but why
160. Take note of this? When I began to enquire,
161. To watch and question those I met, and speak
162. Without reserve to them, the lonely roads
163. Were open schools in which I daily read
164. With most delight the passions of mankind,
165. Whether by words, looks, sighs, or tears, revealed;
166. There saw into the depth of human souls,
167. Souls that appear to have no depth at all
168. To careless eyes. And--now convinced at heart
169. How little those formalities, to which
170. With overweening trust alone we give
171. The name of Education, have to do
172. With real feeling and just sense; how vain
173. A correspondence with the talking world
174. Proves to the most; and called to make good search
175. If man's estate, by doom of Nature yoked
176. With toil, be therefore yoked with ignorance;
177. If virtue be indeed so hard to rear,
178. And intellectual strength so rare a boon--
179. I prized such walks still more, for there I found
180. Hope to my hope, and to my pleasure peace
181. And steadiness, and healing and repose
182. To every angry passion. There I heard,
183. From mouths of men obscure and lowly, truths
184. Replete with honour; sounds in unison
185. With loftiest promises of good and fair.

186. There are who think that strong affection, love
187. Known by whatever name, is falsely deemed
188. A gift, to use a term which they would use,
189. Of vulgar nature; that its growth requires
190. Retirement, leisure, language purified
191. By manners studied and elaborate;
192. That whoso feels such passion in its strength
193. Must live within the very light and air
194. Of courteous usages refined by art.
195. True is it, where oppression worse than death
196. Salutes the being at his birth, where grace
197. Of culture hath been utterly unknown,
198. And poverty and labour in excess
199. From day to day pre-occupy the ground
200. Of the affections, and to Nature's self
201. Oppose a deeper nature; there, indeed,
202. Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with ease
203. Among the close and overcrowded haunts
204. Of cities, where the human heart is sick,
205. And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed.
206. --Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feel
207. How we mislead each other; above all,
208. How books mislead us, seeking their reward
209. From judgments of the wealthy Few, who see
210. By artificial lights; how they debase
211. The Many for the pleasure of those Few;
212. Effeminately level down the truth
213. To certain general notions, for the sake
214. Of being understood at once, or else
215. Through want of better knowledge in the heads
216. That framed them; flattering self-conceit with words,
217. That, while they most ambitiously set forth
218. Extrinsic differences, the outward marks
219. Whereby society has parted man
220. From man, neglect the universal heart.

221. Here, calling up to mind what then I saw,
222. A youthful traveller, and see daily now
223. In the familiar circuit of my home,
224. Here might I pause, and bend in reverence
225. To Nature, and the power of human minds,
226. To men as they are men within themselves.
227. How oft high service is performed within,
228. When all the external man is rude in show,--
229. Not like a temple rich with pomp and gold,
230. But a mere mountain chapel, that protects
231. Its simple worshippers from sun and shower.
232. Of these, said I, shall be my song; of these,
233. If future years mature me for the task,
234. Will I record the praises, making verse
235. Deal boldly with substantial things; in truth
236. And sanctity of passion, speak of these,
237. That justice may be done, obeisance paid
238. Where it is due: thus haply shall I teach,
239. Inspire; through unadulterated ears
240. Pour rapture, tenderness, and hope,--my theme
241. No other than the very heart of man,
242. As found among the best of those who live--
243. Not unexalted by religious faith,
244. Nor uninformed by books, good books, though few--
245. In Nature's presence: thence may I select
246. Sorrow, that is not sorrow, but delight;
247. And miserable love, that is not pain
248. To hear of, for the glory that redounds
249. Therefrom to human kind, and what we are.
250. Be mine to follow with no timid step
251. Where knowledge leads me: it shall be my pride
252. That I have dared to tread this holy ground,
253. Speaking no dream, but things oracular;
254. Matter not lightly to be heard by those
255. Who to the letter of the outward promise
256. Do read the invisible soul; by men adroit
257. In speech, and for communion with the world
258. Accomplished; minds whose faculties are then
259. Most active when they are most eloquent,
260. And elevated most when most admired.
261. Men may be found of other mould than these,
262. Who are their own upholders, to themselves
263. Encouragement, and energy, and will,
264. Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively words
265. As native passion dictates. Others, too,
266. There are among the walks of homely life
267. Still higher, men for contemplation framed,
268. Shy, and unpractised in the strife of phrase;
269. Meek men, whose very souls perhaps would sink
270. Beneath them, summoned to such intercourse:
271. Theirs is the language of the heavens, the power,
272. The thought, the image, and the silent joy:
273. Words are but under-agents in their souls;
274. When they are grasping with their greatest strength,
275. They do not breathe among them: this I speak
276. In gratitude to God, Who feeds our hearts
277. For His own service; knoweth, loveth us,
278. When we are unregarded by the world.

279. Also, about this time did I receive
280. Convictions still more strong than heretofore,
281. Not only that the inner frame is good,
282. And graciously composed, but that, no less,
283. Nature for all conditions wants not power
284. To consecrate, if we have eyes to see,
285. The outside of her creatures, and to breathe
286. Grandeur upon the very humblest face
287. Of human life. I felt that the array
288. Of act and circumstance, and visible form,
289. Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind
290. What passion makes them; that meanwhile the forms
291. Of Nature have a passion in themselves,
292. That intermingles with those works of man
293. To which she summons him; although the works
294. Be mean, have nothing lofty of their own;
295. And that the Genius of the Poet hence
296. May boldly take his way among mankind
297. Wherever Nature leads; that he hath stood
298. By Nature's side among the men of old,
299. And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend!
300. If thou partake the animating faith
301. That Poets, even as Prophets, each with each
302. Connected in a mighty scheme of truth,
303. Have each his own peculiar faculty,
304. Heaven's gift, a sense that fits him to perceive
305. Objects unseen before, thou wilt not blame
306. The humblest of this band who dares to hope
307. That unto him hath also been vouchsafed
308. An insight that in some sort he possesses,
309. A privilege whereby a work of his,
310. Proceeding from a source of untaught things,
311. Creative and enduring, may become
312. A power like one of Nature's. To a hope
313. Not less ambitious once among the wilds
314. Of Sarum's Plain, my youthful spirit was raised;
315. There, as I ranged at will the pastoral downs
316. Trackless and smooth, or paced the bare white roads
317. Lengthening in solitude their dreary line,
318. Time with his retinue of ages fled
319. Backwards, nor checked his flight until I saw
320. Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear;
321. Saw multitudes of men, and, here and there,
322. A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest,
323. With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold;
324. The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear
325. Shaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength,
326. Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty.
327. I called on Darkness--but before the word
328. Was uttered, midnight darkness seemed to take
329. All objects from my sight; and lo! again
330. The Desert visible by dismal flames;
331. It is the sacrificial altar, fed
332. With living men--how deep the groans! the voice
333. Of those that crowd the giant wicker thrills
334. The monumental hillocks, and the pomp
335. Is for both worlds, the living and the dead.
336. At other moments--(for through that wide waste
337. Three summer days I roamed) where'er the Plain
338. Was figured o'er with circles, lines, or mounds,
339. That yet survive, a work, as some divine,
340. Shaped by the Druids, so to represent
341. Their knowledge of the heavens, and image forth
342. The constellations--gently was I charmed
343. Into a waking dream, a reverie
344. That, with believing eyes, where'er I turned,
345. Beheld long-bearded teachers, with white wands
346. Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky,
347. Alternately, and plain below, while breath
348. Of music swayed their motions, and the waste
349. Rejoiced with them and me in those sweet sounds.

350. This for the past, and things that may be viewed
351. Or fancied in the obscurity of years
352. From monumental hints: and thou, O Friend!
353. Pleased with some unpremeditated strains
354. That served those wanderings to beguile, hast said
355. That then and there my mind had exercised
356. Upon the vulgar forms of present things,
357. The actual world of our familiar days,
358. Yet higher power; had caught from them a tone,
359. An image, and a character, by books
360. Not hitherto reflected. Call we this
361. A partial judgment--and yet why? for 'then'
362. We were as strangers; and I may not speak
363. Thus wrongfully of verse, however rude,
364. Which on thy young imagination, trained
365. In the great City, broke like light from far.
366. Moreover, each man's Mind is to herself
367. Witness and judge; and I remember well
368. That in life's every-day appearances
369. I seemed about this time to gain clear sight
370. Of a new world--a world, too, that was fit
371. To be transmitted, and to other eyes
372. Made visible; as ruled by those fixed laws
373. Whence spiritual dignity originates,
374. Which do both give it being and maintain
375. A balance, an ennobling interchange
376. Of action from without and from within;
377. The excellence, pure function, and best power
378. Both of the objects seen, and eye that sees.
