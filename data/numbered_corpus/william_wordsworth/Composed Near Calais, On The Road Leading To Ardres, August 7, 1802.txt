1. JONES! as from Calais southward you and I
2. Went pacing side by side, this public Way
3. Streamed with the pomp of a too-credulous day,
4. When faith was pledged to new-born Liberty:
5. A homeless sound of joy was in the sky:
6. From hour to hour the antiquated Earth
7. Beat like the heart of Man: songs, garlands, mirth,
8. Banners, and happy faces, far and nigh!
9. And now, sole register that these things were,
10. Two solitary greetings have I heard,
11. 'Good-morrow, Citizen!' a hollow word,
12. As if a dead man spake it! Yet despair
13. Touches me not, though pensive as a bird
14. Whose vernal coverts winter hath laid bare.
