1. 'WEAK is the will of Man, his judgment blind;
2. 'Remembrance persecutes, and Hope betrays;
3. 'Heavy is woe;--and joy, for human-kind,
4. 'A mournful thing, so transient is the blaze!'
5. Thus might 'he' paint our lot of mortal days
6. Who wants the glorious faculty assigned
7. To elevate the more-than-reasoning Mind,
8. And colour life's dark cloud with orient rays.
9. Imagination is that sacred power,
10. Imagination lofty and refined;
11. 'Tis hers to pluck the amaranthine flower
12. Of Faith, and round the Sufferer's temples bind
13. Wreaths that endure affliction's heaviest shower,
14. And do not shrink from sorrow's keenest wind.
