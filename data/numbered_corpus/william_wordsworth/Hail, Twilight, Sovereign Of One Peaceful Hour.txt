1. HAIL Twilight, sovereign of one peaceful hour!
2. Not dull art Thou as undiscerning Night;
3. But studious only to remove from sight
4. Day's mutable distinctions.--Ancient Power!
5. Thus did the waters gleam, the mountains lower,
6. To the rude Briton, when, in wolf-skin vest
7. Here roving wild, he laid him down to rest
8. On the bare rock, or through a leafy bower
9. Looked ere his eyes were closed. By him was seen
10. The self-same Vision which we now behold;
11. At thy meek bidding, shadowy Power! brought forth
12. These mighty barriers, and the gulf between;
13. The flood, the stars,--a spectacle as old
14. As the beginning of the heavens and earth!
