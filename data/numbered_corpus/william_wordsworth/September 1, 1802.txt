1. WE had a female Passenger who came
2. From Calais with us, spotless in array,--
3. A white-robed Negro, like a lady gay,
4. Yet downcast as a woman fearing blame;
5. Meek, destitute, as seemed, of hope or aim
6. She sate, from notice turning not away,
7. But on all proffered intercourse did lay
8. A weight of languid speech, or to the same
9. No sign of answer made by word or face:
10. Yet still her eyes retained their tropic fire,
11. That, burning independent of the mind,
12. Joined with the lustre of her rich attire
13. To mock the Outcast.--O ye Heavens, be kind!
14. And feel, thou Earth, for this afflicted Race!
