1. AN Orpheus! an Orpheus! yes, Faith may grow bold,
2. And take to herself all the wonders of old;--
3. Near the stately Pantheon you'll meet with the same
4. In the street that from Oxford hath borrowed its name.

5. His station is there; and he works on the crowd,
6. He sways them with harmony merry and loud;
7. He fills with his power all their hearts to the brim--
8. Was aught ever heard like his fiddle and him?

9. What an eager assembly! what an empire is this!
10. The weary have life, and the hungry have bliss;
11. The mourner is cheered, and the anxious have rest;
12. And the guilt-burthened soul is no longer opprest.

13. As the Moon brightens round her the clouds of the night,
14. So He, where he stands, is a centre of light;
15. It gleams on the face, there, of dusky-browed Jack,
16. And the pale-visaged Baker's, with basket on back.

17. That errand-bound 'Prentice was passing in haste--
18. What matter! he's caught--and his time runs to waste;
19. The Newsman is stopped, though he stops on the fret;
20. And the half-breathless Lamplighter--he's in the net!

21. The Porter sits down on the weight which he bore;
22. The Lass with her barrow wheels hither her store;--
23. If a thief could be here he might pilfer at ease;
24. She sees the Musician, 'tis all that she sees!

25. He stands, backed by the wall;--he abates not his din
26. His hat gives him vigour, with boons dropping in,
27. From the old and the young, from the poorest; and there!
28. The one-pennied Boy has his penny to spare.

29. O blest are the hearers, and proud be the hand
30. Of the pleasure it spreads through so thankful a band;
31. I am glad for him, blind as he is!--all the while
32. If they speak 'tis to praise, and they praise with a smile.

33. That tall Man, a giant in bulk and in height,
34. Not an inch of his body is free from delight;
35. Can he keep himself still, if he would? oh, not he!
36. The music stirs in him like wind through a tree.

37. Mark that Cripple who leans on his crutch; like a tower
38. That long has leaned forward, leans hour after hour!--
39. That Mother, whose spirit in fetters is bound,
40. While she dandles the Babe in her arms to the sound.

41. Now, coaches and chariots! roar on like a stream;
42. Here are twenty souls happy as souls in a dream:
43. They are deaf to your murmurs--they care not for you,
44. Nor what ye are flying, nor what ye pursue!
