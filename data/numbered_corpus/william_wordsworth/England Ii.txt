1. MILTON! thou shouldst be living at this hour:
2. England hath need of thee: she is a fen
3. Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,
4. Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,
5. Have forfeited their ancient English dower
6. Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;
7. O raise us up, return to us again,
8. And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power!
9. Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart;
10. Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:
11. Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,
12. So didst thou travel on life's common way,
13. In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart
14. The lowliest duties on herself did lay.
