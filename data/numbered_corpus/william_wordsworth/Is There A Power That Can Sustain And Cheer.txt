1. Is there a power that can sustain and cheer
2. The captive chieftain, by a tyrant's doom,
3. Forced to descend into his destined tomb--
4. A dungeon dark! where he must waste the year,
5. And lie cut off from all his heart holds dear;
6. What time his injured country is a stage
7. Whereon deliberate Valour and the rage
8. Of righteous Vengeance side by side appear,
9. Filling from morn to night the heroic scene
10. With deeds of hope and everlasting praise:--
11. Say can he think of this with mind serene
12. And silent fetters? Yes, if visions bright
13. Shine on his soul, reflected from the days
14. When he himself was tried in open light.
