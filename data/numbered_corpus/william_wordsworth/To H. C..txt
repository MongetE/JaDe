1. SIX YEARS OLD

2. O THOU! whose fancies from afar are brought;
3. Who of thy words dost make a mock apparel,
4. And fittest to unutterable thought
5. The breeze-like motion and the self-born carol;
6. Thou faery voyager! that dost float
7. In such clear water, that thy boat
8. May rather seem
9. To brood on air than on an earthly stream;
10. Suspended in a stream as clear as sky,
11. Where earth and heaven do make one imagery;
12. O blessed vision! happy child!
13. Thou art so exquisitely wild,
14. I think of thee with many fears
15. For what may be thy lot in future years.
16. I thought of times when Pain might be thy guest,
17. Lord of thy house and hospitality;
18. And Grief, uneasy lover! never rest
19. But when she sate within the touch of thee.
20. O too industrious folly!
21. O vain and causeless melancholy!
22. Nature will either end thee quite;
23. Or, lengthening out thy season of delight,
24. Preserve for thee, by individual right,
25. A young lamb's heart among the full-grown flocks.
26. What hast thou to do with sorrow,
27. Or the injuries of to-morrow?
28. Thou art a dew-drop, which the morn brings forth,
29. Ill fitted to sustain unkindly shocks,
30. Or to be trailed along the soiling earth;
31. A gem that glitters while it lives,
32. And no forewarning gives;
33. But, at the touch of wrong, without a strife
34. Slips in a moment out of life.
