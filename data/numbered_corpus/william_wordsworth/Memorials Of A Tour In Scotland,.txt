1. THOUGHTS SUGGESTED THE DAY FOLLOWING, ON THE BANKS OF NITH, NEAR THE POET'S RESIDENCE

2. TOO frail to keep the lofty vow
3. That must have followed when his brow
4. Was wreathed--'The Vision' tells us how--
5. With holly spray,
6. He faltered, drifted to and fro,
7. And passed away.

8. Well might such thoughts, dear Sister, throng
9. Our minds when, lingering all too long,
10. Over the grave of Burns we hung
11. In social grief--
12. Indulged as if it were a wrong
13. To seek relief.

14. But, leaving each unquiet theme
15. Where gentlest judgments may misdeem,
16. And prompt to welcome every gleam
17. Of good and fair,
18. Let us beside this limpid Stream
19. Breathe hopeful air.

20. Enough of sorrow, wreck, and blight;
21. Think rather of those moments bright
22. When to the consciousness of right
23. His course was true,
24. When Wisdom prospered in his sight
25. And virtue grew.

26. Yes, freely let our hearts expand,
27. Freely as in youth's season bland,
28. When side by side, his Book in hand,
29. We wont to stray,
30. Our pleasure varying at command
31. Of each sweet Lay.

32. How oft inspired must he have trod
33. These pathways, yon far-stretching road!
34. There lurks his home; in that Abode,
35. With mirth elate,
36. Or in his nobly-pensive mood,
37. The Rustic sate.

38. Proud thoughts that Image overawes,
39. Before it humbly let us pause,
40. And ask of Nature, from what cause
41. And by what rules
42. She trained her Burns to win applause
43. That shames the Schools.

44. Through busiest street and loneliest glen
45. Are felt the flashes of his pen;
46. He rules 'mid winter snows, and when
47. Bees fill their hives;
48. Deep in the general heart of men
49. His power survives.

50. What need of fields in some far clime
51. Where Heroes, Sages, Bards sublime,
52. And all that fetched the flowing rhyme
53. From genuine springs,
54. Shall dwell together till old Time
55. Folds up his wings?

56. Sweet Mercy! to the gates of Heaven
57. This Minstrel lead, his sins forgiven;
58. The rueful conflict, the heart riven
59. With vain endeavour,
60. And memory of Earth's bitter leaven,
61. Effaced for ever.

62. But why to Him confine the prayer,
63. When kindred thoughts and yearnings bear
64. On the frail heart the purest share
65. With all that live?--
66. The best of what we do and are,
67. Just God, forgive!
