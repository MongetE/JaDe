1. September, 1

2. And is this -Yarrow? -This the stream
3. Of which my fancy cherished
4. So faithfully, a waking dream,
5. An image that hath perished?
6. O that some minstrel's harp were near
7. To utter notes of gladness
8. And chase this silence from the air,
9. That fills my heart with sadness!

10. Yet why? -a silvery current flows
11. With uncontrolled meanderings;
12. Nor have these eyes by greener hills
13. Been soothed, in all my wanderings.
14. And, through her depths, Saint Mary's Lake
15. Is visibly delighted;
16. For not a feature of those hills
17. Is in the mirror slighted.

18. A blue sky bends o'er Yarrow Vale,
19. Save where that pearly whiteness
20. Is round the rising sun diffused,
21. A tender hazy brightness;
22. Mild dawn of promise! that excludes
23. All profitless dejection;
24. Though not unwilling here to admit
25. A pensive recollection.

26. Where was it that the famous Flower
27. Of Yarrow Vale lay bleeding?
28. His bed perchance was yon smooth mound
29. On which the herd is feeding:
30. And haply from this crystal pool,
31. Now peaceful as the morning,
32. The Water-wraith ascended thrice,
33. And gave his doleful warning.

34. Delicious is the Lay that sings
35. The haunts of happy lovers,
36. The path that leads them to the grove,
37. The leafy grove that covers:
38. And pity sanctifies the verse
39. That paints, by strength of sorrow,
40. The unconquerable strength of love;
41. Bear witness, rueful Yarrow!

42. But thou that didst appear so fair
43. To fond imagination,
44. Dost rival in the light of day
45. Her delicate creation:
46. Meek loveliness is round thee spread,
47. A softness still and holy:
48. The grace of forest charms decayed,
49. And pastoral melancholy.

50. That region left, the vale unfolds
51. Rich groves of lofty stature,
52. With Yarrow winding through the pomp
53. Of cultivated nature;
54. And rising from those lofty groves
55. Behold a ruin hoary,
56. The shattered front of Newark's Towers,
57. Renowned in Border story.

58. Fair scenes for childhood's opening bloom,
59. For sportive youth to stray in,
60. For manhood to enjoy his strength,
61. And age to wear away in!
62. Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss,
63. A covert for protection
64. Of tender thoughts, that nestle there -
65. The brood of chaste affection.

66. How sweeet on this autumnal day
67. The wild-wood fruits to gather,
68. And on my true-love's forehead plant
69. A crest of blooming heather!
70. And what if I enwreathed my own?
71. 'Twere no offence to reason;
72. The sober hills thus deck their brows
73. To meet the wintry season.

74. I see -but not by sight alone,
75. Loved Yarrow, have I won thee;
76. A ray of Fancy still survives -
77. Her sunshine plays upon thee!
78. Thy ever-youthful waters keep
79. A course of lively pleasure;
80. And gladsome notes my lips can breathe
81. Accordant to the measure.

82. The vapours linger round the heights,
83. They melt, and soon must vanish;
84. One hour is theirs, nor more is mine -
85. Sad thought! which I would banish,
86. But that I know, where'er I go,
87. Thy genuine image, Yarrow!
88. Will dwell with me -to heighten joy,
89. And cheer my mind in sorrow.
