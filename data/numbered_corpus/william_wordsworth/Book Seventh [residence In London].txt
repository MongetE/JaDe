1. SIX changeful years have vanished since I first
2. Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze
3. Which met me issuing from the City's walls)
4. A glad preamble to this Verse: I sang
5. Aloud, with fervour irresistible
6. Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,
7. From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side
8. To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth
9. (So willed the Muse) a less impetuous stream,
10. That flowed awhile with unabating strength,
11. Then stopped for years; not audible again
12. Before last primrose-time. Beloved Friend!
13. The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts
14. On thy departure to a foreign land
15. Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work.
16. Through the whole summer have I been at rest,
17. Partly from voluntary holiday,
18. And part through outward hindrance. But I heard,
19. After the hour of sunset yester-even,
20. Sitting within doors between light and dark,
21. A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near
22. My threshold,--minstrels from the distant woods
23. Sent in on Winter's service, to announce,
24. With preparation artful and benign,
25. That the rough lord had left the surly North
26. On his accustomed journey. The delight,
27. Due to this timely notice, unawares
28. Smote me, and, listening, I in whispers said,
29. 'Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be
30. Associates, and, unscared by blustering winds,
31. Will chant together.' Thereafter, as the shades
32. Of twilight deepened, going forth, I spied
33. A glow-worm underneath a dusky plume
34. Or canopy of yet unwithered fern,
35. Clear-shining, like a hermit's taper seen
36. Through a thick forest. Silence touched me here
37. No less than sound had done before; the child
38. Of Summer, lingering, shining, by herself,
39. The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills,
40. Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir
41. Of Winter that had warbled at my door,
42. And the whole year breathed tenderness and love.

43. The last night's genial feeling overflowed
44. Upon this morning, and my favourite grove,
45. Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft,
46. As if to make the strong wind visible,
47. Wakes in me agitations like its own,
48. A spirit friendly to the Poet's task,
49. Which we will now resume with lively hope,
50. Nor checked by aught of tamer argument
51. That lies before us, needful to be told.

52. Returned from that excursion, soon I bade
53. Farewell for ever to the sheltered seats
54. Of gowned students, quitted hall and bower,
55. And every comfort of that privileged ground,
56. Well pleased to pitch a vagrant tent among
57. The unfenced regions of society.

58. Yet, undetermined to what course of life
59. I should adhere, and seeming to possess
60. A little space of intermediate time
61. At full command, to London first I turned,
62. In no disturbance of excessive hope,
63. By personal ambition unenslaved,
64. Frugal as there was need, and, though self-willed,
65. From dangerous passions free. Three years had flown
66. Since I had felt in heart and soul the shock
67. Of the huge town's first presence, and had paced
68. Her endless streets, a transient visitant:
69. Now, fixed amid that concourse of mankind
70. Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly,
71. And life and labour seem but one, I filled
72. An idler's place; an idler well content
73. To have a house (what matter for a home?)
74. That owned him; living cheerfully abroad
75. With unchecked fancy ever on the stir,
76. And all my young affections out of doors.

77. There was a time when whatsoe'er is feigned
78. Of airy palaces, and gardens built
79. By Genii of romance; or hath in grave
80. Authentic history been set forth of Rome,
81. Alcairo, Babylon, or Persepolis;
82. Or given upon report by pilgrim friars,
83. Of golden cities ten months' journey deep
84. Among Tartarian wilds--fell short, far short,
85. Of what my fond simplicity believed
86. And thought of London--held me by a chain
87. Less strong of wonder and obscure delight.
88. Whether the bolt of childhood's Fancy shot
89. For me beyond its ordinary mark,
90. 'Twere vain to ask; but in our flock of boys
91. Was One, a cripple from his birth, whom chance
92. Summoned from school to London; fortunate
93. And envied traveller! When the Boy returned,
94. After short absence, curiously I scanned
95. His mien and person, nor was free, in sooth,
96. From disappointment, not to find some change
97. In look and air, from that new region brought,
98. As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;
99. And every word he uttered, on my ears
100. Fell flatter than a caged parrot's note,
101. That answers unexpectedly awry,
102. And mocks the prompter's listening. Marvellous things
103. Had vanity (quick Spirit that appears
104. Almost as deeply seated and as strong
105. In a Child's heart as fear itself) conceived
106. For my enjoyment. Would that I could now
107. Recall what then I pictured to myself,
108. Of mitred Prelates, Lords in ermine clad,
109. The King, and the King's Palace, and, not last,
110. Nor least, Heaven bless him! the renowned Lord Mayor.
111. Dreams not unlike to those which once begat
112. A change of purpose in young Whittington,
113. When he, a friendless and a drooping boy,
114. Sate on a stone, and heard the bells speak out
115. Articulate music. Above all, one thought
116. Baffled my understanding: how men lived
117. Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still
118. Strangers, not knowing each the other's name.

119. Oh, wondrous power of words, by simple faith
120. Licensed to take the meaning that we love!
121. Vauxhall and Ranelagh! I then had heard
122. Of your green groves, and wilderness of lamps
123. Dimming the stars, and fireworks magical,
124. And gorgeous ladies, under splendid domes,
125. Floating in dance, or warbling high in air
126. The songs of spirits! Nor had Fancy fed
127. With less delight upon that other class
128. Of marvels, broad-day wonders permanent:
129. The River proudly bridged; the dizzy top
130. And Whispering Gallery of St. Paul's; the tombs
131. Of Westminster; the Giants of Guildhall;
132. Bedlam, and those carved maniacs at the gates,
133. Perpetually recumbent; Statues--man,
134. And the horse under him--in gilded pomp
135. Adorning flowery gardens, 'mid vast squares;
136. The Monument, and that Chamber of the Tower
137. Where England's sovereigns sit in long array,
138. Their steeds bestriding,--every mimic shape
139. Cased in the gleaming mail the monarch wore,
140. Whether for gorgeous tournament addressed,
141. Or life or death upon the battle-field.
142. Those bold imaginations in due time
143. Had vanished, leaving others in their stead:
144. And now I looked upon the living scene;
145. Familiarly perused it; oftentimes,
146. In spite of strongest disappointment, pleased
147. Through courteous self-submission, as a tax
148. Paid to the object by prescriptive right.

149. Rise up, thou monstrous ant-hill on the plain
150. Of a too busy world! Before me flow,
151. Thou endless stream of men and moving things!
152. Thy every-day appearance, as it strikes--
153. With wonder heightened, or sublimed by awe--
154. On strangers, of all ages; the quick dance
155. Of colours, lights, and forms; the deafening din;
156. The comers and the goers face to face,
157. Face after face; the string of dazzling wares,
158. Shop after shop, with symbols, blazoned names,
159. And all the tradesman's honours overhead:
160. Here, fronts of houses, like a title-page,
161. With letters huge inscribed from top to toe,
162. Stationed above the door, like guardian saints;
163. There, allegoric shapes, female or male,
164. Or physiognomies of real men,
165. Land-warriors, kings, or admirals of the sea,
166. Boyle, Shakspeare, Newton, or the attractive head
167. Of some quack-doctor, famous in his day.

168. Meanwhile the roar continues, till at length,
169. Escaped as from an enemy, we turn
170. Abruptly into some sequestered nook,
171. Still as a sheltered place when winds blow loud!
172. At leisure, thence, through tracts of thin resort,
173. And sights and sounds that come at intervals,
174. We take our way. A raree-show is here,
175. With children gathered round; another street
176. Presents a company of dancing dogs,
177. Or dromedary, with an antic pair
178. Of monkeys on his back; a minstrel band
179. Of Savoyards; or, single and alone,
180. An English ballad-singer. Private courts,
181. Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly lanes
182. Thrilled by some female vendor's scream, belike
183. The very shrillest of all London cries,
184. May then entangle our impatient steps;
185. Conducted through those labyrinths, unawares,
186. To privileged regions and inviolate,
187. Where from their airy lodges studious lawyers
188. Look out on waters, walks, and gardens green.

189. Thence back into the throng, until we reach,
190. Following the tide that slackens by degrees,
191. Some half-frequented scene, where wider streets
192. Bring straggling breezes of suburban air.
193. Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls;
194. Advertisements, of giant-size, from high
195. Press forward, in all colours, on the sight;
196. These, bold in conscious merit, lower down;
197. 'That', fronted with a most imposing word,
198. Is, peradventure, one in masquerade.
199. As on the broadening causeway we advance,
200. Behold, turned upwards, a face hard and strong
201. In lineaments, and red with over-toil.
202. 'Tis one encountered here and everywhere;
203. A travelling cripple, by the trunk cut short,
204. And stumping on his arms. In sailor's garb
205. Another lies at length, beside a range
206. Of well-formed characters, with chalk inscribed
207. Upon the smooth flint stones: the Nurse is here,
208. The Bachelor, that loves to sun himself,
209. The military Idler, and the Dame,
210. That field-ward takes her walk with decent steps.

211. Now homeward through the thickening hubbub, where
212. See, among less distinguishable shapes,
213. The begging scavenger, with hat in hand;
214. The Italian, as he thrids his way with care,
215. Steadying, far-seen, a frame of images
216. Upon his head; with basket at his breast
217. The Jew; the stately and slow-moving Turk,
218. With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm!

219. Enough;--the mighty concourse I surveyed
220. With no unthinking mind, well pleased to note
221. Among the crowd all specimens of man,
222. Through all the colours which the sun bestows,
223. And every character of form and face:
224. The Swede, the Russian; from the genial south,
225. The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from remote
226. America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors,
227. Malays, Lascars, the Tartar, the Chinese,
228. And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns.

229. At leisure, then, I viewed, from day to day,
230. The spectacles within doors,--birds and beasts
231. Of every nature, and strange plants convened
232. From every clime; and, next, those sights that ape
233. The absolute presence of reality,
234. Expressing, as in mirror, sea and land,
235. And what earth is, and what she has to show.
236. I do not here allude to subtlest craft,
237. By means refined attaining purest ends,
238. But imitations, fondly made in plain
239. Confession of man's weakness and his loves.
240. Whether the Painter, whose ambitious skill
241. Submits to nothing less than taking in
242. A whole horizon's circuit, do with power,
243. Like that of angels or commissioned spirits,
244. Fix us upon some lofty pinnacle,
245. Or in a ship on waters, with a world
246. Of life, and life-like mockery beneath,
247. Above, behind, far stretching and before;
248. Or more mechanic artist represent
249. By scale exact, in model, wood or clay,
250. From blended colours also borrowing help,
251. Some miniature of famous spots or things,--
252. St. Peter's Church; or, more aspiring aim,
253. In microscopic vision, Rome herself;
254. Or, haply, some choice rural haunt,--the Falls
255. Of Tivoli; and, high upon that steep,
256. The Sibyl's mouldering Temple! every tree,
257. Villa, or cottage, lurking among rocks
258. Throughout the landscape; tuft, stone scratch minute--
259. All that the traveller sees when he is there.

260. Add to these exhibitions, mute and still,
261. Others of wider scope, where living men,
262. Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes,
263. Diversified the allurement. Need I fear
264. To mention by its name, as in degree,
265. Lowest of these and humblest in attempt,
266. Yet richly graced with honours of her own,
267. Half-rural Sadler's Wells? Though at that time
268. Intolerant, as is the way of youth
269. Unless itself be pleased, here more than once
270. Taking my seat, I saw (nor blush to add,
271. With ample recompense) giants and dwarfs,
272. Clowns, conjurors, posture-masters, harlequins,
273. Amid the uproar of the rabblement,
274. Perform their feats. Nor was it mean delight
275. To watch crude Nature work in untaught minds;
276. To note the laws and progress of belief;
277. Though obstinate on this way, yet on that
278. How willingly we travel, and how far!
279. To have, for instance, brought upon the scene
280. The champion, Jack the Giant-killer: Lo!
281. He dons his coat of darkness; on the stage
282. Walks, and achieves his wonders, from the eye
283. Of living Mortal covert, 'as the moon
284. Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.'
285. Delusion bold! and how can it be wrought?
286. The garb he wears is black as death, the word
287. 'Invisible' flames forth upon his chest.

288. Here, too, were 'forms and pressures of the time,'
289. Rough, bold, as Grecian comedy displayed
290. When Art was young; dramas of living men,
291. And recent things yet warm with life; a sea-fight,
292. Shipwreck, or some domestic incident
293. Divulged by Truth and magnified by Fame;
294. Such as the daring brotherhood of late
295. Set forth, too serious theme for that light place--
296. I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawn
297. From our own ground,--the Maid of Buttermere,--
298. And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wife
299. Deserted and deceived, the Spoiler came
300. And wooed the artless daughter of the hills,
301. And wedded her, in cruel mockery
302. Of love and marriage bonds. These words to thee
303. Must needs bring back the moment when we first,
304. Ere the broad world rang with the maiden's name,
305. Beheld her serving at the cottage inn;
306. Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,
307. With admiration of her modest mien
308. And carriage, marked by unexampled grace.
309. We since that time not unfamiliarly
310. Have seen her,--her discretion have observed,
311. Her just opinions, delicate reserve,
312. Her patience, and humility of mind
313. Unspoiled by commendation and the excess
314. Of public notice--an offensive light
315. To a meek spirit suffering inwardly.

316. From this memorial tribute to my theme
317. I was returning, when, with sundry forms
318. Commingled--shapes which met me in the way
319. That we must tread--thy image rose again,
320. Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace
321. Upon the spot where she was born and reared;
322. Without contamination doth she live
323. In quietness, without anxiety:
324. Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earth
325. Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb
326. That, thither driven from some unsheltered place,
327. Rests underneath the little rock-like pile
328. When storms are raging. Happy are they both--
329. Mother and child!--These feelings, in themselves
330. Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think
331. On those ingenuous moments of our youth
332. Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes
333. And sorrows of the world. Those simple days
334. Are now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes,
335. Which yet survive in memory, appears
336. One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,
337. A sportive infant, who, for six months' space,
338. Not more, had been of age to deal about
339. Articulate prattle--Child as beautiful
340. As ever clung around a mother's neck,
341. Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.
342. There, too, conspicuous for stature tall
343. And large dark eyes, beside her infant stood
344. The mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused,
345. False tints too well accorded with the glare
346. From play-house lustres thrown without reserve
347. On every object near. The Boy had been
348. The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on
349. In whatsoever place, but seemed in this
350. A sort of alien scattered from the clouds.
351. Of lusty vigour, more than infantine
352. He was in limb, in cheek a summer rose
353. Just three parts blown--a cottage-child--if e'er,
354. By cottage-door on breezy mountain-side,
355. Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe
356. By Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board
357. Decked with refreshments had this child been placed
358. 'His' little stage in the vast theatre,
359. And there he sate, surrounded with a throng
360. Of chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men
361. And shameless women, treated and caressed;
362. Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,
363. While oaths and laughter and indecent speech
364. Were rife about him as the songs of birds
365. Contending after showers. The mother now
366. Is fading out of memory, but I see
367. The lovely Boy as I beheld him then
368. Among the wretched and the falsely gay,
369. Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged
370. Amid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells
371. Muttered on black and spiteful instigation
372. Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths.
373. Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer
374. Have been preferred, that this fair creature, checked
375. By special privilege of Nature's love,
376. Should in his childhood be detained for ever!
377. But with its universal freight the tide
378. Hath rolled along, and this bright innocent,
379. Mary! may now have lived till he could look
380. With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps,
381. Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed.

382. Four rapid years had scarcely then been told
383. Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,
384. I heard, and for the first time in my life,
385. The voice of woman utter blasphemy--
386. Saw woman as she is, to open shame
387. Abandoned, and the pride of public vice;
388. I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at once
389. Thrown in that from humanity divorced
390. Humanity, splitting the race of man
391. In twain, yet leaving the same outward form.
392. Distress of mind ensued upon the sight,
393. And ardent meditation. Later years
394. Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness,
395. Feelings of pure commiseration, grief
396. For the individual and the overthrow
397. Of her soul's beauty; farther I was then
398. But seldom led, or wished to go; in truth
399. The sorrow of the passion stopped me there.

400. But let me now, less moved, in order take
401. Our argument. Enough is said to show
402. How casual incidents of real life,
403. Observed where pastime only had been sought,
404. Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events
405. And measured passions of the stage, albeit
406. By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power.
407. Yet was the theatre my dear delight;
408. The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,
409. And all the mean upholstery of the place,
410. Wanted not animation, when the tide
411. Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast
412. With the ever-shifting figures of the scene,
413. Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dame
414. Advanced in radiance through a deep recess
415. Of thick entangled forest, like the moon
416. Opening the clouds; or sovereign king, announced
417. With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state
418. Of the world's greatness, winding round with train
419. Of courtiers, banners, and a length of guards;
420. Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling
421. His slender manacles; or romping girl
422. Bounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,
423. A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed up
424. In all the tatters of infirmity
425. All loosely put together, hobbled in,
426. Stumping upon a cane with which he smites,
427. From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them
428. Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout
429. Of one so overloaded with his years.
430. But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace,
431. The antics striving to outstrip each other,
432. Were all received, the least of them not lost,
433. With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night,
434. Between the show, and many-headed mass
435. Of the spectators, and each several nook
436. Filled with its fray or brawl, how eagerly
437. And with what flashes, as it were, the mind
438. Turned this way--that way! sportive and alert
439. And watchful, as a kitten when at play,
440. While winds are eddying round her, among straws
441. And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!
442. Romantic almost, looked at through a space,
443. How small, of intervening years! For then,
444. Though surely no mean progress had been made
445. In meditations holy and sublime,
446. Yet something of a girlish child-like gloss
447. Of novelty survived for scenes like these;
448. Enjoyment haply handed down from times
449. When at a country-playhouse, some rude barn
450. Tricked out for that proud use, if I perchance
451. Caught, on a summer evening through a chink
452. In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse
453. Of daylight, the bare thought of where I was
454. Gladdened me more than if I had been led
455. Into a dazzling cavern of romance,
456. Crowded with Genii busy among works
457. Not to be looked at by the common sun.

458. The matter that detains us now may seem,
459. To many, neither dignified enough
460. Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,
461. Who, looking inward, have observed the ties
462. That bind the perishable hours of life
463. Each to the other, and the curious props
464. By which the world of memory and thought
465. Exists and is sustained. More lofty themes,
466. Such as at least do wear a prouder face,
467. Solicit our regard; but when I think
468. Of these, I feel the imaginative power
469. Languish within me; even then it slept,
470. When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart
471. Was more than full; amid my sobs and tears
472. It slept, even in the pregnant season of youth.
473. For though I was most passionately moved
474. And yielded to all changes of the scene
475. With an obsequious promptness, yet the storm
476. Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;
477. Save when realities of act and mien,
478. The incarnation of the spirits that move
479. In harmony amid the Poet's world,
480. Rose to ideal grandeur, or, called forth
481. By power of contrast, made me recognise,
482. As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,
483. And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,
484. When, having closed the mighty Shakspeare's page,
485. I mused, and thought, and felt, in solitude.

486. Pass we from entertainments, that are such
487. Professedly, to others titled higher,
488. Yet, in the estimate of youth at least,
489. More near akin to those than names imply,--
490. I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts
491. Before the ermined judge, or that great stage
492. Where senators, tongue-favoured men, perform,
493. Admired and envied. Oh! the beating heart,
494. When one among the prime of these rose up,--
495. One, of whose name from childhood we had heard
496. Familiarly, a household term, like those,
497. The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of old,
498. Whom the fifth Harry talks of. Silence! hush!
499. This is no trifler, no short-flighted wit,
500. No stammerer of a minute, painfully
501. Delivered, No! the Orator hath yoked
502. The Hours, like young Aurora, to his car:
503. Thrice welcome Presence! how can patience e'er
504. Grow weary of attending on a track
505. That kindles with such glory! All are charmed,
506. Astonished; like a hero in romance,
507. He winds away his never-ending horn;
508. Words follow words, sense seems to follow sense:
509. What memory and what logic! till the strain
510. Transcendent, superhuman as it seemed,
511. Grows tedious even in a young man's ear.

512. Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced
513. By specious wonders, and too slow to tell
514. Of what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,
515. Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides,
516. And wise men, willing to grow wiser, caught,
517. Rapt auditors! from thy most eloquent tongue--
518. Now mute, for ever mute in the cold grave.
519. I see him,--old, but vigorous in age,--
520. Stand like an oak whose stag-horn branches start
521. Out of its leafy brow, the more to awe
522. The younger brethren of the grove. But some--
523. While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth,
524. Against all systems built on abstract rights,
525. Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims
526. Of Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;
527. Declares the vital power of social ties
528. Endeared by Custom; and with high disdain,
529. Exploding upstart Theory, insists
530. Upon the allegiance to which men are born--
531. Some--say at once a froward multitude--
532. Murmur (for truth is hated, where not loved)
533. As the winds fret within the Aeolian cave,
534. Galled by their monarch's chain. The times were big
535. With ominous change, which, night by night, provoked
536. Keen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;
537. But memorable moments intervened,
538. When Wisdom, like the Goddess from Jove's brain,
539. Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,
540. Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one
541. In ancient story versed, whose breast had heaved
542. Under the weight of classic eloquence,
543. Sit, see, and hear, unthankful, uninspired?

544. Nor did the Pulpit's oratory fail
545. To achieve its higher triumph. Not unfelt
546. Were its admonishments, nor lightly heard
547. The awful truths delivered thence by tongues
548. Endowed with various power to search the soul;
549. Yet ostentation, domineering, oft
550. Poured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!--
551. There have I seen a comely bachelor,
552. Fresh from a toilette of two hours, ascend
553. His rostrum, with seraphic glance look up,
554. And, in a tone elaborately low
555. Beginning, lead his voice through many a maze
556. A minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,
557. From time to time, into an orifice
558. Most delicate, a lurking eyelet, small,
559. And only not invisible, again
560. Open it out, diffusing thence a smile
561. Of rapt irradiation, exquisite.
562. Meanwhile the Evangelists, Isaiah, Job,
563. Moses, and he who penned, the other day,
564. The Death of Abel, Shakspeare, and the Bard
565. Whose genius spangled o'er a gloomy theme
566. With fancies thick as his inspiring stars,
567. And Ossian (doubt not--'tis the naked truth)
568. Summoned from streamy Morven--each and all
569. Would, in their turns, lend ornaments and flowers
570. To entwine the crook of eloquence that helped
571. This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the plains,
572. To rule and guide his captivated flock.

573. I glance but at a few conspicuous marks,
574. Leaving a thousand others, that, in hall,
575. Court, theatre, conventicle, or shop,
576. In public room or private, park or street,
577. Each fondly reared on his own pedestal,
578. Looked out for admiration. Folly, vice,
579. Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,
580. And all the strife of singularity,
581. Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense--
582. Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,
583. There is no end. Such candidates for regard,
584. Although well pleased to be where they were found,
585. I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,
586. Nor made unto myself a secret boast
587. Of reading them with quick and curious eye;
588. But, as a common produce, things that are
589. To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them
590. Such willing note, as, on some errand bound
591. That asks not speed, a traveller might bestow
592. On sea-shells that bestrew the sandy beach,
593. Or daisies swarming through the fields of June.

594. But foolishness and madness in parade,
595. Though most at home in this their dear domain,
596. Are scattered everywhere, no rarities,
597. Even to the rudest novice of the Schools.
598. Me, rather, it employed, to note, and keep
599. In memory, those individual sights
600. Of courage, or integrity, or truth,
601. Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,
602. Appeared more touching. One will I select--
603. A Father--for he bore that sacred name;--
604. Him saw I, sitting in an open square,
605. Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,
606. Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fenced
607. A spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sate
608. This One Man, with a sickly babe outstretched
609. Upon his knee, whom he had thither brought
610. For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air.
611. Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,
612. He took no heed; but in his brawny arms
613. (The Artificer was to the elbow bare,
614. And from his work this moment had been stolen)
615. He held the child, and, bending over it,
616. As if he were afraid both of the sun
617. And of the air, which he had come to seek,
618. Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable.

619. As the black storm upon the mountain top
620. Sets off the sunbeam in the valley, so
621. That huge fermenting mass of human-kind
622. Serves as a solemn back-ground, or relief,
623. To single forms and objects, whence they draw,
624. For feeling and contemplative regard,
625. More than inherent liveliness and power.
626. How oft, amid those overflowing streets,
627. Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said
628. Unto myself, 'The face of every one
629. That passes by me is a mystery!'
630. Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed
631. By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,
632. Until the shapes before my eyes became
633. A second-sight procession, such as glides
634. Over still mountains, or appears in dreams;
635. And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyond
636. The reach of common indication, lost
637. Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten
638. Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)
639. Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,
640. Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest
641. Wearing a written paper, to explain
642. His story, whence he came, and who he was.
643. Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round
644. As with the might of waters; and apt type
645. This label seemed of the utmost we can know,
646. Both of ourselves and of the universe;
647. And, on the shape of that unmoving man,
648. His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,
649. As if admonished from another world.

650. Though reared upon the base of outward things,
651. Structures like these the excited spirit mainly
652. Builds for herself; scenes different there are,
653. Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,
654. Possession of the faculties,--the peace
655. That comes with night; the deep solemnity
656. Of nature's intermediate hours of rest,
657. When the great tide of human life stands still:
658. The business of the day to come, unborn,
659. Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;
660. The blended calmness of the heavens and earth,
661. Moonlight and stars, and empty streets, and sounds
662. Unfrequent as in deserts; at late hours
663. Of winter evenings, when unwholesome rains
664. Are falling hard, with people yet astir,
665. The feeble salutation from the voice
666. Of some unhappy woman, now and then
667. Heard as we pass, when no one looks about,
668. Nothing is listened to. But these, I fear,
669. Are falsely catalogued; things that are, are not,
670. As the mind answers to them, or the heart
671. Is prompt, or slow, to feel. What say you, then,
672. To times, when half the city shall break out
673. Full of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear?
674. To executions, to a street on fire,
675. Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From these sights
676. Take one,--that ancient festival, the Fair,
677. Holden where martyrs suffered in past time,
678. And named of St. Bartholomew; there, see
679. A work completed to our hands, that lays,
680. If any spectacle on earth can do,
681. The whole creative powers of man asleep!--
682. For once, the Muse's help will we implore,
683. And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings,
684. Above the press and danger of the crowd,
685. Upon some showman's platform. What a shock
686. For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din,
687. Barbarian and infernal,--a phantasma,
688. Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound!
689. Below, the open space, through every nook
690. Of the wide area, twinkles, is alive
691. With heads; the midway region, and above,
692. Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls,
693. Dumb proclamations of the Prodigies;
694. With chattering monkeys dangling from their poles,
695. And children whirling in their roundabouts;
696. With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes,
697. And crack the voice in rivalship, the crowd
698. Inviting; with buffoons against buffoons
699. Grimacing, writhing, screaming,--him who grinds
700. The hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves,
701. Rattles the salt-box, thumps the kettle-drum,
702. And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks,
703. The silver-collared Negro with his timbrel,
704. Equestrians, tumblers, women, girls, and boys,
705. Blue-breeched, pink-vested, with high-towering plumes.--
706. All moveables of wonder, from all parts,
707. Are here--Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,
708. The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig,
709. The Stone-eater, the man that swallows fire,
710. Giants, Ventriloquists, the Invisible Girl,
711. The Bust that speaks and moves its goggling eyes,
712. The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craft
713. Of modern Merlins, Wild Beasts, Puppet-shows,
714. All out-o'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,
715. All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts
716. Of man, his dulness, madness, and their feats
717. All jumbled up together, to compose
718. A Parliament of Monsters. Tents and Booths
719. Meanwhile, as if the whole were one vast mill,
720. Are vomiting, receiving on all sides,
721. Men, Women, three-years' Children, Babes in arms.

722. Oh, blank confusion! true epitome
723. Of what the mighty City is herself,
724. To thousands upon thousands of her sons,
725. Living amid the same perpetual whirl
726. Of trivial objects, melted and reduced
727. To one identity, by differences
728. That have no law, no meaning, and no end--
729. Oppression, under which even highest minds
730. Must labour, whence the strongest are not free.
731. But though the picture weary out the eye,
732. By nature an unmanageable sight,
733. It is not wholly so to him who looks
734. In steadiness, who hath among least things
735. An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts
736. As parts, but with a feeling of the whole.
737. This, of all acquisitions, first awaits
738. On sundry and most widely different modes
739. Of education, nor with least delight
740. On that through which I passed. Attention springs,
741. And comprehensiveness and memory flow,
742. From early converse with the works of God
743. Among all regions; chiefly where appear
744. Most obviously simplicity and power.
745. Think, how the everlasting streams and woods,
746. Stretched and still stretching far and wide, exalt
747. The roving Indian, on his desert sands:
748. What grandeur not unfelt, what pregnant show
749. Of beauty, meets the sun-burnt Arab's eye:
750. And, as the sea propels, from zone to zone,
751. Its currents; magnifies its shoals of life
752. Beyond all compass; spreads, and sends aloft
753. Armies of clouds,--even so, its powers and aspects
754. Shape for mankind, by principles as fixed,
755. The views and aspirations of the soul
756. To majesty. Like virtue have the forms
757. Perennial of the ancient hills; nor less
758. The changeful language of their countenances
759. Quickens the slumbering mind, and aids the thoughts,
760. However multitudinous, to move
761. With order and relation. This, if still,
762. As hitherto, in freedom I may speak,
763. Not violating any just restraint,
764. As may be hoped, of real modesty,--
765. This did I feel, in London's vast domain.
766. The Spirit of Nature was upon me there;
767. The soul of Beauty and enduring Life
768. Vouchsafed her inspiration, and diffused,
769. Through meagre lines and colours, and the press
770. Of self-destroying, transitory things,
771. Composure, and ennobling Harmony.
