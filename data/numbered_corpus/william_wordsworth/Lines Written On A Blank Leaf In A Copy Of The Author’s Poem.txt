1. Upon Hearing Of The Death Of The Late Vicar Of Kendal

2. TO public notice, with reluctance strong,
3. Did I deliver this unfinished Song;
4. Yet for one happy issue;--and I look
5. With self-congratulation on the Book
6. Which pious, learned, MURFITT saw and read;--
7. Upon my thoughts his saintly Spirit fed;
8. He conned the new-born Lay with grateful heart--
9. Foreboding not how soon he must depart;
10. Unweeting that to him the joy was given
11. Which good men take with them from earth to heaven.
