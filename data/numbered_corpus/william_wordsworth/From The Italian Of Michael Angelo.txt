1. YES! hope may with my strong desire keep pace,
2. And I be undeluded, unbetrayed;
3. For if of our affections none finds grace
4. In sight of Heaven, then, wherefore hath God made
5. The world which we inhabit? Better plea
6. Love cannot have, than that in loving thee
7. Glory to that eternal Peace is paid,
8. Who such divinity to thee imparts
9. As hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts.
10. His hope is treacherous only whose love dies
11. With beauty, which is varying every hour;
12. But, in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the power
13. Of outward change, there blooms a deathless flower,
14. That breathes on earth the air of paradise.
