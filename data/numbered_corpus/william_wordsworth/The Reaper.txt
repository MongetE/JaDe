1. Behold her, single in the field,
2. Yon solitary Highland Lass!
3. Reaping and singing by herself;
4. Stop here, or gently pass!
5. Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
6. And sings a melancholy strain;
7. O listen! for the vale profound
8. Is overflowing with the sound.

9. No nightingale did ever chaunt
10. More welcome notes to weary bands
11. Of travellers in some shady haunt,
12. Among Arabian sands:
13. A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
14. In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird
15. Breaking the silence of the seas
16. Among the farthest Hebrides.

17. Will no one tell me what she sings?
18. Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
19. For old, unhappy, far-off things,
20. And battles long ago:
21. Or is it some more humble lay,
22. Familiar matter of today?
23. Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
24. That has been, and may be again!

25. Whate'er the theme, the maiden sang
26. As if her song could have no ending;
27. I saw her singing at her work,
28. And o'er the sickle bending;
29. I listened, motionless and still;
30. And as I mounted up the hill
31. The music in my heart I bore,
32. Long after it was heard no more.
