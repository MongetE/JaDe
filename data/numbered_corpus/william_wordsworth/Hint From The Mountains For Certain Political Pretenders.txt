1. 'WHO but hails the sight with pleasure
2. When the wings of genius rise,
3. Their ability to measure
4. With great enterprise;
5. But in man was ne'er such daring
6. As yon Hawk exhibits, pairing
7. His brave spirit with the war in

9. 'Mark him, how his power he uses,
10. Lays it by, at will resumes!
11. Mark, ere for his haunt he chooses
12. Clouds and utter glooms!

30. Dry and withered, light and yellow;--
31. 'That' to be the tempest's fellow!
32. Wait--and you shall see how hollow
33. Its endeavouring!'
