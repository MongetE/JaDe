1. O'ER the wide earth, on mountain and on plain,
2. Dwells in the affections and the soul of man
3. A Godhead, like the universal PAN;
4. But more exalted, with a brighter train:
5. And shall his bounty be dispensed in vain,
6. Showered equally on city and on field,
7. And neither hope nor steadfast promise yield
8. In these usurping times of fear and pain?
9. Such doom awaits us. Nay, forbid it Heaven!
10. We know the arduous strife, the eternal laws
11. To which the triumph of all good is given,
12. High sacrifice, and labour without pause,
13. Even to the death:--else wherefore should the eye
14. Of man converse with immortality?
