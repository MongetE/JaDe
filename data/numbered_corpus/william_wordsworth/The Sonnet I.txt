1. NUNS fret not at their convent's narrow room,
2. And hermits are contented with their cells,
3. And students with their pensive citadels;
4. Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,
5. Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,
6. High as the highest peak of Furness fells,
7. Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:
8. In truth the prison unto which we doom
9. Ourselves no prison is: and hence for me,
10. In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound
11. Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground;
12. Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be)
13. Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,
14. Should find brief solace there, as I have found.
