1. Let other bards of angels sing,
2. Bright suns without a spot;
3. But thou art no such perfect thing:
4. Rejoice that thou art not!

5. Heed not tho' none should call thee fair;
6. So, Mary, let it be
7. If nought in loveliness compare
8. With what thou art to me.

9. True beauty dwells in deep retreats,
10. Whose veil is unremoved
11. Till heart with heart in concord beats,
12. And the lover is beloved.
