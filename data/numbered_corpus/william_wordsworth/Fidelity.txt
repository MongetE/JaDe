1. A BARKING sound the Shepherd hears,
2. A cry as of a dog or fox;
3. He halts--and searches with his eyes
4. Among the scattered rocks:
5. And now at distance can discern
6. A stirring in a brake of fern;
7. And instantly a dog is seen,
8. Glancing through that covert green.

9. The Dog is not of mountain breed;
10. Its motions, too, are wild and shy;
11. With something, as the Shepherd thinks,
12. Unusual in its cry:
13. Nor is there any one in sight
14. All round, in hollow or on height;
15. Nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear;
16. What is the creature doing here?

17. It was a cove, a huge recess,
18. That keeps, till June, December's snow;
19. A lofty precipice in front,
20. A silent tarn below!
21. Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,
22. Remote from public road or dwelling,
23. Pathway, or cultivated land;
24. From trace of human foot or hand.

25. There sometimes doth a leaping fish
26. Send through the tarn a lonely cheer;
27. The crags repeat the raven's croak,
28. In symphony austere;
29. Thither the rainbow comes--the cloud--
30. And mists that spread the flying shroud;
31. And sunbeams; and the sounding blast,
32. That, if it could, would hurry past;
33. But that enormous barrier holds it fast.

34. Not free from boding thoughts, a while
35. The Shepherd stood; then makes his way
36. O'er rocks and stones, following the Dog
37. As quickly as he may;
38. Nor far had gone before he found
39. A human skeleton on the ground;
40. The appalled Discoverer with a sigh
41. Looks round, to learn the history.

42. From those abrupt and perilous rocks
43. The Man had fallen, that place of fear!
44. At length upon the Shepherd's mind
45. It breaks, and all is clear:
46. He instantly recalled the name,
47. And who he was, and whence he came;
48. Remembered, too, the very day
49. On which the Traveller passed this way.

50. But hear a wonder, for whose sake
51. This lamentable tale I tell!
52. A lasting monument of words
53. This wonder merits well.
54. The Dog, which still was hovering nigh,
55. Repeating the same timid cry,
56. This Dog, had been through three months' space
57. A dweller in that savage place.

58. Yes, proof was plain that, since the day
59. When this ill-fated Traveller died,
60. The Dog had watched about the spot,
61. Or by his master's side:
62. How nourished here through such long time
63. He knows, who gave that love sublime;
64. And gave that strength of feeling, great
65. Above all human estimate!
