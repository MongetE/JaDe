1. BEAUMONT! it was thy wish that I should rear
2. A seemly Cottage in this sunny Dell,
3. On favoured ground, thy gift, where I might dwell
4. In neighbourhood with One to me most dear,
5. That undivided we from year to year
6. Might work in our high Calling-a bright hope
7. To which our fancies, mingling, gave free scope
8. Till checked by some necessities severe.
9. And should these slacken, honoured BEAUMONT! still
10. Even then we may perhaps in vain implore
11. Leave of our fate thy wishes to fulfil.
12. Whether this boon be granted us or not,
13. Old Skiddaw will look down upon the Spot
14. With pride, the Muses love it evermore.
