1. THE Voice of song from distant lands shall call
2. To that great King; shall hail the crowned Youth
3. Who, taking counsel of unbending Truth,
4. By one example hath set forth to all
5. How they with dignity may stand; or fall,
6. If fall they must. Now, whither doth it tend?
7. And what to him and his shall be the end?
8. That thought is one which neither can appal
9. Nor cheer him; for the illustrious Swede hath done
10. The thing which ought to be; is raised 'above'
11. All consequences: work he hath begun
12. Of fortitude, and piety, and love,
13. Which all his glorious ancestors approve:
14. The heroes bless him, him their rightful son.
