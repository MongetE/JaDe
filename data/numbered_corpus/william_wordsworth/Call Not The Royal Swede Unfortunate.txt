1. CALL not the royal Swede unfortunate,
2. Who never did to Fortune bend the knee;
3. Who slighted fear; rejected steadfastly
4. Temptation; and whose kingly name and state
5. Have 'perished by his choice, and not his fate!'
6. Hence lives He, to his inner self endeared;
7. And hence, wherever virtue is revered,
8. He sits a more exalted Potentate,
9. Throned in the hearts of men. Should Heaven ordain
10. That this great Servant of a righteous cause
11. Must still have sad or vexing thoughts to endure,
12. Yet may a sympathising spirit pause,
13. Admonished by these truths, and quench all pain
14. In thankful joy and gratulation pure.
