1. FOUNDED UPON A BELIEF PREVALENT AMONG THE PASTORAL VALES OF WESTMORELAND

2. SWIFTLY turn the murmuring wheel!
3. Night has brought the welcome hour,
4. When the weary fingers feel
5. Help, as if from faery power;
6. Dewy night o'ershades the ground;
7. Turn the swift wheel round and round!

8. Now, beneath the starry sky,
9. Couch the widely-scattered sheep;--
10. Ply the pleasant labour, ply!
11. For the spindle, while they sleep,
12. Runs with speed more smooth and fine,
13. Gathering up a trustier line.

14. Short-lived likings may be bred
15. By a glance from fickle eyes;
16. But true love is like the thread
17. Which the kindly wool supplies,
18. When the flocks are all at rest
19. Sleeping on the mountain's breast.
