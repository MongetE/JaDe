1. THOSE words were uttered as in pensive mood
2. We turned, departing from that solemn sight:
3. A contrast and reproach to gross delight,
4. And life's unspiritual pleasures daily wooed!
5. But now upon this thought I cannot brood;
6. It is unstable as a dream of night;
7. Nor will I praise a cloud, however bright,
8. Disparaging Man's gifts, and proper food.
9. Grove, isle, with every shape of sky-built dome,
10. Though clad in colours beautiful and pure,
11. Find in the heart of man no natural home:
12. The immortal Mind craves objects that endure:
13. These cleave to it; from these it cannot roam,
14. Nor they from it: their fellowship is secure.
