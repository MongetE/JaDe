1. OAK of Guernica! Tree of holier power
2. Than that which in Dodona did enshrine
3. (So faith too fondly deemed) a voice divine
4. Heard from the depths of its aerial bower--
5. How canst thou flourish at this blighting hour?
6. What hope, what joy can sunshine bring to thee,
7. Or the soft breezes from the Atlantic sea,
8. The dews of morn, or April's tender shower?
9. Stroke merciful and welcome would that be
10. Which should extend thy branches on the ground,
11. If never more within their shady round
12. Those lofty-minded Lawgivers shall meet,
13. Peasant and lord, in their appointed seat,
14. Guardians of Biscay's ancient liberty.
