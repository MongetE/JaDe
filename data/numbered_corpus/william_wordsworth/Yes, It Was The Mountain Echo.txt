1. YES, it was the mountain Echo,
2. Solitary, clear, profound,
3. Answering to the shouting Cuckoo,
4. Giving to her sound for sound!

5. Unsolicited reply
6. To a babbling wanderer sent;
7. Like her ordinary cry,
8. Like--but oh, how different!

9. Hears not also mortal Life?
10. Hear not we, unthinking Creatures!
11. Slaves of folly, love, or strife--
12. Voices of two different natures?

13. Have not 'we' too?--yes, we have
14. Answers, and we know not whence;
15. Echoes from beyond the grave,
16. Recognised intelligence!

17. Such rebounds our inward ear
18. Catches sometimes from afar--
19. Listen, ponder, hold them dear;
20. For of God,--of God they are.
