1. AVAUNT all specious pliancy of mind
2. In men of low degree, all smooth pretence!
3. I better like a blunt indifference,
4. And self-respecting slowness, disinclined
5. To win me at first sight: and be there joined
6. Patience and temperance with this high reserve,
7. Honour that knows the path and will not swerve;
8. Affections, which, if put to proof, are kind;
9. And piety towards God. Such men of old
10. Were England's native growth; and, throughout Spain
11. (Thanks to high God) forests of such remain:
12. Then for that Country let our hopes be bold;
13. For matched with these shall policy prove vain,
14. Her arts, her strength, her iron, and her gold.
