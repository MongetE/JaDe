1. Amid a fertile region green with wood
2. And fresh with rivers, well doth it become
3. The Ducal Owner, in his Palace-home
4. To naturalise this tawny Lion brood;
5. Children of Art, that claim strange brotherhood,
6. Couched in their Den, with those that roam at large
7. Over the burning wilderness, and charge
8. The wind with terror while they roar for food.
9. But
10. these
11. are satiate, and a stillness drear
12. Calls into life a more enduring fear;
13. Yet is the Prophet calm, nor would the cave
14. Daunt him - if his Companions, now bedrowsed
15. Yawning and listless, were by hunger roused:
16. Man placed him here, and God, he knows, can save.
