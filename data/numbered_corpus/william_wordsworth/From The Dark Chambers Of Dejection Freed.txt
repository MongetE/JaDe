1. FROM the dark chambers of dejection freed,
2. Spurning the unprofitable yoke of care,
3. Rise, GILLIES, rise; the gales of youth shall bear
4. Thy genius forward like a winged steed.
5. Though bold Bellerophon (so Jove decreed
6. In wrath) fell headlong from the fields of air,
7. Yet a rich guerdon waits on minds that dare,
8. If aught be in them of immortal seed,
9. And reason govern that audacious flight
10. Which heavenward they direct.--Then droop not thou,
11. Erroneously renewing a sad vow
12. In the low dell 'mid Roslin's faded grove:
13. A cheerful life is what the Muses love,
14. A soaring spirit is their prime delight.
