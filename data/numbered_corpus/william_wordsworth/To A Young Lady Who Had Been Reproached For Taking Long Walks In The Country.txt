1. DEAR Child of Nature, let them rail!
2. --There is a nest in a green dale,
3. A harbour and a hold;
4. Where thou, a Wife and Friend, shalt see
5. Thy own heart-stirring days, and be
6. A light to young and old.

7. There, healthy as a shepherd boy,
8. And treading among flowers of joy
9. Which at no season fade,
10. Thou, while thy babes around thee cling,
11. Shalt show us how divine a thing
12. A Woman may be made.

13. Thy thoughts and feelings shall not die,
14. Nor leave thee, when grey hairs are nigh,
15. A melancholy slave;
16. But an old age serene and bright,
17. And lovely as a Lapland night,
18. Shall lead thee to thy grave.
