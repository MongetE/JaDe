1. ALAS! what boots the long laborious quest
2. Of moral prudence, sought through good and ill;
3. Or pains abstruse-to elevate the will,
4. And lead us on to that transcendent rest
5. Where every passion shall the sway attest
6. Of Reason, seated on her sovereign hill;
7. What is it but a vain and curious skill,
8. If sapient Germany must lie deprest,
9. Beneath the brutal sword?-Her haughty Schools
10. Shall blush; and may not we with sorrow say-
11. A few strong instincts and a few plain rules,
12. Among the herdsmen of the Alps, have wrought
13. More for mankind at this unhappy day
14. Then all the pride of intellect and thought?
