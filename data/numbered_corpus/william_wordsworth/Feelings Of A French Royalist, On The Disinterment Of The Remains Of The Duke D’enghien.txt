1. DEAR Reliques! from a pit of vilest mould
2. Uprisen--to lodge among ancestral kings;
3. And to inflict shame's salutary stings
4. On the remorseless hearts of men grown old
5. In a blind worship; men perversely bold
6. Even to this hour,--yet, some shall now forsake
7. Their monstrous Idol if the dead e'er spake,
8. To warn the living; if truth were ever told
9. By aught redeemed out of the hollow grave:
10. O murdered Prince! meek, loyal, pious, brave!
11. The power of retribution once was given:
12. But 'tis a rueful thought that willow bands
13. So often tie the thunder-wielding hands
14. Of Justice sent to earth from highest Heaven!
