1. BRAVE Schill! by death delivered, take thy flight
2. From Prussia's timid region. Go, and rest
3. With heroes, 'mid the islands of the Blest,
4. Or in the fields of empyrean light.
5. A meteor wert thou crossing a dark night:
6. Yet shall thy name, conspicuous and sublime,
7. Stand in the spacious firmament of time,
8. Fixed as a star: such glory is thy right.
9. Alas! it may not be: for earthly fame
10. Is Fortune's frail dependant; yet there lives
11. A Judge, who, as man claims by merit, gives;
12. To whose all-pondering mind a noble aim,
13. Faithfully kept, is as a noble deed;
14. In whose pure sight all virtue doth succeed.
