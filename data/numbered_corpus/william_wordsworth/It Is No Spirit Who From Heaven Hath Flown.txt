1. IT is no Spirit who from heaven hath flown,
2. And is descending on his embassy;
3. Nor Traveller gone from earth the heavens to espy!
4. 'Tis Hesperus--there he stands with glittering crown,
5. First admonition that the sun is down!
6. For yet it is broad day-light: clouds pass by;
7. A few are near him still--and now the sky,
8. He hath it to himself--'tis all his own.
9. O most ambitious Star! an inquest wrought
10. Within me when I recognised thy light;
11. A moment I was startled at the sight:
12. And, while I gazed, there came to me a thought
13. That I might step beyond my natural race
14. As thou seem'st now to do; might one day trace
15. Some ground not mine; and, strong her strength above,
16. My Soul, an Apparition in the place,
17. Tread there with steps that no one shall reprove!
