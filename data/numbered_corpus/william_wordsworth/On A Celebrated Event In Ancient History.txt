1. A ROMAN Master stands on Grecian ground,
2. And to the people at the Isthmian Games
3. Assembled, He, by a herald's voice, proclaims
4. THE LIBERTY OF GREECE:--the words rebound
5. Until all voices in one voice are drowned;
6. Glad acclamation by which air was rent!
7. And birds, high-flying in the element,
8. Dropped to the earth, astonished at the sound!
9. Yet were the thoughtful grieved; and still that voice
10. Haunts, with sad echoes, musing Fancy's ear:
11. Ah! that a 'Conqueror's' words should be so dear:
12. Ah! that a 'boon' could shed such rapturous joys!
13. A gift of that which is not to be given
14. By all the blended powers of Earth and Heaven.
