1. A Conversation

2. We talked with open heart, and tongue
3. Affectionate and true,
4. A pair of friends, though I was young,
5. And Matthew seventy-two.

6. We lay beneath a spreading oak,
7. Beside a mossy seat;
8. And from the turf a fountain broke
9. And gurgled at our feet.

10. `Now, Matthew! ' said I, `let us match
11. This water's pleasant tune
12. With some old border-song, or catch
13. That suits a summer's noon;

14. `Or of the church-clock and the chimes
15. Sing here beneath the shade
16. That half-mad thing of witty rhymes
17. Which you last April made! '

18. In silence Matthew lay, and eyed
19. The spring beneath the tree;
20. And thus the dear old man replied,
21. The grey-haired man of glee:

22. `No check, no stay, this streamlet fears,
23. How merrily it goes!
24. 'Twill murmur on a thousand years
25. And flow as now it flows.

26. `And here, on this delightful day,
27. I cannot choose but think
28. How oft, a vigorous man, I lay
29. Beside this fountain's brink.

30. `My eyes are dim with childish tears,
31. My heart is idly stirred,
32. For the same sound is in my ears
33. Which in those days I heard.

34. `Thus fares it still in our decay:
35. And yet the wiser mind
36. Mourns less for what Age takes away,
37. Than what it leaves behind.

38. `The blackbird amid leafy trees,
39. The lark above the hill,
40. Let loose their carols when they please,
41. Are quiet when they will.

42. `With Nature never do they wage
43. A foolish strife; they see
44. A happy youth, and their old age
45. Is beautiful and free:

46. `But we are pressed by heavy laws;
47. And often, glad no more,
48. We wear a face of joy, because
49. We have been glad of yore.

50. `If there be one who need bemoan
51. His kindred laid in earth,
52. The household hearts that were his own, -
53. It is the man of mirth.

54. `My days, my friend, are almost gone,
55. My life has been approved,
56. And many love me; but by none
57. Am I enough beloved.'

58. `Now both himself and me he wrongs,
59. The man who thus complains!
60. I live and sing my idle songs
61. Upon these happy plains:

62. `And, Matthew, for thy children dead
63. I'll be a son to thee! '
64. At this he grasped my hand and said
65. `Alas! that cannot be.'

66. We rose up from the fountain-side;
67. And down the smooth descent
68. Of the green sheep-track did we glide;
69. And through the wood we went;

70. And ere we came to Leonard's Rock
71. He sang those witty rhymes
72. About the crazy old church-clock,
73. And the bewildered chimes.
