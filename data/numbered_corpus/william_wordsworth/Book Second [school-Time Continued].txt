1. THUS far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much
2. Unvisited, endeavoured to retrace
3. The simple ways in which my childhood walked;
4. Those chiefly that first led me to the love
5. Of rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet
6. Was in its birth, sustained as might befall
7. By nourishment that came unsought; for still
8. From week to week, from month to month, we lived
9. A round of tumult. Duly were our games
10. Prolonged in summer till the daylight failed:
11. No chair remained before the doors; the bench
12. And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep
13. The labourer, and the old man who had sate
14. A later lingerer; yet the revelry
15. Continued and the loud uproar: at last,
16. When all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars
17. Edged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,
18. Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.
19. Ah! is there one who ever has been young,
20. Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride
21. Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem?
22. One is there, though the wisest and the best
23. Of all mankind, who covets not at times
24. Union that cannot be;--who would not give
25. If so he might, to duty and to truth
26. The eagerness of infantine desire?
27. A tranquillising spirit presses now
28. On my corporeal frame, so wide appears
29. The vacancy between me and those days
30. Which yet have such self-presence in my mind,
31. That, musing on them, often do I seem
32. Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself
33. And of some other Being. A rude mass
34. Of native rock, left midway in the square
35. Of our small market village, was the goal
36. Or centre of these sports; and when, returned
37. After long absence, thither I repaired,
38. Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place
39. A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground
40. That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream,
41. And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know
42. That more than one of you will think with me
43. Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame
44. From whom the stone was named, who there had sate,
45. And watched her table with its huckster's wares
46. Assiduous, through the length of sixty years.

47. We ran a boisterous course; the year span round
48. With giddy motion. But the time approached
49. That brought with it a regular desire
50. For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms
51. Of Nature were collaterally attached
52. To every scheme of holiday delight
53. And every boyish sport, less grateful else
54. And languidly pursued.
55. When summer came,
56. Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,
57. To sweep along the plain of Windermere
58. With rival oars; and the selected bourne
59. Was now an Island musical with birds
60. That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle
61. Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown
62. With lilies of the valley like a field;
63. And now a third small Island, where survived
64. In solitude the ruins of a shrine
65. Once to Our Lady dedicate, and served
66. Daily with chaunted rites. In such a race
67. So ended, disappointment could be none,
68. Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:
69. We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,
70. Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,
71. And the vain-glory of superior skill,
72. Were tempered; thus was gradually produced
73. A quiet independence of the heart;
74. And to my Friend who knows me I may add,
75. Fearless of blame, that hence for future days
76. Ensued a diffidence and modesty,
77. And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,
78. The self-sufficing power of Solitude.

79. Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!
80. More than we wished we knew the blessing then
81. Of vigorous hunger--hence corporeal strength
82. Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude
83. A little weekly stipend, and we lived
84. Through three divisions of the quartered year
85. In penniless poverty. But now to school
86. From the half-yearly holidays returned,
87. We came with weightier purses, that sufficed
88. To furnish treats more costly than the Dame
89. Of the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.
90. Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,
91. Or in the woods, or by a river side
92. Or shady fountains, while among the leaves
93. Soft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun
94. Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.
95. Nor is my aim neglected if I tell
96. How sometimes, in the length of those half-years,
97. We from our funds drew largely;--proud to curb,
98. And eager to spur on, the galloping steed;
99. And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud
100. Supplied our want, we haply might employ
101. Sly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound
102. Were distant: some famed temple where of yore
103. The Druids worshipped, or the antique walls
104. Of that large abbey, where within the Vale
105. Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,
106. Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,
107. Belfry, and images, and living trees;
108. A holy scene!--Along the smooth green turf
109. Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace,
110. Left by the west wind sweeping overhead
111. From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers
112. In that sequestered valley may be seen,
113. Both silent and both motionless alike;
114. Such the deep shelter that is there, and such
115. The safeguard for repose and quietness.

116. Our steeds remounted and the summons given,
117. With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew
118. In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,
119. And the stone-abbot, and that single wren
120. Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave
121. Of the old church, that--though from recent showers
122. The earth was comfortless, and, touched by faint
123. Internal breezes, sobbings of the place
124. And respirations, from the roofless walls
125. The shuddering ivy dripped large drops--yet still
126. So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird
127. Sang to herself, that there I could have made
128. My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there
129. To hear such music. Through the walls we flew
130. And down the valley, and, a circuit made
131. In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth
132. We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,
133. And that still spirit shed from evening air!
134. Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt
135. Your presence, when with slackened step we breathed
136. Along the sides of the steep hills, or when
137. Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea
138. We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.

139. Midway on long Winander's eastern shore,
140. Within the crescent of pleasant bay,
141. A tavern stood; no homely-featured house,
142. Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,
143. But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset
144. With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within
145. Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine.
146. In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built
147. On the large island, had this dwelling been
148. More worthy of a poet's love, a hut,
149. Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.
150. But--though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed
151. The threshold, and large golden characters,
152. Spread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged
153. The old Lion and usurped his place, in slight
154. And mockery of the rustic painter's hand--
155. Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dear
156. With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay
157. Upon a slope surmounted by a plain
158. Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood
159. A grove, with gleams of water through the trees
160. And over the tree-tops; nor did we want
161. Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.
162. There, while through half an afternoon we played
163. On the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed
164. Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee
165. Made all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,
166. When in our pinnace we returned at leisure
167. Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach
168. Of some small island steered our course with one,
169. The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there,
170. And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute
171. Alone upon the rock--oh, then, the calm
172. And dead still water lay upon my mind
173. Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,
174. Never before so beautiful, sank down
175. Into my heart, and held me like a dream!
176. Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus
177. Daily the common range of visible things
178. Grew dear to me: already I began
179. To love the sun; a boy I loved the sun,
180. Not as I since have loved him, as a pledge
181. And surety of our earthly life, a light
182. Which we behold and feel we are alive;
183. Nor for his bounty to so many worlds--
184. But for this cause, that I had seen him lay
185. His beauty on the morning hills, had seen
186. The western mountain touch his setting orb,
187. In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess
188. Of happiness, my blood appeared to flow
189. For its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.
190. And, from like feelings, humble though intense,
191. To patriotic and domestic love
192. Analogous, the moon to me was dear;
193. For I could dream away my purposes,
194. Standing to gaze upon her while she hung
195. Midway between the hills, as if she knew
196. No other region, but belonged to thee,
197. Yea, appertained by a peculiar right
198. To thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale!

199. Those incidental charms which first attached
200. My heart to rural objects, day by day
201. Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell
202. How Nature, intervenient till this time
203. And secondary, now at length was sought
204. For her own sake. But who shall parcel out
205. His intellect by geometric rules,
206. Split like a province into round and square?
207. Who knows the individual hour in which
208. His habits were first sown, even as a seed?
209. Who that shall point as with a wand and say
210. 'This portion of the river of my mind
211. Came from yon fountain?' Thou, my Friend! art one
212. More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee
213. Science appears but what in truth she is,
214. Not as our glory and our absolute boast,
215. But as a succedaneum, and a prop
216. To our infirmity. No officious slave
217. Art thou of that false secondary power
218. By which we multiply distinctions, then
219. Deem that our puny boundaries are things
220. That we perceive, and not that we have made.
221. To thee, unblinded by these formal arts,
222. The unity of all hath been revealed,
223. And thou wilt doubt, with me less aptly skilled
224. Than many are to range the faculties
225. In scale and order, class the cabinet
226. Of their sensations, and in voluble phrase
227. Run through the history and birth of each
228. As of a single independent thing.
229. Hard task, vain hope, to analyse the mind,
230. If each most obvious and particular thought,
231. Not in a mystical and idle sense,
232. But in the words of Reason deeply weighed,
233. Hath no beginning.
234. Blest the infant Babe,
235. (For with my best conjecture I would trace
236. Our Being's earthly progress,) blest the Babe,
237. Nursed in his Mother's arms, who sinks to sleep
238. Rocked on his Mother's breast; who with his soul
239. Drinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye!
240. For him, in one dear Presence, there exists
241. A virtue which irradiates and exalts
242. Objects through widest intercourse of sense.
243. No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:
244. Along his infant veins are interfused
245. The gravitation and the filial bond
246. Of nature that connect him with the world.
247. Is there a flower, to which he points with hand
248. Too weak to gather it, already love
249. Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him
250. Hath beautified that flower; already shades
251. Of pity cast from inward tenderness
252. Do fall around him upon aught that bears
253. Unsightly marks of violence or harm.
254. Emphatically such a Being lives,
255. Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail,
256. An inmate of this active universe:
257. For, feeling has to him imparted power
258. That through the growing faculties of sense
259. Doth like an agent of the one great Mind
260. Create, creator and receiver both,
261. Working but in alliance with the works
262. Which it beholds.--Such, verily, is the first
263. Poetic spirit of our human life,
264. By uniform control of after years,
265. In most, abated or suppressed; in some,
266. Through every change of growth and of decay,
267. Pre-eminent till death.
268. From early days,
269. Beginning not long after that first time
270. In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch
271. I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart,
272. I have endeavoured to display the means
273. Whereby this infant sensibility,
274. Great birthright of our being, was in me
275. Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path
276. More difficult before me; and I fear
277. That in its broken windings we shall need
278. The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:
279. For now a trouble came into my mind
280. From unknown causes. I was left alone
281. Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.
282. The props of my affections were removed,
283. And yet the building stood, as if sustained
284. By its own spirit! All that I beheld
285. Was dear, and hence to finer influxes
286. The mind lay open to a more exact
287. And close communion. Many are our joys
288. In youth, but oh! what happiness to live
289. When every hour brings palpable access
290. Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,
291. And sorrow is not there! The seasons came,
292. And every season wheresoe'er I moved
293. Unfolded transitory qualities,
294. Which, but for this most watchful power of love,
295. Had been neglected; left a register
296. Of permanent relations, else unknown.
297. Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude
298. More active ever than 'best society'--
299. Society made sweet as solitude
300. By silent inobtrusive sympathies,
301. And gentle agitations of the mind
302. From manifold distinctions, difference
303. Perceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye,
304. No difference is, and hence, from the same source,
305. Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,
306. Under the quiet stars, and at that time
307. Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound
308. To breathe an elevated mood, by form
309. Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,
310. If the night blackened with a coming storm,
311. Beneath some rock, listening to notes that are
312. The ghostly language of the ancient earth,
313. Or make their dim abode in distant winds.
314. Thence did I drink the visionary power;
315. And deem not profitless those fleeting moods
316. Of shadowy exultation: not for this,
317. That they are kindred to our purer mind
318. And intellectual life; but that the soul,
319. Remembering how she felt, but what she felt
320. Remembering not, retains an obscure sense
321. Of possible sublimity, whereto
322. With growing faculties she doth aspire,
323. With faculties still growing, feeling still
324. That whatsoever point they gain, they yet
325. Have something to pursue.
326. And not alone,
327. 'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less 'mid fair
328. And tranquil scenes, that universal power
329. And fitness in the latent qualities
330. And essences of things, by which the mind
331. Is moved with feelings of delight, to me
332. Came strengthened with a superadded soul,
333. A virtue not its own. My morning walks
334. Were early;--oft before the hours of school
335. I travelled round our little lake, five miles
336. Of pleasant wandering. Happy time! more dear
337. For this, that one was by my side, a Friend,
338. Then passionately loved; with heart how full
339. Would he peruse these lines! For many years
340. Have since flowed in between us, and, our minds
341. Both silent to each other, at this time
342. We live as if those hours had never been.
343. Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch
344. Far earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen
345. From human dwelling, or the vernal thrush
346. Was audible; and sate among the woods
347. Alone upon some jutting eminence,
348. At the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,
349. Yet slumbering, lay in utter solitude.
350. How shall I seek the origin? where find
351. Faith in the marvellous things which then I felt?
352. Oft in these moments such a holy calm
353. Would overspread my soul, that bodily eyes
354. Were utterly forgotten, and what I saw
355. Appeared like something in myself, a dream,
356. A prospect in the mind.
357. 'Twere long to tell
358. What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,
359. And what the summer shade, what day and night,
360. Evening and morning, sleep and waking, thought
361. From sources inexhaustible, poured forth
362. To feed the spirit of religious love
363. In which I walked with Nature. But let this
364. Be not forgotten, that I still retained
365. My first creative sensibility;
366. That by the regular action of the world
367. My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power
368. Abode with me; a forming hand, at times
369. Rebellious, acting in a devious mood;
370. A local spirit of his own, at war
371. With general tendency, but, for the most,
372. Subservient strictly to external things
373. With which it communed. An auxiliar light
374. Came from my mind, which on the setting sun
375. Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds,
376. The fluttering breezes, fountains that run on
377. Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed
378. A like dominion, and the midnight storm
379. Grew darker in the presence of my eye:
380. Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence,
381. And hence my transport.
382. Nor should this, perchance,
383. Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved
384. The exercise and produce of a toil,
385. Than analytic industry to me
386. More pleasing, and whose character I deem
387. Is more poetic as resembling more
388. Creative agency. The song would speak
389. Of that interminable building reared
390. By observation of affinities
391. In objects where no brotherhood exists
392. To passive minds. My seventeenth year was come
393. And, whether from this habit rooted now
394. So deeply in my mind, or from excess
395. In the great social principle of life
396. Coercing all things into sympathy,
397. To unorganic natures were transferred
398. My own enjoyments; or the power of truth
399. Coming in revelation, did converse
400. With things that really are; I, at this time,
401. Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.
402. Thus while the days flew by, and years passed on,
403. From Nature and her overflowing soul,
404. I had received so much, that all my thoughts
405. Were steeped in feeling; I was only then
406. Contented, when with bliss ineffable
407. I felt the sentiment of Being spread
408. O'er all that moves and all that seemeth still;
409. O'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought
410. And human knowledge, to the human eye
411. Invisible, yet liveth to the heart;
412. O'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings,
413. Or beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides
414. Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself,
415. And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not
416. If high the transport, great the joy I felt,
417. Communing in this sort through earth and heaven
418. With every form of creature, as it looked
419. Towards the Uncreated with a countenance
420. Of adoration, with an eye of love.
421. One song they sang, and it was audible,
422. Most audible, then, when the fleshly ear,
423. O'ercome by humblest prelude of that strain
424. Forgot her functions, and slept undisturbed.

425. If this be error, and another faith
426. Find easier access to the pious mind,
427. Yet were I grossly destitute of all
428. Those human sentiments that make this earth
429. So dear, if I should fail with grateful voice
430. To speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakes
431. And sounding cataracts, ye mists and winds
432. That dwell among the hills where I was born.
433. If in my youth I have been pure in heart,
434. If, mingling with the world, I am content
435. With my own modest pleasures, and have lived
436. With God and Nature communing, removed
437. From little enmities and low desires--
438. The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,
439. This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,
440. If, 'mid indifference and apathy,
441. And wicked exultation when good men
442. On every side fall off, we know not how,
443. To selfishness, disguised in gentle names
444. Of peace and quiet and domestic love
445. Yet mingled not unwillingly with sneers
446. On visionary minds; if, in this time
447. Of dereliction and dismay, I yet
448. Despair not of our nature, but retain
449. A more than Roman confidence, a faith
450. That fails not, in all sorrow my support,
451. The blessing of my life--the gift is yours,
452. Ye winds and sounding cataracts! 'tis yours,
453. Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed
454. My lofty speculations; and in thee,
455. For this uneasy heart of ours, I find
456. A never-failing principle of joy
457. And purest passion.
458. Thou, my Friend! wert reared
459. In the great city, 'mid far other scenes;
460. But we, by different roads, at length have gained
461. The selfsame bourne. And for this cause to thee
462. I speak, unapprehensive of contempt,
463. The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,
464. And all that silent language which so oft
465. In conversation between man and man
466. Blots from the human countenance all trace
467. Of beauty and of love. For thou hast sought
468. The truth in solitude, and, since the days
469. That gave thee liberty, full long desired,
470. To serve in Nature's temple, thou hast been
471. The most assiduous of her ministers;
472. In many things my brother, chiefly here
473. In this our deep devotion.
474. Fare thee well!
475. Health and the quiet of a healthful mind
476. Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,
477. And yet more often living with thyself,
478. And for thyself, so haply shall thy days
479. Be many, and a blessing to mankind.
