1. HOME AT GRASMERE

2. ONCE to the verge of yon steep barrier came
3. A roving school-boy; what the adventurer's age
4. Hath now escaped his memory--but the hour,
5. One of a golden summer holiday,
6. He well remembers, though the year be gone--
7. Alone and devious from afar he came;
8. And, with a sudden influx overpowered
9. At sight of this seclusion, he forgot
10. His haste, for hasty had his footsteps been
11. As boyish his pursuits; and sighing said,
12. 'What happy fortune were it here to live!
13. And, if a thought of dying, if a thought
14. Of mortal separation, could intrude
15. With paradise before him, here to die!'
16. No Prophet was he, had not even a hope,
17. Scarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought,
18. A fancy in the heart of what might be
19. The lot of others, never could be his.
20. The station whence he looked was soft and green,
21. Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth
22. Of vale below, a height of hills above.
23. For rest of body perfect was the spot,
24. All that luxurious nature could desire;
25. But stirring to the spirit; who could gaze
26. And not feel motions there? He thought of clouds
27. That sail on winds: of breezes that delight
28. To play on water, or in endless chase
29. Pursue each other through the yielding plain
30. Of grass or corn, over and through and through,
31. In billow after billow, evermore
32. Disporting--nor unmindful was the boy
33. Of sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds;
34. Of fluttering sylphs and softly-gliding Fays,
35. Genii, and winged angels that are Lords
36. Without restraint of all which they behold.
37. The illusion strengthening as he gazed, he felt
38. That such unfettered liberty was his,
39. Such power and joy; but only for this end,
40. To flit from field to rock, from rock to field,
41. From shore to island, and from isle to shore,
42. From open ground to covert, from a bed
43. Of meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood;
44. From high to low, from low to high, yet still
45. Within the bound of this huge concave; here
46. Must be his home, this valley be his world.
47. Since that day forth the Place to him--'to me'
48. (For I who live to register the truth
49. Was that same young and happy Being) became
50. As beautiful to thought, as it had been
51. When present, to the bodily sense; a haunt
52. Of pure affections, shedding upon joy
53. A brighter joy; and through such damp and gloom
54. Of the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youth
55. Mistakes for sorrow, darting beams of light
56. That no self-cherished sadness could withstand;
57. And now 'tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale,
58. Beloved Grasmere (let the wandering streams
59. Take up, the cloud-capt hills repeat, the Name)
60. One of thy lowly Dwellings is my Home.
61. And was the cost so great? and could it seem
62. An act of courage, and the thing itself
63. A conquest? who must bear the blame? Sage man
64. Thy prudence, thy experience, thy desires,
65. Thy apprehensions--blush thou for them all.
66. Yes the realities of life so cold,
67. So cowardly, so ready to betray,
68. So stinted in the measure of their grace
69. As we pronounce them, doing them much wrong,
70. Have been to me more bountiful than hope,
71. Less timid than desire--but that is past.
72. On Nature's invitation do I come,
73. By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead,
74. That made the calmest fairest spot of earth
75. With all its unappropriated good
76. My own; and not mine only, for with me
77. Entrenched, say rather peacefully embowered,
78. Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot,
79. A younger Orphan of a home extinct,
80. The only Daughter of my Parents dwells.
81. Ay, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir,
82. Pause upon that and let the breathing frame
83. No longer breathe, but all be satisfied.
84. --Oh, if such silence be not thanks to God
85. For what hath been bestowed, then where, where then
86. Shall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne'er
87. Fix on a lovely object, nor my mind
88. Take pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,
89. But either She whom now I have, who now
90. Divides with me this loved abode, was there,
91. Or not far off. Where'er my footsteps turned,
92. Her voice was like a hidden Bird that sang,
93. The thought of her was like a flash of light,
94. Or an unseen companionship, a breath
95. Of fragrance independent of the Wind.
96. In all my goings, in the new and old
97. Of all my meditations, and in this
98. Favourite of all, in this the most of all.
99. --What being, therefore, since the birth of Man
100. Had ever more abundant cause to speak
101. Thanks, and if favours of the Heavenly Muse
102. Make him more thankful, then to call on Verse
103. To aid him and in song resound his joy?
104. The boon is absolute; surpassing grace
105. To me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowers
106. Of blissful Eden this was neither given
107. Nor could be given, possession of the good
108. Which had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled,
109. And dear Imaginations realised,
110. Up to their highest measure, yea and more.
111. Embrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in;
112. Now in the clear and open day I feel
113. Your guardianship; I take it to my heart;
114. 'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night.
115. But I would call thee beautiful, for mild,
116. And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou art
117. Dear Valley, having in thy face a smile
118. Though peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased,
119. Pleased with thy crags and woody steeps, thy Lake,
120. Its one green island and its winding shores;
121. The multitude of little rocky hills,
122. Thy Church and cottages of mountain stone
123. Clustered like stars some few, but single most,
124. And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,
125. Or glancing at each other cheerful looks
126. Like separated stars with clouds between.
127. What want we? have we not perpetual streams,
128. Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields,
129. And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds,
130. And thickets full of songsters, and the voice
131. Of lordly birds, an unexpected sound
132. Heard now and then from morn to latest eve,
133. Admonishing the man who walks below
134. Of solitude and silence in the sky?
135. These have we, and a thousand nooks of earth
136. Have also these, but nowhere else is found,
137. Nowhere (or is it fancy?) can be found
138. The one sensation that is here; 'tis here,
139. Here as it found its way into my heart
140. In childhood, here as it abides by day,
141. By night, here only; or in chosen minds
142. That take it with them hence, where'er they go.
143. --'Tis, but I cannot name it, 'tis the sense
144. Of majesty, and beauty, and repose,
145. A blended holiness of earth and sky,
146. Something that makes this individual spot,
147. This small abiding-place of many men,
148. A termination, and a last retreat,
149. A centre, come from wheresoe'er you will,
150. A whole without dependence or defect,
151. Made for itself, and happy in itself,
152. Perfect contentment, Unity entire.
153. Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,
154. When hitherward we journeyed side by side
155. Through burst of sunshine and through flying showers;
156. Paced the long vales--how long they were--and yet
157. How fast that length of way was left behind,
158. Wensley's rich Vale, and Sedbergh's naked heights.
159. The frosty wind, as if to make amends
160. For its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,
161. And drove us onward like two ships at sea,
162. Or like two birds, companions in mid-air,
163. Parted and reunited by the blast.
164. Stern was the face of nature; we rejoiced
165. In that stern countenance, for our souls thence drew
166. A feeling of their strength. The naked trees,
167. The icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared
168. To question us. 'Whence come ye, to what end?'
169. They seemed to say, 'What would ye,' said the shower,
170. 'Wild Wanderers, whither through my dark domain?'
171. The sunbeam said, 'Be happy.' When this vale
172. We entered, bright and solemn was the sky
173. That faced us with a passionate welcoming,
174. And led us to our threshold. Daylight failed
175. Insensibly, and round us gently fell
176. Composing darkness, with a quiet load
177. Of full contentment, in a little shed
178. Disturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed,
179. And wondering at its new inhabitants.
180. It loves us now, this Vale so beautiful
181. Begins to love us! by a sullen storm,
182. Two months unwearied of severest storm,
183. It put the temper of our minds to proof,
184. And found us faithful through the gloom, and heard
185. The poet mutter his prelusive songs
186. With cheerful heart, an unknown voice of joy
187. Among the silence of the woods and hills;
188. Silent to any gladsomeness of sound
189. With all their shepherds.
190. But the gates of Spring
191. Are opened; churlish winter hath given leave
192. That she should entertain for this one day,
193. Perhaps for many genial days to come,
194. His guests, and make them jocund.--They are pleased,
195. But most of all the birds that haunt the flood
196. With the mild summons; inmates though they be
197. Of Winter's household, they keep festival
198. This day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long;
199. They show their pleasure, and shall I do less?
200. Happier of happy though I be, like them
201. I cannot take possession of the sky,
202. Mount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there
203. One of a mighty multitude, whose way
204. Is a perpetual harmony and dance
205. Magnificent. Behold how with a grace
206. Of ceaseless motion, that might scarcely seem
207. Inferior to angelical, they prolong
208. Their curious pastime, shaping in mid-air,
209. And sometimes with ambitious wing that soars
210. High as the level of the mountain tops,
211. A circuit ampler than the lake beneath,
212. Their own domain;--but ever, while intent
213. On tracing and retracing that large round,
214. Their jubilant activity evolves
215. Hundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro,
216. Upwards and downwards; progress intricate
217. Yet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayed
218. Their indefatigable flight. 'Tis done,
219. Ten times and more I fancied it had ceased,
220. But lo! the vanished company again
221. Ascending, they approach. I hear their wings
222. Faint, faint at first; and then an eager sound
223. Passed in a moment--and as faint again!
224. They tempt the sun to sport among their plumes;
225. Tempt the smooth water, or the gleaming ice,
226. To show them a fair image,--'tis themselves,
227. Their own fair forms upon the glimmering plain
228. Painted more soft and fair as they descend,
229. Almost to touch,--then up again aloft,
230. Up with a sally and a flash of speed,
231. As if they scorned both resting-place and rest!
232. --This day is a thanksgiving, 'tis a day
233. Of glad emotion and deep quietness;
234. Not upon me alone hath been bestowed,
235. Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts,
236. The penetrating bliss; oh surely these
237. Have felt it, not the happy choirs of spring,
238. Her own peculiar family of love
239. That sport among green leaves, a blither train!
240. But two are missing, two, a lonely pair
241. Of milk-white Swans; wherefore are they not seen
242. Partaking this day's pleasure? From afar
243. They came, to sojourn here in solitude,
244. Choosing this Valley, they who had the choice
245. Of the whole world. We saw them day by day,
246. Through those two months of unrelenting storm,
247. Conspicuous at the centre of the Lake
248. Their safe retreat, we knew them well, I guess
249. That the whole valley knew them; but to us
250. They were more dear than may be well believed,
251. Not only for their beauty, and their still
252. And placid way of life, and constant love
253. Inseparable, not for these alone,
254. But that 'their' state so much resembled ours,
255. They having also chosen this abode;
256. They strangers, and we strangers, they a pair,
257. And we a solitary pair like them.
258. They should not have departed; many days
259. Did I look forth in vain, nor on the wing
260. Could see them, nor in that small open space
261. Of blue unfrozen water, where they lodged
262. And lived so long in quiet, side by side.
263. Shall we behold them consecrated friends,
264. Faithful companions, yet another year
265. Surviving, they for us, and we for them,
266. And neither pair be broken? nay perchance
267. It is too late already for such hope;
268. The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,
269. And parted them; or haply both are gone
270. One death, and that were mercy given to both.
271. Recall, my song, the ungenerous thought; forgive,
272. Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh
273. Of such inhospitable penalty
274. Inflicted upon confidence so pure.
275. Ah! if I wished to follow where the sight
276. Of all that is before my eyes, the voice
277. Which speaks from a presiding spirit here,
278. Would lead me, I should whisper to myself:
279. They who are dwellers in this holy place
280. Must needs themselves be hallowed, they require
281. No benediction from the stranger's lips,
282. For they are blessed already; none would give
283. The greeting 'peace be with you' unto them,
284. For peace they have; it cannot but be theirs,
285. And mercy, and forbearance--nay--not these--
286. 'Their' healing offices a pure good-will
287. Precludes, and charity beyond the bounds
288. Of charity--an overflowing love;
289. Not for the creature only, but for all
290. That is around them; love for everything
291. Which in their happy Region they behold!
292. Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought
293. Is passed, we blame it not for having come.
294. --What if I floated down a pleasant stream,
295. And now am landed, and the motion gone,
296. Shall I reprove myself? Ah no, the stream
297. Is flowing, and will never cease to flow,
298. And I shall float upon that stream again.
299. By such forgetfulness the soul becomes,
300. Words cannot say how beautiful: then hail,
301. Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,
302. Delightful Valley, habitation fair!
303. And to whatever else of outward form
304. Can give an inward help, can purify,
305. And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,
306. And steal away, and for a while deceive
307. And lap in pleasing rest, and bear us on
308. Without desire in full complacency,
309. Contemplating perfection absolute,
310. And entertained as in a placid sleep.
311. But not betrayed by tenderness of mind
312. That feared, or wholly overlooked the truth,
313. Did we come hither, with romantic hope
314. To find in midst of so much loveliness
315. Love, perfect love: of so much majesty
316. A like majestic-frame of mind in those
317. Who here abide, the persons like the place.
318. Not from such hope, or aught of such belief,
319. Hath issued any portion of the joy
320. Which I have felt this day. An awful voice
321. 'Tis true hath in my walks been often heard,
322. Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields,
323. Shout after shout--reiterated whoop,
324. In manner of a bird that takes delight
325. In answering to itself: or like a hound
326. Single at chase among the lonely woods,
327. His yell repeating; yet it was in truth
328. A human voice--a spirit of coming night;
329. How solemn when the sky is dark, and earth
330. Not dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snow
331. Made visible, amid a noise of winds
332. And bleatings manifold of mountain sheep,
333. Which in that iteration recognise
334. Their summons, and are gathering round for food,
335. Devoured with keenness, ere to grove or bank
336. Or rocky bield with patience they retire.
337. That very voice, which, in some timid mood
338. Of superstitious fancy, might have seemed
339. Awful as ever stray demoniac uttered,
340. His steps to govern in the wilderness;
341. Or as the Norman Curfew's regular beat
342. To hearths when first they darkened at the knell:
343. That shepherd's voice, it may have reached mine ear
344. Debased and under profanation, made
345. The ready organ of articulate sounds
346. From ribaldry, impiety, or wrath,
347. Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawls
348. Of some abused Festivity--so be it.
349. I came not dreaming of unruffled life,
350. Untainted manners; born among the hills,
351. Bred also there, I wanted not a scale
352. To regulate my hopes; pleased with the good
353. I shrink not from the evil with disgust,
354. Or with immoderate pain. I look for Man,
355. The common creature of the brotherhood,
356. Differing but little from the Man elsewhere,
357. For selfishness and envy and revenge,
358. Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be--
359. Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong.
360. Yet is it something gained, it is in truth
361. A mighty gain, that Labour here preserves
362. His rosy face, a servant only here
363. Of the fireside or of the open field,
364. A Freeman therefore sound and unimpaired:
365. That extreme penury is here unknown,
366. And cold and hunger's abject wretchedness
367. Mortal to body and the heaven-born mind:
368. That they who want are not too great a weight
369. For those who can relieve; here may the heart
370. Breathe in the air of fellow-suffering
371. Dreadless, as in a kind of fresher breeze
372. Of her own native element, the hand
373. Be ready and unwearied without plea,
374. From tasks too frequent or beyond its power,
375. For languor or indifference or despair.
376. And as these lofty barriers break the force
377. Of winds,--this deep Vale, as it doth in part
378. Conceal us from the storm, so here abides
379. A power and a protection for the mind,
380. Dispensed indeed to other solitudes
381. Favoured by noble privilege like this,
382. Where kindred independence of estate
383. Is prevalent, where he who tills the field,
384. He, happy man! is master of the field,
385. And treads the mountains which his Fathers trod.
386. Not less than halfway up yon mountain's side,
387. Behold a dusky spot, a grove of Firs
388. That seems still smaller than it is; this grove
389. Is haunted--by what ghost? a gentle spirit
390. Of memory faithful to the call of love;
391. For, as reports the Dame, whose fire sends up
392. Yon curling smoke from the grey cot below,
393. The trees (her first-born child being then a babe)
394. Were planted by her husband and herself,
395. That ranging o'er the high and houseless ground
396. Their sheep might neither want from perilous storm
397. Of winter, nor from summer's sultry heat,
398. A friendly covert; 'and they knew it well,'
399. Said she, 'for thither as the trees grew up
400. We to the patient creatures carried food
401. In times of heavy snow.' She then began
402. In fond obedience to her private thoughts
403. To speak of her dead husband; is there not
404. An art, a music, and a strain of words
405. That shall be life, the acknowledged voice of life,
406. Shall speak of what is done among the fields,
407. Done truly there, or felt, of solid good
408. And real evil, yet be sweet withal,
409. More grateful, more harmonious than the breath,
410. The idle breath of softest pipe attuned
411. To pastoral fancies? Is there such a stream
412. Pure and unsullied flowing from the heart
413. With motions of true dignity and grace?
414. Or must we seek that stream where Man is not?
415. Methinks I could repeat in tuneful verse,
416. Delicious as the gentlest breeze that sounds
417. Through that aerial fir-grove--could preserve
418. Some portion of its human history
419. As gathered from the Matron's lips, and tell
420. Of tears that have been shed at sight of it,
421. And moving dialogues between this Pair
422. Who in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands
423. Did plant the grove, now flourishing, while they
424. No longer flourish, he entirely gone,
425. She withering in her loneliness. Be this
426. A task above my skill--the silent mind
427. Has her own treasures, and I think of these,
428. Love what I see, and honour humankind.
429. No, we are not alone, we do not stand,
430. My sister here misplaced and desolate,
431. Loving what no one cares for but ourselves,
432. We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks
433. Of this fair Vale, and o'er its spacious heights,
434. Unprofitable kindliness, bestowed
435. On objects unaccustomed to the gifts
436. Of feeling, which were cheerless and forlorn
437. But few weeks past, and would be so again
438. Were we not here; we do not tend a lamp
439. Whose lustre we alone participate,
440. Which shines dependent upon us alone,
441. Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame.
442. Look where we will, some human hand has been
443. Before us with its offering; not a tree
444. Sprinkles these little pastures, but the same
445. Hath furnished matter for a thought; perchance
446. For some one serves as a familiar friend.
447. Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,
448. Home of untutored shepherds as it is,
449. Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,
450. Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds. Nor deem
451. These feelings, though subservient more than ours
452. To every day's demand for daily bread,
453. And borrowing more their spirit and their shape
454. From self-respecting interests; deem them not
455. Unworthy therefore, and unhallowed--no,
456. They lift the animal being, do themselves
457. By nature's kind and ever-present aid
458. Refine the selfishness from which they spring,
459. Redeem by love the individual sense
460. Of anxiousness, with which they are combined.
461. And thus it is that fitly they become
462. Associates in the joy of purest minds:
463. They blend therewith congenially: meanwhile
464. Calmly they breathe their own undying life
465. Through this their mountain sanctuary; long
466. Oh long may it remain inviolate,
467. Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness,
468. And giving to the moments as they pass
469. Their little boons of animating thought
470. That sweeten labour, make it seen and felt
471. To be no arbitrary weight imposed,
472. But a glad function natural to man.
473. Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be,
474. Already have I gained; the inward frame,
475. Though slowly opening, opens every day
476. With process not unlike to that which cheers
477. A pensive stranger journeying at his leisure
478. Through some Helvetian Dell; when low-hung mists
479. Break up and are beginning to recede;
480. How pleased he is where thin and thinner grows
481. The veil, or where it parts at once, to spy
482. The dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads;
483. To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed;
484. Then to be greeted by the scattered huts
485. As they shine out; and 'see' the streams whose murmur
486. Had soothed his ear while 'they' were hidden; how pleased
487. To have about him which way e'er he goes
488. Something on every side concealed from view,
489. In every quarter something visible
490. Half seen or wholly, lost and found again,
491. Alternate progress and impediment,
492. And yet a growing prospect in the main.
493. Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,
494. Herein less happy than the Traveller,
495. To cast from time to time a painful look
496. Upon unwelcome things which unawares
497. Reveal themselves, not therefore is my heart
498. Depressed, nor does it fear what is to come;
499. But confident, enriched at every glance,
500. The more I see the more delight my mind
501. Receives, or by reflection can create:
502. Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells
503. With Hope, who would not follow where she leads?
504. Nor let me pass unheeded other loves
505. Where no fear is, and humbler sympathies.
506. Already hath sprung up within my heart
507. A liking for the small grey horse that bears
508. The paralytic man, and for the brute
509. In Scripture sanctified--the patient brute
510. On which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,
511. Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways.
512. The famous sheep-dog, first in all the vale,
513. Though yet to me a stranger, will not be
514. A stranger long; nor will the blind man's guide,
515. Meek and neglected thing, of no renown!
516. Soon will peep forth the primrose, ere it fades
517. Friends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrush
518. To rouse me, and a hundred warblers more!
519. And if those Eagles to their ancient hold
520. Return, Helvellyn's Eagles! with the Pair
521. From my own door I shall be free to claim
522. Acquaintance, as they sweep from cloud to cloud.
523. The owl that gives the name to Owlet-Crag
524. Have I heard whooping, and he soon will be
525. A chosen one of my regards. See there
526. The heifer in yon little croft belongs
527. To one who holds it dear; with duteous care
528. She reared it, and in speaking of her charge
529. I heard her scatter some endearing words
530. Domestic, and in spirit motherly,
531. She being herself a mother; happy Beast,
532. If the caresses of a human voice
533. Can make it so, and care of human hands.
534. And ye as happy under Nature's care,
535. Strangers to me and all men, or at least
536. Strangers to all particular amity,
537. All intercourse of knowledge or of love
538. That parts the individual from his kind.
539. Whether in large communities ye keep
540. From year to year, not shunning man's abode,
541. A settled residence, or be from far
542. Wild creatures, and of many homes, that come
543. The gift of winds, and whom the winds again
544. Take from us at your pleasure; yet shall ye
545. Not want for this your own subordinate place
546. In my affections. Witness the delight
547. With which erewhile I saw that multitude
548. Wheel through the sky, and see them now at rest,
549. Yet not at rest upon the glassy lake:
550. They 'cannot' rest--they gambol like young whelps;
551. Active as lambs, and overcome with joy
552. They try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge,
553. And beat the passive water with their wings.
554. Too distant are they for plain view, but lo!
555. Those little fountains, sparkling in the sun,
556. Betray their occupation, rising up
557. First one and then another silver spout,
558. As one or other takes the fit of glee,
559. Fountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guise
560. Of plaything fireworks, that on festal nights
561. Sparkle about the feet of wanton boys.
562. --How vast the compass of this theatre,
563. Yet nothing to be seen but lovely pomp
564. And silent majesty; the birch-tree woods
565. Are hung with thousand thousand diamond drops
566. Of melted hoar-frost, every tiny knot
567. In the bare twigs, each little budding-place
568. Cased with its several beads; what myriads these
569. Upon one tree, while all the distant grove,
570. That rises to the summit of the steep,
571. Shows like a mountain built of silver light:
572. See yonder the same pageant, and again
573. Behold the universal imagery
574. Inverted, all its sun-bright features touched
575. As with the varnish and the gloss of dreams.
576. Dreamlike the blending also of the whole
577. Harmonious landscape: all along the shore
578. The boundary lost--the line invisible
579. That parts the image from reality;
580. And the clear hills, as high as they ascend
581. Heavenward, so deep piercing the lake below.
582. Admonished of the days of love to come
583. The raven croaks, and fills the upper air
584. With a strange sound of genial harmony;
585. And in and all about that playful band,
586. Incapable although they be of rest,
587. And in their fashion very rioters,
588. There is a stillness, and they seem to make
589. Calm revelry in that their calm abode.
590. Them leaving to their joyous hours I pass,
591. Pass with a thought the life of the whole year
592. That is to come: the throng of woodland flowers
593. And lilies that will dance upon the waves.
594. Say boldly then that solitude is not
595. Where these things are: he truly is alone,
596. He of the multitude whose eyes are doomed
597. To hold a vacant commerce day by day
598. With Objects wanting life--repelling love;
599. He by the vast metropolis immured,
600. Where pity shrinks from unremitting calls,
601. Where numbers overwhelm humanity,
602. And neighbourhood serves rather to divide
603. Than to unite--what sighs more deep than his,
604. Whose nobler will hath long been sacrificed;
605. Who must inhabit under a black sky
606. A city, where, if indifference to disgust
607. Yield not to scorn or sorrow, living men
608. Are ofttimes to their fellow-men no more
609. Than to the forest Hermit are the leaves
610. That hang aloft in myriads; nay, far less,
611. For they protect his walk from sun and shower,
612. Swell his devotion with their voice in storms,
613. And whisper while the stars twinkle among them
614. His lullaby. From crowded streets remote,
615. Far from the living and dead Wilderness
616. Of the thronged world, Society is here
617. A true community--a genuine frame
618. Of many into one incorporate.
619. 'That' must be looked for here: paternal sway,
620. One household, under God, for high and low,
621. One family and one mansion; to themselves
622. Appropriate, and divided from the world,
623. As if it were a cave, a multitude
624. Human and brute, possessors undisturbed
625. Of this Recess--their legislative Hall,
626. Their Temple, and their glorious Dwelling-place.
627. Dismissing therefore all Arcadian dreams,
628. All golden fancies of the golden age,
629. The bright array of shadowy thoughts from times
630. That were before all time, or are to be
631. Ere time expire, the pageantry that stirs
632. Or will be stirring, when our eyes are fixed
633. On lovely objects, and we wish to part
634. With all remembrance of a jarring world,
635. --Take we at once this one sufficient hope,
636. What need of more? that we shall neither droop
637. Nor pine for want of pleasure in the life
638. Scattered about us, nor through want of aught
639. That keeps in health the insatiable mind.
640. --That we shall have for knowledge and for love
641. Abundance, and that feeling as we do
642. How goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure
643. From all reproach is yon ethereal vault,
644. And this deep Vale, its earthly counterpart,
645. By which and under which we are enclosed
646. To breathe in peace; we shall moreover find
647. (If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves,
648. If rightly we observe and justly weigh)
649. The inmates not unworthy of their home,
650. The Dwellers of their Dwelling.
651. And if this
652. Were otherwise, we have within ourselves
653. Enough to fill the present day with joy,
654. And overspread the future years with hope,
655. Our beautiful and quiet home, enriched
656. Already with a stranger whom we love
657. Deeply, a stranger of our Father's house,
658. A never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea,
659. Who finds at last an hour to his content
660. Beneath our roof. And others whom we love
661. Will seek us also, Sisters of our hearts,
662. And one, like them, a Brother of our hearts,
663. Philosopher and Poet, in whose sight
664. These mountains will rejoice with open joy.
665. --Such is our wealth! O Vale of Peace we are
666. And must be, with God's will, a happy Band.
667. Yet 'tis not to enjoy that we exist,
668. For that end only; something must be done:
669. I must not walk in unreproved delight
670. These narrow bounds, and think of nothing more,
671. No duty that looks further, and no care.
672. Each Being has his office, lowly some
673. And common, yet all worthy if fulfilled
674. With zeal, acknowledgment that with the gift
675. Keeps pace a harvest answering to the seed.
676. Of ill-advised Ambition and of Pride
677. I would stand clear, but yet to me I feel
678. That an internal brightness is vouchsafed
679. That must not die, that must not pass away.
680. Why does this inward lustre fondly seek
681. And gladly blend with outward fellowship?
682. Why do 'they' shine around me whom I love?
683. Why do they teach me, whom I thus revere?
684. Strange question, yet it answers not itself.
685. That humble Roof embowered among the trees,
686. That calm fireside, it is not even in them,
687. Blest as they are, to furnish a reply
688. That satisfies and ends in perfect rest.
689. Possessions have I that are solely mine,
690. Something within which yet is shared by none,
691. Not even the nearest to me and most dear,
692. Something which power and effort may impart;
693. I would impart it, I would spread it wide:
694. Immortal in the world which is to come--
695. Forgive me if I add another claim--
696. And would not wholly perish even in this,
697. Lie down and be forgotten in the dust,
698. I and the modest Partners of my days
699. Making a silent company in death;
700. Love, knowledge, all my manifold delights,
701. All buried with me without monument
702. Or profit unto any but ourselves!
703. It must not be, if I, divinely taught,
704. Be privileged to speak as I have felt
705. Of what in man is human or divine.
706. While yet an innocent little one, with a heart
707. That doubtless wanted not its tender moods,
708. I breathed (for this I better recollect)
709. Among wild appetites and blind desires,
710. Motions of savage instinct my delight
711. And exaltation. Nothing at that time
712. So welcome, no temptation half so dear
713. As that which urged me to a daring feat,
714. Deep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags,
715. And tottering towers: I loved to stand and read
716. Their looks forbidding, read and disobey,
717. Sometimes in act and evermore in thought.
718. With impulses, that scarcely were by these
719. Surpassed in strength, I heard of danger met
720. Or sought with courage; enterprise forlorn
721. By one, sole keeper of his own intent,
722. Or by a resolute few, who for the sake
723. Of glory fronted multitudes in arms.
724. Yea, to this hour I cannot read a Tale
725. Of two brave vessels matched in deadly fight,
726. And fighting to the death, but I am pleased
727. More than a wise man ought to be; I wish,
728. Fret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there.
729. But me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seek
730. For other agitations, or be calm;
731. Hath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream,
732. Some nursling of the mountains which she leads
733. Through quiet meadows, after he has learnt
734. His strength, and had his triumph and his joy,
735. His desperate course of tumult and of glee.
736. That which in stealth by Nature was performed
737. Hath Reason sanctioned: her deliberate Voice
738. Hath said; be mild, and cleave to gentle things,
739. Thy glory and thy happiness be there.
740. Nor fear, though thou confide in me, a want
741. Of aspirations that have been--of foes
742. To wrestle with, and victory to complete,
743. Bounds to be leapt, darkness to be explored;
744. All that inflamed thy infant heart, the love,
745. The longing, the contempt, the undaunted quest,
746. All shall survive, though changed their office, all
747. Shall live, it is not in their power to die.
748. Then farewell to the Warrior's Schemes, farewell
749. The forwardness of soul which looks that way
750. Upon a less incitement than the Cause
751. Of Liberty endangered, and farewell
752. That other hope, long mine, the hope to fill
753. The heroic trumpet with the Muse's breath!
754. Yet in this peaceful Vale we will not spend
755. Unheard-of days, though loving peaceful thought,
756. A voice shall speak, and what will be the theme?
757. On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life,
758. Musing in solitude, I oft perceive
759. Fair trains of imagery before me rise,
760. Accompanied by feelings of delight
761. Pure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed;
762. And I am conscious of affecting thoughts
763. And dear remembrances, whose presence soothes
764. Or elevates the Mind, intent to weigh
765. The good and evil of our mortal state.
766. --To these emotions, whencesoe'er they come,
767. Whether from breath of outward circumstance,
768. Or from the Soul--an impulse to herself--
769. I would give utterance in numerous verse.
770. Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope,
771. And melancholy Fear subdued by Faith;
772. Of blessed consolations in distress;
773. Of moral strength, and intellectual Power;
774. Of joy in widest commonalty spread;
775. Of the individual Mind that keeps her own
776. Inviolate retirement, subject there
777. To Conscience only, and the law supreme
778. Of that Intelligence which governs all--
779. I sing:--'fit audience let me find though few!'
780. So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard--
781. In holiest mood. Urania, I shall need
782. Thy guidance, or a greater Muse, if such
783. Descend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!
784. For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink
785. Deep--and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds
786. To which the heaven of heavens is but a veil.
787. All strength--all terror, single or in bands,
788. That ever was put forth in personal form--
789. Jehovah--with his thunder, and the choir
790. Of shouting Angels, and the empyreal thrones--
791. I pass them unalarmed. Not Chaos, not
792. The darkest pit of lowest Erebus,
793. Nor aught of blinder vacancy, scooped out
794. By help of dreams--can breed such fear and awe
795. As fall upon us often when we look
796. Into our Minds, into the Mind of Man--
797. My haunt, and the main region of my song
798. --Beauty--a living Presence of the earth,
799. Surpassing the most fair ideal Forms
800. Which craft of delicate Spirits hath composed
801. From earth's materials--waits upon my steps;
802. Pitches her tents before me as I move,
803. An hourly neighbour. Paradise, and groves
804. Elysian, Fortunate Fields--like those of old
805. Sought in the Atlantic Main--why should they be
806. A history only of departed things,
807. Or a mere fiction of what never was?
808. For the discerning intellect of Man,
809. When wedded to this goodly universe
810. In love and holy passion, shall find these
811. A simple produce of the common day.
812. --I, long before the blissful hour arrives,
813. Would chant, in lonely peace, the spousal verse
814. Of this great consummation:--and, by words
815. Which speak of nothing more than what we are,
816. Would I arouse the sensual from their sleep
817. Of Death, and win the vacant and the vain
818. To noble raptures; while my voice proclaims
819. How exquisitely the individual Mind
820. (And the progressive powers perhaps no less
821. Of the whole species) to the external World
822. Is fitted:--and how exquisitely, too--
823. Theme this but little heard of among men--
824. The external World is fitted to the Mind;
825. And the creation (by no lower name
826. Can it be called) which they with blended might
827. Accomplish:--this is our high argument.
828. --Such grateful haunts foregoing, if I oft
829. Must turn elsewhere--to travel near the tribes
830. And fellowships of men, and see ill sights
831. Of madding passions mutually inflamed;
832. Must hear Humanity in fields and groves
833. Pipe solitary anguish; or must hang
834. Brooding above the fierce confederate storm
835. Of sorrow, barricadoed evermore
836. Within the walls of cities--may these sounds
837. Have their authentic comment; that even these
838. Hearing, I be not downcast or forlorn!--
839. Descend, prophetic Spirit! that inspir'st
840. The human Soul of universal earth,
841. Dreaming on things to come; and dost possess
842. A metropolitan temple in the hearts
843. Of mighty Poets; upon me bestow
844. A gift of genuine insight; that my Song
845. With star-like virtue in its place may shine,
846. Shedding benignant influence, and secure
847. Itself from all malevolent effect
848. Of those mutations that extend their sway
849. Throughout the nether sphere!--And if with this
850. I mix more lowly matter; with the thing
851. Contemplated, describe the Mind and Man
852. Contemplating; and who, and what he was--
853. The transitory Being that beheld
854. This Vision;--when and where, and how he lived;
855. Be not this labour useless. If such theme
856. May sort with highest objects, then--dread Power!
857. Whose gracious favour is the primal source
858. Of all illumination--may my Life
859. Express the image of a better time,
860. More wise desires, and simpler manners;--nurse
861. My Heart in genuine freedom:--all pure thoughts
862. Be with me;--so shall thy unfailing love
863. Guide, and support, and cheer me to the end!
