1. Sweet was the walk along the narrow lane
2. At noon, the bank and hedge-rows all the way
3. Shagged with wild pale green tufts of fragrant hay,
4. Caught by the hawthorns from the loaded wain,
5. Which Age with many a slow stoop strove to gain;
6. And childhood, seeming still most busy, took
7. His little rake; with cunning side-long look,
8. Sauntering to pluck the strawberries wild, unseen.
9. Now, too, on melancholy's idle dreams
10. Musing, the lone spot with my soul agrees,
11. Quiet and dark; for through the thick wove trees
12. Scarce peeps the curious star till solemn gleams
13. The clouded moon, and calls me forth to stray
14. Thro' tall, green, silent woods and ruins gray.
