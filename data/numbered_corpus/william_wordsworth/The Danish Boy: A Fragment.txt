1. I

2. Between two sister moorland rills
3. There is a spot that seems to lie
4. Sacred to flowerets of the hills,
5. And sacred to the sky.
6. And in this smooth and open dell
7. There is a tempest-stricken tree;
8. A corner-stone by lightning cut,
9. The last stone of a lonely hut;
10. And in this dell you see
11. A thing no storm can e'er destroy,
12. The shadow of a Danish Boy.

13. II

14. In clouds above, the lark is heard,
15. But drops not here to earth for rest;
16. Within this lonesome nook the bird
17. Did never build her nest.
18. No beast, no bird hath here his home;
19. Bees, wafted on the breezy air,
20. Pass high above those fragrant bells
21. To other flowers:--to other dells
22. Their burthens do they bear;
23. The Danish Boy walks here alone:
24. The lovely dell is all his own.

25. III

26. A Spirit of noon-day is he;
27. Yet seems a form of flesh and blood;
28. Nor piping shepherd shall he be,
29. Nor herd-boy of the wood.
30. A regal vest of fur he wears,
31. In colour like a raven's wing;
32. It fears not rain, nor wind, nor dew;
33. But in the storm 'tis fresh and blue
34. As budding pines in spring;
35. His helmet has a vernal grace,
36. Fresh as the bloom upon his face.

37. IV

38. A harp is from his shoulder slung;
39. Resting the harp upon his knee,
40. To words of a forgotten tongue
41. He suits its melody.
42. Of flocks upon the neighbouring hill
43. He is the darling and the joy;
44. And often, when no cause appears,
45. The mountain-ponies prick their ears,
46. --They hear the Danish Boy,
47. While in the dell he sings alone
48. Beside the tree and corner-stone.

49. V

50. There sits he; in his face you spy
51. No trace of a ferocious air,
52. Nor ever was a cloudless sky
53. So steady or so fair.
54. The lovely Danish Boy is blest
55. And happy in his flowery cove:
56. From bloody deeds his thoughts are far;
57. And yet he warbles songs of war,
58. That seem like songs of love,
59. For calm and gentle is his mien;
60. Like a dead Boy he is serene.
