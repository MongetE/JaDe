1. YES! thou art fair, yet be not moved
2. To scorn the declaration,
3. That sometimes I in thee have loved
4. My fancy's own creation.

5. Imagination needs must stir;
6. Dear Maid, this truth believe,
7. Minds that have nothing to confer
8. Find little to perceive.

9. Be pleased that nature made thee fit
10. To feed my heart's devotion,
11. By laws to which all Forms submit
12. In sky, air, earth, and ocean.
