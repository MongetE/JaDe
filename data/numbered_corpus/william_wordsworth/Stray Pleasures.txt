1. BY their floating mill,
2. That lies dead and still,
3. Behold yon Prisoners three,
4. The Miller with two Dames, on the breast of the Thames!
5. The platform is small, but gives room for them all;
6. And they're dancing merrily.

7. From the shore come the notes
8. To their mill where it floats,
9. To their house and their mill tethered fast:
10. To the small wooden isle where, their work to beguile,
11. They from morning to even take whatever is given;--
12. And many a blithe day they have past.

13. In sight of the spires,
14. All alive with the fires
15. Of the sun going down to his rest,
16. In the broad open eye of the solitary sky,
17. They dance,--there are three, as jocund as free,
18. While they dance on the calm river's breast.

19. Man and Maidens wheel,
20. They themselves make the reel,
21. And their music's a prey which they seize;
22. It plays not for them,--what matter? 'tis theirs;
23. And if they had care, it has scattered their cares,
24. While they dance, crying, 'Long as ye please!'

25. They dance not for me,
26. Yet mine is their glee!
27. Thus pleasure is spread through the earth
28. In stray gifts to be claimed by whoever shall find;
29. Thus a rich loving-kindness, redundantly kind,
30. Moves all nature to gladness and mirth.

31. The showers of the spring
32. Rouse the birds, and they sing;
33. If the wind do but stir for his proper delight,
34. Each leaf, that and this, his neighbour will kiss;
35. Each wave, one and t' other, speeds after his brother:
36. They are happy, for that is their right!
