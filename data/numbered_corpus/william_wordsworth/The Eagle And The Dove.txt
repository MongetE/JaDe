1. SHADE of Caractacus, if spirits love
2. The cause they fought for in their earthly home
3. To see the Eagle ruffled by the Dove
4. May soothe thy memory of the chains of Rome.

5. These children claim thee for their sire; the breath
6. Of thy renown, from Cambrian mountains, fans
7. A flame within them that despises death
8. And glorifies the truant youth of Vannes.

9. With thy own scorn of tyrants they advance,
10. But truth divine has sanctified their rage,
11. A silver cross enchased with flowers of France
12. Their badge, attests the holy fight they wage.

13. The shrill defiance of the young crusade
14. Their veteran foes mock as an idle noise;
15. But unto Faith and Loyalty comes aid
16. From Heaven, gigantic force to beardless boys.
