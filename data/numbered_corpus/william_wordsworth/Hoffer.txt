1. OF mortal parents is the Hero born
2. By whom the undaunted Tyrolese are led?
3. Or is it Tell's great Spirit, from the dead
4. Returned to animate an age forlorn?
5. He comes like Phoebus through the gates of morn
6. When dreary darkness is discomfited,
7. Yet mark his modest state! upon his head,
8. That simple crest, a heron's plume, is worn.
9. O Liberty! they stagger at the shock
10. From van to rear--and with one mind would flee,
11. But half their host is buried:--rock on rock
12. Descends:--beneath this godlike Warrior, see!
13. Hills, torrents, woods, embodied to bemock
14. The Tyrant, and confound his cruelty.
