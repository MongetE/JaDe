1. Yet are they here the same unbroken knot
2. Of human Beings, in the self-same spot!
3. Men, women, children, yea the frame
4. Of the whole spectacle the same!
5. Only their fire seems bolder, yielding light,
6. Now deep and red, the colouring of night;
7. That on their Gipsy-faces falls,
8. Their bed of straw and blanket-walls.
9. --Twelve hours, twelve bounteous hours are gone, while I
10. Have been a traveller under open sky,
11. Much witnessing of change and cheer,
12. Yet as I left I find them here!
13. The weary Sun betook himself to rest;--
14. Then issued Vesper from the fulgent west,
15. Outshining like a visible God
16. The glorious path in which he trod.
17. And now, ascending, after one dark hour
18. And one night's diminution of her power,
19. Behold the mighty Moon! this way
20. She looks as if at them--but they
21. Regard not her:--oh better wrong and strife
22. (By nature transient) than this torpid life;
23. Life which the very stars reprove
24. As on their silent tasks they move!
25. Yet, witness all that stirs in heaven or earth!
26. In scorn I speak not;--they are what their birth
27. And breeding suffer them to be;
28. Wild outcasts of society!
