1. TWO Voices are there; one is of the sea,
2. One of the mountains; each a mighty Voice:
3. In both from age to age thou didst rejoice,
4. They were thy chosen music, Liberty!
5. There came a Tyrant, and with holy glee
6. Thou fought'st against him; but hast vainly striven:
7. Thou from thy Alpine holds at length art driven,
8. Where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee.
9. Of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft:
10. Then cleave, O cleave to that which still is left;
11. For, high-souled Maid, what sorrow would it be
12. That Mountain floods should thunder as before,
13. And Ocean bellow from his rocky shore,
14. And neither awful Voice be heard by thee!
