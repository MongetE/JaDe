1. YET, yet, Biscayans! we must meet our Foes
2. With firmer soul, yet labour to regain
3. Our ancient freedom; else 'twere worse than vain
4. To gather round the bier these festal shows.
5. A garland fashioned of the pure white rose
6. Becomes not one whose father is a slave:
7. Oh, bear the infant covered to his grave!
8. These venerable mountains now enclose
9. A people sunk in apathy and fear.
10. If this endure, farewell, for us, all good!
11. The awful light of heavenly innocence
12. Will fail to illuminate the infant's bier;
13. And guilt and shame, from which is no defence,
14. Descend on all that issues from our blood.
