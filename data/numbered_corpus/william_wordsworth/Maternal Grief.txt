1. DEPARTED Child! I could forget thee once
2. Though at my bosom nursed; this woeful gain
3. Thy dissolution brings, that in my soul
4. Is present and perpetually abides
5. A shadow, never, never to be displaced
6. By the returning substance, seen or touched,
7. Seen by mine eyes, or clasped in my embrace.
8. Absence and death how differ they! and how
9. Shall I admit that nothing can restore
10. What one short sigh so easily removed?--
11. Death, life, and sleep, reality and thought,
12. Assist me, God, their boundaries to know,
13. O teach me calm submission to thy Will!
14. The Child she mourned had overstepped the pale
15. Of Infancy, but still did breathe the air
16. That sanctifies its confines, and partook
17. Reflected beams of that celestial light
18. To all the Little-ones on sinful earth
19. Not unvouchsafed--a light that warmed and cheered
20. Those several qualities of heart and mind
21. Which, in her own blest nature, rooted deep,
22. Daily before the Mother's watchful eye,
23. And not hers only, their peculiar charms
24. Unfolded,--beauty, for its present self,
25. And for its promises to future years,
26. With not unfrequent rapture fondly hailed.
27. Have you espied upon a dewy lawn
28. A pair of Leverets each provoking each
29. To a continuance of their fearless sport,
30. Two separate Creatures in their several gifts
31. Abounding, but so fashioned that, in all
32. That Nature prompts them to display, their looks,
33. Their starts of motion and their fits of rest,
34. An undistinguishable style appears
35. And character of gladness, as if Spring
36. Lodged in their innocent bosoms, and the spirit
37. Of the rejoicing morning were their own?
38. Such union, in the lovely Girl maintained
39. And her twin Brother, had the parent seen,
40. Ere, pouncing like a ravenous bird of prey,
41. Death in a moment parted them, and left
42. The Mother, in her turns of anguish, worse
43. Than desolate; for oft-times from the sound
44. Of the survivor's sweetest voice (dear child,
45. He knew it not) and from his happiest looks,
46. Did she extract the food of self-reproach,
47. As one that lived ungrateful for the stay
48. By Heaven afforded to uphold her maimed
49. And tottering spirit. And full oft the Boy,
50. Now first acquainted with distress and grief,
51. Shrunk from his Mother's presence, shunned with fear
52. Her sad approach, and stole away to find,
53. In his known haunts of joy where'er he might,
54. A more congenial object. But, as time
55. Softened her pangs and reconciled the child
56. To what he saw, he gradually returned,
57. Like a scared Bird encouraged to renew
58. A broken intercourse; and, while his eyes
59. Were yet with pensive fear and gentle awe
60. Turned upon her who bore him, she would stoop
61. To imprint a kiss that lacked not power to spread
62. Faint colour over both their pallid cheeks,
63. And stilled his tremulous lip. Thus they were calmed
64. And cheered; and now together breathe fresh air
65. In open fields; and when the glare of day
66. Is gone, and twilight to the Mother's wish
67. Befriends the observance, readily they join
68. In walks whose boundary is the lost One's grave,
69. Which he with flowers hath planted, finding there
70. Amusement, where the Mother does not miss
71. Dear consolation, kneeling on the turf
72. In prayer, yet blending with that solemn rite
73. Of pious faith the vanities of grief;
74. For such, by pitying Angels and by Spirits
75. Transferred to regions upon which the clouds
76. Of our weak nature rest not, must be deemed
77. Those willing tears, and unforbidden sighs,
78. And all those tokens of a cherished sorrow,
79. Which, soothed and sweetened by the grace of Heaven
80. As now it is, seems to her own fond heart,
81. Immortal as the love that gave it being.
