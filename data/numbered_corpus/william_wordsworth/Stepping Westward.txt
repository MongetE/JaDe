1. "What, you are stepping westward?"--"Yea."

2. ---'T would be a wildish destiny,
3. If we, who thus together roam
4. In a strange land, and far from home,
5. Were in this place the guests of Chance:
6. Yet who would stop, or fear to advance,
7. Though home or shelter he had none,
8. With such a sky to lead him on?

9. The dewy ground was dark and cold;
10. Behind, all gloomy to behold;
11. And stepping westward seemed to be
12. A kind of heavenly destiny:
13. I liked the greeting; 't was a sound
14. Of something without place or bound;
15. And seemed to give me spiritual right
16. To travel through that region bright.

17. The voice was soft, and she who spake
18. Was walking by her native lake:
19. The salutation had to me
20. The very sound of courtesy:
21. Its power was felt; and while my eye
22. Was fixed upon the glowing sky,
23. The echo of the voice enwrought
24. A human sweetness with the thought
25. Of travelling through the world that lay
26. Before me in my endless way.
