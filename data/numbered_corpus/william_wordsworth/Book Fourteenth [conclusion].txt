1. In one of those excursions (may they ne'er
2. Fade from remembrance!) through the Northern tracts
3. Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend,
4. I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time,
5. And westward took my way, to see the sun
6. Rise, from the top of Snowdon. To the door
7. Of a rude cottage at the mountain's base
8. We came, and roused the shepherd who attends
9. The adventurous stranger's steps, a trusty guide;
10. Then, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth.

11. It was a close, warm, breezeless summer night,
12. Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fog
13. Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky;
14. But, undiscouraged, we began to climb
15. The mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,
16. And, after ordinary travellers' talk
17. With our conductor, pensively we sank
18. Each into commerce with his private thoughts:
19. Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself
20. Was nothing either seen or heard that checked
21. Those musings or diverted, save that once
22. The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the crags,
23. Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased
24. His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.
25. This small adventure, for even such it seemed
26. In that wild place and at the dead of night,
27. Being over and forgotten, on we wound
28. In silence as before. With forehead bent
29. Earthward, as if in opposition set
30. Against an enemy, I panted up
31. With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.
32. Thus might we wear a midnight hour away,
33. Ascending at loose distance each from each,
34. And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band;
35. When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,
36. And with a step or two seemed brighter still;
37. Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause,
38. For instantly a light upon the turf
39. Fell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,
40. The Moon hung naked in a firmament
41. Of azure without cloud, and at my feet
42. Rested a silent sea of hoary mist.
43. A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved
44. All over this still ocean; and beyond,
45. Far, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched,
46. In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,
47. Into the main Atlantic, that appeared
48. To dwindle, and give up his majesty,
49. Usurped upon far as the sight could reach.
50. Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none
51. Was there, nor loss; only the inferior stars
52. Had disappeared, or shed a fainter light
53. In the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon,
54. Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazed
55. Upon the billowy ocean, as it lay
56. All meek and silent, save that through a rift--
57. Not distant from the shore whereon we stood,
58. A fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place--
59. Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams
60. Innumerable, roaring with one voice!
61. Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,
62. For so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens.

63. When into air had partially dissolved
64. That vision, given to spirits of the night
65. And three chance human wanderers, in calm thought
66. Reflected, it appeared to me the type
67. Of a majestic intellect, its acts
68. And its possessions, what it has and craves,
69. What in itself it is, and would become.
70. There I beheld the emblem of a mind
71. That feeds upon infinity, that broods
72. Over the dark abyss, intent to hear
73. Its voices issuing forth to silent light
74. In one continuous stream; a mind sustained
75. By recognitions of transcendent power,
76. In sense conducting to ideal form,
77. In soul of more than mortal privilege.
78. One function, above all, of such a mind
79. Had Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,
80. 'Mid circumstances awful and sublime,
81. That mutual domination which she loves
82. To exert upon the face of outward things,
83. So moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowed
84. With interchangeable supremacy,
85. That men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive,
86. And cannot choose but feel. The power, which all
87. Acknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thus
88. To bodily sense exhibits, is the express
89. Resemblance of that glorious faculty
90. That higher minds bear with them as their own.
91. This is the very spirit in which they deal
92. With the whole compass of the universe:
93. They from their native selves can send abroad
94. Kindred mutations; for themselves create
95. A like existence; and, whene'er it dawns
96. Created for them, catch it, or are caught
97. By its inevitable mastery,
98. Like angels stopped upon the wing by sound
99. Of harmony from Heaven's remotest spheres.
100. Them the enduring and the transient both
101. Serve to exalt; they build up greatest things
102. From least suggestions; ever on the watch,
103. Willing to work and to be wrought upon,
104. They need not extraordinary calls
105. To rouse them; in a world of life they live,
106. By sensible impressions not enthralled,
107. But by their quickening impulse made more prompt
108. To hold fit converse with the spiritual world,
109. And with the generations of mankind
110. Spread over time, past, present, and to come,
111. Age after age, till Time shall be no more.
112. Such minds are truly from the Deity,
113. For they are Powers; and hence the highest bliss
114. That flesh can know is theirs--the consciousness
115. Of Whom they are, habitually infused
116. Through every image and through every thought,
117. And all affections by communion raised
118. From earth to heaven, from human to divine;
119. Hence endless occupation for the Soul,
120. Whether discursive or intuitive;
121. Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life,
122. Emotions which best foresight need not fear,
123. Most worthy then of trust when most intense.
124. Hence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that crush
125. Our hearts--if here the words of Holy Writ
126. May with fit reverence be applied--that peace
127. Which passeth understanding, that repose
128. In moral judgments which from this pure source
129. Must come, or will by man be sought in vain.

130. Oh! who is he that hath his whole life long
131. Preserved, enlarged, this freedom in himself?
132. For this alone is genuine liberty:
133. Where is the favoured being who hath held
134. That course unchecked, unerring, and untired,
135. In one perpetual progress smooth and bright?--
136. A humbler destiny have we retraced,
137. And told of lapse and hesitating choice,
138. And backward wanderings along thorny ways:
139. Yet--compassed round by mountain solitudes,
140. Within whose solemn temple I received
141. My earliest visitations, careless then
142. Of what was given me; and which now I range,
143. A meditative, oft a suffering, man--
144. Do I declare--in accents which, from truth
145. Deriving cheerful confidence, shall blend
146. Their modulation with these vocal streams--
147. That, whatsoever falls my better mind,
148. Revolving with the accidents of life,
149. May have sustained, that, howsoe'er misled,
150. Never did I, in quest of right and wrong,
151. Tamper with conscience from a private aim;
152. Nor was in any public hope the dupe
153. Of selfish passions; nor did ever yield
154. Wilfully to mean cares or low pursuits,
155. But shrunk with apprehensive jealousy
156. From every combination which might aid
157. The tendency, too potent in itself,
158. Of use and custom to bow down the soul
159. Under a growing weight of vulgar sense,
160. And substitute a universe of death
161. For that which moves with light and life informed,
162. Actual, divine, and true. To fear and love,
163. To love as prime and chief, for there fear ends,
164. Be this ascribed; to early intercourse,
165. In presence of sublime or beautiful forms,
166. With the adverse principles of pain and joy--
167. Evil as one is rashly named by men
168. Who know not what they speak. By love subsists
169. All lasting grandeur, by pervading love;
170. That gone, we are as dust.--Behold the fields
171. In balmy spring-time full of rising flowers
172. And joyous creatures; see that pair, the lamb
173. And the lamb's mother, and their tender ways
174. Shall touch thee to the heart; thou callest this love,
175. And not inaptly so, for love it is,
176. Far as it carries thee. In some green bower
177. Rest, and be not alone, but have thou there
178. The One who is thy choice of all the world:
179. There linger, listening, gazing, with delight
180. Impassioned, but delight how pitiable!
181. Unless this love by a still higher love
182. Be hallowed, love that breathes not without awe;
183. Love that adores, but on the knees of prayer,
184. By heaven inspired; that frees from chains the soul,
185. Lifted, in union with the purest, best,
186. Of earth-born passions, on the wings of praise
187. Bearing a tribute to the Almighty's Throne.

188. This spiritual Love acts not nor can exist
189. Without Imagination, which, in truth,
190. Is but another name for absolute power
191. And clearest insight, amplitude of mind,
192. And Reason in her most exalted mood.
193. This faculty hath been the feeding source
194. Of our long labour: we have traced the stream
195. From the blind cavern whence is faintly heard
196. Its natal murmur; followed it to light
197. And open day; accompanied its course
198. Among the ways of Nature, for a time
199. Lost sight of it bewildered and engulphed;
200. Then given it greeting as it rose once more
201. In strength, reflecting from its placid breast
202. The works of man and face of human life;
203. And lastly, from its progress have we drawn
204. Faith in life endless, the sustaining thought
205. Of human Being, Eternity, and God.

206. Imagination having been our theme,
207. So also hath that intellectual Love,
208. For they are each in each, and cannot stand
209. Dividually.--Here must thou be, O Man!
210. Power to thyself; no Helper hast thou here;
211. Here keepest thou in singleness thy state:
212. No other can divide with thee this work:
213. No secondary hand can intervene
214. To fashion this ability; 'tis thine,
215. The prime and vital principle is thine
216. In the recesses of thy nature, far
217. From any reach of outward fellowship,
218. Else is not thine at all. But joy to him,
219. Oh, joy to him who here hath sown, hath laid
220. Here, the foundation of his future years!
221. For all that friendship, all that love can do,
222. All that a darling countenance can look
223. Or dear voice utter, to complete the man,
224. Perfect him, made imperfect in himself,
225. All shall be his: and he whose soul hath risen
226. Up to the height of feeling intellect
227. Shall want no humbler tenderness; his heart
228. Be tender as a nursing mother's heart;
229. Of female softness shall his life be full,
230. Of humble cares and delicate desires,
231. Mild interests and gentlest sympathies.

232. Child of my parents! Sister of my soul!
233. Thanks in sincerest verse have been elsewhere
234. Poured out for all the early tenderness
235. Which I from thee imbibed: and 'tis most true
236. That later seasons owed to thee no less;
237. For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touch
238. Of kindred hands that opened out the springs
239. Of genial thought in childhood, and in spite
240. Of all that unassisted I had marked
241. In life or nature of those charms minute
242. That win their way into the heart by stealth
243. (Still to the very going-out of youth)
244. I too exclusively esteemed 'that' love,
245. And sought 'that' beauty, which, as Milton sings,
246. Hath terror in it. Thou didst soften down
247. This over-sternness; but for thee, dear Friend!
248. My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had stood
249. In her original self too confident,
250. Retained too long a countenance severe;
251. A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds
252. Familiar, and a favourite of the stars:
253. But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers,
254. Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze,
255. And teach the little birds to build their nests
256. And warble in its chambers. At a time
257. When Nature, destined to remain so long
258. Foremost in my affections, had fallen back
259. Into a second place, pleased to become
260. A handmaid to a nobler than herself,
261. When every day brought with it some new sense
262. Of exquisite regard for common things,
263. And all the earth was budding with these gifts
264. Of more refined humanity, thy breath,
265. Dear Sister! was a kind of gentler spring
266. That went before my steps. Thereafter came
267. One whom with thee friendship had early paired;
268. She came, no more a phantom to adorn
269. A moment, but an inmate of the heart,
270. And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined
271. To penetrate the lofty and the low;
272. Even as one essence of pervading light
273. Shines, in the brightest of ten thousand stars
274. And the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp
275. Couched in the dewy grass.
276. With such a theme,
277. Coleridge! with this my argument, of thee
278. Shall I be silent? O capacious Soul!
279. Placed on this earth to love and understand,
280. And from thy presence shed the light of love,
281. Shall I be mute, ere thou be spoken of?
282. Thy kindred influence to my heart of hearts
283. Did also find its way. Thus fear relaxed
284. Her overweening grasp; thus thoughts and things
285. In the self-haunting spirit learned to take
286. More rational proportions; mystery,
287. The incumbent mystery of sense and soul,
288. Of life and death, time and eternity,
289. Admitted more habitually a mild
290. Interposition--a serene delight
291. In closelier gathering cares, such as become
292. A human creature, howsoe'er endowed,
293. Poet, or destined for a humbler name;
294. And so the deep enthusiastic joy,
295. The rapture of the hallelujah sent
296. From all that breathes and is, was chastened, stemmed
297. And balanced by pathetic truth, by trust
298. In hopeful reason, leaning on the stay
299. Of Providence; and in reverence for duty,
300. Here, if need be, struggling with storms, and there
301. Strewing in peace life's humblest ground with herbs,
302. At every season green, sweet at all hours.

303. And now, O Friend! this history is brought
304. To its appointed close: the discipline
305. And consummation of a Poet's mind,
306. In everything that stood most prominent,
307. Have faithfully been pictured; we have reached
308. The time (our guiding object from the first)
309. When we may, not presumptuously, I hope,
310. Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and such
311. My knowledge, as to make me capable
312. Of building up a Work that shall endure.
313. Yet much hath been omitted, as need was;
314. Of books how much! and even of the other wealth
315. That is collected among woods and fields,
316. Far more: for Nature's secondary grace
317. Hath hitherto been barely touched upon,
318. The charm more superficial that attends
319. Her works, as they present to Fancy's choice
320. Apt illustrations of the moral world,
321. Caught at a glance, or traced with curious pains.

322. Finally, and above all, O Friend! (I speak
323. With due regret) how much is overlooked
324. In human nature and her subtle ways,
325. As studied first in our own hearts, and then
326. In life among the passions of mankind,
327. Varying their composition and their hue,
328. Where'er we move, under the diverse shapes
329. That individual character presents
330. To an attentive eye. For progress meet,
331. Along this intricate and difficult path,
332. Whate'er was wanting, something had I gained,
333. As one of many schoolfellows compelled,
334. In hardy independence, to stand up
335. Amid conflicting interests, and the shock
336. Of various tempers; to endure and note
337. What was not understood, though known to be;
338. Among the mysteries of love and hate,
339. Honour and shame, looking to right and left,
340. Unchecked by innocence too delicate,
341. And moral notions too intolerant,
342. Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when called
343. To take a station among men, the step
344. Was easier, the transition more secure,
345. More profitable also; for, the mind
346. Learns from such timely exercise to keep
347. In wholesome separation the two natures,
348. The one that feels, the other that observes.

349. Yet one word more of personal concern;--
350. Since I withdrew unwillingly from France,
351. I led an undomestic wanderer's life,
352. In London chiefly harboured, whence I roamed,
353. Tarrying at will in many a pleasant spot
354. Of rural England's cultivated vales
355. Or Cambrian solitudes. A youth--(he bore
356. The name of Calvert--it shall live, if words
357. Of mine can give it life,) in firm belief
358. That by endowments not from me withheld
359. Good might be furthered--in his last decay
360. By a bequest sufficient for my needs
361. Enabled me to pause for choice, and walk
362. At large and unrestrained, nor damped too soon
363. By mortal cares. Himself no Poet, yet
364. Far less a common follower of the world,
365. He deemed that my pursuits and labours lay
366. Apart from all that leads to wealth, or even
367. A necessary maintenance insures,
368. Without some hazard to the finer sense;
369. He cleared a passage for me, and the stream
370. Flowed in the bent of Nature.
371. Having now
372. Told what best merits mention, further pains
373. Our present purpose seems not to require,
374. And I have other tasks. Recall to mind
375. The mood in which this labour was begun,
376. O Friend! The termination of my course
377. Is nearer now, much nearer; yet even then,
378. In that distraction and intense desire,
379. I said unto the life which I had lived,
380. Where art thou? Hear I not a voice from thee
381. Which 'tis reproach to hear? Anon I rose
382. As if on wings, and saw beneath me stretched
383. Vast prospect of the world which I had been
384. And was; and hence this Song, which, like a lark,
385. I have protracted, in the unwearied heavens
386. Singing, and often with more plaintive voice
387. To earth attempered and her deep-drawn sighs,
388. Yet centring all in love, and in the end
389. All gratulant, if rightly understood.

390. Whether to me shall be allotted life,
391. And, with life, power to accomplish aught of worth,
392. That will be deemed no insufficient plea
393. For having given the story of myself,
394. Is all uncertain: but, beloved Friend!
395. When, looking back, thou seest, in clearer view
396. Than any liveliest sight of yesterday,
397. That summer, under whose indulgent skies,
398. Upon smooth Quantock's airy ridge we roved
399. Unchecked, or loitered 'mid her sylvan combs,
400. Thou in bewitching words, with happy heart,
401. Didst chaunt the vision of that Ancient Man,
402. The bright-eyed Mariner, and rueful woes
403. Didst utter of the Lady Christabel;
404. And I, associate with such labour, steeped
405. In soft forgetfulness the livelong hours,
406. Murmuring of him who, joyous hap, was found,
407. After the perils of his moonlight ride,
408. Near the loud waterfall; or her who sate
409. In misery near the miserable Thorn--
410. When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts,
411. And hast before thee all which then we were,
412. To thee, in memory of that happiness,
413. It will be known, by thee at least, my Friend!
414. Felt, that the history of a Poet's mind
415. Is labour not unworthy of regard;
416. To thee the work shall justify itself.

417. The last and later portions of this gift
418. Have been prepared, not with the buoyant spirits
419. That were our daily portion when we first
420. Together wantoned in wild Poesy,
421. But, under pressure of a private grief,
422. Keen and enduring, which the mind and heart,
423. That in this meditative history
424. Have been laid open, needs must make me feel
425. More deeply, yet enable me to bear
426. More firmly; and a comfort now hath risen
427. From hope that thou art near, and wilt be soon
428. Restored to us in renovated health;
429. When, after the first mingling of our tears,
430. 'Mong other consolations, we may draw
431. Some pleasure from this offering of my love.

432. Oh! yet a few short years of useful life,
433. And all will be complete, thy race be run,
434. Thy monument of glory will be raised;
435. Then, though (too weak to tread the ways of truth)
436. This age fall back to old idolatry,
437. Though men return to servitude as fast
438. As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame,
439. By nations, sink together, we shall still
440. Find solace--knowing what we have learnt to know,
441. Rich in true happiness if allowed to be
442. Faithful alike in forwarding a day
443. Of firmer trust, joint labourers in the work
444. (Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe)
445. Of their deliverance, surely yet to come.
446. Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak
447. A lasting inspiration, sanctified
448. By reason, blest by faith: what we have loved,
449. Others will love, and we will teach them how;
450. Instruct them how the mind of man becomes
451. A thousand times more beautiful than the earth
452. On which he dwells, above this frame of things
453. (Which, 'mid all revolution in the hopes
454. And fears of men, doth still remain unchanged)
455. In beauty exalted, as it is itself
456. Of quality and fabric more divine.
