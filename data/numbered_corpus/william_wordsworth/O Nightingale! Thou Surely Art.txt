1. O Nightingale! thou surely art
2. A creature of a "fiery heart":--
3. These notes of thine--they pierce and pierce;
4. Tumultuous harmony and fierce!
5. Thou sing'st as if the God of wine
6. Had helped thee to a Valentine;
7. A song in mockery and despite
8. Of shades, and dews, and silent night;
9. And steady bliss, and all the loves
10. Now sleeping in these peaceful groves.
11. I heard a Stock-dove sing or say
12. His homely tale, this very day;
13. His voice was buried among trees,
14. Yet to be come at by the breeze:
15. He did not cease; but cooed--and cooed;
16. And somewhat pensively he wooed:
17. He sang of love, with quiet blending,
18. Slow to begin, and never ending;
19. Of serious faith, and inward glee;
20. That was the song -- the song for me!
