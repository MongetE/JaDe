1. It is the first mild day of March:
2. Each minute sweeter than before
3. The redbreast sings from the tall larch
4. That stands beside our door.

5. There is a blessing in the air,
6. Which seems a sense of joy to yield
7. To the bare trees, and mountains bare,
8. And grass in the green field.

9. My sister! ('tis a wish of mine)
10. Now that our morning meal is done,
11. Make haste, your morning task resign;
12. Come forth and feel the sun.

13. Edward will come with you;--and, pray,
14. Put on with speed your woodland dress;
15. And bring no book: for this one day
16. We'll give to idleness.
17. No joyless forms shall regulate
18. Our living calendar:
19. We from to-day, my Friend, will date
20. The opening of the year.

21. Love, now a universal birth,
22. From heart to heart is stealing,
23. From earth to man, from man to earth:
24. --It is the hour of feeling.

25. One moment now may give us more
26. Than years of toiling reason:
27. Our minds shall drink at every pore
28. The spirit of the season.

29. Some silent laws our hearts will make,
30. Which they shall long obey:
31. We for the year to come may take
32. Our temper from to-day.

33. And from the blessed power that rolls
34. About, below, above,
35. We'll frame the measure of our souls:
36. They shall be tuned to love.

37. Then come, my Sister! come, I pray,
38. With speed put on your woodland dress;
39. And bring no book: for this one day
40. We'll give to idleness.
