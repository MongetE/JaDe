1. ADVANCE-come forth from thy Tyrolean ground,
2. Dear Liberty! stern Nymph of soul untamed;
3. Sweet Nymph, O rightly of the mountains named!
4. Through the long chain of Alps from mound to mound
5. And o'er the eternal snows, like Echo, bound;
6. Like Echo, when the hunter train at dawn
7. Have roused her from her sleep: and forest-lawn,
8. Cliffs, woods and caves, her viewless steps resound
9. And babble of her pastime!-On, dread Power!
10. With such invisible motion speed thy flight,
11. Through hanging clouds, from craggy height to height,
12. Through the green vales and through the herdsman's bower-
13. That all the Alps may gladden in thy might,
14. Here, there, and in all places at one hour.
