1. She had a tall man's height or more;
2. Her face from summer's noontide heat
3. No bonnet shaded, but she wore
4. A mantle, to her very feet
5. Descending with a graceful flow,
6. And on her head a cap as white as new-fallen snow.

7. Her skin was of Egyptian brown:
8. Haughty, as if her eye had seen
9. Its own light to a distance thrown,
10. She towered, fit person for a Queen
11. To lead those ancient Amazonian files;
12. Or ruling Bandit's wife among the Grecian isles.

13. Advancing, forth she stretched her hand
14. And begged an alms with doleful plea
15. That ceased not; on our English land
16. Such woes, I knew, could never be;
17. And yet a boon I gave her, for the creature
18. Was beautiful to see-a weed of glorious feature.

19. I left her, and pursued my way;
20. And soon before me did espy
21. A pair of little Boys at play,
22. Chasing a crimson butterfly;
23. The taller followed with his hat in hand,
24. Wreathed round with yellow flowers the gayest of the land.

25. The other wore a rimless crown
26. With leaves of laurel stuck about;
27. And, while both followed up and down,
28. Each whooping with a merry shout,
29. In their fraternal features I could trace
30. Unquestionable lines of that wild Suppliant's face.

31. Yet 'they', so blithe of heart, seemed fit
32. For finest tasks of earth or air:
33. Wings let them have, and they might flit
34. Precursors to Aurora's car,
35. Scattering fresh flowers; though happier far, I ween,
36. To hunt their fluttering game o'er rock and level green.

37. They dart across my path-but lo,
38. Each ready with a plaintive whine!
39. Said I, 'not half an hour ago
40. Your Mother has had alms of mine.'
41. 'That cannot be,' one answered-'she is dead:'-
42. I looked reproof-they saw-but neither hung his head.

43. 'She has been dead, Sir, many a day.'-
44. 'Hush, boys! you're telling me a lie;
45. It was your Mother, as I say!'
46. And, in the twinkling of an eye,
47. 'Come! Come!' cried one, and without more ado,
48. Off to some other play the joyous Vagrants flew!
