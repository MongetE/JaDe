1. FLY, some kind Harbinger, to Grasmere-dale!
2. Say that we come, and come by this day's light;
3. Fly upon swiftest wing round field and height,
4. But chiefly let one Cottage hear the tale;
5. There let a mystery of joy prevail,
6. The kitten frolic, like a gamesome sprite,
7. And Rover whine, as at a second sight
8. Of near-approaching good that shall not fail:
9. And from that Infant's face let joy appear;
10. Yea, let our Mary's one companion child--
11. That hath her six weeks' solitude beguiled
12. With intimations manifold and dear,
13. While we have wandered over wood and wild--
14. Smile on his Mother now with bolder cheer.
