1. STAY near me---do not take thy flight!
2. A little longer stay in sight!
3. Much converse do I find I thee,
4. Historian of my infancy !
5. Float near me; do not yet depart!
6. Dead times revive in thee:
7. Thou bring'st, gay creature as thou art!
8. A solemn image to my heart,
9. My father's family!

10. Oh! pleasant, pleasant were the days,
11. The time, when, in our childish plays,
12. My sister Emmeline and I
13. Together chased the butterfly!
14. A very hunter did I rush
15. Upon the prey:---with leaps and spring
16. I followed on from brake to bush;
17. But she, God love her, feared to brush
18. The dust from off its wings.
