1. Before I see another day,
2. Oh let my body die away!
3. In sleep I heard the northern gleams;
4. The stars, they were among my dreams;
5. In rustling conflict through the skies,
6. I heard, I saw the flashes drive,
7. And yet they are upon my eyes,
8. And yet I am alive;
9. Before I see another day,
10. Oh let my body die away!

11. My fire is dead: it knew no pain;
12. Yet is it dead, and I remain:
13. All stiff with ice the ashes lie;
14. And they are dead, and I will die.
15. When I was well, I wished to live,
16. For clothes, for warmth, for food, and fire;
17. But they to me no joy can give,
18. No pleasure now, and no desire.
19. Then here contented will I lie
20. Alone, I cannot fear to die.

21. Alas! ye might have dragged me on
22. Another day, a single one!
23. Too soon I yielded to despair;
24. Why did ye listen to my prayer
25. When ye were gone my limb were stronger;
26. And oh, how grievously I rue,
27. That, afterward, a little longer,
28. My friends, I did not follow you!
29. For strong and without pain I lay,
30. Dear friends, when ye were gone away.

31. My Child! they gave thee to another,
32. A woman who was not thy mother.
33. When from my arms my Babe they took,
34. On me how strangely did he look !
35. Through his whole body something ran,
36. A most strange working did I see;
37. ---As if he strove to be a man,
38. That he might pull the sledge for me:
39. And then he stretched his arm, how wild!
40. Oh mercy! like a helpless child.

41. My little joy! my little pride!
42. In two day more I must have died.
43. Then do not weep and grieve for me;
44. I feel I must have died with thee.
45. O wind, that o'er my head art flying
46. The way my friends their course did bend,
47. I should not feel the pain of dying,
48. Could I with thee a message end;
49. Too soon, my friend, ye went away;
50. For I had many thing to say.

51. I'll follow you across the snow;
52. Ye travel heavily and slow;
53. In spite of all my weary pain
54. I'll look upon your tent again.
55. ---My fire is dead, and snowy white
56. The water which beside it stood:
57. The wolf has come to me to-night,
58. And he has stolen away my food.
59. Forever left alone am I;
60. Then wherefore should I fear to die ?

61. Young as I am, my course is run,
62. I shall not see another sun;
63. I cannot lift my limb to know
64. If they have any life or no.
65. My poor forsaken child, if I
66. For once could have thee close to me,
67. With happy heart I then would die,
68. And my last thought would happy be;
69. But thou, dear Babe, art far away,
70. Nor shall I see another day.
