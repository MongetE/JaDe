1. LONG time his pulse hath ceased to beat
2. But benefits, his gift, we trace--
3. Expressed in every eye we meet
4. Round this dear Vale, his native place.

5. To stately Hall and Cottage rude
6. Flowed from his life what still they hold,
7. Light pleasures, every day, renewed;
8. And blessings half a century old.

9. Oh true of heart, of spirit gay,
10. Thy faults, where not already gone
11. From memory, prolong their stay
12. For charity's sweet sake alone.

13. Such solace find we for our loss;
14. And what beyond this thought we crave
15. Comes in the promise from the Cross,
16. Shining upon thy happy grave.
