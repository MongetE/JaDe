1. .   Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower
2. Of beauty is thy earthly dower!
3. Twice seven consenting years have shed
4. Their utmost bounty on thy head:
5. And these grey rocks; that household lawn;
6. Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;
7. This fall of water that doth make
8. A murmur near the silent lake;
9. This little bay; a quiet road
10. That holds in shelter thy Abode--
11. In truth together do ye seem
12. Like something fashioned in a dream;
13. Such Forms as from their covert peep
14. When earthly cares are laid asleep!
15. But, O fair Creature! in the light
16. Of common day, so heavenly bright,
17. I bless Thee, Vision as thou art,
18. I bless thee with a human heart;
19. God shield thee to thy latest years!
20. Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers;
21. And yet my eyes are filled with tears.

22. With earnest feeling I shall pray
23. For thee when I am far away:
24. For never saw I mien, or face,
25. In which more plainly I could trace
26. Benignity and home-bred sense
27. Ripening in perfect innocence.
28. Here scattered, like a random seed,
29. Remote from men, Thou dost not need
30. The embarrassed look of shy distress,
31. And maidenly shamefacedness:
32. Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear
33. The freedom of a Mountaineer:
34. A face with gladness overspread!
35. Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!
36. And seemliness complete, that sways
37. Thy courtesies, about thee plays;
38. With no restraint, but such as springs
39. From quick and eager visitings
40. Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach
41. Of thy few words of English speech:
42. A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife
43. That gives thy gestures grace and life!
44. So have I, not unmoved in mind,
45. Seen birds of tempest-loving kind--
46. Thus beating up against the wind.

47. What hand but would a garland cull
48. For thee who art so beautiful?
49. O happy pleasure! here to dwell
50. Beside thee in some heathy dell;
51. Adopt your homely ways, and dress,
52. A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!
53. But I could frame a wish for thee
54. More like a grave reality:
55. Thou art to me but as a wave
56. Of the wild sea; and I would have
57. Some claim upon thee, if I could,
58. Though but of common neighbourhood.
59. What joy to hear thee, and to see!
60. Thy elder Brother I would be,
61. Thy Father--anything to thee!

62. Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace
63. Hath led me to this lonely place.
64. Joy have I had; and going hence
65. I bear away my recompense.
66. In spots like these it is we prize
67. Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes:
68. Then, why should I be loth to stir?
69. I feel this place was made for her;
70. To give new pleasure like the past,
71. Continued long as life shall last.
72. Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,
73. Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part;
74. For I, methinks, till I grow old,
75. As fair before me shall behold,
76. As I do now, the cabin small,
77. The lake, the bay, the waterfall;
78. And thee, the spirit of them all!
