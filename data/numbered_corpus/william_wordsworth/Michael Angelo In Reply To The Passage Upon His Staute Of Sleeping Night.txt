1. 'Night Speaks'

2. GRATEFUL is Sleep, my life in stone bound fast;
3. More grateful still: while wrong and shame shall last,
4. On me can Time no happier state bestow
5. Than to be left unconscious of the woe.
6. Ah then, lest you awaken me, speak low.
7. Grateful is Sleep, more grateful still to be
8. Of marble; for while shameless wrong and woe
9. Prevail, 'tis best to neither hear nor see.
10. Then wake me not, I pray you. Hush, speak low.
11. Come, gentle Sleep, Death's image tho' thou art,
12. Come share my couch, nor speedily depart;
13. How sweet thus living without life to lie,
14. Thus without death how sweet it is to die.
