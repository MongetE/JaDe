1. --Was it for this
2. That one, the fairest of all Rivers, lov'd
3. To blend his murmurs with my Nurse's song,
4. And from his alder shades and rocky falls,
5. And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice
6. That flow'd along my dreams? For this, didst Thou,
7. O Derwent! travelling over the green Plains
8. Near my 'sweet Birthplace', didst thou, beauteous Stream
9. Make ceaseless music through the night and day
10. Which with its steady cadence, tempering
11. Our human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts
12. To more than infant softness, giving me,
13. Among the fretful dwellings of mankind,
14. A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm
15. That Nature breathes among the hills and groves.
16. When, having left his Mountains, to the Towers
17. Of Cockermouth that beauteous River came,
18. Behind my Father's House he pass'd, close by,
19. Along the margin of our Terrace Walk.
20. He was a Playmate whom we dearly lov'd.
21. Oh! many a time have I, a five years' Child,
22. A naked Boy, in one delightful Rill,
23. A little Mill-race sever'd from his stream,
24. Made one long bathing of a summer's day,
25. Bask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again
26. Alternate all a summer's day, or cours'd
27. Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves
28. Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,
29. The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,
30. Were bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone
31. Beneath the sky, as if I had been born
32. On Indian Plains, and from my Mother's hut
33. Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport,
34. A naked Savage, in the thunder shower.


35. Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up
36. Foster'd alike by beauty and by fear;
37. Much favour'd in my birthplace, and no less
38. In that beloved Vale to which, erelong,
39. I was transplanted. Well I call to mind
40. ('Twas at an early age, ere I had seen
41. Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope
42. The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd
43. The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy
44. To wander half the night among the Cliffs
45. And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran
46. Along the open turf. In thought and wish
47. That time, my shoulder all with springes hung,
48. I was a fell destroyer. On the heights
49. Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied
50. My anxious visitation, hurrying on,
51. Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars
52. Were shining o'er my head; I was alone,
53. And seem'd to be a trouble to the peace
54. That was among them. Sometimes it befel
55. In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire
56. O'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird
57. Which was the captive of another's toils
58. Became my prey; and, when the deed was done
59. I heard among the solitary hills
60. Low breathings coming after me, and sounds
61. Of undistinguishable motion, steps
62. Almost as silent as the turf they trod.
63. Nor less in springtime when on southern banks
64. The shining sun had from his knot of leaves
65. Decoy'd the primrose flower, and when the Vales
66. And woods were warm, was I a plunderer then
67. In the high places, on the lonesome peaks
68. Where'er, among the mountains and the winds,
69. The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean
70. My object, and inglorious, yet the end
71. Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung
72. Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass
73. And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock
74. But ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd,
75. Suspended by the blast which blew amain,
76. Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time,
77. While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,
78. With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind
79. Blow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky
80. Of earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds!


81. The mind of Man is fram'd even like the breath
82. And harmony of music. There is a dark
83. Invisible workmanship that reconciles
84. Discordant elements, and makes them move
85. In one society. Ah me! that all
86. The terrors, all the early miseries
87. Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all
88. The thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd
89. Into my mind, should ever have made up
90. The calm existence that is mine when I
91. Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!
92. Thanks likewise for the means! But I believe
93. That Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame
94. A favor'd Being, from his earliest dawn
95. Of infancy doth open out the clouds,
96. As at the touch of lightning, seeking him
97. With gentlest visitation; not the less,
98. Though haply aiming at the self-same end,
99. Does it delight her sometimes to employ
100. Severer interventions, ministry
101. More palpable, and so she dealt with me.


102. One evening (surely I was led by her)
103. I went alone into a Shepherd's Boat,
104. A Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied
105. Within a rocky Cave, its usual home.
106. 'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale
107. Wherein I was a Stranger, thither come
108. A School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays.
109. Forth rambled from the Village Inn alone
110. No sooner had I sight of this small Skiff,
111. Discover'd thus by unexpected chance,
112. Than I unloos'd her tether and embark'd.
113. The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear
114. Among the hoary mountains; from the Shore
115. I push'd, and struck the oars and struck again
116. In cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on
117. Even like a Man who walks with stately step
118. Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth
119. And troubled pleasure; not without the voice
120. Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on,
121. Leaving behind her still on either side
122. Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
123. Until they melted all into one track
124. Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose
125. Above the Cavern of the Willow tree
126. And now, as suited one who proudly row'd
127. With his best skill, I fix'd a steady view
128. Upon the top of that same craggy ridge,
129. The bound of the horizon, for behind
130. Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
131. She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily
132. I dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake,
133. And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat
134. Went heaving through the water, like a Swan;
135. When from behind that craggy Steep, till then
136. The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff,
137. As if with voluntary power instinct,
138. Uprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again
139. And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff
140. Rose up between me and the stars, and still,
141. With measur'd motion, like a living thing,
142. Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd,
143. And through the silent water stole my way
144. Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree.
145. There, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark,
146. And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave
147. And serious thoughts; and after I had seen
148. That spectacle, for many days, my brain
149. Work'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense
150. Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts
151. There was a darkness, call it solitude,
152. Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes
153. Of hourly objects, images of trees,
154. Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;
155. But huge and mighty Forms that do not live
156. Like living men mov'd slowly through the mind
157. By day and were the trouble of my dreams.


158. Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
159. Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought!
160. That giv'st to forms and images a breath
161. And everlasting motion! not in vain,
162. By day or star-light thus from my first dawn
163. Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me
164. The passions that build up our human Soul,
165. Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man,
166. But with high objects, with enduring things,
167. With life and nature, purifying thus
168. The elements of feeling and of thought,
169. And sanctifying, by such discipline,
170. Both pain and fear, until we recognize
171. A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.


172. Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me
173. With stinted kindness. In November days,
174. When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made
175. A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods
176. At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
177. When, by the margin of the trembling Lake,
178. Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went
179. In solitude, such intercourse was mine;
180. 'Twas mine among the fields both day and night,
181. And by the waters all the summer long.


182. And in the frosty season, when the sun
183. Was set, and visible for many a mile
184. The cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd,
185. I heeded not the summons:--happy time
186. It was, indeed, for all of us; to me
187. It was a time of rapture: clear and loud
188. The village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd about,
189. Proud and exulting, like an untired horse,
190. That cares not for its home.--All shod with steel,
191. We hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games
192. Confederate, imitative of the chace
193. And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,
194. The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare.
195. So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
196. And not a voice was idle; with the din,
197. Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,
198. The leafless trees, and every icy crag
199. Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills
200. Into the tumult sent an alien sound
201. Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,
202. Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west
203. The orange sky of evening died away.


204. Not seldom from the uproar I retired
205. Into a silent bay, or sportively
206. Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
207. To cut across the image of a star
208. That gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes
209. When we had given our bodies to the wind,
210. And all the shadowy banks, on either side,
211. Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
212. The rapid line of motion; then at once
213. Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
214. Stopp'd short, yet still the solitary Cliffs
215. Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd
216. With visible motion her diurnal round;
217. Behind me did they stretch in solemn train
218. Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watch'd
219. Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.


220. Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky
221. And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!
222. And Souls of lonely places! can I think
223. A vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd
224. Such ministry, when Ye through many a year
225. Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,
226. On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,
227. Impress'd upon all forms the characters
228. Of danger or desire, and thus did make
229. The surface of the universal earth
230. With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear,
231. Work like a sea?       Not uselessly employ'd,
232. I might pursue this theme through every change
233. Of exercise and play, to which the year
234. Did summon us in its delightful round.


235. We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven
236. Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours,
237. Nor saw a race in happiness and joy
238. More worthy of the ground where they were sown.
239. I would record with no reluctant voice
240. The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers
241. With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,
242. True symbol of the foolishness of hope,
243. Which with its strong enchantment led us on
244. By rocks and pools, shut out from every star
245. All the green summer, to forlorn cascades
246. Among the windings of the mountain brooks.
247. --Unfading recollections! at this hour
248. The heart is almost mine with which I felt
249. From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons
250. The Kite high up among the fleecy clouds
251. Pull at its rein, like an impatient Courser,
252. Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,
253. Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly
254. Dash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm.


255. Ye lowly Cottages in which we dwelt,
256. A ministration of your own was yours,
257. A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love!
258. Can I forget you, being as ye were
259. So beautiful among the pleasant fields
260. In which ye stood? Or can I here forget
261. The plain and seemly countenance with which
262. Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye
263. Delights and exultations of your own.
264. Eager and never weary we pursued
265. Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire
266. At evening; when with pencil and with slate,
267. In square divisions parcell'd out, and all
268. With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,
269. We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head
270. In strife too humble to be named in Verse.
271. Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,
272. Cherry or maple, sate in close array,
273. And to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on
274. thick-ribbed Army; not as in the world
275. Neglected and ungratefully thrown by
276. Even for the very service they had wrought,
277. But husbanded through many a long campaign.
278. Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few
279. Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards,
280. Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth
281. Had glorified, and call'd to represent
282. The persons of departed Potentates.
283. Oh! with what echoes on the Board they fell!
284. Ironic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades,
285. A congregation piteously akin.
286. Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit,
287. Those sooty knaves, precipitated down
288. With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven,
289. The paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse,
290. Queens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay,
291. And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd
292. By royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad
293. The heavy rain was falling, or the frost
294. Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth,
295. And, interrupting oft the impassion'd game,
296. From Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting ice,
297. While it sank down towards the water, sent,
298. Among the meadows and the hills, its long
299. And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves
300. When they are howling round the Bothnic Main.


301. Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace
302. How Nature by extrinsic passion first
303. Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand,
304. And made me love them, may I well forget
305. How other pleasures have been mine, and joys
306. Of subtler origin; how I have felt,
307. Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time,
308. Those hallow'd and pure motions of the sense
309. Which seem, in their simplicity, to own
310. An intellectual charm, that calm delight
311. Which, if I err not, surely must belong
312. To those first-born affinities that fit
313. Our new existence to existing things,
314. And, in our dawn of being, constitute
315. The bond of union betwixt life and joy.


316. Yes, I remember, when the changeful earth,
317. And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd
318. The faces of the moving year, even then,
319. A Child, I held unconscious intercourse
320. With the eternal Beauty, drinking in
321. A pure organic pleasure from the lines
322. Of curling mist, or from the level plain
323. Of waters colour'd by the steady clouds.


324. The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays
325. Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell
326. How when the Sea threw off his evening shade
327. And to the Shepherd's huts beneath the crags
328. Did send sweet notice of the rising moon,
329. How I have stood, to fancies such as these,
330. Engrafted in the tenderness of thought,
331. A stranger, linking with the spectacle
332. No conscious memory of a kindred sight,
333. And bringing with me no peculiar sense
334. Of quietness or peace, yet I have stood,
335. Even while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues
336. Of shining water, gathering, as it seem'd,
337. Through every hair-breadth of that field of light,
338. New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.


339. Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy
340. Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits
341. Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss
342. Which, like a tempest, works along the blood
343. And is forgotten; even then I felt
344. Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth
345. And common face of Nature spake to me
346. Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,
347. By chance collisions and quaint accidents
348. Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd
349. Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain
350. Nor profitless, if haply they impress'd
351. Collateral objects and appearances,
352. Albeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep
353. Until maturer seasons call'd them forth
354. To impregnate and to elevate the mind.
355. --And if the vulgar joy by its own weight
356. Wearied itself out of the memory,
357. The scenes which were a witness of that joy
358. Remained, in their substantial lineaments
359. Depicted on the brain, and to the eye
360. Were visible, a daily sight; and thus
361. By the impressive discipline of fear,
362. By pleasure and repeated happiness,
363. So frequently repeated, and by force
364. Of obscure feelings representative
365. Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,
366. So beauteous and majestic in themselves,
367. Though yet the day was distant, did at length
368. Become habitually dear, and all
369. Their hues and forms were by invisible links
370. Allied to the affections.       I began
371. My story early, feeling as I fear,
372. The weakness of a human love, for days
373. Disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring
374. Planting my snowdrops among winter snows.
375. Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt
376. In sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out,
377. With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale.
378. Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch
379. Invigorating thoughts from former years,
380. Might fix the wavering balance of my wind,
381. And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power
382. May spur me on, in manhood now mature,
383. To honorable toil. Yet should these hopes
384. Be vain, and thus should neither I be taught
385. To understand myself, nor thou to know
386. With better knowledge how the heart was fram'd
387. Of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee
388. Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit
389. Those recollected hours that have the charm
390. Of visionary things, and lovely forms
391. And sweet sensations that throw back our life
392. And almost make our Infancy itself
393. A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?


394. One end hereby at least hath been attain'd,
395. My mind hath been revived, and if this mood
396. Desert me not, I will forthwith bring down,
397. Through later years, the story of my life.
398. The road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme
399. Single and of determined bounds; and hence
400. I chuse it rather at this time, than work
401. Of ampler or more varied argument.
