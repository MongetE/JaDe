1. Our walk was far among the ancient trees:
2. There was no road, nor any woodman's path;
3. But a thick umbrage--checking the wild growth
4. Of weed and sapling, along soft green turf
5. Beneath the branches--of itself had made
6. A track, that brought us to a slip of lawn,
7. And a small bed of water in the woods.
8. All round this pool both flocks and herds might drink
9. On its firm margin, even as from a well,
10. Or some stone-basin which the herdsman's hand
11. Had shaped for their refreshment; nor did sun,
12. Or wind from any quarter, ever come,
13. But as a blessing to this calm recess,
14. This glade of water and this one green field.
15. The spot was made by Nature for herself;
16. The travellers know it not, and 'twill remain
17. Unknown to them; but it is beautiful;
18. And if a man should plant his cottage near,
19. Should sleep beneath the shelter of its trees,
20. And blend its waters with his daily meal,
21. He would so love it, that in his death-hour
22. Its image would survive among his thoughts:
23. And therefore, my sweet MARY, this still Nook,
24. With all its beeches, we have named from You!
