1. YOUNG ENGLAND--what is then become of Old
2. Of dear Old England? Think they she is dead,
3. Dead to the very name? Presumption fed
4. On empty air! That name will keep its hold
5. In the true filial bosom's inmost fold
6. For ever.--The Spirit of Alfred, at the head
7. Of all who for her rights watched, toiled and bled,
8. Knows that this prophecy is not too bold.
9. What--how! shall she submit in will and deed
10. To Beardless Boys--an imitative race,
11. The 'servum pecus' of a Gallic breed?
12. Dear Mother! if thou 'must' thy steps retrace,
13. Go where at least meek Innocency dwells;
14. Let Babes and Sucklings be thy oracles.
