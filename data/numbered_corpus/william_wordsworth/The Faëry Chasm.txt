1. No fiction was it of the antique age:
2. A sky-blue stone, within this sunless cleft,
3. Is of the very footmarks unbereft
4. Which tiny Elves impressed; - on that smooth stage
5. Dancing with all their brilliant equipage
6. In secret revels - haply after theft
7. Of some sweet Babe - Flower stolen, and coarse Weed left
8. For the distracted Mother to assuage
9. Her grief with, as she might! - But, where, oh! where
10. Is traceable a vestige of the notes
11. That ruled those dances wild in character? -
12. Deep underground? Or in the upper air,
13. On the shrill wind of midnight? or where floats
14. O'er twilight fields the autumnal gossamer?
