1. . Departing summer hath assumed
2. An aspect tenderly illumed,
3. The gentlest look of spring;
4. That calls from yonder leafy shade
5. Unfaded, yet prepared to fade,
6. A timely carolling.
7. No faint and hesitating trill,
8. Such tribute as to winter chill
9. The lonely redbreast pays!
10. Clear, loud, and lively is the din,
11. From social warblers gathering in
12. Their harvest of sweet lays.

13. Nor doth the example fail to cheer
14. Me, conscious that my leaf is sere,
15. And yellow on the bough:-
16. Fall, rosy garlands, from my head!
17. Ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed
18. Around a younger brow!

19. Yet will I temperately rejoice;
20. Wide is the range, and free the choice
21. Of undiscordant themes;
22. Which, haply, kindred souls may prize
23. Not less than vernal ecstasies,
24. And passion's feverish dreams.

25. For deathless powers to verse belong,
26. And they like Demi-gods are strong
27. On whom the Muses smile;
28. But some their function have disclaimed,
29. Best pleased with what is aptliest framed
30. To enervate and defile.

31. Not such the initiatory strains
32. Committed to the silent plains
33. In Britain's earliest dawn:
34. Trembled the groves, the stars grew pale,
35. While all-too-daringly the veil
36. Of nature was withdrawn!

37. Nor such the spirit-stirring note
38. When the live chords Alcæus smote,
39. Inflamed by sense of wrong;
40. Woe! woe to Tyrants! from the lyre
41. Broke threateningly, in sparkles dire
42. Of fierce vindictive song.

43. And not unhallowed was the page
44. By wingèd Love inscribed, to assuage
45. The pangs of vain pursuit;
46. Love listening while the Lesbian Maid
47. With finest touch of passion swayed
48. Her own Æolian lute.

49. O ye, who patiently explore
50. The wreck of Herculanean lore,
51. What rapture! could ye seize
52. Some Theban fragment, or unroll
53. One precious, tender-hearted scroll
54. Of pure Simonides.

55. That were, indeed, a genuine birth
56. Of poesy; a bursting forth
57. Of genius from the dust:
58. What Horace gloried to behold,
59. What Maro loved, shall we enfold?
60. Can haughty Time be just!
