1. BEHOLD, within the leafy shade,
2. Those bright blue eggs together laid!
3. On me the chance-discovered sight
4. Gleamed like a vision of delight.
5. I started---seeming to espy
6. The home and sheltered bed,
7. The Sparrow's dwelling, which, hard by
8. My Father' house, in wet or dry
9. My sister Emmeline and I
10. Together visited.

11. She looked at it and seemed to fear it;
12. Dreading, tho' wishing, to be near it:
13. Such heart was in her, being then
14. A little Prattler among men.
15. The Blessing of my later year
16. Was with me when a boy:
17. She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;
18. And humble care, and delicate fears;
19. A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;
20. And love, and thought, and joy.
