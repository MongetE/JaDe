1. I saw an aged Beggar in my walk;
2. And he was seated, by the highway side,
3. On a low structure of rude masonry
4. Built at the foot of a huge hill, that they
5. Who lead their horses down the steep rough road
6. May thence remount at ease. The aged Man
7. Had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone
8. That overlays the pile; and, from a bag
9. All white with flour, the dole of village dames,
10. He drew his scraps and fragments, one by one;
11. And scanned them with a fixed and serious look
12. Of idle computation. In the sun,
13. Upon the second step of that small pile,
14. Surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills,
15. He sat, and ate his food in solitude:
16. And ever, scattered from his palsied hand,
17. That, still attempting to prevent the waste,
18. Was baffled still, the crumbs in little showers
19. Fell on the ground; and the small mountain birds,
20. Not venturing yet to peck their destined meal,
21. Approached within the length of half his staff.
22. Him from my childhood have I known; and then
23. He was so old, he seems not older now;
24. He travels on, a solitary Man,
25. So helpless in appearance, that for him
26. The sauntering Horseman throws not with a slack
27. And careless hand his alms upon the ground,
28. But stops,--that he may safely lodge the coin
29. Within the old Man's hat; nor quits him so,
30. But still, when he has given his horse the rein,
31. Watches the aged Beggar with a look
32. Sidelong, and half-reverted. She who tends
33. The toll-gate, when in summer at her door
34. She turns her wheel, if on the road she sees
35. The aged beggar coming, quits her work,
36. And lifts the latch for him that he may pass.
37. The post-boy, when his rattling wheels o'ertake
38. The aged Beggar in the woody lane,
39. Shouts to him from behind; and if, thus warned,
40. The old man does not change his course, the boy
41. Turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside,
42. And passes gently by, without a curse
43. Upon his lips, or anger at his heart.
44. He travels on, a solitary Man;
45. His age has no companion. On the ground
46. His eyes are turned, and, as he moves along
47. 'They' move along the ground; and, evermore,
48. Instead of common and habitual sight
49. Of fields with rural works, of hill and dale,
50. And the blue sky, one little span of earth
51. Is all his prospect. Thus, from day to day,
52. Bow-bent, his eyes for ever on the ground,
53. He plies his weary journey; seeing still,
54. And seldom knowing that he sees, some straw,
55. Some scattered leaf, or marks which, in one track,
56. The nails of cart or chariot-wheel have left
57. Impressed on the white road,--in the same line,
58. At distance still the same. Poor Traveller!
59. His staff trails with him; scarcely do his feet
60. Disturb the summer dust; he is so still
61. In look and motion, that the cottage curs,
62. Ere he has passed the door, will turn away,
63. Weary of barking at him. Boys and girls,
64. The vacant and the busy, maids and youths,
65. And urchins newly breeched--all pass him by:
66. Him even the slow-paced waggon leaves behind.
67. But deem not this Man useless.--Statesmen! ye
68. Who are so restless in your wisdom, ye
69. Who have a broom still ready in your hands
70. To rid the world of nuisances; ye proud,
71. Heart-swoln, while in your pride ye contemplate
72. Your talents, power, or wisdom, deem him not
73. A burthen of the earth! 'Tis Nature's law
74. That none, the meanest of created things,
75. Or forms created the most vile and brute,
76. The dullest or most noxious, should exist
77. Divorced from good--a spirit and pulse of good,
78. A life and soul, to every mode of being
79. Inseparably linked. Then be assured
80. That least of all can aught--that ever owned
81. The heaven-regarding eye and front sublime
82. Which man is born to--sink, howe'er depressed,
83. So low as to be scorned without a sin;
84. Without offence to God cast out of view;
85. Like the dry remnant of a garden-flower
86. Whose seeds are shed, or as an implement
87. Worn out and worthless. While from door to door,
88. This old Man creeps, the villagers in him
89. Behold a record which together binds
90. Past deeds and offices of charity,
91. Else unremembered, and so keeps alive
92. The kindly mood in hearts which lapse of years,
93. And that half-wisdom half-experience gives,
94. Make slow to feel, and by sure steps resign
95. To selfishness and cold oblivious cares.
96. Among the farms and solitary huts,
97. Hamlets and thinly-scattered villages,
98. Where'er the aged Beggar takes his rounds,
99. The mild necessity of use compels
100. To acts of love; and habit does the work 0
101. Of reason; yet prepares that after-joy
102. Which reason cherishes. And thus the soul,
103. By that sweet taste of pleasure unpursued,
104. Doth find herself insensibly disposed
105. To virtue and true goodness.
106. Some there are,
107. By their good works exalted, lofty minds
108. And meditative, authors of delight
109. And happiness, which to the end of time
110. Will live, and spread, and kindle: even such minds
111. In childhood, from this solitary Being,
112. Or from like wanderer, haply have received
113. (A thing more precious far than all that books
114. Or the solicitudes of love can do!)
115. That first mild touch of sympathy and thought,
116. In which they found their kindred with a world
117. Where want and sorrow were. The easy man
118. Who sits at his own door,--and, like the pear
119. That overhangs his head from the green wall,
120. Feeds in the sunshine; the robust and young,
121. The prosperous and unthinking, they who live
122. Sheltered, and flourish in a little grove
123. Of their own kindred;--all behold in him
124. A silent monitor, which on their minds
125. Must needs impress a transitory thought
126. Of self-congratulation, to the heart
127. Of each recalling his peculiar boons,
128. His charters and exemptions; and, perchance,
129. Though he to no one give the fortitude
130. And circumspection needful to preserve
131. His present blessings, and to husband up
132. The respite of the season, he, at least,
133. And 'tis no vulgar service, makes them felt.
134. Yet further.----Many, I believe, there are
135. Who live a life of virtuous decency,
136. Men who can hear the Decalogue and feel
137. No self-reproach; who of the moral law
138. Established in the land where they abide
139. Are strict observers; and not negligent
140. In acts of love to those with whom they dwell,
141. Their kindred, and the children of their blood.
142. Praise be to such, and to their slumbers peace!
143. --But of the poor man ask, the abject poor;
144. Go, and demand of him, if there be here
145. In this cold abstinence from evil deeds,
146. And these inevitable charities,
147. Wherewith to satisfy the human soul?
148. No--man is dear to man; the poorest poor
149. Long for some moments in a weary life
150. When they can know and feel that they have been,
151. Themselves, the fathers and the dealers-out
152. Of some small blessings; have been kind to such
153. As needed kindness, for this single cause,
154. That we have all of us one human heart.
155. --Such pleasure is to one kind Being known,
156. My neighbour, when with punctual care, each week
157. Duly as Friday comes, though pressed herself
158. By her own wants, she from her store of meal
159. Takes one unsparing handful for the scrip
160. Of this old Mendicant, and, from her door
161. Returning with exhilarated heart,
162. Sits by her fire, and builds her hope in heaven.
163. Then let him pass, a blessing on his head!
164. And while in that vast solitude to which
165. The tide of things has borne him, he appears
166. To breathe and live but for himself alone,
167. Unblamed, uninjured, let him bear about
168. The good which the benignant law of Heaven
169. Has hung around him: and, while life is his,
170. Still let him prompt the unlettered villagers
171. To tender offices and pensive thoughts.
172. --Then let him pass, a blessing on his head!
173. And, long as he can wander, let him breathe
174. The freshness of the valleys; let his blood
175. Struggle with frosty air and winter snows;
176. And let the chartered wind that sweeps the heath
177. Beat his grey locks against his withered face.
178. Reverence the hope whose vital anxiousness
179. Gives the last human interest to his heart.
180. May never HOUSE, misnamed of INDUSTRY,
181. Make him a captive!--for that pent-up din,
182. Those life-consuming sounds that clog the air,
183. Be his the natural silence of old age!
184. Let him be free of mountain solitudes;
185. And have around him, whether heard or not,
186. The pleasant melody of woodland birds.
187. Few are his pleasures: if his eyes have now
188. Been doomed so long to settle upon earth
189. That not without some effort they behold
190. The countenance of the horizontal sun,
191. Rising or setting, let the light at least
192. Find a free entrance to their languid orbs.
193. And let him, 'where' and 'when' he will, sit down
194. Beneath the trees, or on a grassy bank
195. Of highway side, and with the little birds
196. Share his chance-gathered meal; and, finally,
197. As in the eye of Nature he has lived,
198. So in the eye of Nature let him die!
