1. .   Another year!--another deadly blow!
2. Another mighty Empire overthrown!
3. And We are left, or shall be left, alone;
4. The last that dare to struggle with the Foe.
5. 'Tis well! from this day forward we shall know
6. That in ourselves our safety must be sought;
7. That by our own right hands it must be wrought;
8. That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.
9. O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!
10. We shall exult, if they who rule the land
11. Be men who hold its many blessings dear,
12. Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,
13. Who are to judge of danger which they fear,
14. And honour which they do not understand.
