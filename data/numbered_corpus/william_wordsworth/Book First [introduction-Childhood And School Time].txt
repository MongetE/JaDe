1. OH there is blessing in this gentle breeze,
2. A visitant that while it fans my cheek
3. Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings
4. From the green fields, and from yon azure sky.
5. Whate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come
6. To none more grateful than to me; escaped
7. From the vast city, where I long had pined
8. A discontented sojourner: now free,
9. Free as a bird to settle where I will.
10. What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale
11. Shall be my harbour? underneath what grove
12. Shall I take up my home? and what clear stream
13. Shall with its murmur lull me into rest?
14. The earth is all before me. With a heart
15. Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty,
16. I look about; and should the chosen guide
17. Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,
18. I cannot miss my way. I breathe again!
19. Trances of thought and mountings of the mind
20. Come fast upon me: it is shaken off,
21. That burthen of my own unnatural self,
22. The heavy weight of many a weary day
23. Not mine, and such as were not made for me.
24. Long months of peace (if such bold word accord
25. With any promises of human life),
26. Long months of ease and undisturbed delight
27. Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,
28. By road or pathway, or through trackless field,
29. Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing
30. Upon the river point me out my course?

31. Dear Liberty! Yet what would it avail
32. But for a gift that consecrates the joy?
33. For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven
34. Was blowing on my body, felt within
35. A correspondent breeze, that gently moved
36. With quickening virtue, but is now become
37. A tempest, a redundant energy,
38. Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,
39. And their congenial powers, that, while they join
40. In breaking up a long-continued frost,
41. Bring with them vernal promises, the hope
42. Of active days urged on by flying hours,--
43. Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought
44. Abstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,
45. Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!

46. Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make
47. A present joy the matter of a song,
48. Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains
49. That would not be forgotten, and are here
50. Recorded: to the open fields I told
51. A prophecy: poetic numbers came
52. Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe
53. A renovated spirit singled out,
54. Such hope was mine, for holy services.
55. My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's
56. Internal echo of the imperfect sound;
57. To both I listened, drawing from them both
58. A cheerful confidence in things to come.

59. Content and not unwilling now to give
60. A respite to this passion, I paced on
61. With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,
62. To a green shady place, where down I sate
63. Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice
64. And settling into gentler happiness.
65. 'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,
66. With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun
67. Two hours declined towards the west; a day
68. With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,
69. And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove
70. A perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts
71. Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was made
72. Of a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,
73. Nor rest till they had reached the very door
74. Of the one cottage which methought I saw.
75. No picture of mere memory ever looked
76. So fair; and while upon the fancied scene
77. I gazed with growing love, a higher power
78. Than Fancy gave assurance of some work
79. Of glory there forthwith to be begun,
80. Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,
81. Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,
82. Save when, amid the stately grove of oaks,
83. Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup
84. Dislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once
85. To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.
86. From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun
87. Had almost touched the horizon; casting then
88. A backward glance upon the curling cloud
89. Of city smoke, by distance ruralised;
90. Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,
91. But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,
92. Even with the chance equipment of that hour,
93. The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.
94. It was a splendid evening, and my soul
95. Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked
96. Aeolian visitations; but the harp
97. Was soon defrauded, and the banded host
98. Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,
99. And lastly utter silence! 'Be it so;
100. Why think of anything but present good?'
101. So, like a home-bound labourer, I pursued
102. My way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed
103. Mild influence; nor left in me one wish
104. Again to bend the Sabbath of that time
105. To a servile yoke. What need of many words?
106. A pleasant loitering journey, through three days
107. Continued, brought me to my hermitage.
108. I spare to tell of what ensued, the life
109. In common things--the endless store of things,
110. Rare, or at least so seeming, every day
111. Found all about me in one neighbourhood--
112. The self-congratulation, and, from morn
113. To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.
114. But speedily an earnest longing rose
115. To brace myself to some determined aim,
116. Reading or thinking; either to lay up
117. New stores, or rescue from decay the old
118. By timely interference: and therewith
119. Came hopes still higher, that with outward life
120. I might endue some airy phantasies
121. That had been floating loose about for years,
122. And to such beings temperately deal forth
123. The many feelings that oppressed my heart.
124. That hope hath been discouraged; welcome light
125. Dawns from the east, but dawns to disappear
126. And mock me with a sky that ripens not
127. Into a steady morning: if my mind,
128. Remembering the bold promise of the past,
129. Would gladly grapple with some noble theme,
130. Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds
131. Impediments from day to day renewed.

132. And now it would content me to yield up
133. Those lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts
134. Of humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!
135. The Poet, gentle creature as he is,
136. Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times;
137. His fits when he is neither sick nor well,
138. Though no distress be near him but his own
139. Unmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased
140. While she as duteous as the mother dove
141. Sits brooding, lives not always to that end,
142. But like the innocent bird, hath goadings on
143. That drive her as in trouble through the groves;
144. With me is now such passion, to be blamed
145. No otherwise than as it lasts too long.

146. When, as becomes a man who would prepare
147. For such an arduous work, I through myself
148. Make rigorous inquisition, the report
149. Is often cheering; for I neither seem
150. To lack that first great gift, the vital soul,
151. Nor general Truths, which are themselves a sort
152. Of Elements and Agents, Under-powers,
153. Subordinate helpers of the living mind:
154. Nor am I naked of external things,
155. Forms, images, nor numerous other aids
156. Of less regard, though won perhaps with toil
157. And needful to build up a Poet's praise.
158. Time, place, and manners do I seek, and these
159. Are found in plenteous store, but nowhere such
160. As may be singled out with steady choice;
161. No little band of yet remembered names
162. Whom I, in perfect confidence, might hope
163. To summon back from lonesome banishment,
164. And make them dwellers in the hearts of men
165. Now living, or to live in future years.
166. Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking
167. Proud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,
168. Will settle on some British theme, some old
169. Romantic tale by Milton left unsung;
170. More often turning to some gentle place
171. Within the groves of Chivalry, I pipe
172. To shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,
173. Amid reposing knights by a river side
174. Or fountain, listen to the grave reports
175. Of dire enchantments faced and overcome
176. By the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,
177. Where spear encountered spear, and sword with sword
178. Fought, as if conscious of the blazonry
179. That the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;
180. Whence inspiration for a song that winds
181. Through ever-changing scenes of votive quest
182. Wrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid
183. To patient courage and unblemished truth,
184. To firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,
185. And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.
186. Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate
187. How vanquished Mithridates northward passed,
188. And, hidden in the cloud of years, became
189. Odin, the Father of a race by whom
190. Perished the Roman Empire: how the friends
191. And followers of Sertorius, out of Spain
192. Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,
193. And left their usages, their arts and laws,
194. To disappear by a slow gradual death,
195. To dwindle and to perish one by one,
196. Starved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul
197. Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred years
198. Survived, and, when the European came
199. With skill and power that might not be withstood,
200. Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold
201. And wasted down by glorious death that race
202. Of natural heroes: or I would record
203. How, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,
204. Unnamed among the chronicles of kings,
205. Suffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,
206. How that one Frenchman, through continued force
207. Of meditation on the inhuman deeds
208. Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles,
209. Went single in his ministry across
210. The Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,
211. But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about
212. Withering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought
213. Help at his need in Dalecarlia's mines:
214. How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name
215. Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,
216. All over his dear Country; left the deeds
217. Of Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,
218. To people the steep rocks and river banks,
219. Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul
220. Of independence and stern liberty.
221. Sometimes it suits me better to invent
222. A tale from my own heart, more near akin
223. To my own passions and habitual thoughts;
224. Some variegated story, in the main
225. Lofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts
226. Before the very sun that brightens it,
227. Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish,
228. My last and favourite aspiration, mounts
229. With yearning toward some philosophic song
230. Of Truth that cherishes our daily life;
231. With meditations passionate from deep
232. Recesses in man's heart, immortal verse
233. Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;
234. But from this awful burthen I full soon
235. Take refuge and beguile myself with trust
236. That mellower years will bring a riper mind
237. And clearer insight. Thus my days are past
238. In contradiction; with no skill to part
239. Vague longing, haply bred by want of power,
240. From paramount impulse not to be withstood,
241. A timorous capacity, from prudence,
242. From circumspection, infinite delay.
243. Humility and modest awe, themselves
244. Betray me, serving often for a cloak
245. To a more subtle selfishness; that now
246. Locks every function up in blank reserve,
247. Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye
248. That with intrusive restlessness beats off
249. Simplicity and self-presented truth.
250. Ah! better far than this, to stray about
251. Voluptuously through fields and rural walks,
252. And ask no record of the hours, resigned
253. To vacant musing, unreproved neglect
254. Of all things, and deliberate holiday.
255. Far better never to have heard the name
256. Of zeal and just ambition, than to live
257. Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour
258. Turns recreant to her task; takes heart again,
259. Then feels immediately some hollow thought
260. Hang like an interdict upon her hopes.
261. This is my lot; for either still I find
262. Some imperfection in the chosen theme,
263. Or see of absolute accomplishment
264. Much wanting, so much wanting, in myself,
265. That I recoil and droop, and seek repose
266. In listlessness from vain perplexity,
267. Unprofitably travelling toward the grave,
268. Like a false steward who hath much received
269. And renders nothing back.
270. Was it for this
271. That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved
272. To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,
273. And, from his alder shades and rocky falls,
274. And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice
275. That flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,
276. O Derwent! winding among grassy holms
277. Where I was looking on, a babe in arms,
278. Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts
279. To more than infant softness, giving me
280. Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind
281. A foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm
282. That Nature breathes among the hills and groves.

283. When he had left the mountains and received
284. On his smooth breast the shadow of those towers
285. That yet survive, a shattered monument
286. Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed
287. Along the margin of our terrace walk;
288. A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.
289. Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child,
290. In a small mill-race severed from his stream,
291. Made one long bathing of a summer's day;
292. Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked again
293. Alternate, all a summer's day, or scoured
294. The sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves
295. Of yellow ragwort; or, when rock and hill,
296. The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,
297. Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone
298. Beneath the sky, as if I had been born
299. On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut
300. Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport
301. A naked savage, in the thunder shower.

302. Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up
303. Fostered alike by beauty and by fear:
304. Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less
305. In that beloved Vale to which erelong
306. We were transplanted;--there were we let loose
307. For sports of wider range. Ere I had told
308. Ten birth-days, when among the mountain slopes
309. Frost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped
310. The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy
311. With store of springes o'er my shoulder hung
312. To range the open heights where woodcocks run
313. Along the smooth green turf. Through half the night,
314. Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied
315. That anxious visitation;--moon and stars
316. Were shining o'er my head. I was alone,
317. And seemed to be a trouble to the peace
318. That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befell
319. In these night wanderings, that a strong desire
320. O'erpowered my better reason, and the bird
321. Which was the captive of another's toil
322. Became my prey; and when the deed was done
323. I heard among the solitary hills
324. Low breathings coming after me, and sounds
325. Of undistinguishable motion, steps
326. Almost as silent as the turf they trod.

327. Nor less, when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,
328. Moved we as plunderers where the mother-bird
329. Had in high places built her lodge; though mean
330. Our object and inglorious, yet the end
331. Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung
332. Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass
333. And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock
334. But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)
335. Suspended by the blast that blew amain,
336. Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time
337. While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,
338. With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind
339. Blow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky
340. Of earth--and with what motion moved the clouds!

341. Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows
342. Like harmony in music; there is a dark
343. Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles
344. Discordant elements, makes them cling together
345. In one society. How strange, that all
346. The terrors, pains, and early miseries,
347. Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused
348. Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,
349. And that a needful part, in making up
350. The calm existence that is mine when I
351. Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!
352. Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;
353. Whether her fearless visitings, or those
354. That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light
355. Opening the peaceful clouds; or she would use
356. Severer interventions, ministry
357. More palpable, as best might suit her aim.

358. One summer evening (led by her) I found
359. A little boat tied to a willow tree
360. Within a rocky cave, its usual home.
361. Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in
362. Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth
363. And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice
364. Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;
365. Leaving behind her still, on either side,
366. Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
367. Until they melted all into one track
368. Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,
369. Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point
370. With an unswerving line, I fixed my view
371. Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,
372. The horizon's utmost boundary; far above
373. Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
374. She was an elfin pinnace; lustily
375. I dipped my oars into the silent lake,
376. And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat
377. Went heaving through the water like a swan;
378. When, from behind that craggy steep till then
379. The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,
380. As if with voluntary power instinct,
381. Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,
382. And growing still in stature the grim shape
383. Towered up between me and the stars, and still,
384. For so it seemed, with purpose of its own
385. And measured motion like a living thing,
386. Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,
387. And through the silent water stole my way
388. Back to the covert of the willow tree;
389. There in her mooring-place I left my bark,--
390. And through the meadows homeward went, in grave
391. And serious mood; but after I had seen
392. That spectacle, for many days, my brain
393. Worked with a dim and undetermined sense
394. Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts
395. There hung a darkness, call it solitude
396. Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes
397. Remained, no pleasant images of trees,
398. Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;
399. But huge and mighty forms, that do not live
400. Like living men, moved slowly through the mind
401. By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.

402. Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
403. Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought
404. That givest to forms and images a breath
405. And everlasting motion, not in vain
406. By day or star-light thus from my first dawn
407. Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
408. The passions that build up our human soul;
409. Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,
410. But with high objects, with enduring things--
411. With life and nature--purifying thus
412. The elements of feeling and of thought,
413. And sanctifying, by such discipline,
414. Both pain and fear, until we recognise
415. A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.
416. Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
417. With stinted kindness. In November days,
418. When vapours rolling down the valley made
419. A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods,
420. At noon and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
421. When, by the margin of the trembling lake,
422. Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went
423. In solitude, such intercourse was mine;
424. Mine was it in the fields both day and night,
425. And by the waters, all the summer long.

426. And in the frosty season, when the sun
427. Was set, and visible for many a mile
428. The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,
429. I heeded not their summons: happy time
430. It was indeed for all of us--for me
431. It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud
432. The village clock tolled six,--I wheeled about,
433. Proud and exulting like an untired horse
434. That cares not for his home. All shod with steel,
435. We hissed along the polished ice in games
436. Confederate, imitative of the chase
437. And woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,
438. The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.
439. So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
440. And not a voice was idle; with the din
441. Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;
442. The leafless trees and every icy crag
443. Tinkled like iron; while far distant hills
444. Into the tumult sent an alien sound
445. Of melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars
446. Eastward were sparkling clear, and in the west
447. The orange sky of evening died away.
448. Not seldom from the uproar I retired
449. Into a silent bay, or sportively
450. Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
451. To cut across the reflex of a star
452. That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed
453. Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,
454. When we had given our bodies to the wind,
455. And all the shadowy banks on either side
456. Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
457. The rapid line of motion, then at once
458. Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
459. Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
460. Wheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled
461. With visible motion her diurnal round!
462. Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,
463. Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched
464. Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.

465. Ye Presences of Nature in the sky
466. And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!
467. And Souls of lonely places! can I think
468. A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed
469. Such ministry, when ye, through many a year
470. Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,
471. On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,
472. Impressed, upon all forms, the characters
473. Of danger or desire; and thus did make
474. The surface of the universal earth,
475. With triumph and delight, with hope and fear,
476. Work like a sea?
477. Not uselessly employed,
478. Might I pursue this theme through every change
479. Of exercise and play, to which the year
480. Did summon us in his delightful round.

481. We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven
482. Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours;
483. Nor saw a band in happiness and joy
484. Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.
485. I could record with no reluctant voice
486. The woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers
487. With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,
488. True symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong
489. And unreproved enchantment led us on
490. By rocks and pools shut out from every star,
491. All the green summer, to forlorn cascades
492. Among the windings hid of mountain brooks.
493. --Unfading recollections! at this hour
494. The heart is almost mine with which I felt,
495. From some hill-top on sunny afternoons,
496. The paper kite high among fleecy clouds
497. Pull at her rein like an impetuous courser;
498. Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,
499. Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly
500. Dashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.

501. Ye lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,
502. A ministration of your own was yours;
503. Can I forget you, being as you were
504. So beautiful among the pleasant fields
505. In which ye stood? or can I here forget
506. The plain and seemly countenance with which
507. Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye
508. Delights and exultations of your own.
509. Eager and never weary we pursued
510. Our home-amusements by the warm peat-fire
511. At evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate
512. In square divisions parcelled out and all
513. With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,
514. We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head
515. In strife too humble to be named in verse:
516. Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,
517. Cherry or maple, sate in close array,
518. And to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on
519. A thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,
520. Neglected and ungratefully thrown by
521. Even for the very service they had wrought,
522. But husbanded through many a long campaign.
523. Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few
524. Had changed their functions: some, plebeian cards
525. Which Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,
526. Had dignified, and called to represent
527. The persons of departed potentates.
528. Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell!
529. Ironic diamonds,--clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,
530. A congregation piteously akin!
531. Cheap matter offered they to boyish wit,
532. Those sooty knaves, precipitated down
533. With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:
534. The paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,
535. Queens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,
536. And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained
537. By royal visages. Meanwhile abroad
538. Incessant rain was falling, or the frost
539. Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;
540. And, interrupting oft that eager game,
541. From under Esthwaite's splitting fields of ice
542. The pent-up air, struggling to free itself,
543. Gave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud
544. Protracted yelling, like the noise of wolves
545. Howling in troops along the Bothnic Main.

546. Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace
547. How Nature by extrinsic passion first
548. Peopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,
549. And made me love them, may I here omit
550. How other pleasures have been mine, and joys
551. Of subtler origin; how I have felt,
552. Not seldom even in that tempestuous time,
553. Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense
554. Which seem, in their simplicity, to own
555. An intellectual charm; that calm delight
556. Which, if I err not, surely must belong
557. To those first-born affinities that fit
558. Our new existence to existing things,
559. And, in our dawn of being, constitute
560. The bond of union between life and joy.

561. Yes, I remember when the changeful earth,
562. And twice five summers on my mind had stamped
563. The faces of the moving year, even then
564. I held unconscious intercourse with beauty
565. Old as creation, drinking in a pure
566. Organic pleasure from the silver wreaths
567. Of curling mist, or from the level plain
568. Of waters coloured by impending clouds.

569. The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays
570. Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell
571. How, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,
572. And to the shepherd's hut on distant hills
573. Sent welcome notice of the rising moon,
574. How I have stood, to fancies such as these
575. A stranger, linking with the spectacle
576. No conscious memory of a kindred sight,
577. And bringing with me no peculiar sense
578. Of quietness or peace; yet have I stood,
579. Even while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league
580. Of shining water, gathering as it seemed,
581. Through every hair-breadth in that field of light,
582. New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.

583. Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy
584. Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits
585. Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss
586. Which, like a tempest, works along the blood
587. And is forgotten; even then I felt
588. Gleams like the flashing of a shield;--the earth
589. And common face of Nature spake to me
590. Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,
591. By chance collisions and quaint accidents
592. (Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed
593. Of evil-minded fairies), yet not vain
594. Nor profitless, if haply they impressed
595. Collateral objects and appearances,
596. Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep
597. Until maturer seasons called them forth
598. To impregnate and to elevate the mind.
599. --And if the vulgar joy by its own weight
600. Wearied itself out of the memory,
601. The scenes which were a witness of that joy
602. Remained in their substantial lineaments
603. Depicted on the brain, and to the eye
604. Were visible, a daily sight; and thus
605. By the impressive discipline of fear,
606. By pleasure and repeated happiness,
607. So frequently repeated, and by force
608. Of obscure feelings representative
609. Of things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,
610. So beautiful, so majestic in themselves,
611. Though yet the day was distant, did become
612. Habitually dear, and all their forms
613. And changeful colours by invisible links
614. Were fastened to the affections.
615. I began
616. My story early--not misled, I trust,
617. By an infirmity of love for days
618. Disowned by memory--ere the breath of spring
619. Planting my snowdrops among winter snows:
620. Nor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt
621. In sympathy, that I have lengthened out
622. With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.
623. Meanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch
624. Invigorating thoughts from former years;
625. Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,
626. And haply meet reproaches too, whose power
627. May spur me on, in manhood now mature
628. To honourable toil. Yet should these hopes
629. Prove vain, and thus should neither I be taught
630. To understand myself, nor thou to know
631. With better knowledge how the heart was framed
632. Of him thou lovest; need I dread from thee
633. Harsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit
634. Those recollected hours that have the charm
635. Of visionary things, those lovely forms
636. And sweet sensations that throw back our life,
637. And almost make remotest infancy
638. A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?

639. One end at least hath been attained; my mind
640. Hath been revived, and if this genial mood
641. Desert me not, forthwith shall be brought down
642. Through later years the story of my life.
643. The road lies plain before me;--'tis a theme
644. Single and of determined bounds; and hence
645. I choose it rather at this time, than work
646. Of ampler or more varied argument,
647. Where I might be discomfited and lost:
648. And certain hopes are with me, that to thee
649. This labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!
