1. WHO weeps for strangers? Many wept
2. For George and Sarah Green;
3. Wept for that pair's unhappy fate,
4. Whose grave may here be seen.

5. By night, upon these stormy fells,
6. Did wife and husband roam;
7. Six little ones at home had left,
8. And could not find that home.

9. For 'any' dwelling-place of man
10. As vainly did they seek.
11. He perish'd; and a voice was heard--
12. The widow's lonely shriek.

13. Not many steps, and she was left
14. A body without life--
15. A few short steps were the chain that bound
16. The husband to the wife.

17. Now do those sternly-featured hills
18. Look gently on this grave;
19. And quiet now are the depths of air,
20. As a sea without a wave.

21. But deeper lies the heart of peace
22. In quiet more profound;
23. The heart of quietness is here
24. Within this churchyard bound.

25. And from all agony of mind
26. It keeps them safe, and far
27. From fear and grief, and from all need
28. Of sun or guiding star.

29. O darkness of the grave! how deep,
30. After that living night--
31. That last and dreary living one
32. Of sorrow and affright?

33. O sacred marriage-bed of death,
34. That keeps them side by side
35. In bond of peace, in bond of love,
36. That may not be untied!
