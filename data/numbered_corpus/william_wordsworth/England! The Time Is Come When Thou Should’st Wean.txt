1. ENGLAND! the time is come when thou should'st wean
2. Thy heart from its emasculating food;
3. The truth should now be better understood;
4. Old things have been unsettled; we have seen
5. Fair seed-time, better harvest might have been
6. But for thy trespasses; and, at this day,
7. If for Greece, Egypt, India, Africa,
8. Aught good were destined, thou would'st step between.
9. England! all nations in this charge agree:
10. But worse, more ignorant in love and hate,
11. Far--far more abject, is thine Enemy:
12. Therefore the wise pray for thee, though the freight
13. Of thy offences be a heavy weight:
14. Oh grief that Earth's best hopes rest all with Thee!
