1. HOW sweet it is, when mother Fancy rocks
2. The wayward brain, to saunter through a wood!
3. An old place, full of many a lovely brood,
4. Tall trees, green arbours, and ground-flowers in flocks;
5. And wild rose tip-toe upon hawthorn stocks,
6. Like a bold Girl, who plays her agile pranks
7. At Wakes and Fairs with wandering Mountebanks,--
8. When she stands cresting the Clown's head, and mocks
9. The crowd beneath her. Verily I think,
10. Such place to me is sometimes like a dream
11. Or map of the whole world: thoughts, link by link,
12. Enter through ears and eyesight, with such gleam
13. Of all things, that at last in fear I shrink,
14. And leap at once from the delicious stream.
