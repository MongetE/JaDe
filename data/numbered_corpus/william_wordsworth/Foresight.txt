1. That is work of waste and ruin--
2. Do as Charles and I are doing!
3. Strawberry-blossoms, one and all,
4. We must spare them--here are many:
5. Look at it--the flower is small,
6. Small and low, though fair as any:
7. Do not touch it! summers two
8. I am older, Anne, than you.

9. Pull the primrose, sister Anne!
10. Pull as many as you can.
11. --Here are daisies, take your fill;
12. Pansies, and the cuckoo-flower:
13. Of the lofty daffodil
14. Make your bed, or make your bower;
15. Fill your lap, and fill your bosom;
16. Only spare the strawberry-blossom!

17. Primroses, the Spring may love them--
18. Summer knows but little of them:
19. Violets, a barren kind,
20. Withered on the ground must lie;
21. Daisies leave no fruit behind
22. When the pretty flowerets die;
23. Pluck them, and another year
24. As many will be blowing here.

25. God has given a kindlier power
26. To the favoured strawberry-flower.
27. Hither soon as spring is fled
28. You and Charles and I will walk;
29. Lurking berries, ripe and red,
30. Then will hang on every stalk,
31. Each within its leafy bower;
32. And for that promise spare the flower!
