1. .  Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much
2. Unvisited, endeavour'd to retrace
3. My life through its first years, and measured back
4. The way I travell'd when I first began
5. To love the woods and fields; the passion yet
6. Was in its birth, sustain'd, as might befal,
7. By nourishment that came unsought, for still,
8. From week to week, from month to month, we liv'd
9. A round of tumult: duly were our games
10. Prolong'd in summer till the day-light fail'd;
11. No chair remain'd before the doors, the bench
12. And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep
13. The Labourer, and the old Man who had sate,
14. A later lingerer, yet the revelry
15. Continued, and the loud uproar: at last,
16. When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds
17. Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went,
18. With weary joints, and with a beating mind.
19. Ah! is there one who ever has been young,
20. Nor needs a monitory voice to tame
21. The pride of virtue, and of intellect?
22. And is there one, the wisest and the best
23. Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish
24. For things which cannot be, who would not give,
25. If so he might, to duty and to truth
26. The eagerness of infantine desire?
27. A tranquillizing spirit presses now
28. On my corporeal frame: so wide appears
29. The vacancy between me and those days,
30. Which yet have such self-presence in my mind
31. That, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem
32. Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself
33. And of some other Being. A grey Stone
34. Of native rock, left midway in the Square
35. Of our small market Village, was the home
36. And centre of these joys, and when, return'd
37. After long absence, thither I repair'd,
38. I found that it was split, and gone to build
39. A smart Assembly-room that perk'd and flar'd
40. With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground
41. Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream,
42. And be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know
43. That more than one of you will think with me
44. Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame
45. From whom the stone was nam'd who there had sate
46. And watch'd her Table with its huckster's wares
47. Assiduous, thro' the length of sixty years.

48. We ran a boisterous race; the year span round
49. With giddy motion. But the time approach'd
50. That brought with it a regular desire
51. For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms
52. Of Nature were collaterally attach'd
53. To every scheme of holiday delight,
54. And every boyish sport, less grateful else,
55. And languidly pursued.         When summer came
56. It was the pastime of our afternoons
57. To beat along the plain of Windermere
58. With rival oars, and the selected bourne
59. Was now an Island musical with birds
60. That sang for ever; now a Sister Isle
61. Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown
62. With lillies of the valley, like a field;
63. And now a third small Island where remain'd
64. An old stone Table, and a moulder'd Cave,
65. A Hermit's history. In such a race,
66. So ended, disappointment could be none,
67. Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:
68. We rested in the shade, all pleas'd alike,
69. Conquer'd and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,
70. And the vain-glory of superior skill
71. Were interfus'd with objects which subdu'd
72. And temper'd them, and gradually produc'd
73. A quiet independence of the heart.
74. And to my Friend, who knows me, I may add,
75. Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence
76. Ensu'd a diffidence and modesty,
77. And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,
78. The self-sufficing power of solitude.

79. No delicate viands sapp'd our bodily strength;
80. More than we wish'd we knew the blessing then
81. Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals
82. Were frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude
83. A little weekly stipend, and we lived
84. Through three divisions of the quarter'd year
85. In pennyless poverty. But now, to School
86. Return'd, from the half-yearly holidays,
87. We came with purses more profusely fill'd,
88. Allowance which abundantly suffic'd
89. To gratify the palate with repasts
90. More costly than the Dame of whom I spake,
91. That ancient Woman, and her board supplied.
92. Hence inroads into distant Vales, and long
93. Excursions far away among the hills,
94. Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,
95. Or in the woods, or near a river side,
96. Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs
97. Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun
98. Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy.

99. Nor is my aim neglected, if I tell
100. How twice in the long length of those half-years
101. We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand
102. Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least,
103. To feel the motion of the galloping Steed;
104. And with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth,
105. On such occasion sometimes we employ'd
106. Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound
107. Of the day's journey was too distant far
108. For any cautious man, a Structure famed
109. Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls
110. Of that large Abbey which within the vale
111. Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,
112. Stands yet, a mouldering Pile, with fractured Arch,
113. Belfry, and Images, and living Trees,
114. A holy Scene! along the smooth green turf
115. Our Horses grazed: to more than inland peace
116. Left by the sea wind passing overhead
117. (Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers
118. May in that Valley oftentimes be seen,
119. Both silent and both motionless alike;
120. Such is the shelter that is there, and such
121. The safeguard for repose and quietness.


122. Our steeds remounted, and the summons given,
123. With whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew
124. In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg'd Knight,
125. And the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren
126. Which one day sang so sweetly in the Nave
127. Of the old Church, that, though from recent showers
128. The earth was comfortless, and, touch'd by faint
129. Internal breezes, sobbings of the place,
130. And respirations, from the roofless walls
131. The shuddering ivy dripp'd large drops, yet still,
132. So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible Bird
133. Sang to itself, that there I could have made
134. My dwelling-place, and liv'd for ever there
135. To hear such music. Through the Walls we flew
136. And down the valley, and a circuit made
137. In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth
138. We scamper'd homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams,
139. And that still Spirit of the evening air!
140. Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt
141. Your presence, when with slacken'd step we breath'd
142. Along the sides of the steep hills, or when,
143. Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea,
144. We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.


145. Upon the Eastern Shore of Windermere,
146. Above the crescent of a pleasant Bay,
147. There stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed,
148. Brother of the surrounding Cottages,
149. But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset
150. With Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within
151. Decanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine.
152. In ancient times, or ere the Hall was built
153. On the large Island, had this Dwelling been
154. More worthy of a Poet's love, a Hut,
155. Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade.
156. But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed
157. The threshold, and large golden characters
158. On the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp'd
159. The place of the old Lion, in contempt
160. And mockery of the rustic painter's hand,
161. Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear
162. With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay
163. Upon a slope surmounted by the plain
164. Of a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood
165. A grove; with gleams of water through the trees
166. And over the tree-tops; nor did we want
167. Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.
168. And there, through half an afternoon, we play'd
169. On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent
170. Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall
171. Of night, when in our pinnace we return'd
172. Over the dusky Lake, and to the beach
173. Of some small Island steer'd our course with one,
174. The Minstrel of our troop, and left him there,
175. And row'd off gently, while he blew his flute
176. Alone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm
177. And dead still water lay upon my mind
178. Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky
179. Never before so beautiful, sank down
180. Into my heart, and held me like a dream.


181. Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged,
182. And thus the common range of visible things
183. Grew dear to me: already I began
184. To love the sun, a Boy I lov'd the sun,
185. Not as I since have lov'd him, as a pledge
186. And surety of our earthly life, a light
187. Which while we view we feel we are alive;
188. But, for this cause, that I had seen him lay
189. His beauty on the morning hills, had seen
190. The western mountain touch his setting orb,
191. In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess
192. Of happiness, my blood appear'd to flow
193. With its own pleasure, and I breath'd with joy.
194. And from like feelings, humble though intense,
195. To patriotic and domestic love
196. Analogous, the moon to me was dear;
197. For I would dream away my purposes,
198. Standing to look upon her while she hung
199. Midway between the hills, as if she knew
200. No other region; but belong'd to thee,
201. Yea, appertain'd by a peculiar right
202. To thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale!


203. Those incidental charms which first attach'd
204. My heart to rural objects, day by day
205. Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell
206. How Nature, intervenient till this time,
207. And secondary, now at length was sought
208. For her own sake. But who shall parcel out
209. His intellect, by geometric rules,
210. Split, like a province, into round and square?
211. Who knows the individual hour in which
212. His habits were first sown, even as a seed,
213. Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say,
214. 'This portion of the river of my mind
215. Came from yon fountain?' Thou, my Friend! art one
216. More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee
217. Science appears but, what in truth she is,
218. Not as our glory and our absolute boast,
219. But as a succedaneum, and a prop
220. To our infirmity. Thou art no slave
221. Of that false secondary power, by which,
222. In weakness, we create distinctions, then
223. Deem that our puny boundaries are things
224. Which we perceive, and not which we have made.
225. To thee, unblinded by these outward shows,
226. The unity of all has been reveal'd
227. And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill'd
228. Than many are to class the cabinet
229. Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase,
230. Run through the history and birth of each,
231. As of a single independent thing.
232. Hard task to analyse a soul, in which,
233. Not only general habits and desires,
234. But each most obvious and particular thought,
235. Not in a mystical and idle sense,
236. But in the words of reason deeply weigh'd,
237. Hath no beginning.          Bless'd the infant Babe,
238. (For with my best conjectures I would trace
239. The progress of our Being) blest the Babe,
240. Nurs'd in his Mother's arms, the Babe who sleeps
241. Upon his Mother's breast, who, when his soul
242. Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul,
243. Doth gather passion from his Mother's eye!
244. Such feelings pass into his torpid life
245. Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind
246. Even [in the first trial of its powers]
247. Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine
248. In one appearance, all the elements
249. And parts of the same object, else detach'd
250. And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day,
251. Subjected to the discipline of love,
252. His organs and recipient faculties
253. Are quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads,
254. Tenacious of the forms which it receives.
255. In one beloved presence, nay and more,
256. In that most apprehensive habitude
257. And those sensations which have been deriv'd
258. From this beloved Presence, there exists
259. A virtue which irradiates and exalts
260. All objects through all intercourse of sense.
261. No outcast he, bewilder'd and depress'd;
262. Along his infant veins are interfus'd
263. The gravitation and the filial bond
264. Of nature, that connect him with the world.
265. Emphatically such a Being lives,
266. An inmate of this  active universe;
267. From nature largely he receives; nor so
268. Is satisfied, but largely gives again,
269. For feeling has to him imparted strength,
270. And powerful in all sentiments of grief,
271. Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind,
272. Even as an agent of the one great mind,
273. Creates, creator and receiver both,
274. Working but in alliance with the works
275. Which it beholds.--Such, verily, is the first
276. Poetic spirit of our human life;
277. By uniform control of after years
278. In most abated or suppress'd, in some,
279. Through every change of growth or of decay,
280. Pre-eminent till death.       From early days,
281. Beginning not long after that first time
282. In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch,
283. I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart
284. I have endeavour'd to display the means
285. Whereby this infant sensibility,
286. Great birthright of our Being, was in me
287. Augmented and sustain'd. Yet is a path
288. More difficult before me, and I fear
289. That in its broken windings we shall need
290. The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:
291. For now a trouble came into my mind
292. From unknown causes. I was left alone,
293. Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.
294. The props of my affections were remov'd,
295. And yet the building stood, as if sustain'd
296. By its own spirit! All that I beheld
297. Was dear to me, and from this cause it came,
298. That now to Nature's finer influxes
299. My mind lay open, to that more exact
300. And intimate communion which our hearts
301. Maintain with the minuter properties
302. Of objects which already are belov'd,
303. And of those only. Many are the joys
304. Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live
305. When every hour brings palpable access
306. Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,
307. And sorrow is not there. The seasons came,
308. And every season to my notice brought
309. A store of transitory qualities
310. Which, but for this most watchful power of love
311. Had been neglected, left a register
312. Of permanent relations, else unknown,
313. Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude
314. More active, even, than 'best society',
315. Society made sweet as solitude
316. By silent inobtrusive sympathies,
317. And gentle agitations of the mind
318. From manifold distinctions, difference
319. Perceived in things, where to the common eye,
320. No difference is; and hence, from the same source
321. Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,
322. In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights
323. Beneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time,
324. Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound
325. To breathe an elevated mood, by form
326. Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,
327. Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are
328. The ghostly language of the ancient earth,
329. Or make their dim abode in distant winds.
330. Thence did I drink the visionary power.
331. I deem not profitless those fleeting moods
332. Of shadowy exultation: not for this,
333. That they are kindred to our purer mind
334. And intellectual life; but that the soul,
335. Remembering how she felt, but what she felt
336. Remembering not, retains an obscure sense
337. Of possible sublimity, to which,
338. With growing faculties she doth aspire,
339. With faculties still growing, feeling still
340. That whatsoever point they gain, they still
341. Have something to pursue.       And not alone,
342. In grandeur and in tumult, but no less
343. In tranquil scenes, that universal power
344. And fitness in the latent qualities
345. And essences of things, by which the mind
346. Is mov'd by feelings of delight, to me
347. Came strengthen'd with a superadded soul,
348. A virtue not its own. My morning walks
349. Were early; oft, before the hours of School
350. I travell'd round our little Lake, five miles
351. Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear
352. For this, that one was by my side, a Friend
353. Then passionately lov'd; with heart how full
354. Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps
355. A blank to other men! for many years
356. Have since flow'd in between us; and our minds,
357. Both silent to each other, at this time
358. We live as if those hours had never been.
359. Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch
360. Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush
361. Was audible, among the hills I sate
362. Alone, upon some jutting eminence
363. At the first hour of morning, when the Vale
364. Lay quiet in an utter solitude.
365. How shall I trace the history, where seek
366. The origin of what I then have felt?
367. Oft in these moments such a holy calm
368. Did overspread my soul, that I forgot
369. That I had bodily eyes, and what I saw
370. Appear'd like something in myself, a dream,
371. A prospect in my mind.       'Twere long to tell
372. What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,
373. And what the summer shade, what day and night,
374. The evening and the morning, what my dreams
375. And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse
376. That spirit of religious love in which
377. I walked with Nature. But let this, at least
378. Be not forgotten, that I still retain'd
379. My first creative sensibility,
380. That by the regular action of the world
381. My soul was unsubdu'd. A plastic power
382. Abode with me, a forming hand, at times
383. Rebellious, acting in a devious mood,
384. A local spirit of its own, at war
385. With general tendency, but for the most
386. Subservient strictly to the external things
387. With which it commun'd. An auxiliar light
388. Came from my mind which on the setting sun
389. Bestow'd new splendor, the melodious birds,
390. The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on,
391. Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey'd
392. A like dominion; and the midnight storm
393. Grew darker in the presence of my eye.
394. Hence by obeisance, my devotion hence,
395. And hence my transport.       Nor should this, perchance,
396. Pass unrecorded, that I still have lov'd
397. The exercise and produce of a toil
398. Than analytic industry to me
399. More pleasing, and whose character I deem
400. Is more poetic as resembling more
401. Creative agency. I mean to speak
402. Of that interminable building rear'd
403. By observation of affinities
404. In objects where no brotherhood exists
405. To common minds. My seventeenth year was come
406. And, whether from this habit, rooted now
407. So deeply in my mind, or from excess
408. Of the great social principle of life,
409. Coercing all things into sympathy,
410. To unorganic natures I transferr'd
411. My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth
412. Coming in revelation, I convers'd
413. With things that really are, I, at this time
414. Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.
415. Thus did my days pass on, and now at length
416. From Nature and her overflowing soul
417. I had receiv'd so much that all my thoughts
418. Were steep'd in feeling; I was only then
419. Contented when with bliss ineffable
420. I felt the sentiment of Being spread
421. O'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still,
422. O'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought
423. And human knowledge, to the human eye
424. Invisible, yet liveth to the heart,
425. O'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings,
426. Or beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides
427. Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself
428. And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not
429. If such my transports were; for in all things
430. I saw one life, and felt that it was joy.
431. One song they sang, and it was audible,
432. Most audible then when the fleshly ear,
433. O'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain,
434. Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb'd.


435. If this be error, and another faith
436. Find easier access to the pious mind,
437. Yet were I grossly destitute of all
438. Those human sentiments which make this earth
439. So dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice
440. To speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes,
441. And sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds
442. That dwell among the hills where I was born.
443. If, in my youth, I have been pure in heart,
444. If, mingling with the world, I am content
445. With my own modest pleasures, and have liv'd,
446. With God and Nature communing, remov'd
447. From little enmities and low desires,
448. The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,
449. This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,
450. If, 'mid indifference and apathy
451. And wicked exultation, when good men,
452. On every side fall off we know not how,
453. To selfishness, disguis'd in gentle names
454. Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love,
455. Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers
456. On visionary minds; if in this time
457. Of dereliction and dismay, I yet
458. Despair not of our nature; but retain
459. A more than Roman confidence, a faith
460. That fails not, in all sorrow my support,
461. The blessing of my life, the gift is yours,
462. Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed
463. My lofty speculations; and in thee,
464. For this uneasy heart of ours I find
465. A never-failing principle of joy,
466. And purest passion.       Thou, my Friend! wert rear'd
467. In the great City, 'mid far other scenes;
468. But we, by different roads at length have gain'd
469. The self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee
470. I speak, unapprehensive of contempt,
471. The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,
472. And all that silent language which so oft
473. In conversation betwixt man and man
474. Blots from the human countenance all trace
475. Of beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought
476. The truth in solitude, and Thou art one,
477. The most intense of Nature's worshippers
478. In many things my Brother, chiefly here
479. In this my deep devotion.       Fare Thee well!
480. Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind
481. Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,
482. And yet more often living with Thyself,
483. And for Thyself, so haply shall thy days
484. Be many, and a blessing to mankind.
