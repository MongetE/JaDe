1. I MET Louisa in the shade,
2. And, having seen that lovely Maid,
3. Why should I fear to say
4. That, nymph-like, she is fleet and strong,
5. And down the rocks can leap along
6. Like rivulets in May?

7. She loves her fire, her cottage-home;
8. Yet o'er the moorland will she roam
9. In weather rough and bleak;
10. And, when against the wind she strains,
11. Oh! might I kiss the mountain rains
12. That sparkle on her cheek.

13. Take all that's mine 'beneath the moon,'
14. If I with her but half a noon
15. May sit beneath the walls
16. Of some old cave, or mossy nook,
17. When up she winds along the brook
18. To hunt the waterfalls.
