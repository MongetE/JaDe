1. The Shepherd, looking eastward, softly said,
2. "Bright is thy veil, O Moon, as thou art bright!"
3. Forthwith, that little cloud, in ether spread
4. And penetrated all with tender light,
5. She cast away, and showed her fulgent head
6. Uncovered; dazzling the Beholder's sight
7. As if to vindicate her beauty's right
8. Her beauty thoughtlessly disparaged.
9. Meanwhile that veil, removed or thrown aside,
10. Went floating from her, darkening as it went;
11. And a huge mass, to bury or to hide,
12. Approached this glory of the firmament;
13. Who meekly yields, and is obscured--content
14. With one calm triumph of a modest pride.
