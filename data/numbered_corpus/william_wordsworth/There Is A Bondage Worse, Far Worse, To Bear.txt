1. THERE is a bondage worse, far worse, to bear
2. Than his who breathes, by roof, and floor, and wall,
3. Pent in, a Tyrant's solitary Thrall:
4. 'Tis his who walks about in the open air,
5. One of a Nation who, henceforth, must wear
6. Their fetters in their souls. For who could be,
7. Who, even the best, in such condition, free
8. From self-reproach, reproach that he must share
9. With Human-nature? Never be it ours
10. To see the sun how brightly it will shine,
11. And know that noble feelings, manly powers,
12. Instead of gathering strength, must droop and pine;
13. And earth with all her pleasant fruits and flowers
14. Fade, and participate in man's decline.
