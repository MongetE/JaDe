1. I DROPPED my pen; and listened to the Wind
2. That sang of trees uptorn and vessels tost--
3. A midnight harmony; and wholly lost
4. To the general sense of men by chains confined
5. Of business, care, or pleasure; or resigned
6. To timely sleep. Thought I, the impassioned strain,
7. Which, without aid of numbers, I sustain,
8. Like acceptation from the World will find.
9. Yet some with apprehensive ear shall drink
10. A dirge devoutly breathed o'er sorrows past;
11. And to the attendant promise will give heed--
12. The prophecy,--like that of this wild blast,
13. Which, while it makes the heart with sadness shrink,
14. Tells also of bright calms that shall succeed.
