1. OCTOBER 1

2. VANGUARD of Liberty, ye men of Kent,
3. Ye children of a Soil that doth advance
4. Her haughty brow against the coast of France,
5. Now is the time to prove your hardiment!
6. To France be words of invitation sent!
7. They from their fields can see the countenance
8. Of your fierce war, may ken the glittering lance
9. And hear you shouting forth your brave intent.
10. Left single, in bold parley, ye, of yore,
11. Did from the Norman win a gallant wreath;
12. Confirmed the charters that were yours before;--
13. No parleying now! In Britain is one breath;
14. We all are with you now from shore to shore:--
15. Ye men of Kent, 'tis victory or death!
