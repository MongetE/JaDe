1. The sun has long been set,
2. The stars are out by twos and threes,
3. The little birds are piping yet
4. Among the bushes and the trees;
5. There's a cuckoo, and one or two thrushes,
6. And a far-off wind that rushes,
7. And a sound of water that gushes,
8. And the cuckoo's sovereign cry
9. Fills all the hollow of the sky.
10. Who would go `parading'
11. In London, `and masquerading',
12. On such a night of June
13. With that beautiful soft half-moon,
14. And all these innocent blisses?
15. On such a night as this is!
