1. CALM is all nature as a resting wheel.
2. The kine are couched upon the dewy grass;
3. The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass,
4. Is cropping audibly his later meal:
5. Dark is the ground; a slumber seems to steal
6. O'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky.
7. Now, in this blank of things, a harmony,
8. Home-felt, and home-created, comes to heal
9. That grief for which the senses still supply
10. Fresh food; for only then, when memory
11. Is hushed, am I at rest. My Friends! restrain
12. Those busy cares that would allay my pain;
13. Oh! leave me to myself, nor let me feel
14. The officious touch that makes me droop again.
