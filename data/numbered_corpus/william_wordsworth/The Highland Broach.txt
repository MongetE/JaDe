1. If to Tradition faith be due,
2. And echoes from old verse speak true,
3. Ere the meek Saint, Columba, bore
4. Glad tidings to Iona's shore,
5. No common light of nature blessed
6. The mountain region of the west,
7. A land where gentle manners ruled
8. O'er men in dauntless virtues schooled,
9. That raised, for centuries, a bar
10. Impervious to the tide of war;
11. Yet peaceful Arts did entrance gain
12. Where haughty Force had striven in vain,
13. And, 'mid the works of skilful hands,
14. By wanderers brought from foreign lands
15. And various climes, was not unknown
16. The clasp that fixed the Roman Gown;
17. The Fibula, whose shape, I ween,
18. Still in the Highland Broach is seen,
19. Worn at the breast of some grave Dame
20. On road or path, or at the door
21. Of fern-thatched Hut on heathy moor:
22. But delicate of yore its mould,
23. And the material finest gold;
24. As might beseem the fairest Fair,
25. Whether she graced a royal chair,
26. Or shed, within a vaulted Hall,
27. No fancied lustre on the wall
28. Where shields of mighty Heroes hung,
29. While Fingal heard what Ossian sung.

30. The heroic Age expired - it slept
31. Deep in its tomb: - the bramble crept
32. O'er Fingal's hearth; the grassy sod
33. Grew on the floors his Sons had trod;
34. Malvina! where art thou? Their state
35. The noblest-born must abdicate,
36. The fairest, while with fire and sword
37. Come Spoilers - horde impelling horde,
38. Must walk the sorrowing mountains, drest
39. By ruder hands in homelier vest,
40. Yet still the female bosom lent,
41. And loved to borrow, ornament;
42. Still was its inner world a place
43. Reached by the dews of heavenly grace;
44. Still pity to this last retreat
45. Clove fondly; to his favourite seat
46. Love wound his way by soft approach,
47. Beneath a massier Highland Broach.

48. When alternations came of rage
49. Yet fiercer, in a darker age;
50. And feuds, where, clan encountering clan,
51. The weaker perished to a man;
52. For maid and mother, when despair
53. Might else have triumphed, baffling prayer,
54. One small
55. possession
56. lacked not power,
57. Provided in a calmer hour,
58. To meet such need as might befall -
59. Roof, raiment, bread, or burial:
60. For woman, even of tears bereft,
61. The hidden silver Broach was left.

62. As generations come and go,
63. Their arts, their customs, ebb and flow;
64. Fate, fortune, sweep strong powers away,
65. And feeble, of themselves, decay;
66. What poor abodes their heir-loom hide,
67. In which the castle once took pride!
68. Tokens, once kept as boasted wealth,
69. If saved at all, are saved by stealth.
70. Lo! ships, from seas by nature barred,
71. Mount along ways by man prepared;
72. And in far-stretching vales, whose streams
73. Seek other seas, their canvas gleams.
74. Lo! busy towns spring up, on coasts
75. Thronged yesterday by airy ghosts;
76. Soon, like a lingering star forlorn
77. Among the novelties of morn,
78. While young delights on old encroach,
79. Will vanish the last Highland Broach.

80. But when, from out their viewless bed,
81. Like vapours, years have rolled and spread
82. And this poor verse, and worthier lays,
83. Shall yield no light of love or praise,
84. Then, by the spade, or cleaving plough,
85. Or torrent from the mountain's brow.
86. Or whirlwind, reckless what his might
87. Entombs, or forces into light,
88. Blind Chance, a volunteer ally,
89. That oft befriends Antiquity,
90. And clears Oblivion from reproach,
91. May render back the Highland Broach.
