1. Surprised By Joy

2. Surprised by joy â€” impatient as the Wind
3. I turned to share the transport--Oh! with whom
4. But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb,
5. That spot which no vicissitude can find?
6. Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind--
7. But how could I forget thee? Through what power,
8. Even for the least division of an hour,
9. Have I been so beguiled as to be blind
10. To my most grievous loss?--That thought's return
11. Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,
12. Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,
13. Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more;
14. That neither present time, nor years unborn
15. Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.
