1. WITH ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh,
2. Like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed;
3. Some lying fast at anchor in the road,
4. Some veering up and down, one knew not why.
5. A goodly vessel did I then espy
6. Come like a giant from a haven broad;
7. And lustily along the bay she strode,
8. Her tackling rich, and of apparel high.
9. The ship was nought to me, nor I to her,
10. Yet I pursued her with a lover's look;
11. This ship to all the rest did I prefer:
12. When will she turn, and whither? She will brook
13. No tarrying; where she comes the winds must stir:
14. On went she, and due north her journey took.
