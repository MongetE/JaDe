1. INTREPID sons of Albion! not by you
2. Is life despised; ah no, the spacious earth
3. Ne'er saw a race who held, by right of birth,
4. So many objects to which love is due:
5. Ye slight not life--to God and Nature true;
6. But death, becoming death, is dearer far,
7. When duty bids you bleed in open war:
8. Hence hath your prowess quelled that impious crew.
9. Heroes!--for instant sacrifice prepared;
10. Yet filled with ardour and on triumph bent
11. 'Mid direst shocks of mortal accident--
12. To you who fell, and you whom slaughter spared
13. To guard the fallen, and consummate the event,
14. Your Country rears this sacred Monument!
