1. As I was going to St. Ives
2. I met a man with seven lives;
3. Seven lives,
4. In seven sacks,
5. Like seven beeves
6. On seven racks.
7. These seven lives
8. He offered to sell,
9. But which was best
10. He couldn't tell.
11. He swore with any
12. I'd be happy forever;
13. I bought all seven
14. And thought I was clever,
15. But his parting words
16. I can't forget:
17. Forever
18. Isn't over yet.
