1. In spite of her sniffle
2. Isabel's chiffle.
3. Some girls with a sniffle
4. Would be weepy and tiffle;
5. They would look awful,
6. Like a rained-on waffle,
7. But Isabel's chiffle
8. In spite of her sniffle.
9. Her nose is more red
10. With a cold in her head,
11. But then, to be sure,
12. Her eyes are bluer.
13. Some girls with a snuffle,
14. Their tempers are uffle.
15. But when Isabel's snivelly
16. She's snivelly civilly,
17. And when she's snuffly
18. She's perfectly luffly.
