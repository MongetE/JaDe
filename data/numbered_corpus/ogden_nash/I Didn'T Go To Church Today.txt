1. I didn't go to church today,
2. I trust the Lord to understand.
3. The surf was swirling blue and white,
4. The children swirling on the sand.
5. He knows, He knows how brief my stay,
6. How brief this spell of summer weather,
7. He knows when I am said and done
8. We'll have plenty of time together.
