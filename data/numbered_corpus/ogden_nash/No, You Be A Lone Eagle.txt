1. I find it very hard to be fair-minded
2. About people who go around being air-minded.
3. I just can't see any fun
4. In soaring up up up into the sun
5. When the chances are still a fresh cool orchid to a paper geranium
6. That you'll unsoar down down down onto your (to you) invaluable
7. cranium.
8. I know the constant refrain
9. About how safer up in God's trafficless heaven than in an automobile
10. or a train
11. But ...
12. My God, have you ever taken a good look at a strut?
13. Then that one about how you're in Boston before you can say antidis-
14. establishmentarianism
15. So that preferring to take five hours by rail is a pernicious example of
16. antiquarianism.
17. At least when I get on the Boston train I have a good chance of landing
18. in the South Station
19. And not in that part of the daily press which is reserved for victims of
20. aviation.
21. Then, despite the assurance that aeroplanes are terribly comfortable I
22. notice that when you are railroading or automobiling
23. You don't have to take a paper bag along just in case of a funny feeling.
24. It seems to me that no kind of depravity
25. Brings such speedy retribution as ignoring the law of gravity.
26. Therefore nobody could possibly indict me for perjury
27. When I swear that I wish the Wright brothers had gone in for silver
28. fox farming or tree surgery.
