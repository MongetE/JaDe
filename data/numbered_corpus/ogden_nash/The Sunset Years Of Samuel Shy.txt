1. Master I may be,
2. But not of my fate.
3. Now come the kisses, too many too late.
4. Tell me, O Parcae,
5. For fain would I know,
6. Where were these kisses three decades ago?Girls there were plenty,
7. Mint julep girls, beer girls,
8. Gay younger married and headstrong career girls,
9. The girls of my friends
10. And the wives of my friends,
11. Some smugly settled and some at loose ends,
12. Sad girls, serene girls,
13. Girls breathless and turbulent,
14. Debs cosmopolitan, matrons suburbulent,
15. All of them amiable,
16. All of them cordial,
17. Innocent rousers of instincts primordial,
18. But even though health and wealth
19. Hadn't yet missed me,
20. None of them,
21. Not even Jenny,
22. Once kissed me.

23. These very same girls
24. Who with me have grown older
25. Now freely relax with a head on my shoulder,
26. And now come the kisses,
27. A flood in full spate,
28. The meaningless kisses, too many too late.
29. They kiss me hello,
30. They kiss me goodbye,
31. Should I offer a light, there's a kiss for reply.
32. They kiss me at weddings,
33. They kiss me at wakes,
34. The drop of a hat is less than it takes.
35. They kiss me at cocktails,
36. They kiss me at bridge,
37. It's all automatic, like slapping a midge.
38. The sound of their kisses
39. Is loud in my ears
40. Like the locusts that swarm every seventeen years.

41. I'm arthritic, dyspeptic,
42. Potentially ulcery,
43. And weary of kisses by custom compulsory.
44. Should my dear ones commit me
45. As senile demential,
46. It's from kisses perfunctory, inconsequential.
47. Answer, O Parcae,
48. For fain would I know,
49. Where were these kisses three decades ago?
