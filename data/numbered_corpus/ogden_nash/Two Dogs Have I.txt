1. For years we've had a little dog,
2. Last year we acquired a big dog;
3. He wasn't big when we got him,
4. He was littler than the dog we had.
5. We thought our little dog would love him,
6. Would help him to become a trig dog,
7. But the new little dog got bigger,
8. And the old little dog got mad.

9. Now the big dog loves the little dog,
10. But the little dog hates the big dog,
11. The little dog is eleven years old,
12. And the big dog only one;
13. The little dog calls him Schweinhund,
14. The little dog calls him Pig-dog,
15. She grumbles broken curses
16. As she dreams in the August sun.

17. The big dog's teeth are terrible,
18. But he wouldn't bite the little dog;
19. The little dog wants to grind his bones,
20. But the little dog has no teeth;
21. The big dog is acrobatic,
22. The little dog is a brittle dog;
23. She leaps to grip his jugular,
24. And passes underneath.

25. The big dog clings to the little dog
26. Like glue and cement and mortar;
27. The little dog is his own true love;
28. But the big dog is to her
29. Like a scarlet rag to a Longhorn,
30. Or a suitcase to a porter;
31. The day he sat on the hornet
32. I distinctly heard her purr.

33. Well, how can you blame the little dog,
34. Who was once the household darling?
35. He romps like a young Adonis,
36. She droops like an old mustache;
37. No wonder she steals his corner,
38. No wonder she comes out snarling,
39. No wonder she calls him Cochon
40. And even Esp√®ce de vache.

41. Yet once I wanted a sandwich,
42. Either caviar or cucumber,
43. When the sun had not yet risen
44. And the moon had not yet sank;
45. As I tiptoed through the hallway
46. The big dog lay in slumber,
47. And the little dog slept by the big dog,
48. And her head was on his flank.
