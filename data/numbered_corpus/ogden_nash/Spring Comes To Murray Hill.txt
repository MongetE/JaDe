2. And say to myself You have a responsible job havenue?
3. Why then do you fritter away your time on this doggerel?
4. If you have a sore throat you can cure it by using a good goggeral,
5. If you have a sore foot you can get it fixed by a chiropodist,
6. And you can get your original sin removed by St. John the Bopodist,
7. Why then should this flocculent lassitude be incurable?
8. Kansas City, Kansas, proves that even Kansas City needn't always be
9. Missourible.
10. Up up my soul! This inaction is abominable.
11. Perhaps it is the result of disturbances abdominable.
12. The pilgrims settled Massachusetts in 1620 when they landed on a stone
13. hummock.
14. Maybe if they were here now they would settle my stomach.
15. Oh, if I only had the wings of a bird
16. Instead of being confined on Madison Avenue I could soar in a jiffy to
17. Second or Third.
