1. My fellow man I do not care for.
2. I often ask me, What's he there for?
3. The only answer I can find
4. Is, Reproduction of his kind.
5. If I'm supposed to swallow that,
6. Winnetka is my habitat.
7. Isn't it time to carve Hic Jacet
8. Above that Reproduction racket?

9. To make the matter more succint:
10. Suppose my fellow man extinct.
11. Why, who would not approve the plan
12. Save possibly my fellow man?
13. Yet with a politician's voice
14. He names himself as Nature's choice.

15. The finest of the human race
16. Are bad in figure, worse in face.
17. Yet just because they have two legs
18. And come from storks instead of eggs
19. They count the spacious firmament
20. As something to be charged and sent.

21. Though man created cross-town traffic,
22. The Daily Mirror, News and Graphic,
23. The pastoral fight and fighting pastor,
24. And Queen Marie and Lady Astor,
25. He hails himself with drum and fife
26. And bullies lower forms of life.

27. Not that I think much depends
28. On how we treat our feathered friends,
29. Or hold the wrinkled elephant
30. A nobler creature than my aunt.
31. It's simply that I'm sure I can
32. Get on without my fellow man.
