1. More than a catbird hates a cat,
2. Or a criminal hates a clue,
3. Or the Axis hates the United States,
4. That's how much I love you.

5. I love you more than a duck can swim,
6. And more than a grapefruit squirts,
7. I love you more than a gin rummy is a bore,
8. And more than a toothache hurts.

9. As a shipwrecked sailor hates the sea,
10. Or a juggler hates a shove,
11. As a hostess detests unexpected guests,
12. That's how much you I love.

13. I love you more than a wasp can sting,
14. And more than the subway jerks,
15. I love you as much as a beggar needs a crutch,
16. And more than a hangnail irks.

17. I swear to you by the stars above,
18. And below, if such there be,
19. As the High Court loathes perjurious oathes,
20. That's how you're loved by me.
