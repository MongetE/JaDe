2. Enter a child and an ice-cream cone.

3. A parent is easily beguiled
4. By sight of this coniferous child.

5. The friendly embers warmer gleam,
6. The cone begins to drip ice cream.

7. Cones are composed of many a vitamin.
8. My lap is not the place to bitamin.

9. Although my raiment is not chinchilla,
10. I flinch to see it become vanilla.

11. Coniferous child, when vanilla melts
12. Iâ€™d rather it melted somewhere else.

13. Exit child with remains of cone.
14. I sit in the dusk. I am all alone,

15. Muttering spells like an angry Druid,
16. Alone, in the dusk, with the cleaning fluid.
