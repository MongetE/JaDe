1. Now when I have a cold
2. I am careful with my cold,
3. I consult a physician
4. And I do as I am told.
5. I muffle up my torso
6. In woolly woolly garb,
7. And I quaff great flagons
8. Of sodium bicarb.
9. I munch on aspirin,
10. I lunch on water,
11. And I wouldn’t dream of osculating
12. Anybody’s daughter,
13. And to anybody’s son
14. I wouldn’t say howdy,
15. For I am a sufferer
16. Magna cum laude.
17. I don’t like germs,
18. But I’ll keep the germs I’ve got.
19. Will I take a chance of spreading them?
20. Definitely not.
21. I sneeze out the window
22. And I cough up the flue,
23. And I live like a hermit
24. Till the germs get through.
25. And because I’m considerate,
26. Because I’m wary,
27. I am treated by my friends
28. Like Typhoid Mary.

29. Now when you have a cold
30. You are careless with your cold,
31. You are cocky as a gangster
32. Who has just been paroled.
33. You ignore your physician,
34. You eat steaks and oxtails,
35. You stuff yourself with starches,
36. You drink lots of cocktails,
37. And you claim that gargling
38. Is a time of waste,
39. And you won’t take soda
40. For you don’t like the taste,
41. And you prowl around parties
42. Full of selfish bliss,
43. And greet your hostess
44. With a genial kiss.
45. You convert yourself
46. Into a deadly missle,
47. You exhale Hello’s
48. Like a steamboat wistle.
49. You sneeze in the subway
50. And you cough at dances,
51. And let everybody else
52. Take their own good chances.
53. You’re a bronchial boor,
54. A bacterial blighter,
55. And you get more invitations
56. Than a gossip writer.

57. Yes, your throat is froggy,
58. And your eyes are swimmy,
59. And you hand is clammy,
60. And you nose is brimmy,
61. But you woo my girls
62. And their hearts you jimmy
63. While I sit here
64. With the cold you gimmy.
