1. Middle-aged life is merry, and I love to
2. lead it,
3. But there comes a day when your eyes
4. are all right but your arm isn't long
5. enough
6. to hold the telephone book where you      can read it,
7. And your friends get jocular, so you go
8. to the oculist,
9. And of all your friends he is the joculist,
10. So over his facetiousness let us skim,
11. Only noting that he has been waiting for you ever since
12. you said Good evening to his grandfather clock under
13. the impression that it was him,
14. And you look at his chart and it says SHRDLU QWERTYOP,
15. and you say Well, why SHRDNTLU QWERTYOP? and he
16. says one set of glasses won't do.
17. You need two.
18. One for reading Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason and
19. Keats's "Endymion" with,
20. And the other for walking around without saying Hello
21. to strange wymion with.
22. So you spend your time taking off your seeing glasses to put
23. on your reading glasses, and then remembering that your
24. reading glasses are upstairs or in the car,
25. And then you can't find your seeing glasses again because
26. without them on you can't see where they are.
27. Enough of such mishaps, they would try the patience of an
28. ox,
29. I prefer to forget both pairs of glasses and pass my declining
30. years saluting strange women and grandfather clocks.
