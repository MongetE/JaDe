1. When the thunder stalks the sky,
2. When tickle-footed walks the fly,
3. When shirt is wet and throat is dry,
4. Look, my darling, thats July.

5. Through the grassy lawn be leather,
6. And prickly temper tug the tether,
7. Shall we postpone our love for weather?
8. If we must melt, lets melt together!
