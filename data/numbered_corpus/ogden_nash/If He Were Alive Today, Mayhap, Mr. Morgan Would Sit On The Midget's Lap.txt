4. Advertisement in N.Y. Times

5. When comes my second childhood,
6. As to all men it must,
7. I want to be a banker
8. Like the banker at Bankers Trust.
9. I wouldn't ask to be president
10. Or even assistant veep,
11. I'd only ask for a kiddie car
12. And permission to go beep-beep.

13. The banker at Chase Manhattan,
14. He bids a polite Good-day;
15. The banker at Immigrant Savings
16. Cries Scusi! and Ol√©!
17. But I'd be a sleek Ferrari
18. Or perhaps a joggly jeep,
19. And scooting around at Bankers Trust,
20. Beep-beep, I'd go, beep-beep.

21. The trolley car used to say clang-clang
22. And the choo-choo said toot-toot,
23. But the beep of the banker at Bankers Trust
24. Is every bit as cute.
25. Miaow, says the cuddly kitten,
26. Baa, says the woolly sheep,
27. Oink, says the piggy-wiggy,
28. And the banker says beep-beep.

29. So I want to play at Bankers Trust
30. Like a hippety-hoppety bunny,
31. And best of all, oh best of all,
32. With really truly money.
33. Now grown-ups dear, it's nightie-night
34. Until my dream comes true,
35. And I bid you a happy boop-a-doop
36. And a big beep-beep adieu.
