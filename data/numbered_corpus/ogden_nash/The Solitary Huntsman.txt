1. The solitary huntsman
2. No coat of pink doth wear,
3. But midnight black from cap to spur
4. Upon his midnight mare.
5. He drones a tuneless jingle
6. In lieu of tally-ho:
7. “I’ll catch a fox
8. And put him in a box
9. And never let him go.”
10. The solitary huntsman,
11. He follows silent hounds.
12. No horn proclaims his joyless sport,
13. And never a hoofbeat sounds.
14. His hundred hounds, his thousands,
15. Their master’s will they know:
16. To catch a fox
17. And put him in a box
18. And never let him go.

19. For all the fox’s doubling
20. They track him to his den.
21. The chase may fill a morning,
22. Or threescore years and ten.
23. The huntsman never sated
24. Screaks to his saddlebow,
25. “I’ll catch another fox
26. And put him in a box
27. And never let him go.”
