1. When people aren't asking questions
2. They're making suggestions
3. And when they're not doing one of those
4. They're either looking over your shoulder or stepping on your toes
5. And then as if that weren't enough to annoy you
6. They employ you.
7. Anybody at leisure
8. Incurs everybody's displeasure.
9. It seems to be very irking
10. To people at work to see other people not working,
11. So they tell you that work is wonderful medicine,
12. Just look at Firestone and Ford and Edison,
13. And they lecture you till they're out of breath or something
14. And then if you don't succumb they starve you to death or something.
15. All of which results in a nasty quirk:
16. That if you don't want to work you have to work to earn enough money so that you won't have to work.
