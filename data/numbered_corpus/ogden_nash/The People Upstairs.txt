1. The people upstairs all practise ballet
2. Their living room is a bowling alley
3. Their bedroom is full of conducted tours.
4. Their radio is louder than yours,
5. They celebrate week-ends all the week.
6. When they take a shower, your ceilings leak.
7. They try to get their parties to mix
8. By supplying their guests with Pogo sticks,
9. And when their fun at last abates,
10. They go to the bathroom on roller skates.
11. I would love the people upstairs wondrous
12. If instead of above us, they just lived under us.
