1. Let's straighten this out, my little man,
2. And reach an agreement if we can.
3. I entered your door as an honored guest.
4. My shoes are shined and my trousers are pressed,
5. And I won't stretch out and read you the funnies
6. And I won't pretend that we're Easter bunnies.
7. If you must get somebody down on the floor,
8. What in the hell are your parents for?
9. I do not like the things that you say
10. And I hate the games that you want to play.
11. No matter how frightfully hard you try,
12. We've little in common, you and I.
13. The interest I take in my neighbor's nursery
14. Would have to grow, to be even cursory,
15. And I would that performing sons and nephews
16. Were carted away with the daily refuse,
17. And I hold that frolicsome daughters and nieces
18. Are ample excuse for breaking leases.
19. You may take a sock at your daddy's tummy
20. Or climb all over your doting mummy,
21. But keep your attentions to me in check,
22. Or, sonny boy, I will wring your neck.
23. A happier man today I'd be
24. Had someone wrung it ahead of me.
