1. In January everything freezes.
2. We have two children. Both are she'ses.
3. This is our January rule:
4. One girl in bed, and one in school.

5. In February the blizzard whirls.
6. We own a pair of little girls.
7. Blessings upon of each the head ----
8. The one in school and the one in bed.

9. March is the month of cringe and bluster.
10. Each of our children has a sister.
11. They cling together like Hansel and Gretel,
12. With their noses glued to the benzoin kettle.

13. April is made of impetuous waters
14. And doctors looking down throats of daughters.
15. If we had a son too, and a thoroughbred,
16. We'd have a horse,
17. And a boy,
18. And two girls
19. In bed.
