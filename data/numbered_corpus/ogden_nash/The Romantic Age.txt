1. This one is entering her teens,
2. Ripe for sentimental scenes,
3. Has picked a gangling unripe male,
4. Sees herself in bridal veil,
5. Presses lips and tosses head,
6. Declares she's not too young to wed,
7. Informs you pertly you forget
8. Romeo and Juliet.
9. Do not argue, do not shout;
10. Remind her how that one turned out.
