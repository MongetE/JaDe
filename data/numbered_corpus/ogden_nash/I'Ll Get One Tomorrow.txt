1. Barber, barber, come and get me;
2. Hairy torrents irk and fret me.
3. Hair and hair again appears;
4. And climbs like ivy round my ears.
5. Hair across my collar gambols;
6. Down my neck it wayward ambles.
7. Ever down it trip it tickles;
8. Yes, where it trips it tickles.
9. Barber dear I wish I knew;
10. Why i do not visit you.
11. Why I grudge the minutes ten;
12. In your smiling den.
13. Why I choose to choke on hair;
14. Rather than to mount your chair.
15. Men no busier than I;
16. Weekly to your office hie.
17. Men no busier than myself;
18. Confront the armory on your shelf;
19. Men no wealthier than me;
20. Gladly meet your modest fee.
21. And for a fraction of a dollar;
22. Keep the jungle off their collar.
23. I alone am shy and flustered;
24. Solitary, cowardly custard.
25. Shaggy as a prize angore;
26. Overrun with the creeping flora.
27. Barber, barber, you’re in luck;
28. The bell has rung, the hour has struck.
29. Sloth strong, the hair is strong;
30. I cannot stand it any long.
31. Barber, barber here I come;
32. Shake up the odorous bay rum.
33. Bring on your shears your scythes, your snippers;
34. Bring on your crisp electric driers.
35. Employ a dozen extra sweepers;
36. Bring giant harvesters and reapers.
37. I warn you a bumper crop;
38. Waits to overwhelm your shop.
39. Braber, barber, be verbose;
40. Be anything but clip me close.
41. Leave me razored, leave me scissored
42. Leave me hairless, as a lizard;
43. Barber, barber, single and scald;
44. Barber can’t you make me bald?
45. I will be the happiest of men;
46. And never think of you again.
