1. Being a father
2. Is quite a bother.

3. You are as free as air
4. With time to spare,

5. You're a fiscal rocket
6. With change in your pocket,

7. And then one morn
8. A child is born.

9. Your life has been runcible,
10. Irresponsible,

11. Like an arrow or javelin
12. You've been constantly travelin'.

13. But mostly, I daresay,
14. Without a chaise perc√©e,

15. To which by comparison
16. Nothing's embarison.

17. But all children matures,
18. Maybe even yours.

19. You improve them mentally
20. And straighten them dentally,

21. They grow tall as a lancer
22. And ask questions you can't answer,

23. And supply you with data
24. About how everybody else wears lipstick sooner and stays up later,

25. And if they are popular,
26. The phone they monopular.

27. They scorn the dominion
28. Of their parent's opinion,

29. They're no longer corralable
30. Once they find that you're fallible

31. But after you've raised them and educated them and gowned them,
32. They just take their little fingers and wrap you around them.

33. Being a father Is quite a bother,
34. But I like it, rather.
