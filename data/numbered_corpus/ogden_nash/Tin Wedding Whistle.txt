1. Though you know it anyhow
2. Listen to me, darling, now,
3. Proving what I need not prove
4. How I know I love you, love.
5. Near and far, near and far,
6. I am happy where you are;
7. Likewise I have never larnt
8. How to be it where you aren't.
9. Far and wide, far and wide,
10. I can walk with you beside;
11. Furthermore, I tell you what,
12. I sit and sulk where you are not.
13. Visitors remark my frown
14. Where you're upstairs and I am down,
15. Yes, and I'm afraid I pout
16. When I'm indoors and you are out;
17. But how contentedly I view
18. Any room containing you.
19. In fact I care not where you be,
20. Just as long as it's with me.
21. In all your absences I glimpse
22. Fire and flood and trolls and imps.
23. Is your train a minute slothful?
24. I goad the stationmaster wrothful.
25. When with friends to bridge you drive
26. I never know if you're alive,
27. And when you linger late in shops
28. I long to telephone the cops.
29. Yet how worth the waiting for,
30. To see you coming through the door.
31. Somehow, I can be complacent
32. Never but with you adjacent.
33. Near and far, near and far,
34. I am happy where you are;
35. Likewise I have never larnt
36. How to be it where you aren't.
37. Then grudge me not my fond endeavor,
38. To hold you in my sight forever;
39. Let none, not even you, disparage
40. Such a valid reason for a marriage.
