1. AND has my darling told a lie?
2. Did she forget that GOD was by?
3. That GOD, who saw the things she did,
4. From whom no action can be hid;
5. Did she forget that GOD could see
6. And hear, wherever she might be?

7. He made your eyes, and can discern
8. Whichever way you think to turn;
9. He made your ears, and he can hear
10. When you think nobody is near;
11. In every place, by night or day,
12. He watches all you do and say.

13. Oh, how I wish you would but try
14. To act, as shall not need a lie;
15. And when you wish a thing to do,
16. That has been once forbidden you,
17. Remember that, nor ever dare
18. To disobey­, for GOD is there.

19. Why should you fear the truth to tell?
20. Does falsehood ever do so well?
21. Can you be satisfied to know,
22. There's something wrong to hide below?
23. No! let your fault be what it may,
24. To own it is the happy way.

25. So long as you your crime conceal,
26. You cannot light and gladsome feel:
27. Your little heart will seem oppress'd,
28. As if a weight were on your breast;
29. And e'en your mother's eye to meet,
30. Will tinge your face with shame and heat.

31. Yes, GOD has made your duty clear,
32. By every blush, by every fear;
33. And conscience, like an angel kind,
34. Keeps watch to bring it to your mind:
35. Its friendly warnings ever heed,
36. And neither tell a lie­ nor need.
