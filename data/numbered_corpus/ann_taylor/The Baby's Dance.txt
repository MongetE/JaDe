1. Dance little baby, dance up high,
2. Never mind baby, mother is by;
3. Crow and caper, caper and crow,
4. There little baby, there you go;
5. Up to the ceiling, down to the ground,
6. Backwards and forwards, round and round;
7. Dance little baby, and mother shall sing,
8. With the merry coral, ding, ding, ding.
