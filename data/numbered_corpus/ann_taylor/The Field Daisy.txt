1. I'm a pretty little thing,
2. Always coming with the spring;
3. In the meadows green I'm found,
4. Peeping just above the ground,
5. And my stalk is cover'd flat
6. With a white and yellow hat.

7. Little Mary, when you pass
8. Lightly o'er the tender grass,
9. Skip about, but do not tread
10. On my bright but lowly head,
11. For I always seem to say,
12. "Surely winter's gone away."
