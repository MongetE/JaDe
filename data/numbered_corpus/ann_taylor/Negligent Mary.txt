1. AH, Mary! what, do you for dolly not care?
2. And why is she left on the floor?
3. Forsaken, and cover'd with dust, I declare;
4. With you I must trust her no more.

5. I thought you were pleased, as you took her so gladly,
6. When on your birthday she was sent;
7. Did I ever suppose you would use her so sadly?
8. Was that, do you think, what I meant?

9. With her bonnet of straw you once were delighted,
10. And trimm'd it so pretty with pink;
11. But now it is crumpled, and dolly is slighted:
12. Her nurse quite forgets her, I think.

13. Suppose now–for Mary is dolly to me,
14. Whom I love to see tidy and fair–
15. Suppose I should leave you, as dolly I see,
16. In tatters, and comfortless there.

17. But dolly feels nothing, as you do, my dear,
18. Nor cares for her negligent nurse:
19. If I were as careless as you are, I fear,
20. Your lot, and my fault, would be worse.

21. And therefore it is, in my Mary, I strive
22. To check every fault that I see:
23. Mary's doll is but waxen–mamma's is alive,
24. And of far more importance than she.
