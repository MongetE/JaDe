1. 'I DO not like to go to bed,'
2. Sleepy little Harry said;
3. 'Go, naughty Betty, go away,
4. I will not come at all, I say! '

5. Oh, silly child! what is he saying?
6. As if he could be always playing!
7. Then, Betty, you must come and carry
8. This very foolish little Harry.

9. The little birds are better taught,
10. They go to roosting when they ought:
11. And all the ducks, and fowls, you know,
12. They went to bed an hour ago.

13. The little beggar in the street,
14. Who wanders with his naked feet,
15. And has not where to lay his head,
16. Oh, he'd be glad to go to bed.
