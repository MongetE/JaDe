1. DOWN in a green and shady bed,
2. A modest violet grew;
3. Its stalk was bent, it hung its head
4. As if to hide from view.

5. And yet it was a lovely flower,
6. Its colour bright and fair;
7. It might have graced a rosy bower,
8. Instead of hiding there.

9. Yet thus it was content to bloom,
10. In modest tints arrayed;
11. And there diffused a sweet perfume,
12. Within the silent shade.

13. Then let me to the valley go
14. This pretty flower to see;
15. That I may also learn to grow
16. In sweet humility.
