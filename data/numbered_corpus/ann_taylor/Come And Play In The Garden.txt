1. LITTLE sister, come away,
2. And let us in the garden play,
3. For it is a pleasant day.

4. On the grass-plat let us sit,
5. Or, if you please, we'll play a bit,
6. And run about all over it.

7. But the fruit we will not pick,
8. For that would be a naughty trick,
9. And very likely make us sick.

10. Nor will we pluck the pretty flowers
11. That grow about the beds and bowers,
12. Because you know they are not ours.

13. We'll take the daisies, white and red,
14. Because mamma has often said
15. That we may gather then instead.

16. And much I hope we always may
17. Our very dear mamma obey,
18. And mind whatever she may say.
