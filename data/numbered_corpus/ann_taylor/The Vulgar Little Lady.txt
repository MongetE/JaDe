1. "But, mamma, now, " said Charlotte, "pray, don't you believe
2. That I'm better than Jenny, my nurse?
3. Only see my red shoes, and the lace on my sleeve;
4. Her clothes are a thousand times worse.

5. "I ride in my coach, and have nothing to do,
6. And the country folks stare at me so;
7. And nobody dares to control me but you
8. Because I'm a lady, you know.

9. "Then, servants are vulgar, and I am genteel;
10. So really, 'tis out of the way,
11. To think that I should not be better a deal
12. Than maids, and such people as they. "

13. "Gentility, Charlotte," her mother replied,
14. "Belongs to no station or place;
15. And there's nothing so vulgar as folly and pride,
16. Though dress'd in red slippers and lace.

17. Not all the fine things that fine ladies possess
18. Should teach them the poor to despise;
19. For 'tis in good manners, and not in good dress,
20. That the truest gentility lies."
