1. THE Butterfly, an idle thing,
2. Nor honey makes, nor yet can sing,
3. As do the bee and bird;
4. Nor does it, like the prudent ant,
5. Lay up the grain for times of want,
6. A wise and cautious hoard.

7. My youth is but a summer's day:
8. Then like the bee and ant I'll lay
9. A store of learning by;
10. And though from flower to flower I rove,
11. My stock of wisdom I'll improve
12. Nor be a butterfly.
