1. IN an elegant frock, trimm'd with beautiful lace,
2. And hair nicely curl'd, hanging over her face,
3. Young Fanny went out to the house of a friend,
4. With a large little party the evening to spend.

5. 'Ah! how they will all be delighted, I guess,
6. And stare with surprise at my handsome new dress!'
7. Thus said the vain girl, and her little heart beat,
8. Impatient the happy young party to meet.

9. But, alas! they were all too intent on their play
10. To observe the fine clothes of this lady so gay,
11. And thus all her trouble quite lost its design;â€“
12. For they saw she was proud, but forgot she was fine.

13. 'Twas Lucy, though only in simple white clad,
14. (Nor trimmings, nor laces, nor jewels, she had,)
15. Whose cheerful good-nature delighted them more
16. Than Fanny and all the fine garments she wore.

17. 'Tis better to have a sweet smile on one's face,
18. Than to wear a fine frock with an elegant lace,
19. For the good-natured girl is loved best in the main,
20. If her dress is but decent, though ever so plain.
