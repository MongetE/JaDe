1. Well, what's the matter? there's a face
2. What ! has it cut a vein?
3. And is it quite a shocking place?
4. Come, let us look again.

5. I see it bleeds, but never mind
6. That tiny little drop;
7. I don't believe you'll ever find
8. That crying makes it stop.

9. 'Tis sad indeed to cry at pain,
10. For any but a baby;
11. If that should chance to cut a vein,
12. We should not wonder, may be.

13. But such a man as you should try
14. To bear a little sorrow:
15. So run along, and wipe your eye,
16. 'Twill all be well to-morrow.
