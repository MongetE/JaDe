1. Go, go, my naughty girl, and kiss
2. Your little sister dear;
3. I must not have such things as this,
4. And noisy quarrels here.

5. What! little children scratch and fight,
6. That ought to be so mild;
7. Oh! Mary, it's a shocking sight
8. To see an angry child.

9. I can't imagine, for my part,
10. The reason for your folly;
11. She did not do you any hurt
12. By playing with your dolly.

13. See, see, the little tears that run
14. Fast from her watery eye:
15. Come, my sweet innocent, have done,
16. 'Twill do no good to cry.

17. Go, Mary, wipe her tears away,
18. And make it up with kisses:
19. And never turn a pretty play
20. To such a pet as this is.
