1. Thank you, pretty cow, that made
2. Pleasant milk to soak my bread,
3. Every day and every night,
4. Warm, and fresh, and sweet, and white.

5. Do not chew the hemlock rank,
6. Growing on the weedy bank;
7. But the yellow cowslips eat;
8. They perhaps will make it sweet.

9. Where the purple violet grows,
10. Where the bubbling water flows,
11. Where the grass is fresh and fine,
12. Pretty cow, go there to dine.
