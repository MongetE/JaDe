1. ON the cheerful village green,
2. Skirted round with houses small,
3. All the boys and girls are seen,
4. Playing there with hoop and ball.

5. Now they frolic hand in hand,
6. Making many a merry chain;
7. Then they form a warlike band,
8. Marching o'er the level plain.

9. Now ascends the worsted ball,
10. High it rises in the air,
11. Or against the cottage wall,
12. Up and down it bounces there.

13. Then the hoop, with even pace,
14. Runs before the merry throngs;
15. Joy is seen in every face,
16. Joy is heard in cheerful songs.

17. Rich array, and mansions proud,
18. Gilded toys, and costly fare,
19. Would not make the little crowd
20. Half so happy as they are.

21. Then, contented with my state,
22. Where true pleasure may be seen,
23. Let me envy not the great,
24. On a cheerful village green.
