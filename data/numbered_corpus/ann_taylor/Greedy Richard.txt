1. 'I THINK I want some pies this morning,'
2. Said Dick, stretching himself and yawning;
3. So down he threw his slate and books,
4. And saunter'd to the pastry-cook's.

5. And there he cast his greedy eyes
6. Round on the jellies and the pies,
7. So to select, with anxious care,
8. The very nicest that was there.

9. At last the point was thus decided:
10. As his opinion was divided
11. 'Twixt pie and jelly, being loth
12. Either to leave, he took them both.

13. Now Richard never could be pleased
14. To stop when hunger was appeased,
15. But would go on to eat still more
16. When he had had an ample store.

17. 'No, not another now,' said Dick;
18. 'Dear me, I feel extremely sick:
19. I cannot even eat this bit;
20. I wish I had not tasted it. '

21. Then slowing rising from his seat,
22. He threw his cheesecake in the street,
23. And left the tempting pastry-cook's
24. With very discontented looks.

25. Just then a man with wooden leg
26. Met Dick, and held his hat to beg;
27. And while he told his mournful case,
28. Look'd at him with imploring face.

29. Dick, wishing to relieve his pain,
30. His pockets search'd, but search'd in vain;
31. And so at last he did declare,
32. He had not left a farthing there.

33. The beggar turn'd with face of grief,
34. And look of patient unbelief,
35. While Richard now his folly blamed,
36. And felt both sorry and ashamed.

37. 'I wish,' said he (but wishing's vain),
38. 'I had my money back again,
39. And had not spent my last, to pay
40. For what I only threw away.

41. 'Another time, I'll take advice,
42. And not buy things because they're nice;
43. But rather save my little store,
44. To give to those who want it more. '
