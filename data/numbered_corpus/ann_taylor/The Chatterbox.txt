1. From morning till night it was Lucy's delight
2. To chatter and talk without stopping:
3. There was not a day but she rattled away,
4. Like water for ever a-dropping.

5. No matter at all if the subjects were small,
6. Or not worth the trouble of saying,
7. 'Twas equal to her, she would talking prefer
8. To working, or reading, or playing.

9. You'll think now, perhaps, that there would have been gaps,
10. If she had not been wonderfully clever:
11. That her sense was so great, and so witty her pate,
12. It would be forthcoming for ever;

13. But that's quite absurd, for have you not heard
14. That much tongue and few brains are connected?
15. That they are supposed to think least who talk most,
16. And their wisdom is always suspected?

17. While Lucy was young, had she bridled her tongue,
18. With a little good sense and exertion,
19. Who knows, but she might now have been our delight,
20. Instead of our jest and aversion?
