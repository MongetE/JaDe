1. As William and Thomas were walking one day,
2. They came by a fine orchard's side:
3. They would rather eat apples than spell, read, or play,
4. And Thomas to William then cried:

5. 'O brother, look yonder! what clusters hang there!
6. I'll try and climb over the wall:
7. I must have an apple; I will have a pear;
8. Although it should cost me a fall!'

9. Said William to Thomas, 'To steal is a sin,
10. Mamma has oft told this to thee:
11. I never have stolen, nor will I begin,
12. So the apples may hang on the tree. '

13. 'You are a good boy, as you ever have been,'
14. Said Thomas, 'let's walk on, my lad:
15. We'll call on our schoolfellow, Benjamin Green,
16. Who to see us I know will be glad.
