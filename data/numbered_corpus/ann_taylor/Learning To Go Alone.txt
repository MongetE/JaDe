1. Come, my darling, come away,
2. Take a pretty walk to-day;
3. Run along, and never fear,
4. I'll take care of baby dear:
5. Up and down with little feet,
6. That's the way to walk, my sweet.

7. Now it is so very near,
8. Soon she'll get to mother dear.
9. There she comes along at last:
10. Here's my finger, hold it fast:
11. Now one pretty little kiss,
12. After such a walk as this.
