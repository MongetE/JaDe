1. MY father and mother are dead,
2. Nor friend, nor relation I know;
3. And now the cold earth is their bed,
4. And daisies will over them grow.

5. I cast my eyes into the tomb,
6. The sight made me bitterly cry;
7. I said, 'And is this the dark room,
8. Where my father and mother must lie?'

9. I cast my eyes round me again,
10. In hopes some protector to see;
11. Alas! but the search was in vain,
12. For none had compassion on me.

13. I cast my eyes up to the sky,
14. I groan'd, though I said not a word;
15. Yet GOD was not deaf to my cry,
16. The Friend of the fatherless heard.

17. For since I have trusted his care,
18. And learn'd on his word to depend,
19. He has kept me from every snare,
20. And been my best Father and Friend.
