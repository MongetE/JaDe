1. WHY does my Anna toss her head,
2. And look so scornfully around,
3. As if she scarcely deign'd to tread
4. Upon the daisy-dappled ground?

5. Does fancied beauty fire thine eye,
6. The brilliant tint, the satin skin?
7. Does the loved glass, in passing by,
8. Reflect a graceful form and thin?

9. Alas! that form, and brilliant fire,
10. Will never win beholder's love;
11. It may, indeed, make fools admire,
12. But ne'er the wise and good can move.

13. So grows the tulip, gay and bold,
14. The broadest sunshine its delight;
15. Like rubies, or like burnish'd gold,
16. It shows its petals, glossy bright.

17. But who the gaudy floweret crops,
18. As if to court a sweet perfume!
19. Admired it blows, neglected drops,
20. And sinks unheeded to its doom.

21. The virtues of the heart may move
22. Affections of a genial kind;
23. While beauty fails to stir our love,
24. And wins the eye, but not the mind.
