1. Death's the lover that I'd be taking;
2. Wild and fickle and fierce is he.
3. Small's his care if my heart be breaking-
4. Gay young Death would have none of me.

5. Hear them clack of my haste to greet him!
6. No one other my mouth had kissed.
7. I had dressed me in silk to meet him-
8. False young Death would not hold the tryst.

9. Slow's the blood that was quick and stormy,
10. Smooth and cold is the bridal bed;
11. I must wait till he whistles for me-
12. Proud young Death would not turn his head.

13. I must wait till my breast is wilted.
14. I must wait till my back is bowed,
15. I must rock in the corner, jilted-
16. Death went galloping down the road.

17. Gone's my heart with a trifling rover.
18. Fine he was in the game he played-
19. Kissed, and promised, and threw me over,
20. And rode away with a prettier maid.
