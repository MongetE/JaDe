1. God's acre was her garden-spot, she said;
2. She sat there often, of the Summer days,
3. Little and slim and sweet, among the dead,
4. Her hair a fable in the leveled rays.

5. She turned the fading wreath, the rusted cross,
6. And knelt to coax about the wiry stem.
7. I see her gentle fingers on the moss
8. Now it is anguish to remember them.

9. And once I saw her weeping, when she rose
10. And walked a way and turned to look around-
11. The quick and envious tears of one that knows
12. She shall not lie in consecrated ground.
