1. How shall I wail, that wasn't meant for weeping?
2. Love has run and left me, oh, what then?
3. Dream, then, I must, who never can be sleeping;
4. What if I should meet Love, once again?

5. What if I met him, walking on the highway?
6. Let him see how lightly I should care.
7. He'd travel his way, I would follow my way;
8. Hum a little song, and pass him there.

9. What if at night, beneath a sky of ashes,
10. He should seek my doorstep, pale with need?
11. There could he lie, and dry would be my lashes;
12. Let him stop his noise, and let me read.

13. Oh, but I'm gay, that's better off without him;
14. Would he'd come and see me, laughing here.
15. Lord! Don't I know I'd have my arms about him,
16. Crying to him, "Oh, come in, my dear!"
