1. Love has gone a-rocketing.
2. That is not the worst;
3. I could do without the thing,
4. And not be the first.

5. Joy has gone the way it came.
6. That is nothing new;
7. I could get along the same, --
8. Many people do.

9. Dig for me the narrow bed,
10. Now I am bereft.
11. All my pretty hates are dead,
12. And what have I left?
