1. When I was young and bold and strong,
2. Oh, right was right, and wrong was wrong!
3. My plume on high, my flag unfurled,
4. I rode away to right the world.
5. "Come out, you dogs, and fight!" said I,
6. And wept there was but once to die.

7. But I am old; and good and bad
8. Are woven in a crazy plaid.
9. I sit and say, "The world is so;
10. And he is wise who lets it go.
11. A battle lost, a battle won-
12. The difference is small, my son."

13. Inertia rides and riddles me;
14. The which is called Philosophy.
