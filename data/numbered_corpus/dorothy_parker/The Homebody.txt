1. There still are kindly things for me to know,
2. Who am afraid to dream, afraid to feel-
3. This little chair of scrubbed and sturdy deal,
4. This easy book, this fire, sedate and slow.
5. And I shall stay with them, nor cry the woe
6. Of wounds across my breast that do not heal;
7. Nor wish that Beauty drew a duller steel,
8. Since I am sworn to meet her as a foe.

9. It may be, when the devil's own time is done,
10. That I shall hear the dropping of the rain
11. At midnight, and lie quiet in my bed;
12. Or stretch and straighten to the yellow sun;
13. Or face the turning tree, and have no pain;
14. So shall I learn at last my heart is dead.
