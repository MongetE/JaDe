1. They hurried here, as soon as you had died,
2. Their faces damp with haste and sympathy,
3. And pressed my hand in theirs, and smoothed my knee,
4. And clicked their tongues, and watched me, mournful-eyed.
5. Gently they told me of that Other Side-
6. How, even then, you waited there for me,
7. And what ecstatic meeting ours would be.
8. Moved by the lovely tale, they broke, and cried.

9. And when I smiled, they told me I was brave,
10. And they rejoiced that I was comforted,
11. And left to tell of all the help they gave.
12. But I had smiled to think how you, the dead,
13. So curiously preoccupied and grave,
14. Would laugh, could you have heard the things they said.
