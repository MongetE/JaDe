1. When I was bold, when I was bold-
2. And that's a hundred years!-
3. Oh, never I thought my breast could hold
4. The terrible weight of tears.

5. I said: "Now some be dolorous;
6. I hear them wail and sigh,
7. And if it be Love that play them thus,
8. Then never a love will I."

9. I said: "I see them rack and rue,
10. I see them wring and ache,
11. And little I'll crack my heart in two
12. With little the heart can break."

13. When I was gay, when I was gay-
14. It's ninety years and nine!-
15. Oh, never I thought that Death could lay
16. His terrible hand in mine.

17. I said: "He plies his trade among
18. The musty and infirm;
19. A body so hard and bright and young
20. Could never be meat for worm."

21. "I see him dull their eyes," I said,
22. "And still their rattling breath.
23. And how under God could I be dead
24. That never was meant for Death?"

25. But Love came by, to quench my sleep,
26. And here's my sundered heart;
27. And bitter's my woe, and black, and deep,
28. And little I guessed a part.

29. Yet this there is to cool my breast,
30. And this to ease my spell;
31. Now if I were Love's, like all the rest,
32. Then can I be Death's, as well.

33. And he shall have me, sworn and bound,
34. And I'll be done with Love.
35. And better I'll be below the ground
36. Than ever I'll be above.
