1. If you should sail for Trebizond, or die,
2. Or cry another name in your first sleep,
3. Or see me board a train, and fail to sigh,
4. Appropriately, I'd clutch my breast and weep.
5. And you, if I should wander through the door,
6. Or sin, or seek a nunnery, or save
7. My lips and give my cheek, would tread the floor
8. And aptly mention poison and the grave.

9. Therefore the mooning world is gratified,
10. Quoting how prettily we sigh and swear;
11. And you and I, correctly side by side,
12. Shall live as lovers when our bones are bare
13. And though we lie forever enemies,
14. Shall rank with Abelard and Heloise.
