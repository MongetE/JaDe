1. There's little to have but the things I had,
2. There's little to bear but the things I bore.
3. There's nothing to carry and naught to add,
4. And glory to Heaven, I paid the score.

5. There's little to do but I did before,
6. There's little to learn but the things I know;
7. And this is the sum of a lasting lore:
8. Scratch a lover, and find a foe.

9. And couldn't it be I was young and mad
10. If ever my heart on my sleeve I wore?
11. There's many to claw at a heart unclad,
12. And little the wonder it ripped and tore.
13. There's one that'll join in their push and roar,
14. With stories to jabber, and stones to throw;
15. He'll fetch you a lesson that costs you sore:
16. Scratch a lover, and find a foe.

17. So little I'll offer to you, my lad;
18. It's little in loving I set my store.
19. There's many a maid would be flushed and glad,
20. And better you'll knock at a kindlier door.
21. I'll dig at my lettuce, and sweep my floor,
22. Forever, forever I'm done with woe.
23. And happen I'll whistle about my chore,
24. "Scratch a lover, and find a foe."



25. L'ENVOI

26. Oh, beggar or prince, no more, no more!
27. Be off and away with your strut and show.
28. The sweeter the apple, the blacker the core:
29. Scratch a lover, and find a foe!
