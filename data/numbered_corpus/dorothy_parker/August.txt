1. When my eyes are weeds,
2. And my lips are petals, spinning
3. Down the wind that has beginning
4. Where the crumpled beeches start
5. In a fringe of salty reeds;
6. When my arms are elder-bushes,
7. And the rangy lilac pushes
8. Upward, upward through my heart;

9. Summer, do your worst!
10. Light your tinsel moon, and call on
11. Your performing stars to fall on
12. Headlong through your paper sky;
13. Nevermore shall I be cursed
14. By a flushed and amorous slattern,
15. With her dusty laces' pattern
16. Trailing, as she straggles by.
