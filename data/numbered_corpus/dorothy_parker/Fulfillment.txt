1. For this my mother wrapped me warm,
2. And called me home against the storm,
3. And coaxed my infant nights to quiet,
4. And gave me roughage in my diet,
5. And tucked me in my bed at eight,
6. And clipped my hair, and marked my weight,
7. And watched me as I sat and stood:
8. That I might grow to womanhood
9. To hear a whistle and drop my wits
10. And break my heart to clattering bits.
