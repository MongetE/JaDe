1. Star, that gives a gracious dole,
2. What am I to choose?
3. Oh, will it be a shriven soul,
4. Or little buckled shoes?

5. Shall I wish a wedding-ring,
6. Bright and thin and round,
7. Or plead you send me covering-
8. A newly spaded mound?

9. Gentle beam, shall I implore
10. Gold, or sailing-ships,
11. Or beg I hate forevermore
12. A pair of lying lips?

13. Swing you low or high away,
14. Burn you hot or dim;
15. My only wish I dare not say-
16. Lest you should grant me him.
