1. Love has had his way with me.
2. This my heart is torn and maimed
3. Since he took his play with me.
4. Cruel well the bow-boy aimed,

5. Shot, and saw the feathered shaft
6. Dripping bright and bitter red.
7. He that shrugged his wings and laughed-
8. Better had he left me dead.

9. Sweet, why do you plead me, then,
10. Who have bled so sore of that?
11. Could I bear it once again? . . .
12. Drop a hat, dear, drop a hat!
