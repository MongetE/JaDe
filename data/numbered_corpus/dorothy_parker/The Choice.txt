1. He'd have given me rolling lands,
2. Houses of marble, and billowing farms,
3. Pearls, to trickle between my hands,
4. Smoldering rubies, to circle my arms.
5. You- you'd only a lilting song,
6. Only a melody, happy and high,
7. You were sudden and swift and strong-
8. Never a thought for another had I.

9. He'd have given me laces rare,
10. Dresses that glimmered with frosty sheen,
11. Shining ribbons to wrap my hair,
12. Horses to draw me, as fine as a queen.
13. You- you'd only to whistle low,
14. Gayly I followed wherever you led.
15. I took you, and I let him go-
16. Somebody ought to examine my head!
