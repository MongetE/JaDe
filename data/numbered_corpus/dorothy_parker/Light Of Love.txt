1. Joy stayed with me a night --
2. Young and free and fair --
3. And in the morning light
4. He left me there.

5. Then Sorrow came to stay,
6. And lay upon my breast
7. He walked with me in the day.
8. And knew me best.

9. I'll never be a bride,
10. Nor yet celibate,
11. So I'm living now with Pride --
12. A cold bedmate.

13. He must not hear nor see,
14. Nor could he forgive
15. That Sorrow still visits me
16. Each day I live.
