1. There was a rose that faded young;
2. I saw its shattered beauty hung
3. Upon a broken stem.
4. I heard them say, "What need to care
5. With roses budding everywhere?"
6. I did not answer them.

7. There was a bird, brought down to die;
8. They said, "A hundred fill the sky-
9. What reason to be sad?"
10. There was a girl, whose lover fled;
11. I did not wait, the while they said,
12. "There's many another lad."
