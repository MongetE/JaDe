1. Such glorious faith as fills your limpid eyes,
2. Dear little friend of mine, I never knew.
3. All-innocent are you, and yet all-wise.
4. (For Heaven's sake, stop worrying that shoe!)
5. You look about, and all you see is fair;
6. This mighty globe was made for you alone.
7. Of all the thunderous ages, you're the heir.
8. (Get off the pillow with that dirty bone!)

9. A skeptic world you face with steady gaze;
10. High in young pride you hold your noble head,
11. Gayly you meet the rush of roaring days.
12. (Must you eat puppy biscuit on the bed?)
13. Lancelike your courage, gleaming swift and strong,
14. Yours the white rapture of a winged soul,
15. Yours is a spirit like a Mayday song.
16. (God help you, if you break the goldfish bowl!)

17. "Whatever is, is good" - your gracious creed.
18. You wear your joy of living like a crown.
19. Love lights your simplest act, your every deed.
20. (Drop it, I tell you- put that kitten down!)
21. You are God's kindliest gift of all - a friend.
22. Your shining loyalty unflecked by doubt,
23. You ask but leave to follow to the end.
24. (Couldn't you wait until I took you out?)
