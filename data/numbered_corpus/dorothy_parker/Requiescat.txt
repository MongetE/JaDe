1. Tonight my love is sleeping cold
2. Where none may see and none shall pass.
3. The daisies quicken in the mold,
4. And richer fares the meadow grass.

5. The warding cypress pleads the skies,
6. The mound goes level in the rain.
7. My love all cold and silent lies-
8. Pray God it will not rise again!
