1. A string of shiny days we had,
2. A spotless sky, a yellow sun;
3. And neither you nor I was sad
4. When that was through and done.

5. But when, one day, a boy comes by
6. And pleads me with your happiest vow,
7. "There was a lad I knew--" I'll sigh,
8. "I do not know him now."

9. And when another girl shall pass
10. And speak a little name I said,
11. Then you will say, "There was a lass-
12. I wonder is she dead."

13. And each of us will sigh, and start
14. A-talking of a faded year,
15. And lay a hand above a heart,
16. And dry a pretty tear.
