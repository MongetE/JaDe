1. Oh, ponder, friend, the porcupine;
2. Refresh your recollection,
3. And sit a moment, to define
4. His means of self-protection.

5. How truly fortified is he!
6. Where is the beast his double
7. In forethought of emergency
8. And readiness for trouble?

9. Recall his figure, and his shade-
10. How deftly planned and clearly
11. For slithering through the dappled glade
12. Unseen, or pretty nearly.

13. Yet should an alien eye discern
14. His presence in the woodland,
15. How little has he left to learn
16. Of self-defense! My good land!

17. For he can run, as swift as sound,
18. To where his goose may hang high-
19. Or thrust his head against the ground
20. And tunnel half to Shanghai;

21. Or he can climb the dizziest bough-
22. Unhesitant, mechanic-
23. And, resting, dash from off his brow
24. The bitter beads of panic;

25. Or should pursuers press him hot,
26. One scarcely needs to mention
27. His quick and cruel barbs, that got
28. Shakespearean attention;

29. Or driven to his final ditch,
30. To his extremest thicket,
31. He'll fight with claws and molars (which
32. Is not considered cricket).

33. How amply armored, he, to fend
34. The fear of chase that haunts him!
35. How well prepared our little friend!-
36. And who the devil wants him?
