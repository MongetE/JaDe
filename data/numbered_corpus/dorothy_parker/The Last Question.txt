1. New love, new love, where are you to lead me?
2. All along a narrow way that marks a crooked line.
3. How are you to slake me, and how are you to feed me?
4. With bitter yellow berries, and a sharp new wine.

5. New love, new love, shall I be forsaken?
6. One shall go a-wandering, and one of us must sigh.
7. Sweet it is to slumber, but how shall we awaken-
8. Whose will be the broken heart, when dawn comes by?
