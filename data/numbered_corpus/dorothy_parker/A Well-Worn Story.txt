1. In April, in April,
2. My one love came along,
3. And I ran the slope of my high hill
4. To follow a thread of song.

5. His eyes were hard as porphyry
6. With looking on cruel lands;
7. His voice went slipping over me
8. Like terrible silver hands.

9. Together we trod the secret lane
10. And walked the muttering town.
11. I wore my heart like a wet, red stain
12. On the breast of a velvet gown.

13. In April, in April,
14. My love went whistling by,
15. And I stumbled here to my high hill
16. Along the way of a lie.

17. Now what should I do in this place
18. But sit and count the chimes,
19. And splash cold water on my face
20. And spoil a page with rhymes?
