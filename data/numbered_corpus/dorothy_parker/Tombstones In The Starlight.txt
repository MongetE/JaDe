1. I. The Minor Poet

2. His little trills and chirpings were his best.
3. No music like the nightingale's was born
4. Within his throat; but he, too, laid his breast
5. Upon a thorn.


6. II. The Pretty Lady

7. She hated bleak and wintry things alone.
8. All that was warm and quick, she loved too well-
9. A light, a flame, a heart against her own;
10. It is forever bitter cold, in Hell.

11. III. The Very Rich Man

12. He'd have the best, and that was none too good;
13. No barrier could hold, before his terms.
14. He lies below, correct in cypress wood,
15. And entertains the most exclusive worms.


16. IV. The Fisherwoman

17. The man she had was kind and clean
18. And well enough for every day,
19. But, oh, dear friends, you should have seen
20. The one that got away!


21. V. The Crusader

22. Arrived in Heaven, when his sands were run,
23. He seized a quill, and sat him down to tell
24. The local press that something should be done
25. About that noisy nuisance, Gabriel.


26. VI. The Actress

27. Her name, cut clear upon this marble cross,
28. Shines, as it shone when she was still on earth;
29. While tenderly the mild, agreeable moss
30. Obscures the figures of her date of birth.
