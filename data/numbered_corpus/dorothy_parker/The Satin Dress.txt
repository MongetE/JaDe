1. Needle, needle, dip and dart,
2. Thrusting up and down,
3. Where's the man could ease a heart
4. Like a satin gown?

5. See the stitches curve and crawl
6. Round the cunning seams-
7. Patterns thin and sweet and small
8. As a lady's dreams.

9. Wantons go in bright brocade;
10. Brides in organdie;
11. Gingham's for the plighted maid;
12. Satin's for the free!

13. Wool's to line a miser's chest;
14. Crepe's to calm the old;
15. Velvet hides an empty breast
16. Satin's for the bold!

17. Lawn is for a bishop's yoke;
18. Linen's for a nun;
19. Satin is for wiser folk-
20. Would the dress were done!

21. Satin glows in candlelight-
22. Satin's for the proud!
23. They will say who watch at night,
24. "What a fine shroud!"
