1. I think, no matter where you stray,
2. That I shall go with you a way.
3. Though you may wander sweeter lands,
4. You will not soon forget my hands,
5. Nor yet the way I held my head,
6. Nor all the tremulous things I said.
7. You still will see me, small and white
8. And smiling, in the secret night,
9. And feel my arms about you when
10. The day comes fluttering back again.
11. I think, no matter where you be,
12. You'll hold me in your memory
13. And keep my image, there without me,
14. By telling later loves about me.
