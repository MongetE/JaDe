1. Oh, mercifullest one of all,
2. Oh, generous as dear,
3. None lived so lowly, none so small,
4. Thou couldst withhold thy tear:

5. How swift, in pure compassion,
6. How meek in charity,
7. To offer friendship to the one
8. Who begged but love of thee!

9. Oh, gentle word, and sweetest said!
10. Oh, tender hand, and first
11. To hold the warm, delicious bread
12. To lips burned black of thirst.
