1. I never may turn the loop of a road
2. Where sudden, ahead, the sea is Iying,
3. But my heart drags down with an ancient load-
4. My heart, that a second before was flying.

5. I never behold the quivering rain-
6. And sweeter the rain than a lover to me-
7. But my heart is wild in my breast with pain;
8. My heart, that was tapping contentedly.

9. There's never a rose spreads new at my door
10. Nor a strange bird crosses the moon at night
11. But I know I have known its beauty before,
12. And a terrible sorrow along with the sight.

13. The look of a laurel tree birthed for May
14. Or a sycamore bared for a new November
15. Is as old and as sad as my furtherest day-
16. What is it, what is it, I almost remember?
