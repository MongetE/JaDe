1. "So surely is she mine," you say, and turn
2. Your quick and steady mind to harder things-
3. To bills and bonds and talk of what men earn-
4. And whistle up the stair, of evenings.
5. And do you see a dream behind my eyes,
6. Or ask a simple question twice of me-
7. "Thus women are," you say; for men are wise
8. And tolerant, in their security.

9. How shall I count the midnights I have known
10. When calm you turn to me, nor feel me start,
11. To find my easy lips upon your own
12. And know my breast beneath your rhythmic heart.
13. Your god defer the day I tell you this:
14. My lad, my lad, it is not you I kiss!
