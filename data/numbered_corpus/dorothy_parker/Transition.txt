1. Too long and quickly have I lived to vow
2. The woe that stretches me shall never wane,
3. Too often seen the end of endless pain
4. To swear that peace no more shall cool my brow.
5. I know, I know- again the shriveled bough
6. Will burgeon sweetly in the gentle rain,
7. And these hard lands be quivering with grain-
8. I tell you only: it is Winter now.

9. What if I know, before the Summer goes
10. Where dwelt this bitter frenzy shall be rest?
11. What is it now, that June shall surely bring
12. New promise, with the swallow and the rose?
13. My heart is water, that I first must breast
14. The terrible, slow loveliness of Spring.
