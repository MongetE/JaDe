1. Who was there had seen us
2. Wouldn't bid him run?
3. Heavy lay between us
4. All our sires had done.

5. There he was, a-springing
6. Of a pious race,
7. Setting hags a-swinging
8. In a market-place;

9. Sowing turnips over
10. Where the poppies lay;
11. Looking past the clover,
12. Adding up the hay;

13. Shouting through the Spring song,
14. Clumping down the sod;
15. Toadying, in sing-song,
16. To a crabbed god.

17. There I was, that came of
18. Folk of mud and name-
19. I that had my name of
20. Them without a name.

21. Up and down a mountain
22. Streeled my silly stock;
23. Passing by a fountain,
24. Wringing at a rock;

25. Devil-gotten sinners,
26. Throwing back their heads,
27. Fiddling for their dinners,
28. Kissing for their beds.

29. Not a one had seen us
30. Wouldn't help him flee.
31. Angry ran between us
32. Blood of him and me.

33. How shall I be mating
34. Who have looked above-
35. Living for a hating,
36. Dying of a love?
