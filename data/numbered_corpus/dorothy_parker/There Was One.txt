1. There was one a-riding grand
2. On a tall brown mare,
3. And a fine gold band
4. He brought me there.

5. A little, gold band
6. He held to me
7. That would shine on a hand
8. For the world to see.

9. There was one a-walking swift
10. To a little, new song,
11. And a rose was the gift
12. He carried along,

13. First of all the posies,
14. Dewy and red.
15. They that have roses
16. Never need bread.

17. There was one with a swagger
18. And a soft, slow tongue,
19. And a bright, cold dagger
20. Where his left hand swung-

21. Craven and gilt,
22. Old and bad-
23. And his stroking of the hilt
24. Set a girl mad.

25. There was one a-riding grand
26. As he rode from me.
27. And he raised his golden band
28. And he threw it in the sea.

29. There was one a-walking slow
30. To a sad, Iong sigh.
31. And his rose drooped low,
32. And he flung it down to die.

33. There was one with a swagger
34. And a little, sharp pride,
35. And a bright, cold dagger
36. Ever at his side.

37. At his side it stayed
38. When he ran to part.
39. What is this blade
40. Struck through my heart?
