1. Lilacs blossom just as sweet
2. Now my heart is shattered.
3. If I bowled it down the street,
4. Who's to say it mattered?
5. If there's one that rode away
6. What would I be missing?
7. Lips that taste of tears, they say,
8. Are the best for kissing.

9. Eyes that watch the morning star
10. Seem a little brighter;
11. Arms held out to darkness are
12. Usually whiter.
13. Shall I bar the strolling guest,
14. Bind my brow with willow,
15. When, they say, the empty breast
16. Is the softer pillow?

17. That a heart falls tinkling down,
18. Never think it ceases.
19. Every likely lad in town
20. Gathers up the pieces.
21. If there's one gone whistling by
22. Would I let it grieve me?
23. Let him wonder if I lie;
24. Let him half believe me.
