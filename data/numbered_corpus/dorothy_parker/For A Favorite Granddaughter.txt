1. Never love a simple lad,
2. Guard against a wise,
3. Shun a timid youth and sad,
4. Hide from haunted eyes.

5. Never hold your heart in pain
6. For an evil-doer;
7. Never flip it down the lane
8. To a gifted wooer.

9. Never love a loving son,
10. Nor a sheep astray;
11. Gather up your skirts and run
12. From a tender way.

13. Never give away a tear,
14. Never toss a pine;
15. Should you heed my words, my dear,
16. You're no blood of mine!
