1. Love is sharper than stones or sticks;
2. Lone as the sea, and deeper blue;
3. Loud in the night as a clock that ticks;
4. Longer-lived than the Wandering Jew.
5. Show me a love was done and through,
6. Tell me a kiss escaped its debt!
7. Son, to your death you'll pay your due-
8. Women and elephants never forget.
9. Ever a man, alas, would mix,
10. Ever a man, heigh-ho, must woo;
11. So he's left in the world-old fix,
12. Thus is furthered the sale of rue.
13. Son, your chances are thin and few-
14. Won't you ponder, before you're set?
15. Shoot if you must, but hold in view
16. Women and elephants never forget.
17. Down from Caesar past Joynson-Hicks
18. Echoes the warning, ever new:
19. Though they're trained to amusing tricks,
20. Gentler, they, than the pigeon's coo,
21. Careful, son, of the curs'ed two-
22. Either one is a dangerous pet;
23. Natural history proves it true-
24. Women and elephants never forget.
25. L'ENVOI

26. Prince, a precept I'd leave for you,
27. Coined in Eden, existing yet:
28. Skirt the parlor, and shun the zoo-
29. Women and elephants never forget.
