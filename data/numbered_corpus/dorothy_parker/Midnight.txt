1. The stars are soft as flowers, and as near;
2. The hills are webs of shadow, slowly spun;
3. No separate leaf or single blade is here-
4. All blend to one.

5. No moonbeam cuts the air; a sapphire light
6. Rolls lazily. and slips again to rest.
7. There is no edged thing in all this night,
8. Save in my breast.
