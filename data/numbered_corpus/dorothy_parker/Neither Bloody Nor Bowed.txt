1. They say of me, and so they should,
2. It's doubtful if I come to good.
3. I see acquaintances and friends
4. Accumulating dividends,
5. And making enviable names
6. In science, art, and parlor games.
7. But I, despite expert advice,
8. Keep doing things I think are nice,
9. And though to good I never come-
10. Inseparable my nose and thumb!
