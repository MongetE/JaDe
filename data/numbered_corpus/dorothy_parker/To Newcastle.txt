1. I met a man the other day-
2. A kindly man, and serious-
3. Who viewed me in a thoughtful way,
4. And spoke me so, and spoke me thus:

5. "Oh, dallying's a sad mistake;
6. 'Tis craven to survey the morrow!
7. Go give your heart, and if it break-
8. A wise companion is Sorrow.

9. "Oh, live, my child, nor keep your soul
10. To crowd your coffin when you're dead...."
11. I asked his work; he dealt in coal,
12. And shipped it up the Tyne, he said.
