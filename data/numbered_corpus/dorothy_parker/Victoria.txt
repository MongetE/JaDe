1. Dear dead Victoria
2. Rotted cosily;
3. In excelsis gloria,
4. And R. I. P.

5. And her shroud was buttoned neat,
6. And her bones were clean and round,
7. And her soul was at her feet
8. Like a bishop's marble hound.

9. Albert lay a-drying,
10. Lavishly arrayed,
11. With his soul out flying
12. Where his heart had stayed.

13. And there's some could tell you what land
14. His spirit walks serene
15. (But I've heard them say in Scotland
16. It's never been seen).
