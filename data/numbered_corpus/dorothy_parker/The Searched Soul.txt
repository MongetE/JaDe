1. When I consider, pro and con,
2. What things my love is built upon --
3. A curly mouth; a sinewed wrist;
4. A questioning brow; a pretty twist
5. Of words as old and tried as sin;
6. A pointed ear; a cloven chin;
7. Long, tapered limbs; and slanted eyes
8. Not cold nor kind nor darkly wise --
9. When so I ponder, here apart,
10. What shallow boons suffice my heart,
11. What dust-bound trivia capture me,
12. I marvel at my normalcy.
