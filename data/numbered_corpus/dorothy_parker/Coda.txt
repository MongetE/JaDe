1. There's little in taking or giving,
2. There's little in water or wine;
3. This living, this living, this living
4. Was never a project of mine.
5. Oh, hard is the struggle, and sparse is
6. The gain of the one at the top,
7. For art is a form of catharsis,
8. And love is a permanent flop,
9. And work is the province of cattle,
10. And rest's for a clam in a shell,
11. So I'm thinking of throwing the battle-
12. Would you kindly direct me to hell?
