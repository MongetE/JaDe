1. This is what I vow;
2. He shall have my heart to keep,
3. Sweetly will we stir and sleep,
4. All the years, as now.
5. Swift the measured sands may run;
6. Love like this is never done;
7. He and I are welded one:
8. This is what I vow.

9. This is what I pray:
10. Keep him by me tenderly;
11. Keep him sweet in pride of me,
12. Ever and a day;
13. Keep me from the old distress;
14. Let me, for our happiness,
15. Be the one to love the less:
16. This is what I pray.

17. This is what I know:
18. Lovers' oaths are thin as rain;
19. Love's a harbinger of pain-
20. Would it were not so!
21. Ever is my heart a-thirst,
22. Ever is my love accurst;
23. He is neither last nor first:
24. This is what I know.
