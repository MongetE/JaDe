1. I always saw, I always said
2. If I were grown and free,
3. I'd have a gown of reddest red
4. As fine as you could see,

5. To wear out walking, sleek and slow,
6. Upon a Summer day,
7. And there'd be one to see me so
8. And flip the world away.

9. And he would be a gallant one,
10. With stars behind his eyes,
11. And hair like metal in the sun,
12. And lips too warm for lies.

13. I always saw us, gay and good,
14. High honored in the town.
15. Now I am grown to womanhood....
16. I have the silly gown.
