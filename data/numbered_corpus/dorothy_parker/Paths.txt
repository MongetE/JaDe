1. I shall tread, another year,
2. Ways I walked with Grief,
3. Past the dry, ungarnered ear
4. And the brittle leaf.

5. I shall stand, a year apart,
6. Wondering, and shy,
7. Thinking, "Here she broke her heart;
8. Here she pled to die."

9. I shall hear the pheasants call,
10. And the raucous geese;
11. Down these ways, another Fall,
12. I shall walk with Peace.

13. But the pretty path I trod
14. Hand-in-hand with Love-
15. Underfoot, the nascent sod,
16. Brave young boughs above,

17. And the stripes of ribbon grass
18. By the curling way-
19. I shall never dare to pass
20. To my dying day.
