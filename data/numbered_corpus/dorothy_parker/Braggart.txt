1. The days will rally, wreathing
2. Their crazy tarantelle;
3. And you must go on breathing,
4. But I'll be safe in hell.

5. Like January weather,
6. The years will bite and smart,
7. And pull your bones together
8. To wrap your chattering heart.

9. The pretty stuff you're made of
10. Will crack and crease and dry.
11. The thing you are afraid of
12. Will look from every eye.

13. You will go faltering after
14. The bright, imperious line,
15. And split your throat on laughter,
16. And burn your eyes with brine.

17. You will be frail and musty
18. With peering, furtive head,
19. Whilst I am young and lusty
20. Among the roaring dead.
