1. So take my vows and scatter them to sea;
2. Who swears the sweetest is no more than human.
3. And say no kinder words than these of me:
4. "Ever she longed for peace, but was a woman!
5. And thus they are, whose silly female dust
6. Needs little enough to clutter it and bind it,
7. Who meet a slanted gaze, and ever must
8. Go build themselves a soul to dwell behind it."

9. For now I am my own again, my friend!
10. This scar but points the whiteness of my breast;
11. This frenzy, like its betters, spins an end,
12. And now I am my own.  And that is best.
13. Therefore, I am immeasurably grateful
14. To you, for proving shallow, false, and hateful.
