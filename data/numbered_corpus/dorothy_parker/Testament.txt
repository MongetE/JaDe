1. Oh, let it be a night of lyric rain
2. And singing breezes, when my bell is tolled.
3. I have so loved the rain that I would hold
4. Last in my ears its friendly, dim refraln.
5. I shall lie cool and quiet, who have lain
6. Fevered, and watched the book of day unfold.
7. Death will not see me flinch; the heart is bold
8. That pain has made incapable of pain.

9. Kinder the busy worms than ever love;
10. It will be peace to lie there, empty-eyed,
11. My bed made secret by the leveling showers,
12. My breast replenishing the weeds above.
13. And you will say of me, "Then has she died?
14. Perhaps I should have sent a spray of flowers."
