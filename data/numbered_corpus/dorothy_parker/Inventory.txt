1. Four be the things I am wiser to know:
2. Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.

3. Four be the things Iâ€™d been better without:
4. Love, curiosity, freckles, and doubt.

5. Three be the things I shall never attain:
6. Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.

7. Three be the things I shall have till I die:
8. Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye.
