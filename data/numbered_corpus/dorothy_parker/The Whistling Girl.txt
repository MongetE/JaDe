1. Back of my back, they talk of me,
2. Gabble and honk and hiss;
3. Let them batten, and let them be-
4. Me, I can sing them this:

5. "Better to shiver beneath the stars,
6. Head on a faithless breast,
7. Than peer at the night through rusted bars,
8. And share an irksome rest.

9. "Better to see the dawn come up,
10. Along of a trifling one,
11. Than set a steady man's cloth and cup
12. And pray the day be done.

13. "Better be left by twenty dears
14. Than lie in a loveless bed;
15. Better a loaf that's wet with tears
16. Than cold, unsalted bread."

17. Back of my back, they wag their chins,
18. Whinny and bleat and sigh;
19. But better a heart a-bloom with sins
20. Than hearts gone yellow and dry!
