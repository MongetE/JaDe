1. I cannot rest, I cannot rest
2. In straight and shiny wood,
3. My woven hands upon my breast--
4. The dead are all so good!

5. The earth is cool across their eyes;
6. They lie there quietly.
7. But I am neither old nor wise;
8. They do not welcome me.

9. Where never I walked alone before,
10. I wander in the weeds;
11. And people scream and bar the door,
12. And rattle at their beads.

13. We cannot rest, we never rest
14. Within a narrow bed
15. Who still must love the living best--
16. Who hate the pompous dead!
