1. Here in my heart I am Helen;
2. I'm Aspasia and Hero, at least.
3. I'm Judith, and Jael, and Madame de Stael;
4. I'm Salome, moon of the East.

5. Here in my soul I am Sappho;
6. Lady Hamilton am I, as well.
7. In me Recamier vies with Kitty O'Shea,
8. With Dido, and Eve, and poor Nell.

9. I'm of the glamorous ladies
10. At whose beckoning history shook.
11. But you are a man, and see only my pan,
12. So I stay at home with a book.
