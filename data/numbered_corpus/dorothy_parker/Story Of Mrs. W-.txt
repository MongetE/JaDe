1. My garden blossoms pink and white,
2. A place of decorous murmuring,
3. Where I am safe from August night
4. And cannot feel the knife of Spring.

5. And I may walk the pretty place
6. Before the curtsying hollyhocks
7. And laundered daisies, round of face-
8. Good little girls, in party frocks.

9. My trees are amiably arrayed
10. In pattern on the dappled sky,
11. And I may sit in filtered shade
12. And watch the tidy years go by.

13. And I may amble pleasantly
14. And hear my neighbors list their bones
15. And click my tongue in sympathy,
16. And count the cracks in paving-stones.

17. My door is grave in oaken strength,
18. The cool of linen calms my bed,
19. And there at night I stretch my length
20. And envy no one but the dead.
