1. Because my love is quick to come and go-
2. A little here, and then a little there-
3. What use are any words of mine to swear
4. My heart is stubborn, and my spirit slow
5. Of weathering the drip and drive of woe?
6. What is my oath, when you have but to bare
7. My little, easy loves; and I can dare
8. Only to shrug, and answer, "They are so"?

9. You do not know how heavy a heart it is
10. That hangs about my neck- a clumsy stone
11. Cut with a birth, a death, a bridal-day.
12. Each time I love, I find it still my own,
13. Who take it, now to that lad, now to this,
14. Seeking to give the wretched thing away.
