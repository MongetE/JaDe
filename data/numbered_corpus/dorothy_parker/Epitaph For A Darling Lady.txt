1. All her hours were yellow sands,
2. Blown in foolish whorls and tassels;
3. Slipping warmly through her hands;
4. Patted into little castles.

5. Shiny day on shiny day
6. Tumble in a rainbow clutter,
7. As she flipped them all away,
8. Sent them spinning down the gutter.

9. Leave for her a red young rose,
10. Go your way, and save your pity;
11. She is happy, for she knows
12. That her dust is very pretty.
