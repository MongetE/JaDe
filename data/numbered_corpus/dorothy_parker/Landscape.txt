1. Now this must be the sweetest place
2. From here to heaven's end;
3. The field is white and flowering lace,
4. The birches leap and bend,

5. The hills, beneath the roving sun,
6. From green to purple pass,
7. And little, trifling breezes run
8. Their fingers through the grass.

9. So good it is, so gay it is,
10. So calm it is, and pure.
11. A one whose eyes may look on this
12. Must be the happier, sure.

13. But me- I see it flat and gray
14. And blurred with misery,
15. Because a lad a mile away
16. Has little need of me.
