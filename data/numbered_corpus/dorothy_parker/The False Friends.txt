1. They laid their hands upon my head,
2. They stroked my cheek and brow;
3. And time could heal a hurt, they said,
4. And time could dim a vow.

5. And they were pitiful and mild
6. Who whispered to me then,
7. "The heart that breaks in April, child,
8. Will mend in May again."

9. Oh, many a mended heart they knew.
10. So old they were, and wise.
11. And little did they have to do
12. To come to me with lies!

13. Who flings me silly talk of May
14. Shall meet a bitter soul;
15. For June was nearly spent away
16. Before my heart was whole.
