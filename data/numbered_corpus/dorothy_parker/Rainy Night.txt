1. Ghosts of all my lovely sins,
2. Who attend too well my pillow,
3. Gay the wanton rain begins;
4. Hide the limp and tearful willow.

5. Turn aside your eyes and ears,
6. Trail away your robes of sorrow,
7. You shall have my further years-
8. You shall walk with me tomorrow.

9. I am sister to the rain;
10. Fey and sudden and unholy,
11. Petulant at the windowpane,
12. Quickly lost, remembered slowly.

13. I have lived with shades, a shade;
14. I am hung with graveyard flowers.
15. Let me be tonight arrayed
16. In the silver of the showers.

17. Every fragile thing shall rust;
18. When another April passes
19. I may be a furry dust,
20. Sifting through the brittle grasses.

21. All sweet sins shall be forgot;
22. Who will live to tell their siring?
23. Hear me now, nor let me rot
24. Wistful still, and still aspiring.

25. Ghosts of dear temptations, heed;
26. I am frail, be you forgiving.
27. See you not that I have need
28. To be living with the living?

29. Sail, tonight, the Styx's breast;
30. Glide among the dim processions
31. Of the exquisite unblest,
32. Spirits of my shared transgressions,

33. Roam with young Persephone.
34. Plucking poppies for your slumber . . .
35. With the morrow, there shall be
36. One more wraith among your number.
