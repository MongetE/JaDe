1. Authors and actors and artists and such
2. Never know nothing, and never know much.
3. Sculptors and singers and those of their kidney
4. Tell their affairs from Seattle to Sydney.
5. Playwrights and poets and such horses' necks
6. Start off from anywhere, end up at sex.
7. Diarists, critics, and similar roe
8. Never say nothing, and never say no.
9. People Who Do Things exceed my endurance;
10. God, for a man that solicits insurance!
