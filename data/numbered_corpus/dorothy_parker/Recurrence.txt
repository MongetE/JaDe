1. We shall have our little day.
2. Take my hand and travel still
3. Round and round the little way,
4. Up and down the little hill.

5. It is good to love again;
6. Scan the renovated skies,
7. Dip and drive the idling pen,
8. Sweetly tint the paling lies.

9. Trace the dripping, pierced heart,
10. Speak the fair, insistent verse,
11. Vow to God, and slip apart,
12. Little better, Little worse.

13. Would we need not know before
14. How shall end this prettiness;
15. One of us must love the more,
16. One of us shall love the less.

17. Thus it is, and so it goes;
18. We shall have our day, my dear.
19. Where, unwilling, dies the rose
20. Buds the new, another year.
