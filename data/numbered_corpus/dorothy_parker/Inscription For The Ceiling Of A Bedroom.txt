1. Daily dawns another day;
2. I must up, to make my way.
3. Though I dress and drink and eat,
4. Move my fingers and my feet,
5. Learn a little, here and there,
6. Weep and laugh and sweat and swear,
7. Hear a song, or watch a stage,
8. Leave some words upon a page,
9. Claim a foe, or hail a friend-
10. Bed awaits me at the end.

11. Though I go in pride and strength,
12. I'll come back to bed at length.
13. Though I walk in blinded woe,
14. Back to bed I'm bound to go.
15. High my heart, or bowed my head,
16. All my days but lead to bed.
17. Up, and out, and on; and then
18. Ever back to bed again,
19. Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall-
20. I'm a fool to rise at all!
