1. If it shine or if it rain,
2. Little will I care or know.
3. Days, like drops upon a pane,
4. Slip, and join, and go.

5. At my door's another lad;
6. Here's his flower in my hair.
7. If he see me pale and sad,
8. Will he see me fair?

9. I sit looking at the floor.
10. Little will I think or say
11. If he seek another door;
12. Even if he stay.
