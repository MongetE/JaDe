1. They hail you as their morning star
2. Because you are the way you are.
3. If you return the sentiment,
4. They'll try to make you different;
5. And once they have you, safe and sound,
6. They want to change you all around.
7. Your moods and ways they put a curse on;
8. They'd make of you another person.
9. They cannot let you go your gait;
10. They influence and educate.
11. They'd alter all that they admired.
12. They make me sick, they make me tired.
