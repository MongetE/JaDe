1. Half across the world from me
2. Lie the lands I'll never see-
3. I, whose longing lives and dies
4. Where a ship has sailed away;
5. I, that never close my eyes
6. But to look upon Cathay.

7. Things I may not know nor tell
8. Wait, where older waters swell;
9. Ways that flowered at Sappho's tread,
10. Winds that sighed in Homer's strings,
11. Vibrant with the singing dead,
12. Golden with the dust of wings.

13. Under deeper skies than mine,
14. Quiet valleys dip and shine.
15. Where their tender grasses heal
16. Ancient scars of trench and tomb
17. I shall never walk: nor kneel
18. Where the bones of poets bloom.

19. If I seek a lovelier part,
20. Where I travel goes my heart;
21. Where I stray my thought must go;
22. With me wanders my desire.
23. Best to sit and watch the snow,
24. Turn the lock, and poke the fire.
