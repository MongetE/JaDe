1. Roses, rooted warm in earth,
2. Bud in rhyme, another age;
3. Lilies know a ghostly birth
4. Strewn along a patterned page;
5. Golden lad and chimbley sweep
6. Die; and so their song shall keep.

7. Wind that in Arcadia starts
8. In and out a couplet plays;
9. And the drums of bitter hearts
10. Beat the measure of a phrase.
11. Sweets and woes but come to print
12. Quae cum ita sint.
