1. Always I knew that it could not last
2. (Gathering clouds, and the snowflakes flying),
3. Now it is part of the golden past
4. (Darkening skies, and the night-wind sighing);
5. It is but cowardice to pretend.
6. Cover with ashes our love's cold crater-
7. Always I've known that it had to end
8. Sooner or later.
9. Always I knew it would come like this
10. (Pattering rain, and the grasses springing),
11. Sweeter to you is a new love's kiss
12. (Flickering sunshine, and young birds singing).
13. Gone are the raptures that once we knew,
14. Now you are finding a new joy greater-
15. Well, I'll be doing the same thing, too,
16. Sooner or later.
