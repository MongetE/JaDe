1. My hand, a little raised, might press a star-
2. Where I may look, the frosted peaks are spun,
3. So shaped before Olympus was begun,
4. Spanned each to each, now, by a silver bar.
5. Thus to face Beauty have I traveled far,
6. But now, as if around my heart were run
7. Hard, lacing fingers, so I stand undone.
8. Of all my tears, the bitterest these are.

9. Who humbly followed Beauty all her ways,
10. Begging the brambles that her robe had passed,
11. Crying her name in corridors of stone,
12. That day shall know his weariedest of days -
13. When Beauty, still and suppliant at last,
14. Does not suffice him, once they are alone.
