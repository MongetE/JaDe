1. This I say, and this I know:
2. Love has seen the last of me.
3. Love's a trodden lane to woe,
4. Love's a path to misery.

5. This I know, and knew before,
6. This I tell you, of my years:
7. Hide your heart, and lock your door.
8. Hell's afloat in lovers' tears.

9. Give your heart, and toss and moan;
10. What a pretty fool you look!
11. I am sage, who sit alone;
12. Here's my wool, and here's my book.

13. Look! A lad's a-waiting there,
14. Tall he is and bold, and gay.
15. What the devil do I care
16. What I know, and what I say?
