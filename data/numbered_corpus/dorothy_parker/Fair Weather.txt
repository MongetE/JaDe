1. This level reach of blue is not my sea;
2. Here are sweet waters, pretty in the sun,
3. Whose quiet ripples meet obediently
4. A marked and measured line, one after one.
5. This is no sea of mine. that humbly laves
6. Untroubled sands, spread glittering and warm.
7. I have a need of wilder, crueler waves;
8. They sicken of the calm, who knew the storm.

9. So let a love beat over me again,
10. Loosing its million desperate breakers wide;
11. Sudden and terrible to rise and wane;
12. Roaring the heavens apart; a reckless tide
13. That casts upon the heart, as it recedes,
14. Splinters and spars and dripping, salty weeds.
