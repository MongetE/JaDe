1. The first time I died, I walked my ways;
2. I followed the file of limping days.

3. I held me tall, with my head flung up,
4. But I dared not look on the new moon's cup.

5. I dared not look on the sweet young rain,
6. And between my ribs was a gleaming pain.

7. The next time I died, they laid me deep.
8. They spoke worn words to hallow my sleep.

9. They tossed me petals, they wreathed me fern,
10. They weighted me down with a marble urn.

11. And I lie here warm, and I lie here dry,
12. And watch the worms slip by, slip by.
