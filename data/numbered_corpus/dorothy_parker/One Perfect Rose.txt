1. A single flow'r he sent me, since we met.
2. All tenderly his messenger he chose;
3. Deep-hearted, pure, with scented dew still wet -
4. One perfect rose.
5. I knew the language of the floweret;
6. 'My fragile leaves,' it said, 'his heart enclose.'
7. Love long has taken for his amulet
8. One perfect rose.
9. Why is it no one ever sent me yet
10. One perfect limousine, do you suppose?
11. Ah no, it's always just my luck to get
12. One perfect rose.
