1. Only name the day, and we'll fly away
2. In the face of old traditions,
3. To a sheltered spot, by the world forgot,
4. Where we'll park our inhibitions.
5. Come and gaze in eyes where the lovelight lies
6. As it psychoanalyzes,
7. And when once you glean what your fantasies mean
8. Life will hold no more surprises.
9. When you've told your love what you're thinking of
10. Things will be much more informal;
11. Through a sunlit land we'll go hand-in-hand,
12. Drifting gently back to normal.

13. While the pale moon gleams, we will dream sweet dreams,
14. And I'll win your admiration,
15. For it's only fair to admit I'm there
16. With a mean interpretation.
17. In the sunrise glow we will whisper low
18. Of the scenes our dreams have painted,
19. And when you're advised what they symbolized
20. We'll begin to feel acquainted.
21. So we'll gaily float in a slumber boat
22. Where subconscious waves dash wildly;
23. In the stars' soft light, we will say good-night—
24. And "good-night!" will put it mildly.

25. Our desires shall be from repressions free—
26. As it's only right to treat them.
27. To your ego's whims I will sing sweet hymns,
28. And ad libido repeat them.
29. With your hand in mine, idly we'll recline
30. Amid bowers of neuroses,
31. While the sun seeks rest in the great red west
32. We will sit and match psychoses.
33. So come dwell a while on that distant isle
34. In the brilliant tropic weather;
35. Where a Freud in need is a Freud indeed,
36. We'll always be Jung together.
