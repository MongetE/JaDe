1. If I had a shiny gun,
2. I could have a world of fun
3. Speeding bullets through the brains
4. Of the folk who give me pains;

5. Or had I some poison gas,
6. I could make the moments pass
7. Bumping off a number of
8. People whom I do not love.

9. But I have no lethal weapon-
10. Thus does Fate our pleasure step on!
11. So they still are quick and well
12. Who should be, by rights, in hell.
