1. This, no song of an ing√©nue,
2. This, no ballad of innocence;
3. This, the rhyme of a lady who
4. Followed ever her natural bents.
5. This, a solo of sapience,
6. This, a chantey of sophistry,
7. This, the sum of experiments, --
8. I loved them until they loved me.
9. Decked in garments of sable hue,
10. Daubed with ashes of myriad Lents,
11. Wearing shower bouquets of rue,
12. Walk I ever in penitence.
13. Oft I roam, as my heart repents,
14. Through God's acre of memory,
15. Marking stones, in my reverence,
16. "I loved them until they loved me."

17. Pictures pass me in long review,--
18. Marching columns of dead events.
19. I was tender, and, often, true;
20. Ever a prey to coincidence.
21. Always knew I the consequence;
22. Always saw what the end would be.
23. We're as Nature has made us -- hence
24. I loved them until they loved me.
