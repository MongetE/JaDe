1. The day that I was christened-
2. It's a hundred years, and more!-
3. A hag came and listened
4. At the white church door,
5. A-hearing her that bore me
6. And all my kith and kin
7. Considerately, for me,
8. Renouncing sin.
9. While some gave me corals,
10. And some gave me gold,
11. And porringers, with morals
12. Agreeably scrolled,
13. The hag stood, buckled
14. In a dim gray cloak;
15. Stood there and chuckled,
16. Spat, and spoke:
17. "There's few enough in life'll
18. Be needing my help,
19. But I've got a trifle
20. For your fine young whelp.
21. I give her sadness,
22. And the gift of pain,
23. The new-moon madness,
24. And the love of rain."
25. And little good to lave me
26. In their holy silver bowl
27. After what she gave me-
28. Rest her soul!
