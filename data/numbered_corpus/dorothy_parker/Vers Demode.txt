1. For one, the amaryllis and the rose;
2. The poppy, sweet as never lilies are;
3. The ripen'd vine, that beckons as it blows;
4. The dancing star.

5. For one, the trodden rosemary and rue;
6. The bowl, dipt ever in the purple stream
7. And, for the other one, a fairer due-
8. Sleep, and no dream.
