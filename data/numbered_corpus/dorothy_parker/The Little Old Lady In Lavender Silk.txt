1. I was seventy-seven, come August,
2. I shall shortly be losing my bloom;
3. I've experienced zephyr and raw gust
4. And (symbolical) flood and simoom.

5. When you come to this time of abatement,
6. To this passing from Summer to Fall,
7. It is manners to issue a statement
8. As to what you got out of it all.

9. So I'll say, though reflection unnerves me
10. And pronouncements I dodge as I can,
11. That I think (if my memory serves me)
12. There was nothing more fun than a man!
13. In my youth, when the crescent was too wan
14. To embarrass with beams from above,
15. By the aid of some local Don Juan
16. I fell into the habit of love.

17. And I learned how to kiss and be merry- an
18. Education left better unsung.
19. My neglect of the waters Pierian
20. Was a scandal, when Grandma was young.

21. Though the shabby unbalanced the splendid,
22. And the bitter outmeasured the sweet,
23. I should certainly do as I then did,
24. Were I given the chance to repeat.

25. For contrition is hollow and wraithful,
26. And regret is no part of my plan,
27. And I think (if my memory's faithful)
28. There was nothing more fun than a man!
