1. And if my heart be scarred and burned,
2. The safer, I, for all I learned;
3. The calmer, I, to see it true
4. That ways of love are never new-
5. The love that sets you daft and dazed
6. Is every love that ever blazed;
7. The happier, I, to fathom this:
8. A kiss is every other kiss.
9. The reckless vow, the lovely name,
10. When Helen walked, were spoke the same;
11. The weighted breast, the grinding woe,
12. When Phaon fled, were ever so.
13. Oh, it is sure as it is sad
14. That any lad is every lad,
15. And what's a girl, to dare implore
16. Her dear be hers forevermore?
17. Though he be tried and he be bold,
18. And swearing death should he be cold,
19. He'll run the path the others went....
20. But you, my sweet, are different.
