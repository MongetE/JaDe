1. Say my love is easy had,
2. Say I'm bitten raw with pride,
3. Say I am too often sad-
4. Still behold me at your side.

5. Say I'm neither brave nor young,
6. Say I woo and coddle care,
7. Say the devil touched my tongue-
8. Still you have my heart to wear.

9. But say my verses do not scan,
10. And I get me another man!
