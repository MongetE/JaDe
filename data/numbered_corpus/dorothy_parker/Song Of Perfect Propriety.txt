1. Oh, I should like to ride the seas,
2. A roaring buccaneer;
3. A cutlass banging at my knees,
4. A dirk behind my ear.
5. And when my captives' chains would clank
6. I'd howl with glee and drink,
7. And then fling out the quivering plank
8. And watch the beggars sink.

9. I'd like to straddle gory decks,
10. And dig in laden sands,
11. And know the feel of throbbing necks
12. Between my knotted hands.
13. Oh, I should like to strut and curse
14. Among my blackguard crew....
15. But I am writing little verse,
16. As little ladies do.

17. Oh, I should like to dance and laugh
18. And pose and preen and sway,
19. And rip the hearts of men in half,
20. And toss the bits away.
21. I'd like to view the reeling years
22. Through unastonished eyes,
23. And dip my finger-tips in tears,
24. And give my smiles for sighs.

25. I'd stroll beyond the ancient bounds,
26. And tap at fastened gates,
27. And hear the prettiest of sound-
28. The clink of shattered fates.
29. My slaves I'd like to bind with thongs
30. That cut and burn and chill....
31. But I am writing little songs,
32. As little ladies will.
