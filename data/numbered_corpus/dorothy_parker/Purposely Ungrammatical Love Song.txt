1. There's many and many, and not so far,
2. Is willing to dry my tears away;
3. There's many to tell me what you are,
4. And never a lie to all they say.

5. It's little the good to hide my head,
6. It's never the use to bar my door;
7. There's many as counts the tears I shed,
8. There's mourning hearts for my heart is

9. There's honester eyes than your blue eyes,
10. There's better a mile than such as you.
11. But when did I say that I was wise,
12. And when did I hope that you were true?
