1. A nobler king had never breath-
2. I say it now, and said it then.
3. Who weds with such is wed till death
4. And wedded stays in Heaven. Amen.
5. (And oh, the shirts of linen-lawn,
6. And all the armor, tagged and tied,
7. And church on Sundays, dusk and dawn.
8. And bed a thing to kneel beside!)

9. The bravest one stood tall above
10. The rest, and watched me as a light.
11. I heard and heard them talk of love;
12. I'd naught to do but think, at night.

13. The bravest man has littlest brains;
14. That chalky fool from Astolat
15. With all her dying and her pains!-
16. Thank God, I helped him over that.

17. I found him not unfair to see-
18. I like a man with peppered hair!
19. And thus it came about. Ah, me,
20. Tristram was busied otherwhere....

21. A nobler king had never breath-
22. I say it now, and said it then.
23. Who weds with such is wed till death
24. And wedded stays in Heaven. Amen.
