1. Now it's over, and now it's done;
2. Why does everything look the same?
3. Just as bright, the unheeding sun, --
4. Can't it see that the parting came?
5. People hurry and work and swear,
6. Laugh and grumble and die and wed,
7. Ponder what they will eat and wear, --
8. Don't they know that our love is dead?

9. Just as busy, the crowded street;
10. Cars and wagons go rolling on,
11. Children chuckle, and lovers meet, --
12. Don't they know that our love is gone?
13. No one pauses to pay a tear;
14. None walks slow, for the love that's through, --
15. I might mention, my recent dear,
16. I've reverted to normal, too.
