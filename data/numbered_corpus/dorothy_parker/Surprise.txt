1. My heart went fluttering with fear
2. Lest you should go, and leave me here
3. To beat my breast and rock my head
4. And stretch me sleepless on my bed.
5. Ah, clear they see and true they say
6. That one shall weep, and one shall stray
7. For such is Love's unvarying law....
8. I never thought, I never saw
9. That I should be the first to go;
10. How pleasant that it happened so!
