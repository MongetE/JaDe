1. I do not like my state of mind;
2. I'm bitter, querulous, unkind.
3. I hate my legs, I hate my hands,
4. I do not yearn for lovelier lands.
5. I dread the dawn's recurrent light;
6. I hate to go to bed at night.
7. I snoot at simple, earnest folk.
8. I cannot take the gentlest joke.
9. I find no peace in paint or type.
10. My world is but a lot of tripe.
11. I'm disillusioned, empty-breasted.
12. For what I think, I'd be arrested.
13. I am not sick, I am not well.
14. My quondam dreams are shot to hell.
15. My soul is crushed, my spirit sore;
16. I do not like me any more.
17. I cavil, quarrel, grumble, grouse.
18. I ponder on the narrow house.
19. I shudder at the thought of men....
20. I'm due to fall in love again.
