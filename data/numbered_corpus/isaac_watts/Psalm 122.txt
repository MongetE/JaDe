1. Going to church.

2. How did my heart rejoice to hear
3. My friends devoutly say,
4. "In Zion let us all appear,
5. And keep the solemn day!"

6. I love her gates, I love the road;
7. The church, adorned with grace,
8. Stands like a palace built for God,
9. To show his milder face.

10. Up to her courts with joys unknown
11. The holy tribes repair;
12. The Son of David holds his throne,
13. And sits in judgment there.

14. He hears our praises and complaints;
15. And while his awful voice
16. Divides the sinners from the saints,
17. We tremble and rejoice.

18. Peace be within this sacred place,
19. And joy a constant guest!
20. With holy gifts and heav'nly grace
21. Be her attendants blest!

22. My Soul shall pray for Zion still,
23. While life or breath remains;
24. There my best friends, my kindred dwell,
25. There God my Savior reigns.
