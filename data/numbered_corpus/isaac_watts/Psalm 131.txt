1. Humility and submission.

2. Is there ambition in my heart?.
3. Search, gracious God, and see;
4. Or do I act a haughty part?
5. Lord, I appeal to thee.

6. I charge my thoughts, be humble still,
7. And all my carriage mild,
8. Content, my Father, with thy will,
9. And quiet as a child.

10. The patient soul, the lowly mind,
11. Shall have a large reward:
12. Let saints in sorrow lie resigned,
13. And trust a faithful Lord.
