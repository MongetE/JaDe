1. v.1-6
2. C. M.
3. The church is our delight and safety.

4. The Lord of glory is my light,
5. And my salvation too;
6. God is my strength, nor will I fear
7. What all my foes can do.

8. One privilege my heart desires;
9. O grant me an abode
10. Among the churches of thy saints,
11. The temples of my God!

12. There shall I offer my requests,
13. And see thy beauty still;
14. Shall hear thy messages of love,
15. And there inquire thy will.

16. When troubles rise, and storms appear,
17. There may his children hide;
18. God has a strong pavilion where
19. He makes my soul abide.

20. Now shall my head be lifted high
21. Above my foes around,
22. And songs of joy and victory
23. Within thy temple sound.
