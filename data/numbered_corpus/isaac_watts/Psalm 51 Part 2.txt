1. Original and actual sin confessed.

2. Lord, I am vile, conceived in sin;
3. And born unholy and unclean;
4. Sprung from the man whose guilty fall
5. Corrupts the race, and taints us all.

6. Soon as we draw our infant breath,
7. The seeds of sin grow up for death;
8. Thy law demands a perfect heart,
9. But we're defiled in every part.

10. [Great God, create my heart anew,
11. And form my spirit pure and true;
12. O make me wise betimes to spy
13. My danger and my remedy.]

14. Behold, I fall before thy face;
15. My only refuge is thy grace:
16. No outward forms can make me clean
17. The leprosy lies deep within.

18. No bleeding bird, nor bleeding beast,
19. Nor hyssop branch, nor sprinkling priest,
20. Nor running brook, nor flood, nor sea,
21. Can wash the dismal stain away.

22. Jesus, my God, thy blood alone
23. Hath power sufficient to atone;
24. Thy blood can make me white as snow
25. No Jewish types could cleanse me so.

26. While guilt disturbs and breaks my peace,
27. Nor flesh nor soul hath rest or ease;
28. Lord, let me hear thy pard'ning voice,
29. And make my broken bones rejoice.
