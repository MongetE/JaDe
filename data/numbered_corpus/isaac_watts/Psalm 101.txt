1. The magistrate's Psalm.

2. Mercy and judgment are my song;
3. And since they both to thee belong,
4. My gracious God, my righteous King,
5. To thee my songs and vows I bring.

6. If I am raised to bear the sword,
7. I'll take my counsels from thy word;
8. Thy justice and thy heav'nly grace
9. Shall be the pattern of my ways.

10. Let wisdom all my actions guide,
11. And let my God with me reside;
12. No wicked thing shall dwell with me
13. Which may provoke thy jealousy.

14. No sons of slander, rage, and strife
15. Shall be companions of my life;
16. The haughty look, the heart of pride,
17. Within my doors shall ne'er abide.

18. [I'll search the land, and raise the just
19. To posts of honor, wealth, and trust;
20. The men that work thy holy will
21. Shall be my friends and fav'rites still.]

22. In vain shall sinners hope to rise
23. By flatt'ring or malicious lies;
24. And while the innocent I guard,
25. The bold offender sha'n't be spared.

26. The impious crew, that factious band,
27. Shall hide their heads or quit the land;
28. And all that break the public rest,
29. Where I have power, shall be suppressed.
