1. A Psalm before prayer.

2. Sing to the Lord Jehovah's name,
3. And in his strength rejoice;
4. When his salvation is our theme,
5. Exalted be our voice.

6. With thanks approach his awful sight,
7. And psalms of honor sing;
8. The Lord's a God of boundless might,
9. The whole creation's King.

10. Let princes hear, let angels know,
11. How mean their natures seem,
12. Those gods on high and gods below,
13. When once compared with him.

14. Earth, with its caverns dark and deep,
15. Lies in his spacious hand;
16. He fixed the seas what bounds to keep,
17. And where the hills must stand.

18. Come, and with humble souls adore,
19. Come, kneel before his face
20. O may the creatures of his power
21. Be children of his grace!

22. Now is the time; he bends his ear,
23. And waits for your request;
24. Come, lest he rouse his wrath and swear,
25. "Ye shall not see my rest."
