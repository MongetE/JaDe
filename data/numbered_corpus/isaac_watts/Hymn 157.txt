1. Satan's devices.

2. Now Satan comes with dreadful roar
3. And threatens to destroy;
4. He worries whom he can't devour
5. With a malicious joy.

6. Ye sons of God, oppose his rage,
7. Resist, and he'll begone;
8. Thus did our dearest Lord engage
9. And vanquish him alone.

10. Now he appears almost divine,
11. Like innocence and love;
12. But the old serpent lurks within
13. When he assumes the dove.

14. Fly from the false deceiver's tongue,
15. Ye sons of Adam, fly;
16. Our parents found the snare too strong,
17. Nor should the children try.
