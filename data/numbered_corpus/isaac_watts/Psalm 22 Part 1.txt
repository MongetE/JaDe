1. v.1-
2. C. M.
3. The sufferings and death of Christ.

4. Why has my God my soul forsook,
5. Nor will a smile afford?
6. (Thus David once in anguish spoke,
7. And thus our dying Lord.)

8. Though 'tis thy chief delight to dwell
9. Among thy praising saints,
10. Yet thou canst hear a groan as well,
11. And pity our complaints.

12. Our fathers trusted in thy name,
13. And great deliv'rance found;
14. But I'm a worm, despised of men,
15. And trodden to the ground.

16. Shaking the head, they pass me by,
17. And laugh my soul to scorn;
18. "In vain he trusts in God," they cry,.
19. "Neglected and forlorn."

20. But thou art he who formed my flesh
21. By thine almighty word;
22. And since I hung upon the breast,
23. My hope is in the Lord.

24. Why will my Father hide his face,
25. When foes stand threat'ning round,
26. In the dark hour of deep distress,
27. And not a helper found?

28. PAUSE.

29. Behold thy darling left among
30. The cruel and the proud,
31. As bulls of Bashan, fierce and strong,
32. As lions roaring loud.

33. From earth and hell my sorrows meet
34. To multiply the smart;
35. They nail my hands, they pierce my feet,
36. And try to vex my heart.

37. Yet if thy sovereign hand let loose
38. The rage of earth and hell,
39. Why will my heav'nly Father bruise
40. The Son he loves so well?

41. My God, if possible it be,
42. Withhold this bitter cup
43. But I resign my will to thee,
44. And drink the sorrows up).

45. My heart dissolves with pangs unknown,
46. In groans I waste my breath;
47. Thy heavy hand has brought me down
48. Low as the dust of death.

49. Father, I give my spirit up,
50. And trust it in thy hand;
51. My dying flesh shall rest in hope,
52. And rise at thy command.
