1. Afflictions and death under Providence.

2. Job 5:6-8.

3. Not from the dust affliction grows,
4. Nor troubles rise by chance;
5. Yet we are born to cares and woes;
6. A sad inheritance!

7. As sparks break out from burning coals,
8. And still are upwards borne
9. So grief is rooted in our souls,
10. And man grows up to mourn.

11. Yet with my God I leave my cause,
12. And trust his promised grace;
13. He rules me by his well-known laws
14. Of love and righteousness.

15. Not all the pains that e'er I bore
16. Shall spoil my future peace,
17. For death and hell can do no more
18. Than what my Father please.
