1. v.1-6
2. S. M.
3. Safety in God.

4. When, overwhelm'd with grief,
5. My heart within me dies,
6. Helpless, and far from all relief,
7. To heav'n I lift mine eyes.

8. O lead me to the rock
9. That's high above my head,
10. And make the covert of thy wings
11. My shelter and my shade.

12. Within thy presence, Lord,
13. For ever I'll abide;
14. Thou art the tower of my defence,
15. The refuge where I hide.

16. Thou givest me the lot
17. Of those that fear thy name;
18. If endless life be their reward,
19. I shall possess the same.
