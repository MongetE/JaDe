1. Sickness healed, and sorrow removed.

2. I Will extol thee, Lord, on high,
3. At thy command diseases fly:
4. Who but a God can speak and save
5. From the dark borders of the grave?

6. Sing to the Lord, ye saints of his,
7. And tell how large his goodness is;
8. Let all your powers rejoice and bless
9. While you record his holiness.

10. His anger but a moment stays;
11. His love is life and length of days;
12. Though grief and tears the night employ,
13. The morning star restores the joy.
