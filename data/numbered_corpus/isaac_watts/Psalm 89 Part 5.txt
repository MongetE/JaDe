3. The covenant of grace unchangeable.

4. "Yet," saith the Lord, "if David's race,
5. The children of my Son,
6. Should break my laws, abuse my grace,
7. And tempt mine anger down;

8. "Their sins I'll visit with the rod
9. And make their folly smart;
10. But I'll not cease to be their God,
11. Nor from my truth depart.

12. "My cov'nant I will ne'er revoke,
13. But keep my grace in mind
14. And what eternal love hath spoke
15. Eternal truth shall bind.

16. "Once have I sworn (I need no more)
17. And pledged my holiness,
18. To seal the sacred promise sure
19. To David and his race.

20. "The sun shall see his offspring rise
21. And spread from sea to sea,
22. Long as he travels round the skies
23. To give the nations day.

24. "Sure as the moon that rules the night
25. His kingdom shall endure,
26. Till the fixed laws of shade and light
27. Shall be observed no more.
