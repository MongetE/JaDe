1. A penitent pleading for pardon.

2. Show pity, Lord, O Lord, forgive,
3. Let a repenting rebel live:
4. Are not thy mercies large and free?
5. May not a sinner trust in thee?

6. My crimes are great, but not surpass
7. The power and glory of thy grace:
8. Great God, thy nature hath no bound,
9. So let thy pard'ning love be found.

10. O wash my soul from every sin,
11. And make my guilty conscience clean;
12. Here on my heart the burden lies,
13. And past offences pain my eyes.

14. My lips with shame my sins confess
15. Against thy law, against thy grace:
16. Lord, should thy judgment grow severe,
17. I am condemned, but thou art clear.

18. Should sudden vengeance seize my breath,
19. I must pronounce thee just in death;
20. And if my soul were sent to hell,
21. Thy righteous law approves it well.

22. Yet save a trembling sinner, Lord,
23. Whose hope, still hov'ring round thy word,
24. Would light on some sweet promise there,
25. Some sure support against despair.
