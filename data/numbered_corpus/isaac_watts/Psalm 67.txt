1. The nation's prosperity, and the church's increase.

2. Shine, mighty God, on Britain shine,
3. With beams of heav'nly grace;
4. Reveal thy power through all our coasts,
5. And show thy smiling face.

6. [Amidst our isle, exalted high,
7. Do thou our glory stand,
8. And, like a wall of guardian fire,
9. Surround the fav'rite land.]

10. When shall thy name, from shore to shore,
11. Sound all the earth abroad;
12. And distant nations know and love
13. Their Savior and their God?

14. Sing to the Lord, ye distant lands,
15. Sing loud with solemn voice;
16. While British tongues exalt his praise,
17. And British hearts rejoice.

18. He, the great Lord, the sovereign Judge,
19. That sits enthroned above,
20. Wisely commands the worlds he made
21. In justice and in love.

22. Earth shall obey her Maker's will,
23. And yield a full increase;
24. Our God will crown his chosen isle
25. With fruitfulness and peace.

26. God the Redeemer scatters round
27. His choicest favors here,
28. While the creation's utmost bound
29. Shall see, adore, and fear.
