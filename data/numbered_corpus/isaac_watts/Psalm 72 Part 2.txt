1. Christ's kingdom among the Gentiles.

2. Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
3. Does his successive journeys run;
4. His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
5. Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

6. [Behold the islands with their kings,
7. And Europe her best tribute brings;
8. From north to south the princes meet,
9. To pay their homage at his feet.

10. There Persia, glorious to behold,
11. There India shines in eastern gold;
12. And barb'rous nations at his word
13. Submit, and bow, and own their Lord.]

14. For him shall endless prayer be made,
15. And praises throng to crown his head;
16. His name like sweet perfume shall rise
17. With every morning sacrifice.

18. People and realms of every tongue
19. Dwell on his love with sweetest song;
20. And infant voices shall proclaim
21. Their early blessings on his name.

22. Blessings abound where'er he reigns,
23. The pris'ner leaps to lose his chains;
24. The weary find eternal rest,
25. And all the sons of want are blest.

26. [Where he displays his healing power
27. Death and the curse are known no more;
28. In him the tribes of Adam boast
29. More blessings than their father lost.

30. Let every creature rise and bring
31. Peculiar honors to our King;
32. Angels descend with songs again,
33. And earth repeat the long Amen.]
