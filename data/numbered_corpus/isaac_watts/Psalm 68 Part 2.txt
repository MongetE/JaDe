3. Christ's ascension, and the gift of the Spirit.

5. Ten thousand angels filled the sky;

7. Like chariots that attend thy state.

8. Not Sinai's mountain could appear
9. More glorious when the Lord was there;
10. While he pronounced his dreadful law,
11. And struck the chosen tribes with awe.

13. When the rebellious powers of hell,
14. That thousand souls had captive made,
15. Were all in chains like captives led.

17. He sent the promised Spirit down
18. With gifts and grace for rebel men,
19. That God might dwell on earth again.
