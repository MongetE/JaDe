1. Complaint of heavy afflictions in mind and body.

2. My righteous Judge, my gracious God,
3. Hear when I spread my hands abroad,
4. And cry for succor from thy throne;
5. O make thy truth and mercy known!

6. Let judgment not against me pass;
7. Behold, thy servant pleads thy grace:
8. Should justice call us to thy bar,
9. No man alive is guiltless there.

10. Look down in pity, Lord, and see
11. The mighty woes that burden me;
12. Down to the dust my life is brought,
13. Like one long buried and forgot.

14. I dwell in darkness and unseen,
15. My heart is desolate within
16. My thoughts in musing silence trace
17. The ancient wonders of thy grace.

18. Thence I derive a glimpse of hope
19. To bear my sinking spirits up;
20. I stretch my hands to God again,
21. And thirst like parched lands for rain

22. For thee I thirst, I pray, I mourn:
23. When will thy smiling face return?
24. Shall all my joys on earth remove?
25. And God for ever hide his love?

26. My God, thy long delay to save
27. Will sink thy pris'ner to the grave;
28. My heart grows faint, and dim mine eye;
29. Make haste to help before I die.

30. The night is witness to my tears,
31. Distressing pains, distressing fears;
32. O might I hear thy morning voice,
33. How would my wearied powers rejoice!

34. In thee I trust, to thee I sigh,
35. And lift my heavy soul on high;
36. For thee sit waiting all the day,
37. And wear the tiresome hours away.

38. Break off my fetters, Lord, and show
39. Which is the path my feet should go;
40. If snares and foes beset the road,
41. I flee to hide me near my God.

42. Teach me to do thy holy will,
43. And lead me to thy heav'nly hill;
44. Let the good Spirit of thy love
45. Conduct me to thy courts above.

46. Then shall my soul no more complain,
47. The tempter then shall rage in vain;
48. And flesh, that was my foe before,
49. Shall never vex my spirit more.
