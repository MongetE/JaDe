1. v.1-6
2. C. M.
3. The last judgment

4. The Lord, the Judge, before his throne
5. Bids the whole earth draw nigh,
6. The nations near the rising sun,
7. And near the western sky.

8. No more shall bold blasphemers say,
9. "Judgment will ne'er begin;"
10. No more abuse his long delay
11. To impudence and sin.

12. Throned on a cloud our God shall come,
13. Bright flames prepare his way;
14. Thunder and darkness, fire and storm,
15. Lead on the dreadful day.

16. Heav'n from above his call shall hear,
17. Attending angels come,
18. And earth and hell shall know and fear
19. His justice and their doom.

20. "But gather all my saints," he cries,
21. "That made their peace with God
22. By the Redeemer's sacrifice,
23. And sealed it with his blood.

24. "Their faith and works, brought forth to light
25. Shall make the world confess,
26. My sentence of reward is right,
27. And heav'n adore my grace."
