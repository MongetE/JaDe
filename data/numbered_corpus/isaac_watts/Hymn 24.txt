1. The rich sinner dying.

2. Psa. 49:6,9; Eccl. 8:8; Job 3:14,15.

3. In vain the wealthy mortals toil,
4. And heap their shining dust in vain,
5. Look down and scorn the humble poor,
6. And boast their lofty hills of gain.

7. Their golden cordials cannot ease
8. Their pained hearts or aching heads,
9. Nor fright nor bribe approaching death
10. From glitt'ring roofs and downy beds.

11. The ling'ring, the unwilling soul
12. The dismal summons must obey,
13. And bid a long, a sad farewell
14. To the pale lump of lifeless clay.

15. Thence they are huddled to the grave,
16. Where kings and slaves have equal thrones;
17. Their bones without distinction lie
18. Amongst the heap of meaner bones.
