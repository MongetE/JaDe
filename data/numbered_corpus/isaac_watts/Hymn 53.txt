1. The Holy Scriptures.

2. Heb. 1:1,2; 2 Tim. 3:15,16; Psa. 147:19,20.

3. God, who in various methods told
4. His mind and will to saints of old,
5. Sent down his Son, with truth and grace,
6. To teach us in these latter days.

7. Our nation reads the written word,
8. That book of life, that sure record:
9. The bright inheritance of heav'n
10. Is by the sweet conveyance giv'n.

11. God's kindest thoughts are here expressed,
12. Able to make us wise and bless'd;
13. The doctrines are divinely true,
14. Fit for reproof and comfort too.

15. Ye British isles, who read his love
16. In long epistles from above,
17. (He hath not sent his sacred word
18. To every land,) praise ye the Lord.
