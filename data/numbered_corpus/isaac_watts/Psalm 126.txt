1. Surprising deliverance.

2. When God restored our captive state,
3. Joy was our song, and grace our theme;
4. The grace beyond our hopes so great
5. That joy appeared a painted dream.

6. The scoffer owns thy hand, and pays
7. Unwilling honors to thy name;
8. While we with pleasure shout thy praise,
9. With cheerful notes thy love proclaim.

10. When we review our dismal fears,
11. 'Twas hard to think they'd vanish so;
12. With God we left our flowing tears,
13. He makes our joys like rivers flow.

14. The man that in his furrowed field
15. His scattered seed with sadness leaves,
16. Will shout to see the harvest yield
17. A welcome load of joyful sheaves.
