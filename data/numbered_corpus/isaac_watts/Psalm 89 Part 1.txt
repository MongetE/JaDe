1. The faithfulness of God.

2. My never-ceasing songs shall show
3. The mercies of the Lord;
4. And make succeeding ages know
5. How faithful is his word.

6. The sacred truths his lips pronounce
7. Shall firm as heav'n endure;
8. And if he speak a promise once,
9. Th' eternal grace is sure.

10. How long the race of David held
11. The promised Jewish throne!
12. But there's a nobler cov'nant sealed
13. To David's greater Son.

14. His seed for ever shall possess
15. A throne above the skies;
16. The meanest subject of his grace
17. Shall to that glory rise.

18. Lord God of hosts, thy wondrous ways
19. Are sung by saints above;
20. And saints on earth their honors raise
21. To thy unchanging love.
