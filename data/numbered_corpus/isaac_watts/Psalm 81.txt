4. Sing to the Lord aloud,
5. And make a joyful noise;
6. God is our strength, our Savior God;
7. Let Isr'el hear his voice.

8. "From vile idolatry
9. Preserve my worship clean;
10. I am the Lord, who set thee free
11. From slavery and sin.

12. "Stretch thy desires abroad,
13. And I'll supply them well:
14. But if ye will refuse your God,
15. If Isr'el will rebel;

16. "I'll leave them," saith the Lord,
17. "To their own lusts a prey,
18. And let them run the dang'rous road,
19. 'Tis their own chosen way.

20. "Yet, O! that all my saints
21. Would hearken to my voice!
22. Soon I would ease their sore complaints,
23. And bid their hearts rejoice.

24. "While I destroy their foes,
25. I'd richly feed my flock;
26. And they should taste the stream that flows
27. From their eternal rock."
