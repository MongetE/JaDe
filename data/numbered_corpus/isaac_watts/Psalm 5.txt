1. For the Lord's Day Morning.

2. Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear
3. My voice ascending high;
4. To thee will I direct my prayer,
5. To thee lift up mine eye;

6. Up to the hills where Christ is gone
7. To plead for all his saints,
8. Presenting at his Father's throne
9. Our songs and our complaints.

10. Thou art a God, before whose sight
11. The wicked shall not stand;
12. Sinners shall ne'er be thy delight,
13. Nor dwell at thy right hand.

14. But to thy house will I resort,
15. To taste thy mercies there;
16. I will frequent thine holy court,
17. And worship in thy fear.

18. O may thy Spirit guide my feet
19. In ways of righteousness!
20. Make every path of duty straight,
21. And plain before my face.

22. PAUSE.

23. My watchful enemies combine
24. To tempt my feet astray;
25. They flatter, with a base design
26. To make my soul their prey.

27. Lord, crush the serpent in the dust,
28. And all his plots destroy;
29. While those that in thy mercy trust,
30. For ever shout for joy.

31. The men that love and fear thy name
32. Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
33. The mighty God will compass them
34. With favor as a shield.
