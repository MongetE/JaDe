1. Christ exalted, and multitudes converted; or, The success of the gospel.

2. Thus the eternal Father spake
3. To Christ the Son: "Ascend and sit
4. At my right hand, till I shall make
5. Thy foes submissive at thy feet.

6. "From Zion shall thy word proceed;
7. Thy word, the sceptre in thy hand,
8. Shall make the hearts of rebels bleed,
9. And bow their wills to thy command.

10. "That day shall show thy power is great,
11. When saints shall flock with willing minds,
12. And sinners crowd thy temple gate,
13. Where holiness in beauty shines."

14. O blessed power! O glorious day!
15. What a large vict'ry shall ensue!
16. And converts, who thy grace obey,
17. Exceed the drops of morning dew.
