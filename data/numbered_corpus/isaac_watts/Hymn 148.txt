1. The names and titles of Christ. From several scriptures.

2. With cheerful voice I sing
3. The titles of my Lord,
4. And borrow all the names
5. Of honor from his word:
6. Nature and art can ne'er supply
7. Sufficient forms of majesty.

8. In Jesus we behold
9. His Father's glorious face,
10. Shining for ever bright,
11. With mild and lovely rays
12. Th' eternal God's eternal Son
13. Inherits and partakes the throne.]

14. The sovereign King of kings,
15. The Lord of lords most high,
16. Writes his own name upon
17. His garment and his thigh:
18. His name is called The Word of God;
19. He rules the earth with iron rod.

20. Where promises and grace
21. Can neither melt nor move,
22. The angry Lamb resents
23. The injuries of his love;
24. Awakes his wrath without delay,
25. As lions roar, and tear the prey.

26. But when for works of peace
27. The great Redeemer comes,
28. What gentle characters,
29. What titles he assumes!
30. Light of the world, and Life of men;
31. Nor will he bear those names in vain.

32. Immense compassion reigns
33. In our Immanuel's heart,
34. When he descends to act
35. A Mediator's part:
36. He is a Friend and Brother too;
37. Divinely kind, divinely true.

38. At length the Lord the Judge
39. His awful throne ascends,
40. And drives the rebels far
41. From favorites and friends:
42. Then shall the saints completely prove
43. The heights and depths of all his love.
