1. The distemper, folly, and madness of sin

2. Sin, like a venomous disease,
3. Infects our vital blood;
4. The only balm is sovereign grace,
5. And the physician, God.

6. Our beauty and our strength are fled,
7. And we draw near to death;
8. But Christ the Lord recalls the dead
9. With his almighty breath.

10. Madness by nature reigns within,
11. The passions burn and rage,
12. Till God's own Son, with skill divine,
13. The inward fire assuage.

14. [We lick the dust, we grasp the wind,
15. And solid good despise;
16. Such is the folly of the mind,
17. Till Jesus makes us wise.

18. We give our souls the wounds they feel,
19. We drink the pois'nous gall,
20. And rush with fury down to hell;
21. But Heav'n prevents the fall.]

22. [The man possessed among the tombs
23. Cuts his own flesh, and cries;
24. He foams and raves, till Jesus comes,
25. And the foul spirit flies.]
