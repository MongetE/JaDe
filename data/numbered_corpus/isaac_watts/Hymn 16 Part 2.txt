1. The enjoyment of Christ; or, Delight in ordinances.

2. Lord, what a heav'n of saving grace
3. Shines through the beauties of thy face,
4. And lights our passions to a flame!
5. Lord, how we love thy charming name!

6. When I can say, "My God is mine,"
7. When I can feel thy glories shine,
8. I tread the world beneath my feet,
9. And all that earth calls good or great.

10. While such a scene of sacred joys
11. Our raptured eyes and souls employs,
12. Here we could sit, and gaze away
13. A long, an everlasting day.

14. Well, we shall quickly pass the night
15. To the fair coasts of perfect light;
16. Then shall our joyful senses rove
17. O'er the dear object of our love.

18. [There shall we drink full draughts of bliss,
19. And pluck new life from heav'nly trees:
20. Yet now and then, dear Lord, bestow
21. A drop of heav'n on worms below.

22. Send comforts down from thy right hand,
23. While we pass through this barren land,
24. And in thy temple let us see
25. A glimpse of love, a glimpse of thee.]
