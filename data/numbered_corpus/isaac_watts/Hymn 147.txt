1. The names and titles of Christ. From several scriptures.

2. ['Tis from the treasures of his word
3. I borrow titles for my Lord;
4. Nor art nor nature can supply
5. Sufficient forms of majesty.

6. Bright image of the Father's face,
7. Shining with undiminished rays;
8. Th' eternal God's eternal Son,
9. The heir and partner of his throne.]

10. The King of kings, the Lord most high,
11. Writes his own name upon his thigh
12. He wears a garment dipped in blood,
13. And breaks the nations with his rod.

14. Where grace can neither melt nor move,
15. The Lamb resents his injured love;
16. Awakes his wrath without delay,
17. And Judah's Lion tears the prey.

18. But when for works of peace he comes,
19. What winning titles he assumes!
20. Light of the world, and Life of men;
21. Nor bears those characters in vain.

22. With tender pity in his heart,
23. He acts the Mediator's part;
24. A Friend and Brother he appears,
25. And well fulfils the names he wears.

26. At length the Judge his throne ascends,
27. Divides the rebels from his friends,
28. And saints in full fruition prove
29. His rich variety of love.
