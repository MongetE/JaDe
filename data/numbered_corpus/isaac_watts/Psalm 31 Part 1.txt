3. Deliverance from death.

4. Unto thine hand, O God of truth,
5. My spirit I commit;
6. Thou hast redeemed my soul from death,
7. And saved me from the pit.

8. The passions of my hope and fear
9. Maintained a doubtful strife,
10. While sorrow, pain, and sin conspired
11. To take away my life.

12. "My times are in thine hand," I cried,
13. "Though I draw near the dust;
14. Thou art the refuge where I hide,
15. The God in whom I trust.

16. O make thy reconciled face
17. Upon thy servant shine,
18. And save me for thy mercy's sake,
19. For I'm entirely thine.

20. PAUSE.

21. ['Twas in my haste my spirit said,
22. "I must despair and die,
23. I am cut off before thine eyes;
24. But thou hast heard my cry.]

25. Thy goodness how divinely free!
26. How wondrous is thy grace
27. To those that fear thy majesty,
28. And trust thy promises!

29. O love the Lord, all ye his saints,
30. And sing his praises loud;
31. He'll bend his ear to your complaints,
32. And recompense the proud.
