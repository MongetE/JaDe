1. Repentance and free pardon.

2. Blest is the man, for ever blest,
3. Whose guilt is pardoned by his God;
4. Whose sins with sorrow are confessed,
5. And covered with his Savior's blood.

6. Blest is the man to whom the Lord
7. Imputes not his iniquities;
8. He pleads no merit of reward,
9. And not on works, but grace relies.

10. From guile his heart and lips are free;
11. His humble joy, his holy fear,
12. With deep repentance well agree,
13. And join to prove his faith sincere.

14. How glorious is that righteousness
15. That hides and cancels all his sins,
16. While a bright evidence of grace
17. Through his whole life appears and shine!
