1. The kingdom of Christ.

2. Great God, whose universal sway
3. The known and unknown worlds obey,
4. Now give the kingdom to thy Son,
5. Extend his power, exalt his throne.

6. Thy sceptre well becomes his hands,
7. All heav'n submits to his commands;
8. His justice shall avenge the poor,
9. And pride and rage prevail no more.

10. With power be vindicates the just,
11. And treads th' oppressor in the dust;
12. His worship and his fear shall last,
13. Till hours, and years, and time be past.

14. As rain on meadows newly mown,
15. So shall he send his influence down;
16. His grace on fainting souls distils,
17. Like heav'nly dew on thirsty hills.

18. The heathen lands that lie beneath
19. The shades of overspreading death,
20. Revive at his first dawning light,
21. And deserts blossom at the sight.

22. The saints shall flourish in his days,
23. Dressed in the robes of joy and praise
24. Peace, like a river from his throne,
25. Shall flow to nations yet unknown.
