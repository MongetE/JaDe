4. Just are thy ways, and true thy word,
5. Great Rock of my secure abode:
6. Who is a God beside the Lord?
7. Or where's a refuge like our God?

8. 'Tis he that girds me with his might,
9. Gives me his holy sword to wield,
10. And while with sin and hell I fight,
11. Spreads his salvation for my shield.

12. He lives, and blessed be my Rock!
13. The God of my salvation lives:
14. The dark designs of hell are broke;
15. Sweet is the peace my Father gives.

16. Before the scoffers of the age
17. I will exalt my Father's name,
18. Nor tremble at their mighty rage,
19. But meet reproach, and bear the shame.

21. Thy grace for ever shall extend;
22. Thy love to saints in Christ their Head
23. Knows not a limit, nor an end.
