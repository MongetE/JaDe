1. v.12ff
2. L. M.
3. The church is the garden of God.

4. Lord, 'tis a pleasant thing to stand
5. In gardens planted by thine hand;
6. Let me within thy courts be seen,
7. Like a young cedar, fresh and green.

8. There grow thy saints in faith and love,
9. Blest with thine influence from above;
10. Not Lebanon with all its trees
11. Yields such a comely sight as these.

12. The plants of grace shall ever live;
13. (Nature decays, but grace must thrive
14. Time, that doth all things else impair,
15. Still makes them flourish strong and fair.

16. Laden with fruits of age, they show
17. The Lord is holy, just, and true;
18. None that attend his gates shall find
19. A God unfaithful or unkind.
