1. Characters of a saint.

2. Who shall inhabit in thy hill,
3. O God of holiness?
4. Whom will the Lord admit to dwell
5. So near his throne of grace?

6. The man that walks in pious ways,
7. And works with righteous hands;
8. That trusts his Maker's promises,
9. And follows his commands.

10. He speaks the meaning of his heart,
11. Nor slanders with his tongue;
12. Will scarce believe an ill report,
13. Nor do his neighbor wrong.

14. The wealthy sinner he contemns,
15. Loves all that fear the Lord;
16. And though to his own hurt he swears,
17. Still he performs his word.

18. His hands disdain a golden bribe,
19. And never gripe the poor:
20. This man shall dwell with God on earth,
21. And find his heav'n secure.
