1. v.9-
2. C. M.
3. Sick-bed devotion.

4. God of my life, look gently down,
5. Behold the pains I feel;
6. But I am dumb before thy throne,
7. Nor dare dispute thy will.

8. Diseases are thy servants, Lord,
9. They come at thy command;
10. I'll not attempt a murm'ring word
11. Against thy chast'ning hand.

12. Yet I may plead with humble cries,
13. Remove thy sharp rebukes;
14. My strength consumes, my spirit dies,
15. Through thy repeated strokes.

16. Crushed as a moth beneath thy hand,
17. We moulder to the dust;
18. Our feeble powers can ne'er withstand,
19. And all our beauty's lost.

20. [This mortal life decays apace,
21. How soon the bubble's broke!
22. Adam and all his num'rous race
23. Are vanity and smoke.]

24. I'm but a sojourner below,
25. As all my fathers were;
26. May I be well prepared to go,
27. When I the summons hear.

28. But if my life be spared awhile,
29. Before my last remove,
30. Thy praise shall be my business still,
31. And I'll declare thy love.
