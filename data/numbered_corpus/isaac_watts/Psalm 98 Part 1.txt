1. Praise for the gospel.

2. To our Almighty Maker, God,
3. New honors be addressed;
4. His great salvation shines abroad,
5. And makes the nations blest.

6. He spake the word to Abraham first;
7. His truth fulfils the grace;
8. The Gentiles make his name their trust,
9. And learn his righteousness.

10. Let the whole earth his love proclaim
11. With all her diff'rent tongues,
12. And spread the honors of his name
13. In melody and songs.
