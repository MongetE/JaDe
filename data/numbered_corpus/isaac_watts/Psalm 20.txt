1. Prayer and hope of victory.
2. For a day of prayer in time of war.

3. Now may the God of power and grace
4. Attend his people's humble cry!
5. Jehovah hears when Isr'el prays,
6. And brings deliverance from on high.

7. The name of Jacob's God defends
8. Better than shields or brazen walls;
9. He from his sanctuary sends
10. Succor and strength, when Zion calls.

11. Well he remembers all our sighs,
12. His love exceeds our best deserts;
13. His love accepts the sacrifice
14. Of humble groans and broken hearts.

15. In his salvation is our hope,
16. And, in the name of Isr'el's God,
17. Our troops shall lift their banners up,
18. Our navies spread their flags abroad.

19. Some trust in horses trained for war,
20. And some of chariots make their boasts:
21. Our surest expectations are
22. From thee, the Lord of heav'nly hosts.

23. [O may the memory of thy name
24. Inspire our armies for the fight!
25. Our foes shall fall and die with shame,
26. Or quit the field with shameful flight.]

27. Now save us, Lord, from slavish fear,
28. Now let our hopes be firm and strong,
29. Till the salvation shall appear,
30. And joy and triumph raise the song.
