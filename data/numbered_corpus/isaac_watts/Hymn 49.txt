1. The works of Moses and the Lamb.

2. Rev. 15:3.

3. How strong thine arm is, mighty God!
4. Who would not fear thy name?
5. Jesus, how sweet thy graces are!
6. Who would not love the Lamb?

7. He has done more than Moses did,
8. Our Prophet and our King;
9. From bonds of hell he freed our souls,
10. And taught our lips to sing.

11. In the Red Sea, by Moses' hand,
12. Th' Egyptian host was drowned;
13. But his own blood hides all our sins,
14. And guilt no more is found.

15. When through the desert Isr'el went,
16. With manna they were fed:
17. Our Lord invites us to his flesh,
18. And calls it living bread.

19. Moses beheld the promised land,
20. Yet never reached the place;
21. But Christ shall bring his followers home,
22. To see his Father's face.

23. Then shall our love and joy be full,
24. And feel a warmer flame;
25. And sweeter voices tune the song
26. Of Moses and the Lamb.
