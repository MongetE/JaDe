1. The Christian's hidden life.

2. Col. 3:3.

3. O happy soul that lives on high
4. While men lie grov'lling here
5. His hopes are fixed above the sky,
6. And faith forbids his fear.

7. His conscience knows no secret stings,
8. While peace and joy combine
9. To form a life whose holy springs
10. Are hidden and divine.

11. He waits in secret on his God,
12. His God in secret sees;
13. Let earth be all in arms abroad,
14. He dwells in heav'nly peace.

15. His pleasures rise from things unseen,
16. Beyond this world and time;
17. Where neither eyes nor ears have been,
18. Nor thoughts of sinners climb.

19. He wants no pomp nor royal throne
20. To raise his figure here;
21. Content and pleased to live unknown,
22. Till Christ, his life, appear.

23. He looks to heav'n's eternal hill
24. To meet that glorious day;
25. But patient waits his Savior's will
26. To fetch his soul away.
