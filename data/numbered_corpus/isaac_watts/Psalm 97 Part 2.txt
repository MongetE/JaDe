3. Christ's incarnation.

4. The Lord is come; the heav'ns proclaim
5. His birth; the nations learn his name;
6. An unknown star directs the road
7. Of eastern sages to their God.

8. All ye bright armies of the skies,
9. Go, worship where the Savior lies;
10. Angels and kings before him bow,
11. Those gods on high and gods below.

13. And their own worshippers confound
14. But Judah shout, but Zion sing,
15. And earth confess her sovereign King.
