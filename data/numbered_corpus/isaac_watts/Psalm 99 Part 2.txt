1. A holy God worshiped with reverence.

2. Exalt the Lord our God,
3. And worship at his feet;
4. His nature is all holiness,
5. And mercy is his seat.

6. When Isr'el was his church,
7. When Aaron was his priest,
8. When Moses cried, when Samuel prayed,
9. He gave his people rest.

10. Oft he forgave their sins,
11. Nor would destroy their race;
12. And oft he made his vengeance known,
13. When they abused his grace.

14. Exalt the Lord our God,
15. Whose grace is still the same;
16. Still he's a God of holiness,
17. And jealous for his name.
