1. Grace and glory.

2. Th'  Almighty reigns exalted high
3. O'er all the earth, o'er all the sky;
4. Though clouds and darkness veil his feet,
5. His dwelling is the mercy-seat.

6. O ye that love his holy name,
7. Hate every work of sin and shame;
8. He guards the souls of all his friends,
9. And from the snares of hell defends.

10. Immortal light and joys unknown
11. Are for the saints in darkness sown
12. Those glorious seeds shall spring and rise,
13. And the bright harvest bless our eyes.

14. Rejoice, ye righteous, and record
15. The sacred honors of the Lord:
16. None but the soul that feels his grace
17. Can triumph in his holiness.
