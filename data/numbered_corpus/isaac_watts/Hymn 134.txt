1. Religion vain without love.

2. 1 Cor. 13:1-3.

3. Had I the tongues of Greeks and Jews,
4. And nobler speech, that angels use,
5. If love be absent, I am found,
6. Like tinkling brass, an empty sound.

7. Were I inspired to preach and tell
8. All that is done in heav'n and hell;
9. Or could my faith the world remove,
10. Still I am nothing without love.

11. Should I distribute all my store
12. To feed the bowels of the poor,
13. Or give my body to the flame,
14. To gain a martyr's glorious name;

15. If love to God and love to men
16. Be absent, all my hopes are vain;
17. Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal,
18. The work of love can e'er fulfil.
