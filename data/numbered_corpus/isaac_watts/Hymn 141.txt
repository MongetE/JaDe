1. The Humiliation and exaltation of Christ.

2. Isa. 53:1-5,10-12.

3. Who has believed thy word,
4. Or thy salvation known?
5. Reveal thine arm, Almighty Lord,
6. And glorify thy Son.

7. The Jews esteemed him here
8. Too mean for their belief;
9. Sorrows his chief acquaintance were,
10. And his companion, grief.

11. They turned their eyes away,
12. And treated him with scorn;
13. But 'twas their grief upon him lay,
14. Their sorrows he has borne.

15. 'Twas for the stubborn Jews,
16. And Gentiles then unknown,
17. The God of justice pleased to bruise
18. His best-beloved Son.

19. "But I'll prolong his days,
20. And make his kingdom stand;
21. My pleasure," saith the God of grace,
22. "Shall prosper in his hand."

23. ["His joyful soul shall see
24. The purchase of his pain
25. And by his knowledge justify
26. The guilty sons of men.]

27. ["Ten thousand captive slaves,
28. Released from death and sin,
29. Shall quit their prisons and their graves
30. And own his power divine.]

31. ["Heav'n shall advance my Son
32. To joys that earth denied;
33. Who saw the follies men had done,
34. And bore their sins, and died."]
