1. Christ's all-sufficiency.

2. How fast their guilt and sorrows rise
3. Who haste to seek some idol-god!
4. I will not taste their sacrifice,
5. Their offerings of forbidden blood.

6. My God provides a richer cup,
7. And nobler food to live upon;
8. He for my life has offered up
9. Jesus, his best-beloved Son.

10. His love is my perpetual feast;
11. By day his counsels guide me right;
12. And be his name for ever blessed,
13. Who gives me sweet advice by night.

14. I set him still before mine eyes;
15. At my right hand he stands prepared
16. To keep my soul from all surprise,
17. And be my everlasting guard.
