1. Daily and nightly devotion.

2. Ye that obey th' immortal King,
3. Attend his holy place;
4. Bow to the glories of his power,
5. And bless his wondrous grace.

6. Lift up your hands by morning light,
7. And send your souls on high;
8. Raise your admiring thoughts by night
9. Above the starry sky.

10. The God of Zion cheers our hearts
11. With rays of quick'ning grace;
12. The God that spread the heav'ns abroad,
13. And rules the swelling seas.
