1. Salvation by grace in Christ.

2. 2 Tim. 1:9,10.

3. Now to the power of God supreme
4. Be everlasting honors giv'n;
5. He saves from hell, (we bless his name,)
6. He calls our wand'ring feet to heav'n.

7. Not for our duties or deserts,
8. But of his own abounding grace,
9. He works salvation in our hearts,
10. And forms a people for his praise.

11. 'Twas his own purpose that begun
12. To rescue rebels doomed to die;
13. He gave us grace in Christ his Son
14. Before he spread the starry sky.

15. Jesus the Lord appears at last,
16. And makes his Father's counsels known;
17. Declares the great transactions past,
18. And brings immortal blessings down.

19. He dies, and in that dreadful night
20. Did all the powers of hell destroy;
21. Rising, he brought our heav'n to light,
22. And took possession of the joy.
