1. v.1-5
2. C. M.
3. Desertion and hope; or, Complaint of absence from public worship.

4. With earnest longings of the mind,
5. My God, to thee I look;
6. So pants the hunted hart to find
7. And taste the cooling brook.

8. When shall I see thy courts of grace,
9. And meet my God again?
10. So long an absence from thy face
11. My heart endures with pain.

12. Temptations vex my weary soul,
13. And tears are my repast;
14. The foe insults without control,
15. "And where's your God at last?"

16. 'Tis with a mournful pleasure now
17. I think on ancient days;
18. Then to thy house did numbers go,
19. And all our work was praise.

20. But why, my soul, sunk down so far
21. Beneath this heavy load?
22. Why do my thoughts indulge despair,
23. And sin against my God?

24. Hope in the Lord, whose mighty hand
25. Can all thy woes remove,
26. For I shall yet before him stand,
27. And sing restoring love.
