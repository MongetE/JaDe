1. v.1-5
2. L. M.
3. Public prayer and praise.

4. The praise of Zion waits for thee,
5. My God, and praise becomes thy house;
6. There shall thy saints thy glory see,
7. And there perform their public vows.

8. O thou whose mercy bends the skies
9. To save when humble sinners pray,
10. All lands to thee shall lift their eyes,
11. And islands of the northern sea.

12. Against my will my sins prevail,
13. But grace shall purge away their stain;
14. The blood of Christ will never fail
15. To wash my garments white again.

16. Blest is the man whom thou shalt choose,
17. And give him kind access to thee;
18. Give him a place within thy house,
19. To taste thy love divinely free.

20. PAUSE.

21. Let Babel fear when Zion prays;
22. Babel, prepare for long distress,
23. When Zion's God himself arrays
24. In terror and in righteousness.

25. With dreadful glory God fulfils
26. What his afflicted saints request;
27. And with almighty wrath reveals
28. His love, to give his churches rest.

29. Then shall the flocking nations run
30. To Zion's hill, and own their Lord;
31. The rising and the setting sun
32. Shall see the Savior's name adored.
