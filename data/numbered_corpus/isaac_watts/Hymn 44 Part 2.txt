1. The true improvement of life.

2. Ps. 90:12.

3. Ane is this life prolonged to me?
4. Are days and seasons giv'n?
5. O let me, then, prepare to be
6. A fitter heir of heav'n.

7. In vain these moments shall not pass,
8. These golden hours be gone:
9. Lord, I accept thine offered grace,
10. I bow before thy throne.

11. Now cleanse my soul from every sin
12. By my Redeemer's blood;
13. Now let my flesh and soul begin
14. The honors of my God.

15. Let me no more my soul beguile
16. With sin's deceitful toys;
17. Let cheerful hope, increasing still,
18. Approach to heav'nly joys.

19. My thankful lips shall loud proclaim
20. The wonders of thy praise,
21. And spread the savor of thy name
22. Where'er I spend my days.

23. On earth let my example shine,
24. And when I leave this state,
25. May heav'n receive this soul of mine
26. To bliss supremely great.
