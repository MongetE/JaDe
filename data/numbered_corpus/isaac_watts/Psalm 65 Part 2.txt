3. Divine providence in air, earth, and sea.

4. The God of our salvation hears
5. The groans of Zion mixed with tears;
6. Yet when he comes with kind designs,
7. Through all the way his terror shines.

8. On him the race of man depends,
9. Far as the earth's remotest ends,
10. Where the Creator's name is known
11. By nature's feeble light alone.

12. Sailors, that travel o'er the flood,
13. Address their frighted souls to God,
14. When tempests rage and billows roar
15. At dreadful distance from the shore.

16. He bids the noisy tempests cease;
17. He calms the raging crowd to peace,
18. When a tumultuous nation raves
19. Wild as the winds, and loud as waves.

21. He settles in a peaceful form;
22. Mountains, established by his hand,
23. Firm on their old foundations stand.

25. New comets blaze, and lightnings fly;
26. The heathen lands, with swift surprise,
27. From the bright horrors turn their eyes.

29. Smiles in the east, and leads the day;

33. The ev'ning and the morn rejoice
34. To see the earth made soft with showers,
35. Laden with fruit, and dressed in flowers.

36. 'Tis from his wat'ry stores on high
37. He gives the thirsty ground supply;
38. He walks upon the clouds, and thence
39. Doth his enriching drops dispense.

40. The desert grows a fruitful field,
41. Abundant food the valleys yield;
42. The valleys shout with cheerful voice,
43. And neighb'ring hills repeat their joys.

44. The pastures smile in green array;
45. There lambs and larger cattle play;
46. The larger cattle and the lamb
47. Each in his language speaks thy name.

48. Thy works pronounce thy power divine;
49. O'er every field thy glories shine;
50. Through every month thy gifts appear;
51. Great God, thy goodness crowns the year!
