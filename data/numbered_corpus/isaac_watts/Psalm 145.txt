1. The greatness of God.

2. My God, my King, thy various praise
3. Shall fill the remnant of my days;
4. Thy grace employ my humble tongue
5. Till death and glory raise the song.

6. The wings of every hour shall bear
7. Some thankful tribute to thine ear;
8. And every setting sun shall see
9. New works of duty done for thee.

10. Thy truth and justice I'll proclaim;
11. Thy bounty flows an endless stream;
12. Thy mercy swift, thine anger slow,
13. But dreadful to the stubborn foe.

14. Thy works with sovereign glory shine,
15. And speak thy majesty divine;
16. Let Britain round her shores proclaim
17. The sound and honor of thy name.

18. Let distant times and nations raise
19. The long succession of thy praise,
20. And unborn ages make my song
21. The joy and labor of their tongue.

22. But who can speak thy wondrous deeds?
23. Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds?
24. Vast and unsearchable thy ways,
25. Vast and immortal be thy praise!
