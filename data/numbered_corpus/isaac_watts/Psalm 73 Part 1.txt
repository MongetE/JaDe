1. Afflicted saints happy, and prosperous sinners cursed.

2. Now I'm convinced the Lord is kind
3. To men of heart sincere;
4. Yet once my foolish thoughts repined,
5. And bordered on despair.

6. I grieved to see the wicked thrive,
7. And spoke with angry breath,
8. "How pleasant and profane they live!
9. How peaceful is their death!

10. "With well-fed flesh and haughty eyes,
11. They lay their fears to sleep;
12. Against the heav'ns their slanders rise,
13. While saints in silence weep.

14. "In vain I lift my hands to pray,
15. And cleanse my heart in vain;
16. For I am chastened all the day,
17. The night renews my pain."

18. Yet while my tongue indulged complaints,
19. I felt my heart reprove,-
20. "Sure I shall thus offend thy saints,
21. And grieve the men I love."

22. But still I found my doubts too hard,
23. The conflict too severe,
24. Till I retired to search thy word,
25. And learn thy secrets there.

26. There, as in some prophetic glass,
27. I saw the sinner's feet
28. High mounted on a slipp'ry place,
29. Beside a fiery pit.

30. I heard the wretch profanely boast,
31. Till at thy frown he fell;
32. His honors in a dream were lost,
33. And he awakes in hell.

34. Lord, what an envious fool I was!
35. How like a thoughtless beast!
36. Thus to suspect thy promised grace,
37. And think the wicked blest.

38. Yet I was kept from full despair,
39. Upheld by power unknown;
40. That blessed hand that broke the snare
41. Shall guide me to thy throne.
