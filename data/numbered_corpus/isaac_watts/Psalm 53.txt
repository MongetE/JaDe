4. Are all the foes of Zion fools,
5. Who thus devour her saints?
6. Do they not know her Savior rules,
7. And pities her complaints?

9. For God's revenging arm
10. Scatters the bones of them that rise
11. To do his children harm.

12. In vain the sons of Satan boast
13. Of armies in array;
14. When God has first despised their host
15. They fall an easy prey.

16. O for a word from Zion's King,
17. Her captives to restore!
18. Jacob with all his tribes shall sing,
19. And Judah weep no more.
