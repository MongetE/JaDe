1. Flesh and spirit.

2. Rom. 8:1

3. What vain desires and passions vain
4. Attend this mortal clay!
5. Oft have they pierced my soul with pain,
6. And drawn my heart astray.

7. How have I wandered from my God!
8. And, following sin and shame,
9. In this vile world of flesh and blood
10. Defiled my nobler frame!

11. For ever blessed be thy grace
12. That formed my soul anew,
13. And made it of a heav'n-born race,
14. Thy glory to pursue.

15. My spirit holds perpetual war,
16. And wrestles and complains;
17. But views the happy moment near
18. That shall dissolve its chains.

19. Cheerful in death I close my eyes
20. To part with every lust;
21. And charge my flesh, whene'er it rise,
22. To leave them in the dust.

23. My purer spirit shall not fear
24. To put this body on;
25. Its tempting powers no more are there,
26. Its lusts and passions gone!
