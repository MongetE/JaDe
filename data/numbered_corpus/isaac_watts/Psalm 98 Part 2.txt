1. The Messiah's coming and kingdom.

2. Joy to the world! the Lord is come!
3. Let earth receive her King;
4. Let every heart prepare him room,
5. And heav'n and nature sing.

6. Joy to the earth! the Savior reigns!
7. Let men their songs employ,
8. While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,
9. Repeat the sounding joy.

10. No more let sins and sorrows grow,
11. Nor thorns infest the ground;
12. He comes to make his blessings flow
13. Far as the curse is found.

14. He rules the world with truth and grace,
15. And makes the nations prove
16. The glories of his righteousness,
17. And wonders of his love.
