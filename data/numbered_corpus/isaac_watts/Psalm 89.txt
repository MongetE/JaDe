1. The covenant made with Christ; or, The true David.

2. For ever shall my song record
3. The truth and mercy of the Lord;
4. Mercy and truth for ever stand,
5. Like heav'n, established by his hand.

6. Thus to his Son he sware, and said,
7. "With thee my cov'nant first is made;
8. In thee shall dying sinners live,
9. Glory and grace are thine to give.

10. "Be thou my Prophet, thou my Priest;
11. Thy children shall be ever blest;
12. Thou art my chosen King: thy throne
13. Shall stand eternal like my own.

14. "There's none of all my sons above
15. So much my image or my love;
16. Celestial powers thy subjects are:
17. Then what can earth to thee compare?

18. "David, my servant, whom I chose
19. To guard my flock, to crush my foes,
20. And raised him to the Jewish throne,
21. Was but a shadow of my Son."

22. Now let the church rejoice and sing
23. Jesus, her Savior and her King;
24. Angels his heav'nly wonders show,
25. And saints declare his works below.
