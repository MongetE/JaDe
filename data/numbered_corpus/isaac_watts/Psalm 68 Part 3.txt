1. v.19,9,20-
2. L. M.
3. Praise for temporal blessings; or, Common and special mercies.

4. We bless the Lord, the just, the good,
5. Who fills our hearts with joy and food:
6. Who pours his blessings from the skies,
7. And loads our days with rich supplies.

8. He sends the sun his circuit round,
9. To cheer the fruits, to warm the ground;
10. He bids the clouds with plenteous rain
11. Refresh the thirsty earth again.

12. 'Tis to his care we owe our breath,
13. And all our near escapes from death;
14. Safety and health to God belong;
15. He heals the weak, and guards the strong.

16. He makes the saint and sinner prove
17. The common blessings of his love;
18. But the wide diff'rence that remains,
19. Is endless joy, or endless pains.

20. The Lord, that bruised the serpent's head,
21. On all the serpent's seed shall tread;
22. The stubborn sinner's hope confound,
23. And smite him with a lasting wound.

24. But his right hand his saints shall raise
25. From the deep earth, or deeper seas,
26. And bring them to his courts above;
27. There shall they taste his special love.
