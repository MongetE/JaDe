1. The church the birth-place of the saints.

2. God in his earthly temple lays
3. Foundations for his heav'nly praise:
4. He likes the tents of Jacob well,
5. But still in Zion loves to dwell.

6. His mercy visits every house
7. That pay their night and morning vows;
8. But makes a more delightful stay
9. Where churches meet to praise and pray.

10. What glories were described of old!
11. What wonders are of Zion told!
12. Thou city of our God below,
13. Thy fame shall Tyre and Egypt know.

14. Egypt and Tyre, and Greek and Jew,
15. Shall there begin their lives anew;
16. Angels and men shall join to sing
17. The hill where living waters spring.

18. When God makes up his last account
19. Of natives in his holy mount,
20. 'Twill be an honor to appear
21. As one new-born or nourished there!
