1. Pleading with submission.

2. O thou whose grace and justice reign
3. Enthroned above the skies,
4. To thee our hearts would tell their pain,
5. To thee we lift our eyes.

6. As servants watch their master's hand,
7. And fear the angry stroke;
8. Or maids before their mistress stand,
9. And wait a peaceful look;

10. So for our sins we justly feel
11. Thy discipline, O God;
12. Yet wait the gracious moment still,
13. Till thou remove thy rod.

14. Those that in wealth and pleasure live,
15. Our daily groans deride,
16. And thy delays of mercy give
17. Fresh courage to their pride.

18. Our foes insult us, but our hope
19. In thy compassion lies;
20. This thought shall bear our spirits up,
21. That God will not despise.
