1. A living and a dead faith.  Collected from several scriptures.

2. Mistaken souls, that dream of heav'n,
3. And make their empty boast
4. Of inward joys, and sins forgiv'n,
5. While they are slaves to lust!

6. Vain are our fancies, airy flights,
7. If faith be cold and dead;
8. None but a living power unites
9. To Christ the living head.

10. 'Tis faith that changes all the heart;
11. 'Tis faith that works by love;
12. That bids all sinful joys depart,
13. And lifts the thoughts above.

14. 'Tis faith that conquers earth and hell
15. By a celestial power;
16. This is the grace that shall prevail
17. In the decisive hour.

18. [Faith must obey her Father's will,
19. As well as trust his grace;
20. A pard'ning God is jealous still
21. For his own holiness.]

22. When from the curse he sets us free,
23. He makes our natures clean;
24. Nor would he send his Son to be
25. The minister of sin.

26. [His Spirit purifies our frame,
27. And seals our peace with God;
28. Jesus and his salvation came
29. By water and by blood.]
