1. Divine protection.

2. Up to the hills I lift mine eyes,
3. Th' eternal hills beyond the skies;
4. Thence all her help my soul derives;
5. There my Almighty refuge lives.

6. He lives; the everlasting God,
7. That built the world, that spread the flood;
8. The heav'ns with all their hosts he made,
9. And the dark regions of the dead.

10. He guides our feet, he guards our way;
11. His morning smiles bless all the day;
12. He spreads the evening veil, and keeps
13. The silent hours while Isr'el sleeps.

14. Isr'el, a name divinely blest,
15. May rise secure, securely rest;
16. Thy holy Guardian's wakeful eyes
17. Admit no slumber nor surprise.

18. No sun shall smite thy head by day,
19. Nor the pale moon with sickly ray
20. Shall blast thy couch; no baleful star
21. Dart his malignant fire so far.

22. Should earth and hell with malice burn,
23. Still thou shalt go, and still return,
24. Safe in the Lord; his heav'nly care
25. Defends thy life from every snare.

26. On thee foul spirits have no power;
27. And in thy last departing hour,
28. Angels that trace the airy road
29. Shall bear thee homeward to thy God.
