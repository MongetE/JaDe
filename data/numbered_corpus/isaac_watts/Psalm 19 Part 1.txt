1. The books of nature and scripture.
2. For a Lord's-day morning

3. Behold, the lofty sky
4. Declares its Maker God,
5. And all his starry works on high
6. Proclaim his power abroad.

7. The darkness and the light
8. Still keep their course the same;
9. While night to day, and day to night,
10. Divinely teach his name.

11. In every diff'rent land
12. Their general voice is known;
13. They show the wonders of his hand,
14. And orders of his throne.

15. Ye British lands, rejoice,
16. Here he reveals his word;
17. We are not left to nature's voice,
18. To bid us know the Lord.

19. His statutes and commands
20. Are set before our eyes;
21. He puts his gospel in our hands,
22. Where our salvation lies.

23. His laws are just and pure,
24. His truth without deceit,
25. His promises for ever sure,
26. And his rewards are great.

27. [Not honey to the taste
28. Affords so much delight,
29. Nor gold that has the furnace passed
30. So much allures the sight.

31. While of thy works I sing,
32. Thy glory to proclaim,
33. Accept the praise, my God, my King
34. In my Redeemer's name.]
