3. A blessed gospel.

4. Blest are the souls that hear and know
5. The gospel's joyful sound;
6. Peace shall attend the path they go,
7. And light their steps surround.

8. Their joy shall bear their spirits up
9. Through their Redeemer's name;
10. His righteousness exalts their hope,
11. Nor Satan dares condemn.

12. The Lord, our glory and defence,
13. Strength and salvation gives;
14. Isr'el, thy King for ever reigns,
15. Thy God for ever lives.
