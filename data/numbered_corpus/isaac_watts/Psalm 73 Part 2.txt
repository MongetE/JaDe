3. God our portion here and hereafter.

4. God, my supporter and my hope,
5. My help for ever near,
6. Thine arm of mercy held me up,
7. When sinking in despair.

8. Thy counsels, Lord, shall guide my feet
9. Through this dark wilderness;
10. Thine hand conduct me near thy seat,
11. To dwell before thy face.

12. Were I in heav'n without my God,
13. 'Twould be no joy to me;
14. And whilst this earth is my abode,
15. I long for none but thee.

16. What if the springs of life were broke,
17. And flesh and heart should faint?
18. God is my soul's eternal rock,
19. The strength of every saint.

20. Behold, the sinners that remove
21. Far from thy presence die;
22. Not all the idol gods they love
23. Can save them when they cry.

24. But to draw near to thee, my God,
25. Shall be my sweet employ;
26. My tongue shall sound thy works abroad,
27. And tell the world my joy.
