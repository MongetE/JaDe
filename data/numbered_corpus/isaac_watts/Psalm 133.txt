1. Brotherly love.

2. Lo! what an entertaining sight
3. Are brethren that agree!
4. Brethren, whose cheerful hearts unite
5. In bands of piety!

6. When streams of love from Christ the spring
7. Descend to every soul,
8. And heav'nly peace, with balmy wing,
9. Shades and bedews the whole;

10. 'Tis like the oil, divinely sweet,
11. On Aaron's reverend head
12. The trickling drops perfumed his feet,
13. And o'er his garments spread.

14. 'Tis pleasant as the morning dews
15. That fall on Zion's hill,
16. Where God his mildest glory shows,
17. And makes his grace distil.
