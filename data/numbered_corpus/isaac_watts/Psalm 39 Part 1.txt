1. v.1-3
2. C. M.
3. Watchfulness over the tongue.

4. Thus I resolved before the Lord,-
5. "Now will I watch my tongue;
6. Lest I let slip one sinful word,
7. Or do my neighbor wrong."

8. And if I'm e'er constrained to stay
9. With men of lives profane,
10. I'll set a double guard that day,
11. Nor let my talk be vain.

12. I'll scarce allow my lips to speak
13. The pious thoughts I feel,
14. Lest scoffers should th' occasion take
15. To mock my holy zeal.

16. Yet if some proper hour appear,
17. I'll not be overawed,
18. But let the scoffing sinners hear
19. That I can speak for God.
