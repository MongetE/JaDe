1. Christ the eternal life.

2. Rom. 9:5.

3. Jesus, our Savior and our God,
4. Arrayed in majesty and blood,
5. Thou art our life; our souls in thee
6. Possess a full felicity.

7. All our immortal hopes are laid
8. In thee, our surety and our head;
9. Thy cross, thy cradle, and thy throne,
10. Are big with glories yet unknown.

11. Let atheists scoff, and Jews blaspheme
12. Th' eternal life and Jesus' name;
13. A word of thy almighty breath
14. Dooms the rebellious world to death.

15. But let my soul for ever lie
16. Beneath the blessings of thine eye;
17. 'Tis heav'n on earth, 'tis heav'n above,
18. To see thy face and taste thy love.
