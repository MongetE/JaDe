1. The eternal and sovereign God.

2. Jehovah reigns; he dwells in light,
3. Girded with majesty and might:
4. The world, created by his hands,
5. Still on its first foundation stands.

6. But ere this spacious world was made,
7. Or had its first foundation laid,
8. Thy throne eternal ages stood,
9. Thyself the ever-living God.

10. Like floods, the angry nations rise,
11. And aim their rage against the skies;
12. Vain floods, that aim their rage so high!
13. At thy rebuke the billows die.

14. For ever shall thy throne endure;
15. Thy promise stands for ever sure;
16. And everlasting holiness
17. Becomes the dwellings of thy grace.
