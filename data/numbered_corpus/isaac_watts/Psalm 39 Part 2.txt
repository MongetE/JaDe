1. v.4-7
2. C. M.
3. The vanity of man as mortal.

4. Teach me the measure of my days,
5. Thou Maker of my frame;
6. I would survey life's narrow space,
7. And learn how frail I am.

8. A span is all that we can boast,
9. An inch or two of time;
10. Man is but vanity and dust
11. In all his flower and prime.

12. See the vain race of mortals move
13. Like shadows o'er the plain;
14. They rage and strive, desire and love,
15. But all the noise is vain.

16. Some walk in honor's gaudy show,
17. Some dig for golden ore;
18. They toil for heirs, they know not who,
19. And straight are seen no more.

20. What should I wish or wait for, then,
21. From creatures earth and dust?
22. They make our expectations vain,
23. And disappoint our trust.

24. Now I forbid my carnal hope,
25. My fond desires recall;
26. I give my mortal interest up,
27. And make my God my all.
