1. Christ's humiliation and exaltation.

2. Rev. 5:12.

3. What equal honors shall we bring
4. To thee, O Lord our God, the Lamb,
5. When all the notes that angels sing
6. Are far inferior to thy name?

7. Worthy is he that once was slain,
8. The Prince of Peace that groaned and died;
9. Worthy to rise, and live, and reign
10. At his Almighty Father's side.

11. Power and dominion are his due
12. Who stood condemned at Pilate's bar;
13. Wisdom belongs to Jesus too,
14. Though he was charged with madness here.

15. All riches are his native right,
16. Yet he sustained amazing loss;
17. To him ascribe eternal might,
18. Who left his weakness on the cross.

19. Honor immortal must be paid,
20. Instead of scandal and of scorn;
21. While glory shines around his head,
22. And a bright crown without a thorn.

23. Blessings for ever on the Lamb
24. Who bore the curse for wretched men;
25. Let angels sound his sacred name,
26. And every creature say, Amen.
