1. v.5-9
2. L. M.
3. The perfections and providence of God.

4. High in the heav'ns, eternal God,
5. Thy goodness in full glory shines
6. Thy truth shall break through every cloud
7. That veils and darkens thy designs.

8. For ever firm thy justice stands,
9. As mountains their foundations keep;
10. Wise are the wonders of thy hands;
11. Thy judgments are a mighty deep.

12. Thy providence is kind and large,
13. Both man and beast thy bounty share;
14. The whole creation is thy charge,
15. But saints are thy peculiar care.

16. My God! how excellent thy grace,
17. Whence all our hope and comfort springs!
18. The sons of Adam in distress
19. Fly to the shadow of thy wings.

20. From the provisions of thy house
21. We shall be fed with sweet repast;
22. There mercy like a river flows,
23. And brings salvation to our taste.

24. Life, like a fountain rich and free,
25. Springs from the presence of the Lord;
26. And in thy light our souls shall see
27. The glories promised in thy word.
