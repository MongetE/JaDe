3. Salvation by Christ.

4. Salvation is for ever nigh
5. The souls that fear and trust the Lord
6. And grace descending from on high
7. Fresh hopes of glory shall afford.

8. Mercy and truth on earth are met,
9. Since Christ the Lord came down from heav'n;
10. By his obedience so complete,
11. Justice is pleased, and peace is giv'n.

12. Now truth and honor shall abound,
13. Religion dwell on earth again,
14. And heav'nly influence bless the ground
15. In our Redeemer's gentle reign.

16. His righteousness is gone before
17. To give us free access to God;
18. Our wand'ring feet shall stray no more,
19. But mark his steps and keep the road.
