2. C. M.
3. A song of praise.

4. In God's own house pronounce his praise,
5. His grace he there reveals;
6. To heav'n your joy and wonder raise,
7. For there his glory dwells.

8. Let all your sacred passions move,
9. While you rehearse his deeds;
10. But the great work of saving love
11. Your highest praise exceeds.

12. All that have motion, life, and breath,
13. Proclaim your Maker blest;
14. Yet, when my voice expires in death,
15. My soul shall praise him best.
