1. God's wonders of creation, providence, redemption of Israel, and salvation of his people.

2. Give thanks to God the sovereign Lord;
3. His mercies still endure;
4. And be the King of kings adored;
5. His truth is ever sure.
6. What wonders hath his wisdom done!
7. How mighty is his hand!
8. Heav'n, earth, and sea, he framed alone;
9. How wide is his command

10. The sun supplies the day with light;
11. How bright his counsels shine!
12. The moon and stars adorn the night;
13. His works are all divine.

14. [He struck the sons of Egypt dead;
15. How dreadful is his rod!
16. And thence with joy his people led;
17. How gracious is our God!

18. He cleft the swelling sea in two;
19. His arm is great in might;
20. And gave the tribes a passage through;
21. His power and grace unite.

22. But Pharaoh's army there he drowned;
23. How glorious are his ways!
24. And brought his saints through desert ground;
25. Eternal be his praise!

26. Great monarchs fell beneath his hand;
27. Victorious is his sword;
28. While Isr'el took the promised land;
29. And faithful is his word.]

30. He saw the nations dead in sin;
31. He felt his pity move:
32. How sad the state the world was in!
33. How boundless was his love!

34. He sent to save us from our woe;
35. His goodness never fails;
36. From death, and hell, and every foe;
37. And still his grace prevails.

38. Give thanks to God the heav'nly King;
39. His mercies still endure:
40. Let the whole earth his praises sing;
41. His truth is ever sure.
