1. The man is ever bless'd
2. Who shuns the sinners' ways,
3. Among their councils never stands,
4. Nor takes the scorner's place;

5. But makes the law of God
6. His study and delight,
7. Amidst the labours of the day,
8. And watches of the night.

9. He like a tree shall thrive,
10. With waters near the root;
11. Fresh as the leaf his name shall live;
12. His works are heav'nly fruit.

13. Not so the ungoodly race,
14. They no such blessings find;
15. Their hopes shall flee, like empty chaff
16. Before the driving wind.

17. How will they bear to stand
18. Before that judgement-seat,
19. When all the saints, at Christ's right hand,
20. In full assembly meet.

21. He knows, and he approves,
22. The way the righteous go;
23. But sinners and their works shall meet
24. A dreadful overthrow.
