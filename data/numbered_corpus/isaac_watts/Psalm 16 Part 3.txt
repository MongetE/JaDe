1. Courage in death, and hope of the resurrection.

2. When God is nigh, my faith is strong;
3. His arm is my almighty prop:
4. Be glad, my heart; rejoice, my tongue;
5. My dying flesh shall rest in hope.

6. Though in the dust I lay my head,
7. Yet, gracious God, thou wilt not leave
8. My soul for ever with the dead,
9. Nor lose thy children in the grave.

10. My flesh shall thy first call obey,
11. Shake off the dust, and rise on high;
12. Then shalt thou lead the wondrous way
13. Up to thy throne above the sky.

14. There streams of endless pleasure flow;
15. And full discoveries of thy grace
16. (Which we but tasted here below)
17. Spread heav'nly joys through all the place.
