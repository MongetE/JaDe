1. Praise to God for his goodness and truth.

2. Praise ye the Lord, my heart shall join
3. In work so pleasant, so divine;
4. Now, while the flesh is mine abode,
5. And when my soul ascends to God.

6. Praise shall employ my noblest powers,
7. While immortality endures;
8. My days of praise shall ne'er be past,
9. While life, and thought, and being last.

10. Why should I make a man my trust?
11. Princes must die and turn to dust;
12. Their breath departs, their pomp, and power,
13. And thoughts, all vanish in an hour.

14. Happy the man whose hopes rely
15. On Isr'el's God; he made the sky,
16. And earth, and seas, with all their train,
17. And none shall find his promise vain.

18. His truth for ever stands secure;
19. He saves th' oppressed, he feeds the poor;
20. He sends the lab'ring conscience peace,
21. And grants the pris'ner sweet release.

22. The Lord hath eyes to give the blind;
23. The Lord supports the sinking mind;
24. He helps the stranger in distress,
25. The widow and the fatherless.

26. He loves his saints, he knows them well,
27. But turns the wicked down to hell:
28. Thy God, O Zion! ever reigns;
29. Praise him in everlasting strains.
