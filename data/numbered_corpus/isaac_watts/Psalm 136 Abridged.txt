1. God's wonders of creation, providence, redemption, and salvation.

2. Give to our God immortal praise;
3. Mercy and truth are all his ways:
4. Wonders of grace to God belong,
5. Repeat his mercies in your song.

6. Give to the Lord of lords renown,
7. The King of kings with glory crown:
8. His mercies ever shall endure,
9. When lords and kings are known no more.

10. He built the earth, he spread the sky,
11. And fixed the starry lights on high:
12. Wonders of grace to God belong,
13. Repeat his mercies in your song.

14. He fills the sun with morning light;
15. He bids the moon direct the night:
16. His mercies ever shall endure,
17. When suns and moons shall shine no more.

18. The Jews he freed from Pharaoh's hand,
19. And brought them to the promised land
20. Wonders of grace to God belong,
21. Repeat his mercies in your song.

22. He saw the Gentiles dead in sin,
23. And felt his pity work within
24. His mercies ever shall endure,
25. When death and sin shall reign no more.

26. He sent his Son with power to save
27. From guilt, and darkness, and the grave
28. Wonders of grace to God belong,
29. Repeat his mercies in your song.

30. Through this vain world he guides our feet,
31. And leads us to his heav'nly seat
32. His mercies ever shall endure,
33. When this vain world shall be no more.
