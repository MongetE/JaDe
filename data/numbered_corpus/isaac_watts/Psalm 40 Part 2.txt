1. v.6-9
2. C. M.
3. The incarnation and sacrifice of Christ.

4. Thus saith the Lord, "Your work is vain
5. Give your burnt-offerings o'er;
6. In dying goats, and bullocks slain,
7. My soul delights no more."

8. Then spake the Savior, "Lo, I'm here,
9. My God, to do thy will;
10. Whate'er thy sacred books declare,
11. Thy servant shall fulfil.

12. "Thy law is ever in my sight,
13. I keep it near my heart;
14. Mine ears are opened with delight
15. To what thy lips impart."

16. And see, the blest Redeemer comes,
17. Th' eternal Son appears,
18. And at th' appointed time assumes
19. The body God prepares.

20. Much he revealed his Father's grace,
21. And much his truth he showed,
22. And preached the way of righteousness
23. Where great assemblies stood.

24. His Father's honor touched his heart,
25. He pitied sinners' cries,
26. And, to fulfil a Savior's part,
27. Was made a sacrifice.

28. PAUSE.

29. No blood of beasts on altars shed
30. Could wash the conscience clean;
31. But the rich sacrifice he paid
32. Atones for all our sin.

33. Then was the great salvation spread,
34. And Satan's kingdom shook;
35. Thus by the woman's promised seed
36. The serpent's head was broke.
