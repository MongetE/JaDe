1. v.1-5
2. L. M.
3. Christ reigning in heaven, and coming to judgment.

4. He reigns! the Lord, the Savior reigns;
5. Praise him in evangelic strains
6. Let the whole earth in songs rejoice,
7. And distant islands join their voice.

8. Deep are his counsels, and unknown,
9. But grace and truth support his throne;
10. Though gloomy clouds his ways surround,
11. Justice is their eternal ground.

12. In robes of judgment, lo! he comes,
13. Shakes the wide earth and cleaves the tombs;
14. Before him burns devouring fire;
15. The mountains melt, the seas retire.

16. His enemies, with sore dismay,
17. Fly from the sight, and shun the day;
18. Then lift your heads, ye saints, on high,
19. And sing, for your redemption's nigh.
