1. v.8,9,13,
2. C. M.
3. Prayer and hope.

4. Soon as I heard my Father say,
5. "Ye children, seek my grace,"
6. My heart replied without delay,
7. "I'll seek my Father's face."

8. Let not thy face be hid from me,
9. Nor frown my soul away;
10. God of my life, I fly to thee
11. In a distressing day.

12. Should friends and kindred near and dear
13. Leave me to want or die,
14. My God would make my life his care,
15. And all my need supply.

16. My fainting flesh had died with grief
17. Had not my soul believed,
18. To see thy grace provide relief;
19. Nor was my hope deceived.

20. Wait on the Lord, ye trembling saints,
21. And keep your courage up;
22. He'll raise your spirit when it faints,
23. And far exceed your hope.
