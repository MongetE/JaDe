1. Christ our passover.

2. Lo, the destroying angel flies
3. To Pharaoh's stubborn land;
4. The pride and flower of Egypt dies
5. By his vindictive hand.

6. He passed the tents of Jacob o'er,
7. Nor poured the wrath divine;
8. He saw the blood on every door,
9. And blessed the peaceful sign.

10. Thus the appointed Lamb must bleed,
11. To break the Egyptian yoke;
12. Thus Isr'el is from bondage freed,
13. And 'scapes the angel's stroke.

14. Lord, if my heart were sprinkled too
15. With blood so rich as thine,
16. Justice no longer would pursue
17. This guilty soul of mine.

18. Jesus our passover was slain,
19. And has at once procured
20. Freedom from Satan's heavy chain,
21. And God's avenging sword.
