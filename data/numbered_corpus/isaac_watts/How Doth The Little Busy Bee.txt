1. How doth the little busy bee
2. Improve each shining hour,
3. And gather honey all the day
4. From every opening flower!

5. How skilfully she builds her cell!
6. How neat she spreads the wax!
7. And labors hard to store it well
8. With the sweet food she makes.

9. In works of labor or of skill,
10. I would be busy too;
11. For Satan finds some mischief still
12. For idle hands to do.

13. In books, or work, or healthful play,
14. Let my first years be passed,
15. That I may give for every day
16. Some good account at last.
