1. The Divine Perfections.

2. Jehovah reigns, his throne is high,
3. His robes are light and majesty;
4. His glory shines with beams so bright,
5. No mortal can sustain the sight.

6. His terrors keep the world in awe;
7. His justice guards his holy law;
8. His love reveals a smiling face;
9. His truth and promise seal the grace.

10. Through all his works his wisdom shines,
11. And baffles Satan's deep designs;
12. His power is sovereign to fulfil
13. The noblest counsels of his will.

14. And will this glorious Lord descend
15. To be my Father and my Friend?
16. Then let my songs with angels join;
17. Heav'n is secure, if God be mine.
