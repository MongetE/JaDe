1. God's condescension to human affairs.

2. Up to the Lord, that reigns on high,
3. And views the nations from afar,
4. Let everlasting praises fly,
5. And tell how large his bounties are.

6. [He that can shake the worlds he made,
7. Or with his word, or with his rod,
8. His goodness, how amazing great!
9. And what a condescending God!]

10. [God, that must stoop to view the skies,
11. And bow to see what angels do,
12. Down to our earth he casts his eyes,
13. And bends his footsteps downwards too.]

14. He overrules all mortal things,
15. And manages our mean affairs;
16. On humble souls the King of kings
17. Bestows his counsels and his cares.

18. Our sorrows and our tears we pour
19. Into the bosom of our God;
20. He hears us in the mournful hour,
21. And helps us bear the heavy load.

22. In vain might lofty princes try
23. Such condescension to perform;
24. For worms were never raised so high
25. Above their meanest fellow worm.

26. O could our thankful hearts devise
27. A tribute equal to thy grace,
28. To the third heav'n our songs should rise,
29. And teach the golden harps thy praise.
