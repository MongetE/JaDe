1. Our king is the care of Heaven.

2. The king, O Lord, with songs of praise,
3. Shall in thy strength rejoice;
4. And, blest with thy salvation, raise
5. To heav'n his cheerful voice.

6. Thy sure defence through nations round
7. Has spread his glorious name;
8. And his successful actions crowned
9. With majesty and fame.

10. Then let the king on God alone
11. For timely aid rely;
12. His mercy shall support the throne,
13. And all our wants supply.

14. But, righteous Lord, his stubborn foes
15. Shall feel thy dreadful hand;
16. Thy vengeful arm shall find out those
17. That hate his mild command.

18. When thou against them dost engage,
19. Thy just but dreadful doom
20. Shall, like a fiery oven's rage,
21. Their hopes and them consume.

22. Thus, Lord, thy wondrous power declare,
23. And thus exalt thy fame;
24. Whilst we glad songs of praise prepare
25. For thine almighty name.
