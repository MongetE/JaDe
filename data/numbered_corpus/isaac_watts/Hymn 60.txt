1. The Virgin Mary's song.

2. Luke 1:46ff.

3. Our souls shall magnify the Lord,
4. In God the Savior we rejoice:
5. While we repeat the Virgin's song,
6. May the same Spirit tune our voice!

7. [The Highest saw her low estate,
8. And mighty things his hand hath done:
9. His overshadowing power and grace
10. Makes her the mother of his Son.

11. Let ev'ry nation call her blest,
12. And endless years prolong her fame;
13. But God alone must be ador'd:
14. Holy and reverend is his name.]

15. To those that fear and trust the Lord,
16. His mercy stands for ever sure:
17. From age to age his promise lives,
18. And the performance is secure.

19. He spake to Abram and his seed,
20. In thee shall all the earth be blessed;"
21. The memory of that ancient word
22. Lay long in his eternal breast.

23. But now no more shall Isr'el wait,
24. No more the Gentiles lie forlorn:
25. Lo, the desire of nations comes;
26. Behold, the promised seed is born!
