1. God and his church; or, Grace and glory.

2. Great God, attend, while Zion sings
3. The joy that from thy presence springs:
4. To spend one day with thee on earth
5. Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.

6. Might I enjoy the meanest place
7. Within thy house, O God of grace,
8. Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power,
9. Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.

10. God is our sun, he makes our day;
11. God is our shield, he guards our way
12. From all th' assaults of hell and sin,
13. From foes without and foes within.

14. All needful grace will God bestow,
15. And crown that grace with glory too!
16. He gives us all things, and withholds
17. No real good from upright souls.

18. O God, our King, whose sovereign sway
19. The glorious hosts of heav'n obey,
20. And devils at thy presence flee,
21. Blest is the man that trusts in thee.
