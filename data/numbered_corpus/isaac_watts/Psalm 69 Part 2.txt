3. The passion and exaltation of Christ.

4. Now let our lips with holy fear
5. And mournful pleasure sing
6. The suff'rings of our great High Priest,
7. The sorrows of our King.

8. He sinks in floods of deep distress;
9. How high the waters rise!
10. While to his heav'nly Father's ear
11. He sends perpetual cries.

12. "Hear me, O Lord, and save thy Son,
13. Nor hide thy shining face;
14. Why should thy fav'rite look like one
15. Forsaken of thy grace?

16. "With rage they persecute the man
17. That groans beneath thy wound,
18. While for a sacrifice I pour
19. My life upon the ground.

20. "They tread my honor to the dust,
21. And laugh when I complain;
22. Their sharp insulting slanders add
23. Fresh anguish to my pain.

24. "All my reproach is known to thee,
25. The scandal and the shame
26. Reproach has broke my bleeding heart,
27. And lies defiled my name.

28. "I looked for pity, but in vain;
29. My kindred are my grief:
30. I ask my friends for comfort round,
31. But meet with no relief.

32. "With vinegar they mock my thirst,
33. They give me gall for food;
34. And sporting with my dying groans,
35. They triumph in my blood.

36. "Shine into my distressed soul,
37. Let thy compassions save;
38. And though my flesh sink down to death,
39. Redeem it from the grave.

40. "I shall arise to praise thy name,
41. Shall reign in worlds unknown;
42. And thy salvation, O my God,
43. Shall seat me on thy throne."
