1. Christ and his church.

2. The King of saints, how fair his face,
3. Adorned with majesty and grace!
4. He comes with blessings from above,
5. And wins the nations to his love.

6. At his right hand our eyes behold
7. The queen arrayed in purest gold;
8. The world admires her heav'nly dress,
9. Her robe of joy and righteousness.

10. He forms her beauties like his own;
11. He calls and seats her near his throne:
12. Fair stranger, let thine heart forget
13. The idols of thy native state.

14. So shall the King the more rejoice
15. In thee, the favorite of his choice;
16. Let him be loved, and yet adored,
17. For he's thy Maker and thy Lord.

18. O happy hour, when thou shalt rise
19. To his fair palace in the skies,
20. And all thy sons (a numerous train)
21. Each like a prince in glory reign!

22. Let endless honors crown his head;
23. Let every age his praises spread;
24. While we with cheerful songs approve
25. The condescensions of his love.
