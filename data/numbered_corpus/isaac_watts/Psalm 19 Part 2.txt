1. God's word most excellent; or, Sincerity and watchfulness.
2. For a Lord's-day morning.

3. Behold, the morning sun
4. Begins his glorious way;
5. His beams through all the nations run,
6. And life and light convey.

7. But where the gospel comes
8. It spreads diviner light;
9. It calls dead sinners from their tombs,
10. And gives the blind their sight.

11. How perfect is thy word!
12. And all thy judgments just!
13. For ever sure thy promise, Lord,
14. And men securely trust.

15. My gracious God, how plain
16. Are thy directions giv'n!
17. O may I never read in vain,
18. But find the path to heav'n!

19. PAUSE.

20. I hear thy word with love,
21. And I would fain obey:
22. Send thy good Spirit from above
23. To guide me, lest I stray.

24. O who can ever find
25. The errors of his ways?
26. Yet with a bold, presumptuous mind
27. I would not dare transgress.

28. Warn me of every sin,
29. Forgive my secret faults,
30. And cleanse this guilty soul of mine,
31. Whose crimes exceed my thoughts.

32. While with my heart and tongue
33. I spread thy praise abroad,
34. Accept the worship and the song,
35. My Savior and my God.
