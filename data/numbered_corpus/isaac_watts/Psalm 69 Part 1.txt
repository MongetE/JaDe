1. v.1-
2. C. M.
3. The sufferings of Christ for our salvation.

4. "Save me, O God, the swelling floods
5. Break in upon my soul;
6. I sink, and sorrows o'er my head
7. Like mighty waters roll.

8. "I cry till all my voice be gone,
9. In tears I waste the day:
10. My God, behold my longing eyes,
11. And shorten thy delay.

12. "They hate my soul without a cause,
13. And still their number grows
14. More than the hairs around my head,
15. And mighty are my foes.

16. "'Twas then I paid that dreadful debt
17. That men could never pay,
18. And gave those honors to thy law
19. Which sinners took away."

20. Thus in the great Messiah's name,
21. The royal prophet mourns;
22. Thus he awakes our hearts to grief,
23. And gives us joy by turns.

24. "Now shall the saints rejoice, and find
25. Salvation in my name;
26. For I have borne their heavy load
27. Of sorrow, pain, and shame.

28. "Grief, like a garment, clothed me round,
29. And sackcloth was my dress,
30. While I procured for naked souls
31. A robe of righteousness.

32. "Amongst my brethren and the Jews
33. I like a stranger stood,
34. And bore their vile reproach, to bring
35. The Gentiles near to God.

36. "I came in sinful mortals' stead,
37. To do my Father's will;
38. Yet when I cleansed my Father's house,
39. They scandalized my zeal.

40. "My fasting and my holy groans
41. Were made the drunkard's song;
42. But God, from his celestial throne,
43. Heard my complaining tongue.

44. "He saved me from the dreadful deep,
45. Nor let my soul be drowned;
46. He raised and fixed my sinking feet
47. On well-established ground.

48. "'Twas in a most accepted hour
49. My prayer arose on high;
50. And for my sake my God shall hear
51. The dying sinner's cry.
