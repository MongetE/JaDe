1. Guilt of conscience and relief

2. Amidst thy wrath remember love,
3. Restore thy servant, Lord;
4. Nor let a Father's chast'ning prove
5. Like an avenger's sword.

6. Thine arrows stick within my heart,
7. My flesh is sorely pressed;
8. Between the sorrow and the smart,
9. My spirit finds no rest.

10. My sins a heavy load appear,
11. And o'er my head are gone;
12. Too heavy they for me to bear,
13. Too hard for me t' atone.

14. My thoughts are like a troubled sea,
15. My head still bending down;
16. And I go mourning all the day,
17. Beneath my Father's frown.

18. Lord, I am weak and broken sore,
19. None of my powers are whole:
20. The inward anguish makes me roar,
21. The anguish of my soul.

22. All my desire to thee is known,
23. Thine eye counts every tear;
24. And every sigh, and every groan,
25. Is noticed by thine ear.

26. Thou art my God, my only hope;
27. My God will hear my cry;
28. My God will bear my spirit up,
29. When Satan bids me die.

30. [My foot is ever apt to slide,
31. My foes rejoice to see 't;
32. They raise their pleasure and their pride
33. When they supplant my feet.

34. But I'll confess my guilt to thee,
35. And grieve for all my sin;
36. I'll mourn how weak my graces be,
37. And beg support divine.

38. My God, forgive my follies past,
39. And be for ever nigh;
40. O Lord of my salvation, haste,
41. Before thy servant die.]
