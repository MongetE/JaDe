1. v.1-6,32-
2. L. M.
3. The vengeance and compassion of God.

4. Let God arise in all his might,
5. And put the troops of hell to flight,
6. As smoke that sought to cloud the skies
7. Before the rising tempest flies.

8. [He comes arrayed in burning flames
9. Justice and Vengeance are his names:
10. Behold his fainting foes expire,
11. Like melting wax before the fire.]

12. He rides and thunders through the sky;
13. His name, Jehovah, sounds on high
14. Sing to his name, ye sons of grace;
15. Ye saints, rejoice before his face.

16. The widow and the fatherless
17. Fly to his aid in sharp distress;
18. In him the poor and helpless find
19. A Judge that's just, a Father kind.

20. He breaks the captive's heavy chain,
21. And prisoners see the light again;
22. But rebels that dispute his will
23. Shall dwell in chains and darkness still.

24. PAUSE.

25. Kingdoms and thrones to God belong;
26. Crown him, ye nations, in your song:
27. His wondrous names and powers rehearse;
28. His honors shall enrich your verse.

29. He shakes the heav'ns with loud alarms;
30. How terrible is God in arms!
31. In Isr'el are his mercies known,
32. Isr'el is his peculiar throne.

33. Proclaim him King, pronounce him blest;
34. He's your defence, your joy, your rest:
35. When terrors rise and nations faint,
36. God is the strength of every saint.
