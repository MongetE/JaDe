1. God incomprehensible and sovereign.

2. [Can creatures to perfection find
3. Th' eternal, uncreated Mind?
4. Or can the largest stretch of thought
5. Measure and search his nature out?

6. 'Tis high as heav'n, 'tis deep as hell
7. And what can mortals know or tell?
8. His glory spreads beyond the sky,
9. And all the shining worlds on high.

10. But man, vain man, would fain be wise;
11. Born like a wild young colt, he flies
12. Through all the follies of his mind,
13. And swells, and snuffs the empty wind.]

14. God is a King of power unknown,
15. Firm are the orders of his throne;
16. If he resolve, who dares oppose,
17. Or ask him why or what he does?

18. He wounds the heart, and he makes whole
19. He calms the tempest of the soul;
20. When he shuts up in long despair,
21. Who can remove the heavy bar?

22. He frowns, and darkness veils the moon;
23. The fainting sun grows dim at noon;
24. The pillars of heav'n's starry roof
25. Tremble and start at his reproof.

26. He gave the vaulted heav'n its form,
27. The crooked serpent, and the worm;
28. He breaks the billows with his breath,
29. And smites the sons of pride to death.

30. These are a portion of his ways;
31. But who shall dare describe his face?
32. Who can endure his light, or stand
33. To hear the thunders of his hand?
