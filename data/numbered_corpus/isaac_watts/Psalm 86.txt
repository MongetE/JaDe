3. A general song of praise to God.

4. Among the princes, earthly gods,
5. There's none hath power divine;
6. Nor is their nature, mighty Lord,
7. Nor are their works, like thine.

8. The nations thou hast made shall bring
9. Their off'rings round thy throne;
10. For thou alone dost wondrous things,
11. For thou art God alone.

12. Lord, I would walk with holy feet;
13. Teach me thine heav'nly ways,
14. And my poor scattered thoughts unite
15. In God my Father's praise.

16. Great is thy mercy, and my tongue
17. Shall those sweet wonders tell,
18. How by thy grace my sinking soul
19. Rose from the deeps of hell.
