1. The inward witness to Christianity.

2. 1 Jn. 5:10.

3. Questions and doubts be heard no more,
4. Let Christ and joy be all our theme;
5. His Spirit seals his gospel sure,
6. To every soul that trusts in him.

7. Jesus, thy witness speaks within;
8. The mercy which thy words reveal
9. Refines the heart from sense and sin,
10. And stamps its own celestial seal.

11. 'Tis God's inimitable hand
12. That molds and forms the heart anew;
13. Blasphemers can no more withstand,
14. But bow, and own thy doctrine true.

15. The guilty wretch that trusts thy blood
16. Finds peace and pardon at the cross;
17. The sinful soul, averse to God,
18. Believes and loves his Maker's laws.

19. Learning and wit may cease their strife,
20. When miracles with glory shine;
21. The voice that calls the dead to life
22. Must be almighty and divine.
