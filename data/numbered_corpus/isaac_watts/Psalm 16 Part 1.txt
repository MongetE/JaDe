1. Confession of our poverty.

2. Preserve me, Lord, in time of need,
3. For succor to thy throne I flee,
4. But have no merits there to plead:
5. My goodness cannot reach to thee.

6. Oft have my heart and tongue confessed
7. How empty and how poor I am;
8. My praise can never make thee blessed,
9. Nor add new glories to thy name.

10. Yet, Lord, thy saints on earth may reap
11. Some profit by the good we do;
12. These are the company I keep,
13. These are the choicest friends I know.

14. Let others choose the sons of mirth
15. To give a relish to their wine;
16. I love the men of heav'nly birth,
17. Whose thoughts and language are divine.
