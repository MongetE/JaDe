1. Characters of the children of God.  From several scriptures.

2. So new-born babes desire the breast,
3. To feed, and grow, and thrive;
4. So saints with joy the gospel taste,
5. And by the gospel live.

6. [With inward gust their heart approves
7. All that the word relates;
8. They love the men their Father loves,
9. And hate the works he hates.]

10. [Not all the flatt'ring baits on earth
11. Can make them slaves to lust;
12. They can't forget their heav'nly birth,
13. Nor grovel in the dust.

14. Not all the chains that tyrants use
15. Shall bind their souls to vice;
16. Faith, like a conqueror, can produce
17. A thousand victories.]

18. [Grace, like an uncorrupting seed,
19. Abides and reigns within;
20. Immortal principles forbid
21. The sons of God to sin.]

22. [Not by the terrors of a slave
23. Do they perform his will,
24. But with the noblest powers they have
25. His sweet commands fulfil.]

26. They find access at every hour
27. To God within the veil;
28. Hence they derive a quick'ning power,
29. And joys that never fail.

30. O happy souls! O glorious state
31. Of overflowing grace!
32. To dwell so near their Father's seat,
33. And see his lovely face!

34. Lord, I address thy heav'nly throne;
35. Call me a child of thine;
36. Send down the Spirit of thy Son
37. To form my heart divine.

38. There shed thy choicest loves abroad,
39. And make my comforts strong:
40. Then shall I say, "My Father God!"
41. With an unwav'ring tongue.
