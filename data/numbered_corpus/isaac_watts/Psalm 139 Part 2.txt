1. The wonderful formation of man.

2. 'Twas from thy hand, my God, I came,
3. A work of such a curious frame
4. In me thy fearful wonders shine,
5. And each proclaims thy skill divine.

6. Thine eyes did all my limbs survey,
7. Which yet in dark confusion lay;
8. Thou saw'st the daily growth they took,
9. Formed by the model of thy book.

10. By thee my growing parts were named,
11. And what thy sovereign counsels framed-
12. The breathing lungs, the beating heart-
13. Was copied with unerring art.

14. At last, to show my Maker's name,
15. God stamped his image on my frame,
16. And in some unknown moment joined
17. The finished members to the mind.

18. There the young seeds of thought began,
19. And all the passions of the man:
20. Great God, our infant nature pays
21. Immortal tribute to thy praise.

22. PAUSE.

23. Lord, since in my advancing age
24. I've acted on life's busy stage,
25. Thy thoughts of love to me surmount
26. The power of numbers to recount.

27. I could survey the ocean o'er,
28. And count each sand that makes the shore,
29. Before my swiftest thoughts could trace
30. The num'rous wonders of thy grace.

31. These on my heart are still impressed,
32. With these I give my eyes to rest;
33. And at my waking hour I find
34. God and his love possess my mind.
