1. Praise God, all his saints  or, The saints judging the world.

2. All ye that love the Lord, rejoice,
3. And let your songs be new;
4. Amidst the church with cheerful voice
5. His later wonders show.

6. The Jews, the people of his grace,
7. Shall their Redeemer sing;
8. And Gentile nations join the praise,
9. While Zion owns her King.

10. The Lord takes pleasure in the just,
11. Whom sinners treat with scorn;
12. The meek that lie despised in dust
13. Salvation shall adorn.

14. Saints should be joyful in their King,
15. E'en on a dying bed;
16. And like the souls in glory sing;
17. For God shall raise the dead.

18. Then his high praise shall fill their tongues
19. Their hands shall wield the sword;
20. And vengeance shall attend their songs,
21. The vengeance of the Lord.

22. When Christ the judgment-seat ascends,
23. And bids the world appear,
24. Thrones are prepared for all his friends
25. Who humbly loved him here.

26. Then shall they rule with iron rod
27. Nations that dared rebel;
28. And join the sentence of their God
29. On tyrants doomed to hell.

30. The royal sinners bound in chains
31. New triumphs shall afford:
32. Such honor for the saints remains;
33. Praise ye, and love the Lord!
