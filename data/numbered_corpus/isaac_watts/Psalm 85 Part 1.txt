1. v.1-8
2. L. M.
3. Waiting for an answer to prayer; or, Deliverance begun and completed.

4. Lord, thou hast called thy grace to mind,
5. Thou hast reversed our heavy doom;
6. So God forgave when Isr'el sinned,
7. And brought his wand'ring captives home.

8. Thou hast begun to set us free,
9. And made thy fiercest wrath abate;
10. Now let our hearts be turned to thee,
11. And thy salvation be complete.

12. Revive our dying graces, Lord,
13. And let thy saints in thee rejoice;
14. Make known thy truth, fulfil thy word;
15. We wait for praise to tune our voice.

16. We wait to hear what God will say;
17. He'll speak, and give his people peace;
18. But let them run no more astray,
19. Lest his returning wrath increase.
