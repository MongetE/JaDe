1. God is the refuge of his saints,
2. When storms of sharp distress invade;
3. Ere we can offer our complaints,
4. Behold him present with his aid!

5. Let mountains from their seats be hurled
6. Down to the deep, and buried there,
7. Convulsions shake the solid world,
8. Our faith shall never yield to fear.

9. Loud may the troubled ocean roar;
10. In sacred peace our souls abide;
11. While every nation, every shore,
12. Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.

13. There is a stream, whose gentle flow
14. Supplies the city of our God,
15. Life, love, and joy still gliding through,
16. And watering our divine abode.

17. Zion enjoys her monarch's love,
18. Secure against the threatening hour;
19. Nor can her firm foundation move,
20. Built on his faithfulness and power.

21. Let Zion in her King rejoice,
22. Though Satan rage, and kingdoms rise:
23. He utters his almighty voice,
24. The nations melt, the tumult dies.

25. The Lord of old for Jacob fought;
26. And Jacob's God is still our aid:
27. Behold the works his hand hath wrought!
28. What desolations he hath made!

29. From sea to sea, through all their shores,
30. He makes the noise of battle cease;
31. When from on high his thunder roars,
32. He awes the trembling world to peace.

33. He breaks the bow, he cuts the spear;
34. Chariots he burns with heavenly flame:
35. Keep silence, all the earth, and hear
36. The sound and glory of his name:

37. "Be still, and learn that I am God,
38. Exalted over all the lands;
39. I will be known and feared abroad;
40. For still my throne in Zion stands."

41. O Lord of hosts, almighty King!
42. While we so near thy presence dwell,
43. Our faith shall rest secure, and sing
44. Defiance to the gates of hell.
