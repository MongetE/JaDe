1. The Divine Perfections.

2. The Lord Jehovah reigns,
3. His throne is built on high;
4. The garments he assumes
5. Are light and majesty:
6. His glories shine
7. With beams so bright,
8. No mortal eye
9. Can bear the sight.

10. The thunders of his hand
11. Keep the wide world in awe;
12. His wrath and justice stand
13. To guard his holy law:
14. And where his love
15. Resolves to bless,
16. His truth confirms
17. And seals the grace.

18. Through all his ancient works
19. Surprising wisdom shines,
20. Confounds the powers of hell,
21. And breaks their cursed designs:
22. Strong is his arm,
23. And shall fulfil
24. His great decrees,
25. His sovereign will.

26. And can this mighty King
27. Of glory condescend?
28. And will he write his name,
29. "My Father and my Friend?"
30. I love his name,
31. I love his word;
32. Join all my powers
33. And praise the Lord.
