1. Wrath and mercy from the judgment-seat.

2. With my whole heart I'll raise my song,
3. Thy wonders I'll proclaim;
4. Thou, sovereign Judge of right and wrong,
5. Wilt put my foes to shame.

6. I'll sing thy majesty and grace;
7. My God prepares his throne
8. To judge the world in righteousness,
9. And make his vengeance known.

10. Then shall the Lord a refuge prove
11. For all the poor oppressed;
12. To save the people of his love,
13. And give the weary rest.

14. The men that know thy name will trust
15. In thy abundant grace;
16. For thou hast ne'er forsook the just,
17. Who humbly seek thy face.

18. Sing praises to the righteous Lord,
19. Who dwells on Zion's hill,
20. Who executes his threatening word,
21. And doth his grace fulfil.
