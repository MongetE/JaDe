1. Summer and winter.
2. A Song for Great Britain.

3. O Britain, praise thy mighty God,
4. And make his honors known abroad,
5. He bid the ocean round thee flow;
6. Not bars of brass could guard thee so.

7. Thy children are secure and blest;
8. Thy shores have peace, thy cities rest;
9. He feeds thy sons with finest wheat,
10. And adds his blessing to their meat.

11. Thy changing seasons he ordains,
12. Thine early and thy latter rains;
13. His flakes of snow like wool he sends,
14. And thus the springing corn defends.

15. With hoary frost he strews the ground;
16. His hail descends with clatt'ring sound:
17. Where is the man so vainly bold
18. That dares defy his dreadful cold?

19. He bids the southern breezes blow;
20. The ice dissolves, the waters flow:
21. But he hath nobler works and ways
22. To call the Britons to his praise.

23. To all the isle his laws are shown,
24. His gospel through the nation known;
25. He hath not thus revealed his word
26. To every land: praise ye the Lord.
