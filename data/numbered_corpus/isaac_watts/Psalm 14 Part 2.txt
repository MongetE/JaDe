1. The folly of persecutors.

2. Are sinners now so senseless grown
3. That they the saints devour?
4. And never worship at thy throne,
5. Nor fear thine awful power?

6. Great God! appear to their surprise;
7. Reveal thy dreadful name;
8. Let them no more thy wrath despise,
9. Nor turn our hope to shame.

10. Dost thou not dwell among the just?
11. And yet our foes deride,
12. That we should make thy name our trust;
13. Great God! confound their pride.

14. O that the joyful day were come
15. To finish our distress!
16. When God shall bring his children home
17. Our songs shall never cease.
