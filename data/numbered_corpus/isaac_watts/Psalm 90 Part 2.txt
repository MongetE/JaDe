3. Infirmities and mortality the effect of sin.

4. Lord, if thine eye surveys our faults,
5. And justice grows severe,
6. Thy dreadful wrath exceeds our thoughts,
7. And burns beyond our fear.

8. Thine anger turns our frame to dust;
9. By one offence to thee
10. Adam with all his sons have lost
11. Their immortality.

12. Life, like a vain amusement, flies,
13. A fable or a song;
14. By swift degrees our nature dies,
15. Nor can our joys be long.

16. 'Tis but a few whose days amount
17. To threescore years and ten;
18. And all beyond that short account
19. Is sorrow, toil, and pain.

20. [Our vitals with laborious strife
21. Bear up the crazy load,
22. And drag those poor remains of life
23. Along the tiresome road.]

24. Almighty God, reveal thy love,
25. And not thy wrath alone;
26. O let our sweet experience prove
27. The mercies of thy throne!

28. Our souls would learn the heav'nly art
29. T' improve the hours we have,
30. That we may act the wiser part,
31. And live beyond the grave.
