1. Spiritual apparel.

2. Isa. 61:10.

3. Awake, my heart; arise, my tongue,
4. Prepare a tuneful voice;
5. In God, the life of all my joys,
6. Aloud will I rejoice.

7. 'Tis he adorned my naked soul,
8. And made salvation mine;
9. Upon a poor polluted worm
10. He makes his graces shine.

11. And lest the shadow of a spot
12. Should on my soul be found,
13. He took the robe the Savior wrought,
14. And cast it all around.

15. How far the heav'nly robe exceeds
16. What earthly princes wear
17. These ornaments, how bright they shine!
18. How white the garments are!

19. The Spirit wrought my faith, and love,
20. And hope, and every grace;
21. But Jesus spent his life to work
22. The robe of righteousness.

23. Strangely, my soul, art thou arrayed
24. By the great Sacred Three!
25. In sweetest harmony of praise
26. Let all thy powers agree.
