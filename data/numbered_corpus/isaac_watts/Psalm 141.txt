1. v.2-5
2. L. M.
3. Watchfulness and brotherly reproof.
4. A morning or evening Psalm.

5. My God, accept my early vows,
6. Like morning incense in thine house;
7. And let my nightly worship rise
8. Sweet as the evening sacrifice.

9. Watch o'er my lips, and guard them, Lord,
10. From every rash and heedless word;
11. Nor let my feet incline to tread
12. The guilty path where sinners lead.

13. O may the righteous, when I stray,
14. Smite, and reprove my wand'ring way!
15. Their gentle words, like ointment shed,
16. Shall never bruise, but cheer my head.

17. When I behold them pressed with grief,
18. I'll cry to heav'n for their relief;
19. And by my warm petitions prove
20. How much I prize their faithful love.
