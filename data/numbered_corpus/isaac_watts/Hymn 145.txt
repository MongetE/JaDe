1. Christ and Aaron.
2. Heb. 7; 9.

3. Jesus, in thee our eyes behold
4. A thousand glories more,
5. Than the rich gems and polished gold
6. The sons of Aaron wore.

7. They first their own burnt-offerings brought,
8. To purge themselves from sin;
9. Thy life was pure without a spot,
10. And all thy nature clean.

11. [Fresh blood as constant as the day
12. Was on their altar spilt;
13. But thy one offering takes away
14. For ever all our guilt.]

15. [Their priesthood ran through several hands,
16. For mortal was their race;
17. Thy never-changing office stands
18. Eternal as thy days.]

19. [Once in the circuit of a year,
20. With blood, but not his own,
21. Aaron within the veil appears
22. Before the golden throne:

23. But Christ, by his own powerful blood,
24. Ascends above the skies,
25. And in the presence of our God
26. Shows his own sacrifice.]

27. Jesus, the King of glory, reigns
28. On Zion's heav'nly hill;
29. Looks like a lamb that has been slain,
30. And wears his priesthood still.

31. He ever lives to intercede
32. Before his Father's face:
33. Give him, my soul, thy cause to plead,
34. Nor doubt the Father's grace.
