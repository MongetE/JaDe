1. v.20-
2. L. M.
3. Sincerity proved and rewarded.

4. Lord, thou hast seen my soul sincere,
5. Hast made thy truth and love appear;
6. Before mine eyes I set thy laws,
7. And thou hast owned my righteous cause.

8. Since I have learned thy holy ways,
9. I've walked upright before thy face;
10. Or if my feet did e'er depart,
11. 'Twas never with a wicked heart.

12. What sore temptations broke my rest!
13. What wars and strugglings in my breast!
14. But through thy grace, that reigns within,
15. I guard against my darling sin:

16. That sin which close besets me still,
17. That works and strives against my will:
18. When shall thy Spirit's sovereign power
19. Destroy it, that it rise no more?

20. [With an impartial hand, the Lord
21. Deals out to mortals their reward;
22. The kind and faithful souls shall find
23. A God as faithful and as kind.

24. The just and pure shall ever say,
25. Thou art more pure, more just than they;
26. And men that love revenge shall know
27. God hath an arm of vengeance too.]
