1. Praise to God for creation and redemption.

2. Let them neglect thy glory, Lord,
3. Who never knew thy grace;
4. But our loud songs shall still record
5. The wonders of thy praise.

6. We raise our shouts, O God, to thee,
7. And send them to thy throne;
8. All glory to th' united Three,
9. The undivided One.

10. 'Twas he (and we'll adore his name)
11. That formed us by a word;
12. 'Tis he restores our ruined frame:
13. Salvation to the Lord!

14. Hosannah! let the earth and skies
15. Repeat the joyful sound
16. Rocks, hills, and vales, reflect the voice
17. In one eternal round.
