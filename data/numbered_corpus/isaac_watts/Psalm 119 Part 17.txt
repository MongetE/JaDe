1. Courage and perseverance under persecution.

2. ver. 143,

3. When pain and anguish seize me, Lord,
4. All my support is from thy word:
5. My soul dissolves for heaviness;
6. Uphold me with thy strength'ning grace.

7. ver. 51,69,

8. The proud have framed their scoffs and lies,
9. They watch my feet with envious eyes,
10. And tempt my soul to snares and sin,
11. Yet thy commands I ne'er decline.

12. ver. 161,

13. They hate me, Lord, without a cause,
14. They hate to see me love thy laws;
15. But I will trust and fear thy name,
16. Till pride and malice die with shame.
