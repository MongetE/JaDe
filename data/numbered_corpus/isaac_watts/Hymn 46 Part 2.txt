1. The privileges of the living above the dead.

2. Isa. 38:18,19.

3. Awake, my zeal; awake, my love,
4. To serve my Savior here below,
5. In works which perfect saints above
6. And holy angels cannot do.

7. Awake, my charity, to feed
8. The hungry soul, and clothe the poor;
9. In heav'n are found no sons of need,
10. There all these duties are no more.

11. Subdue thy passions, O my soul!
12. Maintain the fight, thy work pursue,
13. Daily thy rising sins control,
14. And be thy vict'ries ever new.

15. The land of triumph lies on high,
16. There are no foes t' encounter there;
17. Lord, I would conquer till I die,
18. And finish all the glorious war.

19. Let every flying hour confess
20. I gain thy gospel fresh renown;
21. And when my life and labors cease,
22. May I possess the promised crown!
