1. v.1-7
2. L. M.
3. Safety in public diseases and dangers.

4. He that hath made his refuge God
5. Shall find a most secure abode,
6. Shall walk all day beneath his shade,
7. And there at night shall rest his head.

8. Then will I say, "My God, thy power
9. Shall be my fortress and my tower;
10. I, that am formed of feeble dust,
11. Make thine almighty arm my trust."

12. Thrice happy man! thy Maker's care
13. Shall keep thee from the fowler's snare;
14. Satan, the fowler, who betrays
15. Unguarded souls a thousand ways.

16. Just as a hen protects her brood
17. From birds of prey that seek their blood,
18. Under her feathers, so the Lord
19. Makes his own arm his people's guard.

20. If burning beams of noon conspire
21. To dart a pestilential fire,
22. God is their life; his wings are spread
23. To shield them with a healthful shade.

24. If vapors with malignant breath
25. Rise thick, and scatter midnight death,
26. Isr'el is safe; the poisoned air
27. Grows pure, if Isr'el's God be there.

28. PAUSE.

29. What though a thousand at thy side,
30. At thy right hand ten thousand died,
31. Thy God his chosen people saves
32. Amongst the dead, amidst the graves.

33. So when he sent his angel down
34. To make his wrath in Egypt known,
35. And slew their sons, his careful eye
36. Passed all the doors of Jacob by.

37. But if the fire, or plague, or sword,
38. Receive commission from the Lord
39. To strike his saints among the rest,
40. Their very pains and deaths are blest.

41. The sword, the pestilence, or fire,
42. Shall but fulfil their best desire;
43. From sins and sorrows set them free,
44. And bring thy children, Lord, to thee.
