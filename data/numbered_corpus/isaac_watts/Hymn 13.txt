1. The Son of God incarnate.

2. Isa. 9:2,6,7.

3. The lands that long in darkness lay
4. Now have beheld a heav'nly light;
5. Nations that sat in death's cold shade
6. Are blessed with beams divinely bright.

7. The virgin's promised Son is born,
8. Behold th' expected child appear:
9. What shall his names or titles be?
10. "The Wonderful, the Counsellor."

11. [This infant is the mighty God,
12. Come to be suckled and adored;
13. Th' eternal Father, Prince of Peace,
14. The Son of David, and his Lord.]

15. The government of earth and seas
16. Upon his shoulders shall be laid;
17. His wide dominions still increase,
18. And honors to his name be paid.

19. Jesus, the holy child, shall sit
20. High on his father David's throne;
21. Shall crush his foes beneath his feet,
22. And reign to ages yet unknown.
