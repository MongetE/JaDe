1. v.23-
2. C. M.
3. The way and end of the righteous and the wicked.

4. My God, the steps of pious men
5. Are ordered by thy will;
6. Though they should fall, they rise again,
7. Thy hand supports them still.

8. The Lord delights to see their ways,
9. Their virtue he approves;
10. He'll ne'er deprive them of his grace,
11. Nor leave the men he loves.

12. The heav'nly heritage is theirs,
13. Their portion and their home;
14. He feeds them now, and makes them heirs
15. Of blessings long to come.

16. Wait on the Lord, ye sons of men,
17. Nor fear when tyrants frown;
18. Ye shall confess their pride was vain,
19. When justice casts them down.

20. PAUSE.

21. The haughty sinner have I seen,
22. Nor fearing man nor God,
23. Like a tall bay-tree, fair and green,
24. Spreading his arms abroad.

25. And lo! he vanished from the ground,
26. Destroyed by hands unseen;
27. Nor root, nor branch, nor leaf was found
28. Where all that pride had been.

29. But mark the man of righteousness,
30. His several steps attend;
31. True pleasure runs through all his ways,
32. And peaceful is his end.
