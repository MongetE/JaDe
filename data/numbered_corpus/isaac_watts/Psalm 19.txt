1. The books of nature and of Scripture compared.

2. THE heav'ns declare thy glory, Lord,
3. In every star thy wisdom shines
4. But when our eyes behold thy word,
5. We read thy name in fairer lines.

6. The rolling sun, the changing light,
7. And nights and days, thy power confess
8. But the blest volume thou hast writ
9. Reveals thy justice and thy grace.

10. Sun, moon, and stars convey thy praise
11. Round the whole earth, and never stand:
12. So when thy truth begun its race,
13. It touched and glanced on every land.

14. Nor shall thy spreading gospel rest
15. Till through the world thy truth has run,
16. Till Christ has all the nations blest
17. That see the light or feel the sun.

18. Great Sun of Righteousness, arise,
19. Bless the dark world with heav'nly light;
20. Thy gospel makes the simple wise,
21. Thy laws are pure, thy judgments right.

22. Thy noblest wonders here we view
23. In souls renewed and sins forgiv'n;
24. Lord, cleanse my sins, my soul renew,
25. And make thy word my guide to heaven.
