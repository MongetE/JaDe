1. Dwelling with God.

2. The earth for ever is the Lord's,
3. With Adam's num'rous race;
4. He raised its arches o'er the floods,
5. And built it on the seas.

6. But who among the sons of men
7. May visit thine abode?
8. He that has hands from mischief clean,
9. Whose heart is right with God.

10. This is the man may rise and take
11. The blessings of his grace;
12. This is the lot of those that seek
13. The God of Jacob's face.

14. Now let our souls' immortal powers
15. To meet the Lord prepare,
16. Lift up their everlasting doors,
17. The King of glory's near.

18. The King of glory! who can tell
19. The wonders of his might?
20. He rules the nations; but to dwell
21. With saints is his delight.
