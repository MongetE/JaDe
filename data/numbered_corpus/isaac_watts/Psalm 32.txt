1. Forgiveness of sins upon confession.

2. O Blessed souls are they
3. Whose sins are covered o'er!
4. Divinely blest, to whom the Lord
5. Imputes their guilt no more.

6. They mourn their follies past,
7. And keep their hearts with care;
8. Their lips and lives, without deceit,
9. Shall prove their faith sincere.

10. While I concealed my guilt,
11. I felt the fest'ring wound;
12. Till I confessed my sins to thee,
13. And ready pardon found.

14. Let sinners learn to pray,
15. Let saints keep near the throne;
16. Our help, in times of deep distress,
17. Is found in God alone.
