1. The offices of Christ.  From several scriptures.

2. Join all the glorious names
3. Of wisdom, love, and power,
4. That ever mortals knew,
5. That angels ever bore:
6. All are too mean to speak his worth,
7. Too mean to set my Savior forth.

8. But O what gentle terms,
9. What condescending ways,
10. Doth our Redeemer use
11. To teach his heav'nly grace!
12. Mine eyes with joy and wonder see
13. What forms of love he bears for me.

14. [Arrayed in mortal flesh,
15. He like an angel stands,
16. And holds the promises
17. And pardons in his hands;
18. Commissioned from his Father's throne
19. To make his grace to mortals known.]

20. [Great Prophet of my God,
21. My tongue would bless thy name;
22. By thee the joyful news
23. Of our salvation came:
24. The joyful news of sins forgiv'n,
25. Of hell subdued, and peace with heav'n.]

26. [Be thou my Counsellor,
27. My Pattern, and my Guide;
28. And through this desert land
29. Still keep me near thy side:
30. O let my feet ne'er run astray,
31. Nor rove, nor seek the crooked way.]

32. [I love my Shepherd's voice,
33. His watchful eyes shall keep
34. My wand'ring soul among
35. The thousands of his sheep:
36. He feeds his flock, he calls their names,
37. His bosom bears the tender lambs.]

38. [To this dear Surety's hand
39. Will I commit my cause;
40. He answers and fulfils
41. His Father's broken laws:
42. Behold my soul at freedom set!
43. My Surety paid the dreadful debt.]

44. [Jesus, my great High Priest,
45. Offered his blood, and died;
46. My guilty conscience seeks
47. No sacrifice beside:
48. His powerful blood did once atone,
49. And now it pleads before the throne.]

50. [My Advocate appears
51. For my defence on high;
52. The Father bows his ears,
53. And lays his thunder by:
54. Not all that hell or sin can say
55. Shall turn his heart, his love away.]

56. [My dear Almighty Lord,
57. My Conqueror and my King!
58. Thy sceptre and thy sword,
59. Thy reigning grace I sing:
60. Thine is the power; behold, I sit
61. In willing bonds before thy feet.]

62. [Now let my soul arise,
63. And tread the tempter down;
64. My Captain leads me forth
65. To conquest and a crown:
66. A feeble saint shall win the day,
67. Though death and hell obstruct the way.]

68. Should all the hosts of death,
69. And powers of hell unknown,
70. Put their most dreadful forms
71. Of rage and mischief on,
72. I shall be safe, for Christ displays
73. Superior power, and guardian grace.
