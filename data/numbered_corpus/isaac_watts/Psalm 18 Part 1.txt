1. v.1-6,15-
2. L. M.
3. Deliverance from despair.

4. Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength,
5. My rock, my tower, my high defence:
6. Thy mighty arm shall be my trust,
7. For I have found salvation thence.

8. Death, and the terrors of the grave,
9. Stood round me with their dismal shade;
10. While floods of high temptations rose,
11. And made my sinking soul afraid.

12. I saw the op'ning gates of hell,
13. With endless pains and sorrows there,
14. Which none but they that feel can tell;
15. While I was hurried to despair.

16. In my distress I called my God,
17. When I could scarce believe him mine:
18. He bowed his ear to my complaint,
19. Then did his grace appear divine.

20. With speed he flew to my relief,
21. As on a cherub's wing he rode;
22. Awful and bright as lightning shone
23. The face of my deliverer, God.

24. Temptations fled at his rebuke,
25. The blast of his almighty breath;
26. He sent salvation from on high,
27. And drew me from the deeps of death.

28. Great were my fears, my foes were great,
29. Much was their strength, and more their rage;
30. But Christ, my Lord, is conqueror still,
31. In all the wars that devils wage.

32. My song for ever shall record
33. That terrible, that joyful hour;
34. And give the glory to the Lord,
35. Due to his mercy and his power
