1. Man mortal, and God eternal
2. A mournful song at a funeral.

3. Through every age, eternal God,
4. Thou art our rest, our safe abode;
5. High was thy throne ere heav'n was made,
6. Or earth thy humble footstool laid.

7. Long hadst thou reigned ere time began,
8. Or dust was fashioned to a man;
9. And long thy kingdom shall endure
10. When earth and time shall be no more.

11. But man, weak man, is born to die,
12. Made up of guilt and vanity;
13. Thy dreadful sentence, Lord, was just,
14. "Return, ye sinners, to your dust."

15. [A thousand of our years amount
16. Scarce to a day in thine account;
17. Like yesterday's departed light,
18. Or the last watch of ending night.

19. PAUSE.

20. Death, like an overflowing stream,
21. Sweeps us away; our life's a dream,
22. An empty tale, a morning flower,
23. Cut down and withered in an hour.]

24. [Our age to seventy years is set;
25. How short the time! how frail the state!
26. And if to eighty we arrive,
27. We rather sigh and groan than live.

28. But O how oft thy wrath appears,
29. And cuts off our expected years!
30. Thy wrath awakes our humble dread;
31. We fear the power that strikes us dead.]

32. Teach us, O Lord, how frail is man;
33. And kindly lengthen out our span,
34. Till a wise care of piety
35. Fit us to die, and dwell with thee.
