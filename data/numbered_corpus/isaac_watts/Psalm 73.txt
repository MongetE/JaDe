1. v.22,3,6,17-
2. L. M.
3. The prosperity of sinners cursed.

4. Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I,
5. To mourn, and murmur, and repine,
6. To see the wicked placed on high,
7. In pride and robes of honor shine!

8. But O their end, their dreadful end!
9. Thy sanctuary taught me so;
10. On slipp'ry rocks I see them stand,
11. And fiery billows roll below.

12. Now let them boast how tall they rise,
13. I'll never envy them again;
14. There they may stand with haughty eyes,
15. Till they plunge deep in endless pain.

16. Their fancied joys, how fast they flee!
17. Just like a dream when man awakes;
18. Their songs of softest harmony
19. Are but a preface to their plagues.

20. Now I esteem their mirth and wine
21. Too dear to purchase with my blood;
22. Lord, 'tis enough that thou art mine,
23. My life, my portion, and my God.
