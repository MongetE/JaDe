1. Jesus our surety and Savior.

2. 1 Pet. 1:18; Gal. 3:13; Rom. 4:25.

3. Adam, our father and our head,
4. Transgressed, and justice doomed us dead;
5. The fiery law speaks all despair:
6. There's no reprieve nor pardon there.

7. But, O unutterable grace
8. The Son of God takes Adam's place;
9. Down to our world the Savior flies,
10. Stretches his arms, and bleeds, and dies.

11. Justice was pleased to bruise the God,
12. And pay its wrongs with heav'nly blood:
13. What unknown racks and pangs he bore!
14. Then rose; the law could ask no more.

15. Amazing work! look down, ye skies,
16. Wonder and gaze with all your eyes;
17. Ye heav'nly thrones, stoop from above,
18. And bow to this mysterious love.

19. Lo! they adore th' incarnate Son,
20. And sing the glories he hath won;
21. Sing how he broke our iron chains,
22. How deep he suiik, how high he reigns!

23. Triumph and reign, victorious Lord,
24. By all the flaming hosts adored;
25. And say, dear Couqueror, say how long
26. Ere we shall rise to join their song.

27. Send down a chariot from above,
28. With fiery wheels, and paved with love
29. Raise us beyond th' ethereal blue,
30. To sing and love as angels do.
