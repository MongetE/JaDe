1. The apostles' commission.

2. Mark 16:15ff; Matt. 28:18ff.

3. "O preach my gospel," saith the Lord,
4. "Bid the whole earth my grace receive;
5. He shall be saved that trusts my word,
6. He shall be damned that won't believe.

7. "I'll make your great commission known,
8. And ye shall prove my gospel true,
9. By all the works that I have done,
10. By all the wonders ye shall do.

11. "Go heal the sick, go raise the dead,
12. Go cast out devils in my name;
13. Nor let my prophets be afraid,
14. Though Greeks reproach, and Jews blaspheme.

15. "Teach all the nations my commands,
16. I'm with you till the world shall end;
17. All power is trusted to my hands,
18. I can destroy, and I defend."

19. He spake, and light shone round his head
20. On a bright cloud to heav'n he rode;
21. They to the farthest nations spread
22. The grace of their ascended God.
