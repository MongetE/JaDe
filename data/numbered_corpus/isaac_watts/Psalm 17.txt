1. v.13-
2. S. M.
3. Portion of saints and sinners.

4. Arise, my gracious God,
5. And make the wicked flee;
6. They are but thy chastising rod,
7. To drive thy saints to thee.

8. Behold, the sinner dies,
9. His haughty words are vain;
10. Here in this life his pleasure lies,
11. And all beyond is pain.

12. Then let his pride advance,
13. And boast of all his store;
14. The Lord is my inheritance,
15. My soul can wish no more.

16. I shall behold the face
17. Of my forgiving God;
18. And stand complete in righteousness,
19. Washed in my Savior's blood.

20. There's a new heav'n begun,
21. When I awake from death,
22. Dressed in the likeness of thy Son,
23. And draw immortal breath.
