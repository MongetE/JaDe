1. The Divine Perfections.

2. Great God! thy glories shall employ
3. My holy fear, my humble joy;
4. My lips in songs of honor bring
5. Their tribute to th' eternal King.

6. [Earth, and the stars, and worlds unknown,
7. Depend precarious on his throne;
8. All nature hangs upon his word,
9. And grace and glory own their Lord.]

10. [His sovereign power what mortal knows?
11. If be command, who dares oppose?
12. With strength he girds himself around,
13. And treads the rebels to the ground.]

14. [Who shall pretend to teach him skill,
15. Or guide the counsels of his will?
16. His wisdom, like a sea divine,
17. Flows deep and high beyond our line.]

18. [His name is holy, and his eye
19. Burns with immortal jealousy
20. He hates the sons of pride, and sheds
21. His fiery vengeance on their heads.]

22. [The beaming of his piercing sight
23. Bring dark hypocrisy to light;
24. Death and destruction naked lie,
25. And hell uncovered to his eye.]

26. [Th' eternal law before him stands;
27. His justice, with impartial hands,
28. Divides to all their due reward,
29. Or by the sceptre or the sword.]

30. [His mercy, like a boundless sea,
31. Washes our load of guilt away;
32. While his own Son came down and died
33. T' engage his justice on our side.]

34. [Each of his words demands my faith;
35. My soul can rest on all he saith;
36. His truth inviolably keeps
37. The largest promise of his lips.]

38. O tell me, with a gentle voice,
39. "Thou art my God," and I'll rejoice!
40. Filled with thy love, I dare proclaim
41. The brightest honors of thy name.
