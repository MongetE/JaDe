1. v.1-9
2. C. M.
3. Prayer and faith of persecuted saints.

4. Now plead my cause, Almighty God,
5. With all the sons of strife;
6. And fight against the men of blood,
7. Who fight against my life.

8. Draw out thy spear and stop their way,
9. Lift thine avenging rod;
10. But to my soul in mercy say,
11. "I am thy Savior God!"

12. They plant their snares to catch my feet,
13. And nets of mischief spread;
14. Plunge the destroyers in the pit
15. That their own hands have made.

16. Let fogs and darkness hide their way,
17. And slipp'ry be their ground;
18. Thy wrath shall make their lives a prey,
19. And all their rage confound.

20. They fly like chaff before the wind,
21. Before thine angry breath;
22. The angel of the Lord behind
23. Pursues them down to death.

24. They love the road that leads to hell;
25. Then let the rebels die,
26. Whose malice is implacable
27. Against the Lord on high.

28. But if thou hast a chosen few
29. Amongst that impious race,
30. Divide them from the bloody crew,
31. By thy surprising grace.

32. Then will I raise my tuneful voice,
33. To make thy wonders known;
34. In their salvation I'll rejoice,
35. And bless thee for my own.
