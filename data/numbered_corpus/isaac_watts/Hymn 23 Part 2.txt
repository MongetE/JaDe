1. A hopeful youth falling short of heaven.

2. Mark 10:21.

3. Must all the charms of nature, then,
4. So hopeless to salvation prove?
5. Can hell demand, can heav'n condemn,
6. The man whom Jesus deigns to love?

7. The man who sought the ways of truth,
8. Paid friends and neighbors all their due;
9. A modest, sober, lovely youth,
10. And thought he wanted nothing new.

11. But mark the change; thus spake the Lord-
12. "Come, part with earth for heav'n today:"
13. The youth, astonished at the word,
14. In silent sadness went his way.

15. Poor virtues that he boasted so,
16. This test unable to endure;
17. Let Christ, and grace, and glory go,
18. To make his land and money sure!

19. Ah, foolish choice of treasures here!
20. Ah, fatal love of tempting gold!
21. Must this base world be bought so dear?
22. Are life and heav'n so cheaply sold?

23. In vain the charms of nature shine,
24. If this vile passion govern me:
25. Transform my soul, O love divine!
26. And make me part with all for thee.
