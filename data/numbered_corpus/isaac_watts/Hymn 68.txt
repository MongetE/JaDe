1. The banquet of love.

2. SS 2:1-4,6,7.

3. Behold the Rose of Sharon here,
4. The Lily which the valleys bear;
5. Behold the Tree of Life, that gives
6. Refreshing fruit and healing leaves.

7. Amongst the thorns so lilies shine;
8. Amongst wild gourds the noble vine;
9. So in mine eyes my Savior proves,
10. Amidst a thousand meaner loves.

11. Beneath his cooling shade I sat,
12. To shield me from the burning heat;
13. Of heav'ly fruit he spreads a feast,
14. To feed mine eyes and please my taste.

15. [Kindly he brought me to the place
16. Where stands the banquet of his grace;
17. He saw me faint, and o'er my head
18. The banner of his love he spread.

19. With living bread and gen'rous wine,
20. He cheers this sinking heart of mine;
21. And op'ning his own heart to me,
22. He shows his thoughts how kind they be.]

23. O never let my Lord depart;
24. Lie down, and rest upon my heart;
25. I charge my sins not once to move,
26. Nor stir, nor wake, nor grieve my Love.
