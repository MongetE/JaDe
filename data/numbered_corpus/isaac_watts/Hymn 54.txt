1. Electing grace; or, Saints beloved in Christ.

2. Eph. 1:3ff.

3. Jesus, we bless thy Father's name;
4. Thy God and ours are both the same;
5. What heav'nly blessings from his throne
6. Flow down to sinners through his Son!

7. "Christ be my first elect," he said,
8. Then chose our souls in Christ our head,
9. Before he gave the mountains birth,
10. Or laid foundations for the earth.

11. Thus did eternal love begin
12. To raise us up from death and sin;
13. Our characters were then decreed,
14. "Blameless in love, a holy seed."

15. Predestinated to be sons,
16. Born by degrees, but chose at once,
17. A new regenerated race,
18. To praise the glory of his grace.

19. With Christ our Lord we share our part
20. In the affections of his heart;
21. Nor shall our souls be thence removed,
22. Till he forgets his first-beloved.
