1. Hope of heaven by the resurrection of Christ.

2. 1 Pet. 1:3-5.

3. Blest be the everlasting God,
4. The Father of our Lord;
5. Be his abounding mercy praised,
6. His majesty adored.

7. When from the dead he raised his Son,
8. And called him to the sky,
9. He gave our souls a lively hope
10. That they should never die.

11. What though our inbred sins require
12. Our flesh to see the dust,
13. Yet as the Lord our Savior rose,
14. So all his followers must.

15. There's an inheritance divine
16. Reserved against that day;
17. 'Tis uncorrupted, undefiled,
18. And cannot waste away.

19. Saints by the power of God are kept
20. Till the salvation come;
21. We walk by faith as strangers here,
22. Till Christ shall call us home.
