1. God dwells with the humble and penitent.

2. Isa. 47:15,16.

3. Thus saith the high and lofty One:
4. "I sit upon my holy throne;
5. My name is God, I dwell on high,
6. Dwell in my own eternity.

7. "But I descend to worlds below,
8. On earth I have a mansion too;
9. The humble spirit and contrite
10. Is an abode of my delight.

11. "The humble soul my words revive,
12. I bid the mourning sinner live,
13. Heal all the broken hearts I find,
14. And ease the sorrows of the mind.

15. ["When I contend against their sin,
16. I make them know how vile they've been;
17. But should my wrath for ever smoke,
18. Their souls would sink beneath my stroke."]

19. O may thy pard'ning grace be nigh,
20. Lest we should faint, despair, and die!
21. Thus shall our better thoughts approve
22. The methods of thy chast'ning love.
