1. v.5-
2. L. M.
3. Christ our sacrifice.

4. The wonders, Lord, thy love has wrought,
5. Exceed our praise, surmount our thought;
6. Should I attempt the long detail,
7. My speech would faint, my numbers fail,

8. No blood of beasts on altars spilt
9. Can cleanse the souls of men from guilt;
10. But thou hast set before our eyes
11. An all-sufficient sacrifice.

12. Lo! thine eternal Son appears,
13. To thy designs he bows his ears,
14. Assumes a body well prepared,
15. And well performs a work so hard.

16. "Behold, I come," the Savior cries,
17. With love and duty in his eyes,
18. "I come to bear the heavy load
19. Of sins, and do thy will, my God.

20. "'Tis written in thy great decree,
21. 'Tis in thy book foretold of me,
22. I must fulfil the Savior's part;
23. And lo! thy law is in my heart!

24. "I'll magnify thy holy law,
25. And rebels to obedience draw,
26. When on my cross I'm lifted high,
27. Or to my crown above the sky.

28. "The Spirit shall descend and show
29. What thou hast done, and what I do
30. The wond'ring world shall learn thy grace,
31. Thy wisdom, and thy righteousness."
