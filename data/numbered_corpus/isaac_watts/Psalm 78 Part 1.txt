1. Providences of God recorded.

2. Let children hear the mighty deeds
3. Which God performed of old,
4. Which in our younger years we saw,
5. And which our fathers told.

6. He bids us make his glories known,
7. His works of power and grace;
8. And we'll convey his wonders down
9. Through every rising race.

10. Our lips shall tell them to our sons,
11. And they again to theirs;
12. That generations yet unborn
13. May teach them to their heirs.

14. Thus shall they learn in God alone
15. Their hope securely stands;
16. That they may ne'er forget his works,
17. But practise his commands.
