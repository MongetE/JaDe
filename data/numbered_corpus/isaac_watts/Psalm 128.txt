1. Family blessings.

2. O happy man, whose soul is filled
3. With zeal and reverent awe!
4. His lips to God their honors yield,
5. His life adorns the law.

6. A careful providence shall stand
7. And ever guard thy head,
8. Shall on the labors of thy hand
9. Its kindly blessings shed.

10. [Thy wife shall be a fruitful vine;
11. Thy children round thy board,
12. Each like a plant of honor shine,
13. And learn to fear the Lord.]

14. The Lord shall thy best hopes fulfil
15. For months and years to come;
16. The Lord, who dwells on Zion's hill,
17. Shall send thee blessings home.

18. This is the man whose happy eyes
19. Shall see his house increase;
20. Shall see the sinking church arise,
21. Then leave the world in peace.
