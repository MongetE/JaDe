1. Christ dying, rising, interceding, and reigning.

2. Acts 4:24, etc.

3. [Maker and sovereign Lord
4. Of heav'n, and earth, and seas,
5. Thy providence confirms thy word,
6. And answers thy decrees.

7. The things so long foretold
8. By David are fulfilled,
9. When Jews and Gentiles joined to slay
10. Jesus, thine holy child.]

11. Why did the Gentiles rage,
12. And Jews, with one accord,
13. Bend all their counsels to destroy
14. Th' Anointed of the Lord?

15. Rulers and kings agree
16. To form a vain design;
17. Against the Lord their powers unite,
18. Against his Christ they join.

19. The Lord derides their rage,
20. And will support his throne;
21. He that hath raised him from the dead
22. Hath owned him for his Son.

23. PAUSE.

24. Now he's ascended high,
25. And asks to rule the earth
26. The merit of his blood he pleads,
27. And pleads his heav'nly birth.

28. He asks, and God bestows
29. A large inheritance;
30. Far as the world's remotest ends
31. His kingdom shall advance.

32. The nations that rebel
33. Must feel his iron rod;
34. He'll vindicate those honors well
35. Which he received from God.

36. [Be wise, ye rulers, now,
37. And worship at his throne;
38. With trembling joy, ye people, bow
39. To God's exalted Son.

40. If once his wrath arise,
41. Ye perish on the place;
42. Then blessed is the soul that flies
43. For refuge to his grace.]
