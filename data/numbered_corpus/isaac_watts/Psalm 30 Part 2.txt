1. v.6
2. L. M.
3. Health, sickness, and recovery.

4. Firm was my health, my day was bright,
5. And I presumed 'twould ne'er be night;
6. Fondly I said within my heart,
7. "Pleasure and peace shall ne'er depart."

8. But I forgot thine arm was strong
9. Which made my mountain stand so long:
10. Soon as thy face began to hide,
11. My health was gone, my comforts died.

12. I cried aloud to thee, my God,
13. "What canst thou profit by my blood?
14. Deep in the dust can I declare
15. Thy truth, or sing thy goodness there?

16. "Hear me, O God of grace," I said,
17. "And bring me from among the dead:"
18. Thy word rebuked the pains I felt,
19. Thy pard'ning love removed my guilt.

20. My groans, and tears, and forms of woe
21. Are turned to joy and praises now;
22. I throw my sackcloth on the ground,
23. And ease and gladness gird me round

24. My tongue, the glory of my frame,
25. Shall ne'er be silent of thy name;
26. Thy praise shall sound through earth and heav'n
27. For sickness healed and sins forgiv'n.
