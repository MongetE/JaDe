1. v.12ff
2. C. M.
3. Vows made in trouble paid in the church.

4. What shall I render to my God
5. For all his kindness shown?
6. My feet shall visit thine abode,
7. My songs address thy throne.

8. Among the saints that fill thine house
9. My off'rings shall be paid;
10. There shall my zeal perform the vows
11. My soul in anguish made.

12. How much is mercy thy delight,
13. Thou ever-blessed God!
14. How dear thy servants in thy sight!
15. How precious is their blood!

16. How happy all thy servants are!
17. How great thy grace to me!
18. My life, which thou hast made thy care,
19. Lord, I devote to thee.

20. Now I am thine, for ever thine,
21. Nor shall my purpose move
22. Thy hand hath loosed my bonds of pain,
23. And bound me with thy love.

24. Here in thy courts I leave my vow,
25. And thy rich grace record;
26. Witness, ye saints, who hear me now,
27. If I forsake the Lord.
