1. The blessedness of saints, and misery of sinners.

2. ver. 1-3

3. Blest are the undefiled in heart,
4. Whose ways are right and clean;
5. Who never from thy law depart,
6. But fly from every sin.

7. Blest are the men that keep thy word,
8. And practise thy commands;
9. With their whole heart they seek the Lord,
10. And serve thee with their hands.

11. ver.

12. Great is their peace who love thy law;
13. How firm their souls abide!
14. Nor can a bold temptation draw
15. Their steady feet aside.

16. ver. 6

17. Then shall my heart have inward joy,
18. And keep my face from shame,
19. When all thy statutes I obey,
20. And honor all thy name.

21. ver. 21,

22. But haughty sinners God will hate,
23. The proud shall die accursed;
24. The sons of falsehood and deceit
25. Are trodden to the dust.

26. ver. 119,

27. Vile as the dross the wicked are;
28. And those that leave thy ways
29. Shall see salvation from afar,
30. But never taste thy grace.
