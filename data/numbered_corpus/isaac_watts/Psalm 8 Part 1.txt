5. Through the wide earth thy name is spread;
6. And thine eternal glories rise
7. O'er all the heav'ns thy hands have made.

9. A monument of honor raise;
10. And babes, with uninstructed tongue,
11. Declare the wonders of thy praise.

13. To bring proud rebels to the ground,
14. To still the bold blasphemer's rage,
15. And all their policies confound.

16. Children amidst thy temple throng
17. To see their great Redeemer's face;
18. The Son of David is their song,
19. And young hosannas fill the place.

21. In vain their impious cavils bring;
22. Revenge sits silent in their breasts,
23. While Jewish babes proclaim their King.
