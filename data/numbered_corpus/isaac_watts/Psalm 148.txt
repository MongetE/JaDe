1. Proper Metre.
2. Praise to God from all creatures.

3. Ye tribes of Adam, join
4. With heav'n, and earth, and seas,
5. And offer notes divine
6. To your Creator's praise:
7. Ye holy throng
8. Of angels bright,
9. In worlds of light,
10. Begin the song.

11. Thou sun with dazzling rays,
12. And moon that rules the night,
13. Shine to your Maker's praise,
14. With stars of twinkling light:
15. His power declare,
16. Ye floods on high,
17. And clouds that fly
18. In empty air.

19. The shining worlds above
20. In glorious order stand,
21. Or in swift courses move,
22. By his supreme command:
23. He spake the word,
24. And all their frame
25. From nothing came,
26. To praise the Lord.

27. He moved their mighty wheels
28. In unknown ages past,
29. And each his word fulfils
30. While time and nature last:
31. In diff'rent ways
32. His works proclaim
33. His wondrous name,
34. And speak his praise.

35. PAUSE.

36. Let all the earth-born race,
37. And monsters of the deep
38. The fish that cleave the seas,
39. Or in their bosom sleep;
40. From sea and shore
41. Their tribute pay,
42. And still display
43. Their Maker's power.

44. Ye vapors, hail, and snow,
45. Praise ye th' almighty Lord,
46. And stormy winds that blow,
47. To execute his word:
48. When lightnings shine,
49. Or thunders roar,
50. Let earth adore
51. His hand divine.

52. Ye mountains near the skies,
53. With lofty cedars there,
54. And trees of humbler size,
55. That fruit in plenty bear;
56. Beasts wild and tame,
57. Birds, flies, and worms,
58. In various forms,
59. Exalt his name.

60. Ye kings and judges, fear
61. The Lord, the sovereign King;
62. And while you rule us here,
63. His heav'nly honors sing;
64. Nor let the dream
65. Of power and state
66. Make you forget
67. His power supreme.

68. Virgins and youths, engage
69. To sound his praise divine,
70. While infancy and age
71. Their feebler voices join:
72. Wide as he reigns
73. His name be sung
74. By every tongue
75. In endless strains.

76. Let all the nations fear
77. The God that rules above;
78. He brings his people near,
79. And makes them taste his love:
80. While earth and sky
81. Attempt his praise,
82. His saints shall raise
83. His honors high.
