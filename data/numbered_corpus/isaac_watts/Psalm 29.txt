1. Storm and thunder.

2. Give to the Lord, ye sons of fame,
3. Give to {he Lord renown and power,
4. Ascribe due honors to his name,
5. And his eternal might adore.

6. The Lord proclaims his power aloud
7. Over the ocean and the land;
8. His voice divides the wat'ry cloud,
9. And lightnings blaze at his command.

10. He speaks, and tempest, hail, and wind,
11. Lay the wide forest bare around:
12. The fearful hart and frighted hind
13. Leap at the terror of the sound.

14. To Lebanon he turns his voice,
15. And lo, the stately cedars break;
16. The mountains tremble at the noise,
17. The valleys roar, the deserts quake.

18. The Lord sits sovereign on the flood,
19. The Thund'rer reigns for ever king;
20. But makes his church his blest abode,
21. Where we his awful glories sing.

22. In gentler language there, the Lord
23. The counsels of his grace imparts;
24. Amidst the raging storm, his word
25. Speaks peace and courage to our hearts.
