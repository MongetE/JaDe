1. A guilty conscience eased by confession and pardon.

2. While I keep silence, and conceal
3. My heavy guilt within my heart,
4. What torments doth my conscience feel!
5. What agonies of inward smart!

6. I spread my sins before the Lord,
7. And all my secret faults confess;
8. Thy gospel speaks a pard'ning word,
9. Thine Holy Spirit seals the grace.

10. For this shall every humble soul
11. Make swift addresses to thy seat;
12. When floods of huge temptations roll,
13. There shall they find a bless'd retreat.

14. How safe beneath thy wings I lie,
15. When days grow dark and storms appear;
16. And when I walk, thy watchful eye
17. Shall guide me safe from every snare.
