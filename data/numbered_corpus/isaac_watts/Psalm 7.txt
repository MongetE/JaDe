1. God's care of his people.

2. My trust is in my heav'nly Friend,
3. My hope in thee, my God;
4. Rise, and my helpless life defend
5. From those that seek my blood.

6. With insolence and fury they
7. My soul in pieces tear,
8. As hungry lions rend the prey,
9. When no deliverer's near.

10. If I had e'er provoked them first,
11. Or once abused my foe,
12. Then let him tread my life to dust,
13. And lay mine honor low.

14. If there be malice found in me,
15. I know thy piercing eyes;
16. I should not dare appeal to thee,
17. Nor ask my God to rise.

18. Arise, my God, lift up thy hand,
19. Their pride and power control;
20. Awake to judgment, and command
21. Deliverance for my soul.

22. PAUSE.

23. [Let sinners, and their wicked rage,
24. Be humbled to the dust;
25. Shall not the God of truth engage
26. To vindicate the just?

27. He knows the heart, he tries the reins,
28. He will defend th' upright
29. His sharpest arrows he ordains
30. Against the sons of spite.

31. For me their malice digged a pit,
32. But there themselves are cast;
33. My God makes all their mischief light
34. On their own heads at last.]

35. That cruel, persecuting race
36. Must feel his dreadful sword:
37. Awake, my soul, and praise the grace
38. And justice of the Lord.
