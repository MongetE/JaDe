1. The triumph of faith or, Christ's unchangeable love.

2. Rom. 8:33ff.

3. Who shall the Lord's elect condemn?
4. 'Tis God that justifies their souls;
5. And mercy, like a mighty stream,
6. O'er all their sins divinely rolls.

7. Who shall adjudge the saints to hell?
8. 'Tis Christ that suffered in their stead;
9. And, the salvation to fulfil,
10. Behold him rising from the dead!

11. He lives! he lives and sits above,
12. For ever interceding there:
13. Who shall divide us from his love?
14. Or what should tempt us to despair?

15. Shall persecution, or distress,
16. Famine, or sword, or nakedness?
17. He that hath loved us bears us through,
18. And makes us more than conquerors too.

19. Faith hath an overcoming power;
20. It triumphs in the dying hour:
21. Christ is our life, our joy, our hope,
22. Nor can we sink with such a prop.

23. Not all that men on earth can do,
24. Nor powers on high, nor powers below,
25. Shall cause his mercy to remove,
26. Or wean our hearts from Christ our love.
