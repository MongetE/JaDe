1. Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.

2. Rev. 14:13.

3. Hear what the voice from heav'n proclaims,
4. For all the pious dead;
5. Sweet is the savor of their names,
6. And soft their sleeping bed.

7. They die in Jesus, and are blest;
8. How kind their slumbers are!
9. From suff'rings and from sins released,
10. And freed from every snare.

11. Far from this world of toil and strife,
12. They're present with the Lord;
13. The labors of their mortal life
14. End in a large reward.
