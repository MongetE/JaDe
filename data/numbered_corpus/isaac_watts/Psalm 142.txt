1. God is the hope of the helpless.

2. To God I made my sorrows known,
3. From God I sought relief;
4. In long complaints before his throne
5. I poured out all my grief.

6. My soul was overwhelmed with woes,
7. My heart began to break;
8. My God, who all my burden knows,
9. He knows the way I take.

10. On every side I cast mine eye,
11. And found my helpers gone;
12. While friends and strangers passed me by,
13. Neglected or unknown.

14. Then did I raise a louder cry,
15. And called thy mercy near,-
16. "Thou art my portion when I die;
17. Be thou my refuge here."

18. Lord, I am brought exceeding low,
19. Now let thine ear attend,
20. And make my foes who vex me know
21. I've an almighty Friend.

22. From my sad prison set me free,
23. Then shall I praise thy name,
24. And holy men shall join with me
25. Thy kindness to proclaim.
