1. Hosannah to Christ.

2. Mt. 21:9; Luke 19:38,40.

3. Hosannah to the royal Son
4. Of David's ancient line!
5. His natures two, his person one,
6. Mysterious and divine.

7. The root of David here, we find,
8. And offspring is the same:
9. Eternity and time are joined
10. In our Immanuel's name.

11. Blest he that comes to wretched men
12. With peaceful news from heav'n!
13. Hosannah's of the highest strain
14. To Christ the Lord be giv'n!

15. Let mortals ne'er refuse to take
16. Th' hosannah on their tongues,
17. Lest rocks and stones should rise and break
18. Their silence into songs.
