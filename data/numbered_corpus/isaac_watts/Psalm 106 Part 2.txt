1. v.7,8,12ff
2. S. M.
3. Israel punished and pardoned; or, God's unchangeable love.

4. God of eternal love,
5. How fickle are our ways!
6. And yet how oft did Isr'el prove
7. Thy constancy of grace!

8. They saw thy wonders wrought,
9. And then thy praise they sung;
10. But soon thy works of power forgot,
11. And murmured with their tongue.

12. Now they believe his word
13. While rocks with rivers flow;
14. Now with their lusts provoke the Lord,
15. And he reduced them low.

16. Yet when they mourned their faults,
17. He hearkened to their groans,
18. Brought his own cov'nant to his thoughts,
19. And called them still his sons.

20. Their names were in his book,
21. He saved them from their foes
22. Oft he chastised, but ne'er forsook
23. The people that he chose.

24. Let Isr'el bless the Lord,
25. Who loved their ancient race
26. And Christians join the solemn word,
27. Amen, to all the praise.
