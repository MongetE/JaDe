2. Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord,
3. This work belongs to you;
4. Sing of his name, his ways, his word,
5. How holy, just, and true!

6. His mercy and his righteousness
7. Let heav'n and earth proclaim;
8. His works of nature and of grace
9. Reveal his wondrous name.

10. His wisdom and almighty word
11. The heav'nly arches spread,
12. And by the Spirit of the Lord
13. Their shining hosts were made.

14. He bid the liquid waters flow
15. To their appointed deep;
16. The flowing seas their limits know,
17. And their own station keep).

18. Ye tenants of the spacious earth,
19. With fear before him stand
20. He spake, and nature took its birth,
21. And rests on his command.

22. He scorns the angry nations' rage,
23. And breaks their vain designs;
24. His counsel stands through every age,
25. And in full glory shines.
