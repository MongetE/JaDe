1. Baptism.

2. Matt. 28:19; Acts 2:38.

3. 'Twas the commission of our Lord,
4. "Go teach the nations, and baptize:"
5. The nations have received the word
6. Since he ascended to the skies.

7. He sits upon th' eternal hills,
8. With grace and pardon in his hands;
9. And sends his cov'nant with the seals,
10. To bless the distant British lands.

11. "Repent, and be baptized," he saith,
12. For the remission of your sins:"
13. And thus our sense assists our faith,
14. And shows us what his gospel means.

15. Our souls he washes in his blood,
16. As water makes the body clean;
17. And the good Spirit from our God
18. Descends like purifying rain.

19. Thus we engage ourselves to thee,
20. And seal our cov'nant with the Lord;
21. O may the great eternal Three
22. In heav'n our solemn vows record!
