1. The glory of Christ, and power of his gospel.

2. Now be my heart inspired to sing
3. The glories of my Savior King,
4. Jesus the Lord; how heav'nly fair
5. His form! how bright his beauties are!

6. O'er all the sons of human race
7. He shines with a superior grace;
8. Love from his lips divinely flows,
9. And blessings all his state compose.

10. Dress thee in arms, most mighty Lord,
11. Gird on the terror of thy sword,
12. In majesty and glory ride,
13. With truth and meekness at thy side.

14. Thine anger, like a pointed dart,
15. Shall pierce the foes of stubborn heart;
16. Or words of mercy, kind and sweet,
17. Shall melt the rebels at thy feet.

18. Thy throne, O God, for ever stands,
19. Grace is the sceptre in thy hands;
20. Thy laws and works are just and right,
21. Justice and grace are thy delight.

22. God, thine own God, has richly shed
23. His oil of gladness on thy head,
24. And with his sacred Spirit blest
25. His first-born Son above the rest.
