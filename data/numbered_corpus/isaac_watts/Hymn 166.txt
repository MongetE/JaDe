1. The Divine Perfections.

2. How shall I praise th' eternal God,
3. That infinite Unknown?
4. Who can ascend his high abode,
5. Or venture near his throne?

6. [The great Invisible! he dwells
7. Concealed in dazzling light;
8. But his all-searching eye reveals
9. The secrets of the night.

10. Those watchful eyes that never sleep
11. Survey the world around
12. His wisdom is a boundless deep
13. Where all our thoughts are drowned.]

14. [Speak we of strength? his arm is strong
15. To save or to destroy;
16. Infinite years his life prolong,
17. And endless is his joy.]

18. [He knows no shadow of a change
19. Nor alters his decrees;
20. Firm as a rock his truth remains
21. To guard his promises.]

22. [Sinners before his presence die;
23. How holy is his name!
24. His anger and his jealousy
25. Burn like devouring flame.]

26. Justice upon a dreadful throne
27. Maintains the rights of God;
28. While Mercy sends her pardons down,
29. Bought with a Savior's blood.

30. Now to my soul, immortal King!
31. Speak some forgiving word;
32. Then 'twill be double joy to sing
33. The glories of my Lord.
