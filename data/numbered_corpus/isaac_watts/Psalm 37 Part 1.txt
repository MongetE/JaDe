1. v.1-
2. C. M.
3. The cure of envy, fretfulness, and unbelief.

4. Why should I vex my soul, and fret
5. To see the wicked rise?
6. Or envy sinners waxing great
7. By violence and lies?

8. As flowery grass, cut down at noon,
9. Before the ev'ning fades,
10. So shall their glories vanish soon
11. In everlasting shades.

12. Then let me make the Lord my trust,
13. And practise all that's good;
14. So shall I dwell among the just,
15. And he'll provide me food.

16. I to my God my ways commit,
17. And cheerful wait his will;
18. Thy hand, which guides my doubtful feet,
19. Shall my desires fulfil.

20. Mine innocence shalt thou display,
21. And make thy judgments known,
22. Fair as the light of dawning day,
23. And glorious as the noon.

24. The meek at last the earth possess,
25. And are the heirs of heav'n;
26. True riches, with abundant peace,
27. To humble souls are giv'n.

28. PAUSE.

29. Rest in the Lord, and keep his way,
30. Nor let your anger rise,
31. Though Providence should long delay
32. To punish haughty vice.

33. Let sinners join to break your peace,
34. And plot, and rage, and foam;
35. The Lord derides them, for he sees
36. Their day of vengeance come.

37. They have drawn out the threat'ning sword,
38. Have bent the murd'rous bow,
39. To slay the men that fear the Lord,
40. And bring the righteous low.

41. My God shall break their bows, and burn
42. Their persecuting darts,
43. Shall their own swords against them turn,
44. And pain surprise their hearts.
