1. Saints in the hands of Christ

2. Jn. 10:28,29.

3. Firm as the earth thy gospel stands,
4. My Lord, my hope, my trust;
5. If I am found in Jesus' hands,
6. My soul can ne'er be lost.

7. His honor is engaged to save
8. The meanest of his sheep;
9. All that his heav'nly Father gave
10. His hands securely keep.

11. Nor death nor hell shall e'er remove
12. His favorites from his breast;
13. In the dear bosom of his love
14. They must for ever rest.
