2. Among th' assemblies of the great
3. A greater Ruler takes his seat;
4. The God of heav'n, as Judge, surveys
5. Those gods on earth, and all their ways.

6. Why will ye, then, frame wicked laws?
7. Or why support th' unrighteous cause?
8. When will ye once defend the poor,
9. That sinners vex the saints no more?

11. Dark are the ways in which they go;
12. Their name of earthly gods is vain,
13. For they shall fall and die like men.

15. Possess his universal throne,
16. And rule the nations with his rod;
17. He is our Judge, and he our God.
