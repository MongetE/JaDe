1. Victory over death.

2. 1 Cor. 15:55ff

3. O for an overcoming faith
4. To cheer my dying hours;
5. To triumph o'er the monster Death,
6. And all his frightful powers!

7. Joyful with all the strength I have
8. My quiv'ring lips should sing-
9. Where is thy boasted vict'ry, Grave?
10. And where the monster's sting?

11. If sin be pardoned, I'm secure,
12. Death hath no sting beside;
13. The law gives sin its damning power;
14. But Christ, my ransom, died.

15. Now to the God of victory
16. Immortal thanks be paid,
17. Who makes us conquerors while we die,
18. Through Christ our living head.
