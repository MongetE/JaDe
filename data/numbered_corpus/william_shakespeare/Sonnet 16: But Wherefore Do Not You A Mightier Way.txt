1. But wherefore do not you a mightier way
2. Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time,
3. And fortify your self in your decay
4. With means more bless√®d than my barren rhyme?
5. Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
6. And many maiden gardens yet unset,
7. With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
8. Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
9. So should the lines of life that life repair
10. Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen
11. Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
12. Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
13. To give away your self keeps your self still,
14. And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
