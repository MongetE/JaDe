1. If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
2. Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,
3. And will thy soul knows is admitted there;
4. Thus far for love, my love suit, sweet, fulfil.
5. Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
6. Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
7. In things of great receipt with case we prove
8. Among a number one is reckoned none.
9. Then in the number let me pass untold,
10. Though in thy store's account I one must be;
11. For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
12. That nothing me, a something, sweet, to thee.
13. Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
14. And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
