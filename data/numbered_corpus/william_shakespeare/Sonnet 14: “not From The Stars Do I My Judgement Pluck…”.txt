1. Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
2. And yet methinks I have astronomy,
3. But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
4. Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
5. Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
6. Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
7. Or say with princes if it shall go well
8. By oft predict that I in heaven find.
9. But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
10. And constant stars in them I read such art
11. As truth and beauty shall together thrive
12. If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:
13. Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
14. Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
