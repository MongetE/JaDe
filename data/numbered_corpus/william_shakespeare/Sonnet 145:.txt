1. Those lips that Love's own hand did make
2. Breath'd forth the sound that said I hate
3. To me that languish'd for her sake:
4. But when she saw my woeful state,
5. Straight in her heart did mercy come.
6. Chiding that tongue, that ever sweet
7. Was used in giving gentle doom:
8. And taught it thus anew to greet:
9. 'I hate' she alter'd with an end
10. That follow'd it as gentle day
11. Doth follow night, who like a fiend
12. From heaven to hell is flown away.
13. 'I hate' from hate away she threw,
14. And sav'd my life, saying 'not you'
