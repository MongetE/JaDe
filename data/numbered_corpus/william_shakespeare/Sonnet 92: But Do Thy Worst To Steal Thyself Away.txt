1. But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
2. For term of life thou art assured mine;
3. And life no longer than thy love will stay,
4. For it depends upon that love of thine.
5. Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
6. When in the least of them my life hath end.
7. I see a better state to me belongs
8. Than that which on thy humour doth depend:
9. Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
10. Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
11. O what a happy title do I find,
12. Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
13. But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
14. Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
