1. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
2. Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
3. Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
4. Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
5. What power is it which mounts my love so high,
6. That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
7. The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
8. To join like likes and kiss like native things.
9. Impossible be strange attempts to those
10. That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
11. What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
12. To show her merit that did miss her love?
