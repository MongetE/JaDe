1. THY bosom is endeared with all hearts
2. Which I, by lacking, have supposed dead:
3. And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,
4. And all those friends which I thought buried.
5. How many a holy and obsequious tear
6. Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
7. As interest of the dead!--which now appear
8. But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
9. Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
10. Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
11. Who all their parts of me to thee did give:
12. --That due of many now is thine alone:
13. Their images I loved I view in thee,
14. And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.

15. WHAT is your substance, whereof are you made,
16. That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
17. Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
18. And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
19. Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
20. Is poorly imitated after you;
21. On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
22. And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
23. Speak of the spring and foison of the year,
24. The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
25. The other as your bounty doth appear;
26. And you in every blessed shape we know.
27. In all external grace you have some part,
28. But you like none, none you, for constant heart.
