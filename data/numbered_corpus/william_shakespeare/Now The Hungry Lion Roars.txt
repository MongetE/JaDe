1. From "A Midsummer-Night's Dream," Act V. Scene 2

2. PUCK sings:
3. NOW the hungry lion roars,
4. And the wolf behowls the moon;
5. Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
6. All with weary task fordone.
7. Now the wasted brands do glow,
8. Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
9. Puts the wretch that lies in woe
10. In remembrance of a shroud.
11. Now it is the time of night,
12. That the graves, all gaping wide,
13. Every one lets forth his sprite,
14. In the churchway paths to glide:
15. And we fairies, that do run
16. By the triple Hecate's team,
17. From the presence of the sun,
18. Following darkness like a dream,
19. Now are frolic; not a mouse
20. Shall disturb this hallowed house:
21. I am sent with broom before
22. To sweep the dust behind the door.
