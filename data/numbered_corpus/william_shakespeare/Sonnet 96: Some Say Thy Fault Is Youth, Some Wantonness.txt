2. Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
3. Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
4. Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.
5. As on the finger of a thron√®d queen,
6. The basest jewel will be well esteemed.
7. So are those errors that in thee are seen

9. How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,

12. if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
13. But do not so; I love thee in such sort
14. As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
