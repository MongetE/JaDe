1. SHALL I compare thee to a Summer's day?
2. Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
3. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
4. And Summer's lease hath all too short a date:
5. Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
6. And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
7. And every fair from fair sometime declines,
8. By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
9. But thy eternal Summer shall not fade
10. Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
11. Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,
12. When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
13. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
14. So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
