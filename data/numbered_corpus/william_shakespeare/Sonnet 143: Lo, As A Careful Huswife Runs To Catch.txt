1. Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch
2. One of her feathered creatures broke away,
3. Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
4. In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,
5. Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
6. Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
7. To follow that which flies before her face,
8. Not prizing her poor infant's discontent:
9. So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
10. Whilst I, thy babe, chase thee afar behind;
11. But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me,
12. And play the mother's part: kiss me, be kind.
13. So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
14. If thou turn back and my loud crying still.
