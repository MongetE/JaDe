1. Sweet love, renew thy force! Be it not said
2. Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
3. Which but today by feeding is allayed,
4. Tomorrow sharpened in his former might.
5. So, love, be thou, although today thou fill
6. Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
7. Tomorrow see again, and do not kill
8. The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
9. Let this sad interim like the ocean be
10. Which parts the shore where two contracted new
11. Come daily to the banks, that, when they see
12. Return of love, more blest may be the view;
13. As call it winter, which being full of care
14. Makes summer's welcome thrice more wished, more rare.
