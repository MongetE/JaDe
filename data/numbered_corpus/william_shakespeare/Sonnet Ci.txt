1. O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
2. For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
3. Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
4. So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
5. Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say
6. 'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
7. Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
8. But best is best, if never intermix'd?'
9. Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
10. Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
11. To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
12. And to be praised of ages yet to be.
13. Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
14. To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
