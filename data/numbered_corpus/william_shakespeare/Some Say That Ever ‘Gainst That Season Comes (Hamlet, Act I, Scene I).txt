1. Marcellus to Horatio and Bernardo, after seeing the Ghost,

2. Some say that ever â€˜gainst that season comes
3. Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
4. This bird of dawning singeth all night long;
5. And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
6. The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
7. No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
8. So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
