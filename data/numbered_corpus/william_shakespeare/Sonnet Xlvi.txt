1. Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
2. How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
3. Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
4. My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
5. My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--
6. A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
7. But the defendant doth that plea deny
8. And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
9. To 'cide this title is impanneled
10. A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
11. And by their verdict is determined
12. The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:
13. As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
14. And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.
