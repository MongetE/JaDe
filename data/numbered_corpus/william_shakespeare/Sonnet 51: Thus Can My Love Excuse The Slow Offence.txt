1. Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
2. Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed:
3. From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
4. Till I return, of posting is no need.
5. O, what excuse will my poor beast then find
6. When swift extremity can seem but slow?
7. Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
8. In wingèd speed no motion shall I know.
9. Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
10. Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,
11. Shall neigh—no dull flesh—in his fiery race.
12. But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:
13. Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,
14. Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
