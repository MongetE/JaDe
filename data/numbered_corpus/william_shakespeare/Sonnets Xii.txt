1. HOW like a Winter hath my absence been
2. From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
3. What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,
4. What old December's bareness everywhere!
5. And yet this time removed was summer's time;
6. The teeming Autumn, big with rich increase,
7. Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
8. Like widow'd wombs after their Lord's decease:
9. Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
10. But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
11. For Summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
12. And, thou away, the very birds are mute:
13. Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
14. That leaves look pale, dreading the Winter 's near.
