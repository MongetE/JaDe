1. If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
2. Injurious distance should not stop my way;
3. For then despite of space I would be brought,
4. From limits far remote, where thou dost stay.
5. No matter then although my foot did stand
6. Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
7. For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
8. As soon as think the place where he would be.
9. But, ah, thought kills me that I am not thought,
10. To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
11. But that, so much of earth and water wrought,
12. I must attend time's leisure with my moan,
13. Receiving nought by elements so slow,
14. But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
