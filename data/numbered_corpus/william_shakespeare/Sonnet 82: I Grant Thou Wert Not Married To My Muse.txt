1. I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
2. And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
3. The dedicated words which writers use
4. Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
5. Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
6. Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
7. And therefore art enforced to seek anew
8. Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
9. And do so, love, yet when they have devised
10. What strain√®d touches rhetoric can lend,
11. Thou, truly fair, wert truly sympathized
12. In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;
13. And their gross painting might be better used
14. Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.
