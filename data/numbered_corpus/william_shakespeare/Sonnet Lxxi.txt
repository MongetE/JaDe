1. No longer mourn for me when I am dead
2. Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
3. Give warning to the world that I am fled
4. From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
5. Nay, if you read this line, remember not
6. The hand that writ it; for I love you so
7. That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
8. If thinking on me then should make you woe.
9. O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
10. When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
11. Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
12. But let your love even with my life decay,
13. Lest the wise world should look into your moan
14. And mock you with me after I am gone.
