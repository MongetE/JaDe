1. Your love and pity doth the impression fill
2. Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
3. For what care I who calls me well or ill,
4. So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
5. You are my all the world, and I must strive
6. To know my shames and praises from your tongue:
7. None else to me, nor I to none alive,
8. That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
9. In so profound abysm I throw all care
10. Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
11. To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
12. Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
13. You are so strongly in my purpose bred
14. That all the world besides methinks are dead.
