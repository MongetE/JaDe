1. That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,
2. And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
3. That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
4. A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
5. Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:
6. Thou dost love her because thou know'st I love her,
7. And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
8. Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
9. If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
10. And, losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
11. Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
12. And both for my sake lay on me this cross.
13. But here's the joy: my friend and I are one,
14. Sweet flattery! Then she loves but me alone.
