1. ON a day--alack the day!--
2. Love, whose month is ever May,
3. Spied a blossom passing fair
4. Playing in the wanton air:
5. Through the velvet leaves the wind
6. All unseen 'gan passage find;
7. That the lover, sick to death,
8. Wish'd himself the heaven's breath.
9. Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
10. Air, would I might triumph so!
11. But, alack, my hand is sworn
12. Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn:
13. Vow, alack, for youth unmeet;
14. Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
15. Do not call it sin in me
16. That I am forsworn for thee;
17. Thou for whom e'en Jove would swear
18. Juno but an Ethiop were;
19. And deny himself for Jove,
20. Turning mortal for thy love.
