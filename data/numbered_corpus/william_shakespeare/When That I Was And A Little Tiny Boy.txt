1. When that I was and a little tiny boy,
2. With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
3. A foolish thing was but a toy,
4. For the rain it raineth every day.

5. But when I came to man's estate,
6. With hey, ho, . . .
7. 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
8. For the rain, . . .

9. But when I came, alas! to wive,
10. With hey, ho, . . .
11. By swaggering could I never thrive,
12. For the rain, . . .

13. But when I came unto my beds,
14. With hey, ho, . . .
15. With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
16. For the rain, . . .

17. A great while ago the world begun,
18. With hey, ho, . . .
19. But that's all one, our play is done.
20. And we'll strive to please you every day.
