1. The little Love-god lying once asleep
2. Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
3. Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
4. Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
5. The fairest votary took up that fire
6. Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
7. And so the general of hot desire
8. Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
9. This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
10. Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
11. Growing a bath and healthful remedy
12. For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
13. Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
14. Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
