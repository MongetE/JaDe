1. O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
2. The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
3. That did not better for my life provide
4. Than public means which public manners breeds.
5. Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
6. And almost thence my nature is subdu'd
7. To what it works in, like the dyer's hand.
8. Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
9. Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
10. Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;
11. No bitterness that I will bitter think,
12. Nor double penance, to correct correction.
13. Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye
14. Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
