1. Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
2. In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
3. Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
4. With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.
5. That use is not forbidden usury,
6. Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
7. That's for thyself to breed another thee,
8. Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
9. Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
10. If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
11. Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
12. Leaving thee living in posterity?
13. Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
14. To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
