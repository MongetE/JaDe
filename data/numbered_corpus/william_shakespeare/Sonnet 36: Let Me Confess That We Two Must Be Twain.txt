1. Let me confess that we two must be twain,
2. Although our undivided loves are one;
3. So shall those blots that do with me remain,
4. Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
5. In our two loves there is but one respect,
6. Though in our lives a separable spite,
7. Which, though it alter not love's sole effect,
8. Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
9. I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
10. Lest my bewail√®d guilt should do thee shame,
11. Nor thou with public kindness honour me
12. Unless thou take that honour from thy name.
13. But do not so; I love thee in such sort
14. As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
