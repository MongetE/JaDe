1. THEN hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
2. Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
3. Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
4. And do not drop in for an after loss:
5. Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
6. Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
7. Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
8. To linger out a purposed overthrow.
9. If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
10. When other petty griefs have done their spite,
11. But in the onset come: so shall I taste
12. At first the very worst of fortune's might;
13. And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
14. Compared with loss of thee will not seem so!
