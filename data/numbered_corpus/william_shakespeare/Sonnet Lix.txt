1. If there be nothing new, but that which is
2. Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
3. Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss
4. The second burden of a former child!
5. O, that record could with a backward look,
6. Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
7. Show me your image in some antique book,
8. Since mind at first in character was done!
9. That I might see what the old world could say
10. To this composed wonder of your frame;
11. Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
12. Or whether revolution be the same.
13. O, sure I am, the wits of former days
14. To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
