1. Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
2. Full charactered with lasting memory,
3. Which shall above that idle rank remain
4. Beyond all date even to eternityâ€”
5. Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
6. Have faculty by nature to subsist;
7. Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
8. Of thee, thy record never can be missed.
9. That poor retention could not so much hold,
10. Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
11. Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
12. To trust those tables that receive thee more.
13. To keep an adjunct to remember thee
14. Were to import forgetfulness in me.
