1. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
2. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
3. The evil that men do lives after them;
4. The good is oft interred with their bones;
5. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
6. Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
7. If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
8. And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
9. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-
10. For Brutus is an honourable man;
11. So are they all, all honourable men-
12. Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
13. He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
14. But Brutus says he was ambitious;
15. And Brutus is an honourable man.
16. He hath brought many captives home to Rome
17. Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
18. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
19. When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
20. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
21. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
22. And Brutus is an honourable man.
23. You all did see that on the Lupercal
24. I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
25. Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
26. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
27. And, sure, he is an honourable man.
28. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
29. But here I am to speak what I do know.
30. You all did love him once, not without cause:
31. What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
32. O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
33. And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
34. My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
35. And I must pause till it come back to me.
