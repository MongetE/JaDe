1. If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,
2. Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'
3. And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
4. Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
5. 'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
6. Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
7. In things of great receipt with ease we prove
8. Among a number one is reckon'd none:
9. Then in the number let me pass untold,
10. Though in thy stores' account I one must be;
11. For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
12. That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
13. Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
14. And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'
