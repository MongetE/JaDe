1. Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
2. A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
3. And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
4. In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
5. Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
6. A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
7. And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
8. Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
9. But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
10. The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
11. I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
12. And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
13. But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
14. Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.
