1. When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
2. I all alone beweep my outcast state
3. And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
4. And look upon myself and curse my fate,
5. Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
6. Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
7. Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
8. With what I most enjoy contented least;
9. Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
10. Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
11. Like to the lark at break of day arising
12. From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
13. For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
14. That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
