1. LXXVIII

2. So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,
3. And found such fair assistance in my verse
4. As every alien pen hath got my use
5. And under thee their poesy disperse.
6. Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing
7. And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
8. Have added feathers to the learned's wing
9. And given grace a double majesty.
10. Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
11. Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:
12. In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
13. And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
14. But thou art all my art, and dost advance
15. As high as learning my rude ignorance.

16. LXXIX

17. Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
18. My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;
19. But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,
20. And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
21. I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
22. Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
23. Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
24. He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.
25. He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word
26. From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,
27. And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
28. No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
29. Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
30. Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.

31. LXXX

32. O! how I faint when I of you do write,
33. Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
34. And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
35. To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
36. But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,
37. The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
38. My saucy bark, inferior far to his,
39. On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
40. Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
41. Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
42. Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,
43. He of tall building, and of goodly pride:
44. Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
45. The worst was this, my love was my decay.

46. LXXXI

47. Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
48. Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,
49. From hence your memory death cannot take,
50. Although in me each part will be forgotten.
51. Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
52. Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
53. The earth can yield me but a common grave,
54. When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
55. Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
56. Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;
57. And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
58. When all the breathers of this world are dead;
59. You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,
60. Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.

61. LXXXII

62. I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,
63. And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
64. The dedicated words which writers use
65. Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
66. Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
67. Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
68. And therefore art enforced to seek anew
69. Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
70. And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,
71. What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
72. Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd
73. In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;
74. And their gross painting might be better usd
75. Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abusd.

76. LXXXIII

77. I never saw that you did painting need,
78. And therefore to your fair no painting set;
79. I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
80. The barren tender of a poet's debt:
81. And therefore have I slept in your report,
82. That you yourself, being extant, well might show
83. How far a modern quill doth come too short,
84. Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
85. This silence for my sin you did impute,
86. Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
87. For I impair not beauty being mute,
88. When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
89. There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
90. Than both your poets can in praise devise.

91. LXXXIV

92. Who is it that says most, which can say more,
93. Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you,
94. In whose confine immured is the store
95. Which should example where your equal grew?
96. Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
97. That to his subject lends not some small glory;
98. But he that writes of you, if he can tell
99. That you are you, so dignifies his story.
100. Let him but copy what in you is writ,
101. Not making worse what nature made so clear,
102. And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
103. Making his style admired every where.
104. You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
105. Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.

106. LXXXV

107. My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
108. While comments of your praise richly compiled,
109. Reserve thy character with golden quill,
110. And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
111. I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,
112. And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'
113. To every hymn that able spirit affords,
114. In polished form of well-refined pen.
115. Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'
116. And to the most of praise add something more;
117. But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
118. Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
119. Then others, for the breath of words respect,
120. Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.

121. LXXXVI

122. Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
123. Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
124. That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
125. Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
126. Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
127. Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
128. No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
129. Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
130. He, nor that affable familiar ghost
131. Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
132. As victors of my silence cannot boast;
133. I was not sick of any fear from thence:
134. But when your countenance filled up his line,
135. Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.
