3. Fillet of a fenny snake,
4. In the caldron boil and bake;
5. Eye of newt and toe of frog,
6. Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
7. Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
8. Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,
9. For a charm of powerful trouble,
10. Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

11. Double, double toil and trouble;
12. Fire burn and caldron bubble.
13. Cool it with a baboon's blood,
14. Then the charm is firm and good.
