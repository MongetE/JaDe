1. Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
2. What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
3. No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
4. All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
5. Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
6. I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
7. But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest
8. By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
9. I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
10. Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
11. And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief
12. To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
13. Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
14. Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
