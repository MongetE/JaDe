1. Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
2. Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
3. Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
4. Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
5. That I have frequent been with unknown minds
6. And given to time your own dear-purchased right
7. That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
8. Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
9. Book both my wilfulness and errors down
10. And on just proof surmise accumulate;
11. Bring me within the level of your frown,
12. But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
13. Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
14. The constancy and virtue of your love.
