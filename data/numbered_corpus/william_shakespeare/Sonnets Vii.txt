1. BEING your slave, what should I do but tend
2. Upon the hours and times of your desire?
3. I have no precious time at all to spend,
4. Nor services to do, till you require.
5. Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
6. Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
7. Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
8. When you have bid your servant once adieu;
9. Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
10. Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
11. But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
12. Save, where you are how happy you make those!
13. So true a fool is love, that in your Will,
14. Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.
