1. (from Macbeth, spoken by Macbeth)
2. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
3. Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
4. To the last syllable of recorded time;
5. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
6. The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
7. Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
8. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
9. And then is heard no more. It is a tale
10. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
11. Signifying nothing.
