1. That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
2. For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
3. The ornament of beauty is suspect,
4. A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
5. So thou be good, slander doth but approve
6. Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;
7. For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
8. And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
9. Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,
10. Either not assail'd or victor being charged;
11. Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
12. To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
13. If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
14. Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
