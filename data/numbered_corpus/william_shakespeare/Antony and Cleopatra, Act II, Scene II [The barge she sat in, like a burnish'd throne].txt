1. Enobarbus describes Queen Cleopatra


2. Enobarbus: I will tell you.
3. The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
4. Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
5. Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
6. The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,
7. Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
8. The water which they beat to follow faster,
9. As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
10. It beggar'd all description: she did lie
11. In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,
12. O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
13. The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
14. Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
15. With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
16. To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
17. And what they undid did.

18. Agrippa: O, rare for Antony.

19. Enobarbus: Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
20. So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
21. And made their bends adornings. At the helm
22. A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
23. Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
24. That yarely frame the office. From the barge
25. A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
26. Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
27. Her people out upon her; and Antony,
28. Enthroned i' th' marketplace, did sit alone,
29. Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
30. Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
31. And made a gap in nature.

32. Agrippa: Rare Egyptian!

33. Enobarbus: Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
34. Invited her to supper. She replied
35. It should be better he became her guest;
36. Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
37. Whom ne'er the word of "No" woman heard speak,
38. Being barbered ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
39. And for his ordinary, pays his heart
40. For what his eyes eat only.

41. Agrippa: Royal wench!
42. She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;
43. He plowed her, and she cropped.

44. Enobarbus: I saw her once
45. Hop forty paces through the public street;
46. And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
47. That she did make defect perfection,
48. And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.

49. Maecenas: Now Antony must leave her utterly.

50. Enobarbus: Never; He will not:
51. Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
52. Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
53. The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
54. Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
55. Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
56. Bless her when she is riggish.
