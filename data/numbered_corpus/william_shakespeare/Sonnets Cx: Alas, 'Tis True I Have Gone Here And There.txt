1. Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there
2. And made myself a motley to the view,
3. Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
4. Made old offences of affections new.
5. Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
6. Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
7. These blenches gave my heart another youth,
8. And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
9. Now all is done, have what shall have no end!
10. Mine appetite, I never more will grind
11. On newer proof, to try an older friend,
12. A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
13. Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
14. Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
