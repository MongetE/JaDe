1. Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes
2. And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway;
3. Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes
4. Blown by black players upon a picnic day.
5. She sang and danced on gracefully and calm,
6. The light gauze hanging loose about her form;
7. To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm
8. Grown lovelier for passing through a storm.
9. Upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls
10. Luxuriant fell; and tossing coins in praise,
11. The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls,
12. Devoured her shape with eager, passionate gaze;
13. But looking at her falsely-smiling face,
14. I knew her self was not in that strange place.
