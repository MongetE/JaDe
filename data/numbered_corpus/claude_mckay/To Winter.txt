1. Stay, season of calm love and soulful snows!
2. There is a subtle sweetness in the sun,
3. The ripples on the stream's breast gaily run,
4. The wind more boisterously by me blows,
5. And each succeeding day now longer grows.
6. The birds a gladder music have begun,
7. The squirrel, full of mischief and of fun,
8. From maples' topmost branch the brown twig throws.
9. I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean:
10. I know that thou art making ready to go.
11. Oh stay! I fled a land where fields are green
12. Always, and palms wave gently to and fro,
13. And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen,
14. To ease my heart of its impassioned woe.
