1. There is joy in the woods just now,
2. The leaves are whispers of song,
3. And the birds make mirth on the bough
4. And music the whole day long,
5. And God! to dwell in the town
6. In these springlike summer days,
7. On my brow an unfading frown
8. And hate in my heart always—

9. A machine out of gear, aye, tired,
10. Yet forced to go on—for I’m hired.

11. Just forced to go on through fear,
12. For every day I must eat
13. And find ugly clothes to wear,
14. And bad shoes to hurt my feet
15. And a shelter for work-drugged sleep!
16. A mere drudge! but what can one do?
17. A man that’s a man cannot weep!
18. Suicide? A quitter? Oh, no!

19. But a slave should never grow tired,
20. Whom the masters have kindly hired.

21. But oh! for the woods, the flowers
22. Of natural, sweet perfume,
23. The heartening, summer showers
24. And the smiling shrubs in bloom,
25. Dust-free, dew-tinted at morn,
26. The fresh and life-giving air,
27. The billowing waves of corn
28. And the birds’ notes rich and clear:—

29. For a man-machine toil-tired
30. May crave beauty too—though he’s hired
