1. UPON thy purple mat thy body bare
2. Is fine and limber like a tender tree.
3. The motion of thy supple form is rare,
4. Like a lithe panther lolling languidly,
5. Toying and turning slowly in her lair.
6. Oh, I would never ask for more of thee,
7. Thou art so clean in passion and so fair.
8. Enough! if thou wilt ask no more of me!
