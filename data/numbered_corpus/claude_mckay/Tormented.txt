1. I will not reason, wrestle here with you,
2. Though you pursue and worry me about;
3. As well put forth my swarthy arm to stop
4. The wild wind howling, darkly mad without.

5. The night is yours for revels; day will light.
6. I will not fight you, bold and tigerish,
7. For I am weak, while you are gaining strength;
8. Peace! cease tormenting me to have your wish.

9. But when you're filled and sated with the flesh,
10. I shall go swiftly to the silver stream,
11. To cleanse my body for the spirit's sake,
12. And sun my limbs, and close my eyes to dream.
