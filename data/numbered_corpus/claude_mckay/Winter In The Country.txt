1. Sweet life! how lovely to be here
2. And feel the soft sea-laden breeze
3. Strike my flushed face, the spruce's fair
4. Free limbs to see, the lesser trees'

5. Bare hands to touch, the sparrow's cheep
6. To heed, and watch his nimble flight
7. Above the short brown grass asleep.
8. Love glorious in his friendly might,

9. Music that every heart could bless,
10. And thoughts of life serene, divine,
11. Beyond my power to express,
12. Crowd round this lifted heart of mine!

13. But oh! to leave this paradise
14. For the city's dirty basement room,
15. Where, beauty hidden from the eyes,
16. A table, bed, bureau, and broom

17. In corner set, two crippled chairs
18. All covered up with dust and grim
19. With hideousness and scars of years,
20. And gaslight burning weird and dim,

21. Will welcome me . . . And yet, and yet
22. This very wind, the winter birds
23. The glory of the soft sunset,
24. Come there to me in words.
