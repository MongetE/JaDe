1. Sometimes I tremble like a storm-swept flower,
2. And seek to hide my tortured soul from thee.
3. Bowing my head in deep humility
4. Before the silent thunder of thy power.
5. Sometimes I flee before thy blazing light,
6. As from the specter of pursuing death;
7. Intimidated lest thy mighty breath,
8. Windways, will sweep me into utter night.
9. For oh, I fear they will be swallowed up--
10. The loves which are to me of vital worth,
11. My passion and my pleasure in the earth--
12. And lost forever in thy magic cup!
13. I fear, I fear my truly human heart
14. Will perish on the altar-stone of art!
