1. Far from this foreign Easter damp and chilly
2. My soul steals to a pear-shaped plot of ground,
3. Where gleamed the lilac-tinted Easter lily
4. Soft-scented in the air for yards around;

5. Alone, without a hint of guardian leaf!
6. Just like a fragile bell of silver rime,
7. It burst the tomb for freedom sweet and brief
8. In the young pregnant year at Eastertime;

9. And many thought it was a sacred sign,
10. And some called it the resurrection flower;
11. And I, a pagan, worshiped at its shrine,
12. Yielding my heart unto its perfumed power.
