1. I shall return again; I shall return
2. To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes
3. At golden noon the forest fires burn,
4. Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies.
5. I shall return to loiter by the streams
6. That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses,
7. And realize once more my thousand dreams
8. Of waters rushing down the mountain passes.
9. I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife
10. Of village dances, dear delicious tunes
11. That stir the hidden depths of native life,
12. Stray melodies of dim remembered runes.
13. I shall return, I shall return again,
14. To ease my mind of long, long years of pain.
