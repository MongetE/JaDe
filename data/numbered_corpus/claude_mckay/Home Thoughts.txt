1. Oh something just now must be happening there!
2. That suddenly and quiveringly here,
3. Amid the city's noises, I must think
4. Of mangoes leaning o'er the river's brink,
5. And dexterous Davie climbing high above,
6. The gold fruits ebon-speckled to remove,
7. And toss them quickly in the tangled mass
8. Of wis-wis twisted round the guinea grass;
9. And Cyril coming through the bramble-track
10. A prize bunch of bananas on his back;
11. And Georgie--none could ever dive like him--
12. Throwing his scanty clothes off for a swim;
13. And schoolboys, from Bridge-tunnel going home,
14. Watching the waters downward dash and foam.
15. This is no daytime dream, there's something in it,
16. Oh something's happening there this very minute!
