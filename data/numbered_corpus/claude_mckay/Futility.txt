1. Oh, I have tried to laugh the pain away,
2. Let new flames brush my love-springs like a feather.
3. But the old fever seizes me to-day,
4. As sickness grips a soul in wretched weather.
5. I have given up myself to every urge,
6. With not a care of precious powers spent,
7. Have bared my body to the strangest scourge,
8. To soothe and deaden my heart's unhealing rent.
9. But you have torn a nerve out of my frame,
10. A gut that no physician can replace,
11. And reft my life of happiness and aim.
12. Oh what new purpose shall I now embrace?
13. What substance hold, what lovely form pursue,
14. When my thought burns through everything to you?
