1. When I have passed away and am forgotten,
2. And no one living can recall my face,
3. When under alien sod my bones lie rotten
4. With not a tree or stone to mark the place;

5. Perchance a pensive youth, with passion burning,
6. For olden verse that smacks of love and wine,
7. The musty pages of old volumes turning,
8. May light upon a little song of mine,

9. And he may softly hum the tune and wonder
10. Who wrote the verses in the long ago;
11. Or he may sit him down awhile to ponder
12. Upon the simple words that touch him so.
