1. At first you'll joy to see the playful snow,
2. Like white moths trembling on the tropic air,
3. Or waters of the hills that softly flow
4. Gracefully falling down a shining stair.

5. And when the fields and streets are covered white
6. And the wind-worried void is chilly, raw,
7. Or underneath a spell of heat and light
8. The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw,

9. Like me you'll long for home, where birds' glad song
10. Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry,
11. And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong,
12. Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky.

13. But oh! more than the changeless southern isles,
14. When Spring has shed upon the earth her charm,
15. You'll love the Northland wreathed in golden smiles
16. By the miraculous sun turned glad and warm.
