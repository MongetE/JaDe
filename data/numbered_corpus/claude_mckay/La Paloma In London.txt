1. About Soho we went before the light;
2. We went, unresting six, craving new fun,
3. New scenes, new raptures, for the fevered night
4. Of rollicking laughter, drink and song, was done.
5. The vault was void, but for the dawn's great star
6. That shed upon our path its silver flame,
7. When La Paloma on a low guitar
8. Abruptly from a darkened casement came--
9. Harlem! All else shut out, I saw the hall,
10. And you in your red shoulder sash come dancing
11. With Val against me languid by the wall,
12. Your burning coffee-colored eyes keen glancing
13. Aslant at mine, proud in your golden glory!
14. I loved you, Cuban girl, fond sweet Diory.
