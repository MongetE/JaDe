1. For one brief golden moment rare like wine,
2. The gracious city swept across the line;
3. Oblivious of the color of my skin,
4. Forgetting that I was an alien guest,
5. She bent to me, my hostile heart to win,
6. Caught me in passion to her pillowy breast;
7. The great, proud city, seized with a strange love,
8. Bowed down for one flame hour my pride to prove.
