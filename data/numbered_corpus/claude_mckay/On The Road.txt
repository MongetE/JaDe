1. Roar of the rushing train fearfully rocking,
2. Impatient people jammed in line for food,
3. The rasping noise of cars together knocking,
4. And worried waiters, some in ugly mood,
5. Crowding into the choking pantry hole
6. To call out dishes for each angry glutton
7. Exasperated grown beyond control,
8. From waiting for his soup or fish or mutton.
9. At last the station's reached, the engine stops;
10. For bags and wraps the red-caps circle round;
11. From off the step the passenger lightly hops,
12. And seeks his cab or tram-car homeward bound;
13. The waiters pass out weary, listless, glum,
14. To spend their tips on harlots, cards and rum.
