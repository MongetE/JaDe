1. O word I love to sing! thou art too tender
2. For all the passions agitating me;
3. For all my bitterness thou art too tender,
4. I cannot pour my red soul into thee.

5. O haunting melody! thou art too slender,
6. Too fragile like a globe of crystal glass;
7. For all my stormy thoughts thou art too slender,
8. The burden from my bosom will not pass.

9. O tender word! O melody so slender!
10. O tears of passion saturate with brine,
11. O words, unwilling words, ye can not render
12. My hatred for the foe of me and mine.
