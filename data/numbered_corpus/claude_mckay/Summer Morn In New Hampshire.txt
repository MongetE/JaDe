1. All yesterday it poured, and all night long
2. I could not sleep; the rain unceasing beat
3. Upon the shingled roof like a weird song,
4. Upon the grass like running children's feet.
5. And down the mountains by the dark cloud kissed,
6. Like a strange shape in filmy veiling dressed,
7. Slid slowly, silently, the wraith-like mist,
8. And nestled soft against the earth's wet breast.

9. But lo, there was a miracle at dawn!
10. The still air stirred at touch of the faint breeze,
11. The sun a sheet of gold bequeathed the lawn,
12. The songsters twittered in the rustling trees.
13. And all things were transfigured in the day,
14. But me whom radiant beauty could not move;
15. For you, more wonderful, were far away,
16. And I was blind with hunger for your love.
