1. Alfonso is a handsome bronze-hued lad
2. Of subtly-changing and surprising parts;
3. His moods are storms that frighten and make glad,
4. His eyes were made to capture women's hearts.

5. Down in the glory-hole Alfonso sings
6. An olden song of wine and clinking glasses
7. And riotous rakes; magnificently flings
8. Gay kisses to imaginary lasses.

9. Alfonso's voice of mellow music thrills
10. Our swaying forms and steals our hearts with joy;
11. And when he soars, his fine falsetto trills
12. Are rarest notes of gold without alloy.

13. But, O Alfonso! wherefore do you sing
14. Dream-songs of carefree men and ancient places?
15. Soon we shall be beset by clamouring
16. Of hungry and importunate palefaces.
