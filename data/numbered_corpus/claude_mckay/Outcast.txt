1. For the dim regions whence my fathers came
2. My spirit, bondaged by the body, longs.
3. Words felt, but never heard, my lips would frame;
4. My soul would sing forgotten jungle songs.
5. I would go back to darkness and to peace,
6. But the great western world holds me in fee,
7. And I may never hope for full release
8. While to its alien gods I bend my knee.
9. Something in me is lost, forever lost,
10. Some vital thing has gone out of my heart,
11. And I must walk the way of life a ghost
12. Among the sons of earth, a thing apart;
13. For I was born, far from my native clime,
14. Under the white man's menace, out of time.
