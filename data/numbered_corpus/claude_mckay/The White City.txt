1. I will not toy with it nor bend an inch.
2. Deep in the secret chambers of my heart
3. I muse my life-long hate, and without flinch
4. I bear it nobly as I live my part.
5. My being would be a skeleton, a shell,
6. If this dark Passion that fills my every mood,
7. And makes my heaven in the white world's hell,
8. Did not forever feed me vital blood.
9. I see the mighty city through a mist--
10. The strident trains that speed the goaded mass,
11. The poles and spires and towers vapor-kissed,
12. The fortressed port through which the great ships pass,
13. The tides, the wharves, the dens I contemplate,
14. Are sweet like wanton loves because I hate.
