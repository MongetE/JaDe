1. Lovely dainty Spanish needle
2. With your yellow flower and white,
3. Dew bedecked and softly sleeping,
4. Do you think of me to-night?

5. Shadowed by the spreading mango,
6. Nodding o'er the rippling stream,
7. Tell me, dear plant of my childhood,
8. Do you of the exile dream?

9. Do you see me by the brook's side
10. Catching crayfish 'neath the stone,
11. As you did the day you whispered:
12. Leave the harmless dears alone?

13. Do you see me in the meadow
14. Coming from the woodland spring
15. With a bamboo on my shoulder
16. And a pail slung from a string?

17. Do you see me all expectant
18. Lying in an orange grove,
19. While the swee-swees sing above me,
20. Waiting for my elf-eyed love?

21. Lovely dainty Spanish needle,
22. Source to me of sweet delight,
23. In your far-off sunny southland
24. Do you dream of me to-night?
