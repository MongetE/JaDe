1. Into the furnace let me go alone;
2. Stay you without in terror of the heat.
3. I will go naked in--for thus ''tis sweet--
4. Into the weird depths of the hottest zone.
5. I will not quiver in the frailest bone,
6. You will not note a flicker of defeat;
7. My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet,
8. My mouth give utterance to any moan.
9. The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears;
10. Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.
11. Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,
12. Transforming me into a shape of flame.
13. I will come out, back to your world of tears,
14. A stronger soul within a finer frame.
