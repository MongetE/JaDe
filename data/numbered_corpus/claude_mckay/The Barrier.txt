1. I must not gaze at them although
2. Your eyes are dawning day;
3. I must not watch you as you go
4. Your sun-illumined way;

5. I hear but I must never heed
6. The fascinating note,
7. Which, fluting like a river reed,
8. Comes from your trembing throat;

9. I must not see upon your face
10. Love's softly glowing spark;
11. For there's the barrier of race,
12. You're fair and I am dark.
