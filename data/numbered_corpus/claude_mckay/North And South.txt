1. O sweet are tropic lands for waking dreams!
2. There time and life move lazily along.
3. There by the banks of blue-and-silver streams
4. Grass-sheltered crickets chirp incessant song,
5. Gay-colored lizards loll all through the day,
6. Their tongues outstretched for careless little flies,
7. And swarthy children in the fields at play,
8. Look upward laughing at the smiling skies.
9. A breath of idleness is in the air
10. That casts a subtle spell upon all things,
11. And love and mating-time are everywhere,
12. And wonder to life's commonplaces clings.
13. The fluttering humming-bid darts through the trees
14. And dips his long beak in the big bell-flowers,
15. The leisured buzzard floats upon the breeze,
16. Riding a crescent cloud for endless hours,
17. The sea beats softly on the emerald strands--
18. O sweet for quiet dreams are tropic lands!
