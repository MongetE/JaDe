1. Here, passing lonely down this quiet lane,
2. Before a mud-splashed window long I pause
3. To gaze and gaze, while through my active brain
4. Still thoughts are stirred to wakefulness; because
5. Long, long ago in a dim unknown land,
6. A massive forest-tree, ax-felled, adze-hewn,
7. Was deftly done by cunning mortal hand
8. Into a symbol of the tender moon.
9. Why does it thrill more than the handsome boat
10. That bore me o'er the wild Atlantic ways,
11. And fill me with rare sense of things remote
12. From this harsh land of fretful nights and days?
13. I cannot answer but, whate'er it be,
14. An old wine has intoxicated me.
