1. My spirit wails for water, water now!
2. My tongue is aching dry, my throat is hot
3. For water, fresh rain shaken from a bough,
4. Or dawn dews heavy in some leafy spot.
5. My hungry body's burning for a swim
6. In sunlit water where the air is cool,
7. As in Trout Valley where upon a limb
8. The golden finch sings sweetly to the pool.
9. Oh water, water, when the night is done,
10. When day steals gray-white through the windowpane,
11. Clear silver water when I wake, alone,
12. All impotent of parts, of fevered brain;
13. Pure water from a forest fountain first,
14. To wash me, cleanse me, and to quench my thirst!
