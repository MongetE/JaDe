1. 'Mid the discordant noises of the day I hear thee calling;
2. I stumble as I fare along Earth's way; keep me from falling.
3. Mine eyes are open but they cannot see for gloom of night:
4. I can no more than lift my heart to thee for inward light.

5. The wild and fiery passion of my youth consumes my soul;
6. In agony I turn to thee for truth and self-control.

7. For Passion and all the pleasures it can give will die the death;
8. But this of me eternally must live, thy borrowed breath.

9. 'Mid the discordant noises of the day I hear thee calling;
10. I stumble as I fare along Earth's way; keep me from falling.
