1. About me young careless feet
2. Linger along the garish street;
3. Above, a hundred shouting signs
4. Shed down their bright fantastic glow
5. Upon the merry crowd and lines
6. Of moving carriages below.
7. Oh wonderful is Broadway -- only
8. My heart, my heart is lonely.
9. Desire naked, linked with Passion,
10. Goes trutting by in brazen fashion;
11. From playhouse, cabaret and inn
12. The rainbow lights of Broadway blaze
13. All gay without, all glad within;
14. As in a dream I stand and gaze
15. At Broadway, shining Broadway -- only
16. My heart, my heart is lonely.
