1. There was a time when in late afternoon
2. The four-o'clocks would fold up at day's close
3. Pink-white in prayer, and 'neath the floating moon
4. I lay with them in calm and sweet repose.

5. And in the open spaces I could sleep,
6. Half-naked to the shining worlds above;
7. Peace came with sleep and sleep was long and deep,
8. Gained without effort, sweet like early love.

9. But now no balm--nor drug nor weed nor wine--
10. Can bring true rest to cool my body's fever,
11. Nor sweeten in my mouth the acid brine,
12. That salts my choicest drink and will forever.
