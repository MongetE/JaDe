1. So much have I forgotten in ten years,
2. So much in ten brief years! I have forgot
3. What time the purple apples come to juice,
4. And what month brings the shy forget-me-not.
5. I have forgot the special, startling season
6. Of the pimento's flowering and fruiting;
7. What time of year the ground doves brown the fields
8. And fill the noonday with their curious fluting.
9. I have forgotten much, but still remember
10. The poinsettia's red, blood-red in warm December.
11. I still recall the honey-fever grass,
12. But cannot recollect the high days when
13. We rooted them out of the ping-wing path
14. To stop the mad bees in the rabbit pen.
15. I often try to think in what sweet month
16. The languid painted ladies used to dapple
17. The yellow by-road mazing from the main,
18. Sweet with the golden threads of the rose-apple.
19. I have forgotten--strange--but quite remember
20. The poinsettia's red, blood-red in warm December.

21. What weeks, what months, what time of the mild year
22. We cheated school to have our fling at tops?
23. What days our wine-thrilled bodies pulsed with joy
24. Feasting upon blackberries in the copse?
25. Oh some I know! I have embalmed the days,
26. Even the sacred moments when we played,
27. All innocent of passion, uncorrupt,
28. At noon and evening in the flame-heart's shade.
29. We were so happy, happy, I remember,
30. Beneath the poinsettia's red in warm December.
