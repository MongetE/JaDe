1. Some day, when trees have shed their leaves
2. And against the morning's white
3. The shivering birds beneath the eaves
4. Have sheltered for the night,
5. We'll turn our faces southward, love,
6. Toward the summer isle
7. Where bamboos spire to shafted grove
8. And wide-mouthed orchids smile.

9. And we will seek the quiet hill
10. Where towers the cotton tree,
11. And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
12. And works the droning bee.
13. And we will build a cottage there
14. Beside an open glade,
15. With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,
16. And ferns that never fade.
