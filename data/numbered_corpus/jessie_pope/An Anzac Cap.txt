1. It hangs on the wall, a trifle battered,
2. The wire is warped and the lining tattered.
3. And the leather inside shows speakingly how
4. It’s been wet with the sweat of a soldier’s brow.

5. Month after month, through that fierce campaign—
6. The bitterest fight that was fought in vain—
7. It was jammed on an Anzac’s lean, brown poll,
8. As he pierced his way to a glimpse of goal.

9. Furlong by furlong, aye, inch by inch,
10. From the sniping shot to the cold-steel, clinch-
11. Fists, “rough-housing,” any old tools—
12. He got there each time by “Rafferty rules.”

13. Till a shell, with his name on, gave him a call—
14. And that is the tale of the cap on the wall,
15. But the sequel, though strange, is an equally true one—
16. Its owner, thank God, is now wearing a new one.
