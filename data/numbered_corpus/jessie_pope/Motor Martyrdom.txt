1. I never have clung to a motor car,
2. Or crouched on a motor bike.
3. Worry and scurry, clank and jar
4. I cordially dislike.

5. I do not care for grimy hair,
6. For engines that explode,
7. But of one and all I've the put and call,
8. For I live on the Ripley Road.

9. I drank the country breeze at first,
10. Unsoiled by fetid fumes,
11. But now I am cursed with a constant thirst
12. That parches and consumes.

13. I am choked and hit with smoke and grit
14. When I venture from my abode ;
15. My pets are maimed and my eyes inflamed,
16. For I live on the Ripley Road.

17. I pass my days in a yellow fog,
18. My nights in a dreadful dream,
19. Haunted by handlebar, clutch and cog,
20. And eyes that goggle and gleam.

21. I am not robust, but I dine on dust
22. Gratuitously bestowed,
23. And for twopence I'll sell my house in the dell
24. By the side of the Ripley Road.
