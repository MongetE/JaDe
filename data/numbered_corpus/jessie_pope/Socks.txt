1. Shining pins that dart and click
2. In the fireside’s sheltered peace
3. Check the thoughts the cluster thick -

4. 20 plain and then decrease.


5. He was brave – well, so was I –
6. Keen and merry, but his lip
7. Quivered when he said good-bye –

8. Purl the seam-stitch, purl and slip.


9. Never used to living rough,
10. Lots of things he’d got to learn;
11. Wonder if he’s warm enough –

12. Knit 2, catch 2, knit, turn.


13. Hark! The paper-boys again!
14. Wish that shout could be suppressed;
15. Keeps one always on the strain –

16. Knit off 9, and slip the rest.


17. Wonder if he’s fighting now,
18. What he’s done an’ where he’s been;
19. He’ll come out on top somehow –

20. Slip 1, knit 2, purl 14.
