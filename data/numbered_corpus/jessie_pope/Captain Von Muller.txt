1. A Skipper of mark was Von Muller,
2. The humorous naval leg-puller.
3. With ubiquitous ease
4. He raided the seas
5. And his bag became fuller and fuller.

6. Though now he is finally done, he
7. Had a nice little run for his money,
8. And his victims' distress
9. He would gently suppress
10. With words that were sweeter than honey.

11. The high seas brought hazards to suit him,
12. His laurels, not one will dispute him,
13. No Briton could crow
14. Over such a game foe
15. And his enemy's flag will salute him.
