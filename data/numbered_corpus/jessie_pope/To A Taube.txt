1. Above the valley, rich and fair,
2. On flashing pinions, glittering, gay,
3. You hover in the upper air,
4. A bird of prey.

5. Snarling across the empty blue
6. You curve and skim, you dip and soar,
7. A dove in flight and shape and hue
8. The dove of war.

9. Above the soldier and the slain,
10. An armoured bird, you hang on high,
11. Directed by a human brain,
12. A human eye.

13. A thirsty hunter out for blood
14. Drinking adventure to the dregs
15. Where hidden camps the country stud
16. You drop your eggs.

17. Thus, man, who reasons and invents,
18. Has inconsistently designed
19. The conquest of the elements
20. To kill his kind.
