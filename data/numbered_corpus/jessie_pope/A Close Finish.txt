1. ['A marriage is arranged between Miss Diana Dashington and Lord Broadacres.']

2. The race of the season is over ;
3. I've lost and Diana has won ;
4. She's feasting on Broadacres' clover,
5. And I am right out of the fun.
6. Though Di was the one to begin it,
7. She soon found me making the pace ;
8. I thought all along I should win it,
9. And only backed her for a place.

10. At Ascot Diana was leading,
11. At Henley I spurted ahead ;
12. At Cowes side by side we were speeding;
13. At Trouville I fancy I led.
14. Neck to neck we ran, shoulder to shoulder,
15. The pack was too killing to last
16. (If the weather had only been colder!)
17. I flagged, and Diana shot past.

18. My heart's not by any means broken;
19. I hope I'm not wanting in pluck ;
20. A tear or two, low be it spoken,
21. Then I kissed her and wished her good luck.
22. Di won the race fairly as stated;
23. But when her attractions are reckoned,
24. My own must not be underrated
25. I finished a very good second!
