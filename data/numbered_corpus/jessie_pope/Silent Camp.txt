1. In heaven, a pale uncertain star,
2. Through sullen vapour peeps,
3. On earth, extended wide and far,
4. In all the symmetry of war,
5. A weary army sleeps.

6. The heavy-hearted pall of night
7. Obliterates the lines,
8. Save where a dying camp-fire's light
9. Leaps up and flares, a moment bright,
10. Then once again declines.

11. Black, solemn peace is brooding low,
12. Peace, still unbroken, when
13. There comes a sound, an ebb and flow-
14. The steady breathing, deep and slow,
15. Of half-a-million men.

16. The pregnant dawn is drawing nigh,
17. The dawn of power or pain ;
18. But now, beneath the mournful sky,
19. In sleep's maternal arms they lie
20. Like children once again.
