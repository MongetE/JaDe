1. They were “cobbers,” that’s Anzac for chum.
2. But it means rather more than we mean –
3. A friendship that will not succumb,
4. Though distance or death intervene.
5. Adventure, success, and mishap
6. In boyhood they’d shared, so no wonder
7. They jumped at the chance of a scrap
8. And booked with the crowd from ”down under.”

9. In a narrow Gallipoli trench
10. They chanced upon glimpses of hell,
11. And a thirst there was nothing to quench
12. But a deluging downpour of shell;
13. Perpetual ridges they took,
14. They charged and they cursed and they shouted,
15. But nothing their recklessness shook
16. Till one of the “cobbers” got “outed.”

17. The other one came back at night,
18. Exhausted in body and brain,
19. And groped round the scene of the fight,
20. But sought for his “cobber” in vain.
21. His spirit was heavy with grief,
22. His outlook was sombre and blotted,
23. But his bayonet brought him relief
24. Next, morning— and that’s when he “got it.”

25. Scene: Midday,Victoria street,
26. An Anzac (in blue)  on each side –
27. A coo-ee, wild, ringing, and sweet –
28. The taxicabs swerve and divide.
29. For traffic they don’t care a toss,
30. There, right in the middle, they’re meeting;
31. Stay, let’s draw a curtain across
32. Where the two long-lost “cobbers” are greeting.
