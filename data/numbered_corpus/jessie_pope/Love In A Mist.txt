1. Beneath an Ilfracombe machine,
2. While thunderstorms were raging,
3. Strephon and Chloe found the scene
4. Exceedingly engaging;
5. Though Mother Earth reproached the skies
6. With flinging pailfuls at her,
7. When Strephon looked in Chloe's eyes
8. The weather didn't matter.

9. When 'Arry up on 'Ampstead 'Eath
10. Performed a double shuffle,
11. The rain above, the mud beneath,
12. His spirits failed to ruffle;
13. For 'Arriet was by his side
14. In maddened mazes whirling
15. And little cared his promised bride
16. To see her plumes uncurling.

17. For one resplendent Summer morn
18. Young Edwin fondly waited,
19. Till Angelina grew forlorn
20. And quite emaciated.
21. When Hampton Court was like a sponge,
22. With mists their way beguiling,
23. He seized her hand and took the plunge,
24. And came up wet and smiling.
