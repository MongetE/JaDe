1. By bridge and battery, town and trench,
2. They're fighting with bull-dog pluck;
3. Not one, from Tommy to General French,
4. Is down upon his luck.
5. There are some who stand and some who fall,
6. But how does the chorus go
7. That echoing chant in the hearts of all?
8. 'Are we downhearted? NO!'
9. There's Jack, God bless him, upon the foam,
10. His isn't an easy task,
11. To strike for England, to strike right home,
12. So much, no more, does he ask.
13. On the dreadnought's deck where the big guns bark,
14. Or in quiet depths below
15. The salt wind wafts us a chantey. Hark !
16. ' Are we downhearted ? NO !'
17. And what of the girl who is left behind,
18. And the wife who misses her mate ?
19. Oh, well, we've got our business to mind
20. Though it's only to watch and wait.
21. So we'll take what comes with a gallant heart
22. As we busily knit and sew,
23. Trying, God help us, to do our part,
24. ' Are we downhearted ? NO !'
