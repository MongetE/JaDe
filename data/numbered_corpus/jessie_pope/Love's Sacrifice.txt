1. When I asked my dear Edwin to shave
2. I'd never a thought of denial;
3. He'd been such an absolute slave,
4. I put his devotion on trial.
5. But his eye threw a sinister dart,
6. His features grew dogged and grave ;
7. Still I hardly expected to part
8. When I asked him to shave.

9. He refused, and seemed eager to jest,
10. Till he saw my determined expression.
11. A moustache, he said, suited him best,
12. And helped in his budding profession.
13. ' What! Like yours' I replied with a sneer.
14. He smiled when my temper grew hot,
15. And when I indulged in a tear
16. He said, ' Certainly not.'

17. 'Twas enough, and I said what I felt,
18. Indignant and adamant-hearted,
19. On some of his drawbacks I dwelt
20. He took up his hat and departed.
21. I waited and waited in vain.
22. Disconsolate, haggard and white,
23. I wrestled each day with my pain
24. Till Saturday night.

25. Then I wrote and confessed I was wrong,
26. My hand with emotion was shaking,
27. I prayed him to come before long
28. To the heart that was his and was breaking.
29. Three terrible hours did I wait ;
30. He came and my reason was saved.
31. Then I saw what had made him so late
32. My Edwin had shaved.
