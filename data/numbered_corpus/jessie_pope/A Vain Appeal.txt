1. [From Edwin]
2. Now, Angelina, put it down.
3. Let me entreat you not to smoke it;
4. You dread your Edwin's lightest frown,
5. Or so you say well, don't provoke it.
6. No No I'm serious just now,
7. Great weight to every word attaches;
8. What's that you ask me? Anyhow
9. To pass the matches!

10. You shall have chocolates to eat
11. Of every possible description;
12. Those rosy lips are much too sweet
13. To soil with Yankee or Egyptian.
14. Your smiles with trinkets I'll entice
15. Or silly frillies made of chiffon,
16. Till once again you say I'm nice
17. And not a griffon.

18. Among those violet-scented curls
19. The smell of stale tobacco lingers,
20. And oh ! to think my best of girls
21. Should go about with yellow fingers.
22. Are you aware that stain will spread
23. Right up your arm and past your shoulder
24. And ruin What was that you said?
25. You'll use a holder!

26. No, Angelina, I insist!
27. Come, darling .... what, you're surely joking?
28. You are not anxious to be kissed
29. You'd sooner give up me than smoking
30. So be it take your cigarette
31. And smoke it, love and homage scorning,
32. But suffer me, with much regret,
33. To say 'Good morning'!
