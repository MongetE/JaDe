1. I wanted a muff
2. On an up-to-date scale,
3. Of some soft fluffy stuff,
4. With a head and a tail;
5. So simple and innocent-hearted
6. I started to go to a sale.

7. My muscles are tough,
8. I'm not sickly or pale;
9. But that shop was enough
10. To make ‘Hercules’ quail.
11. The ladies were snatching and gripping,
12. Each using her arm like a flail.

13. My passage was rough
14. And as slow as a snail.
15. In attempting to luff
16. I was pinned to a bale,
17. And asked 'to mind where I was pushing”
18. By a frowsy and frenzied female.

19. They ruined my ruff
20. And twitched off my veil;
21. The shopman was bluff
22. When I told him my tale,
23. And I vowed the next time I played football
24. I would wear a costume of chain mail.

25. I went home in a huff,
26. Looking feeble and frail,
27. Still minus a muff
28. With a head and a tail
29. But my brother politely informed me
30. I was one, to go to a sale.
