1. When the housebreaking business is slack
2. And cracksmen are finding it slow
3. For all the sea-siders are back
4. And a great many more didn't go
5. Here's excellent news from the front
6. And joy in  ;
7. Things are looking up since
8. The German Crown Prince
9. Has been giving a fillip to trade.

10. His methods are quite up-to-date,
11. Displaying adroitness and dash ;
12. What he wants he collects in a crate,
13. What he doesn't he's careful to smash.
14. An historical chateau in France
15. With Imperial ardour he loots,
16. Annexing the best
17. And erasing the rest
18. With the heels of his soldierly boots.

19. Sikes reads the report with applause,
20. It's quite an inspiring affair ;
21. But a sudden idea gives him pause
22. The Germans must stop over there !
23. So he flutters a Union Jack
24. To help to keep Englishmen steady,
25. Remarking, ' His nibs
26. Mustn't crack English cribs,
27. The profession is crowded already.'
