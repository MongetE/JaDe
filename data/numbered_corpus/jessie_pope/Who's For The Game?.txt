1. Who’s for the game, the biggest that’s played,
2. The red crashing game of a fight?
3. Who’ll grip and tackle the job unafraid?
4. And who thinks he’d rather sit tight?
5. Who’ll toe the line for the signal to ‘Go!’?
6. Who’ll give his country a hand?
7. Who wants a turn to himself in the show?
8. And who wants a seat in the stand?
9. Who knows it won’t be a picnic – not much-
10. Yet eagerly shoulders a gun?
11. Who would much rather come back with a crutch
12. Than lie low and be out of the fun?
13. Come along, lads –
14. But you’ll come on all right –
15. For there’s only one course to pursue,
16. Your country is up to her neck in a fight,
17. And she’s looking and calling for you.
