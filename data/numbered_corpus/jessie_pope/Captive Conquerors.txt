1. OH! Stuttgart Frauleins, and capacious Fraus,
2. What shocking news is this that filters through?
3. Have you been fostering domestic rows
4. By casting, naughtily, glad eyes of blue
5. At poor old Tommy in his prison-house?
6. Tut! tut! This is a pretty how-d'ye do!

7. Anna and Gretchen, where's your strength of mind?
8. Think of that khaki crowd whose force of arms
9. Bustles your goose-step legions from behind ;
10. These very captives should inspire alarms.
11. You are indeed disloyal and unkind .

12. To fall a prey to their dishevelled charms.
13. The gods have come among you, I admit,
14. To make your jealous Herren fume and fuss.
15. Unkempt, unshaven, rather short of kit,
16. The prisoners attract you even thus.
17. But, Fraus and Frauleins, what's the use of it?
18. Their hearts, please understand, belong to us !
