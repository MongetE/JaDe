1. He used to get, when in civilian state,
2. His tea and shaving water, sharp, at eight.
3. Then ten delicious minutes would be spent
4. In one last snooze of exquisite content.

5. That cosy nest, luxuriously sprung,
6. Was like a cloud 'twixt earth and heaven hung,
7. The eiderdown and blankets, soft and warm,
8. Were yet as light as spindrift in a storm.

9. Unparalleled contingencies since then
10. Have found a soldier in the citizen.
11. In inky tent he thrusts and coils each limb
12. To make his one ewe blanket cover him.

13. The Spartan methods of a scanty kit
14. May make the budding soldier hard and fit,
15. Yet, while he sleeps, a chilliness of spine
16. Breeds harassed dreams of ''shun! 'and' Right
17. incline!'

18. Grumble not he it's all a bit of fun.
19. 'One blanket's better,' as he says, 'than none'
20. The same for him as other Tommies, but
21. No disrespect in future for the Nut!
