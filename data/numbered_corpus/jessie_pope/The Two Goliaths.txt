1. GOLIATH was a giant, the bully of his side,
2. His coat of mail was brazen, his face was
3. fierce with pride;
4. And when a shepherd stripling to challenge him was
5. fain,
6. Eleven-foot Goliath ignored him in disdain.

7. But David didn't trouble, his heart was cool and
8. glad,
9. Though a sling and rounded pebbles were the only
10. arms he had.
11. That slender slip of Jesse, he knew his cause was
12. just,
13. So he stood up to the bully, and rolled him in the
14. dust.

15. Those days are gone for ever, but the bully strain
16. survives,
17. Though at the time of writing one can hardly say
18. it thrives;
19. The chant of Chauvinism has become an idle yarn,
20. Like the 'Negligible British ' since the Battle of the
21. Marne.

22. Our German-made Goliath taunted Tommy on his size,
23. But the drubbing Tommy gave him has caused him
24. much surprise ;
25. And a hasty memorandum in the Teuton mind is
26. stored
27. 'The little British Army must never be ignored.‚Äù
