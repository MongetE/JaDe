1. A little curly-headed god
2. Through asphodel came creeping,
3. Found Mother Juno on the nod,
4. And safely slipped her keeping.
5. Away he frolicked, full of mirth,
6. Until he glanced in pity
7. Upon the muddiness of earth,
8. The squalour of the city.

9. His flashing pinions forth he spread,
10. And flew with dart and quiver
11. To a celestial garden bed
12. Beside a sapphire river.
13. To deck the dingy world down there
14. He stripped each dazzling flower,
15. And flung through the cerulean air
16. The petals in a shower.

17. His treasured blossoms fluttered down,
18. He watched them softly falling,
19. Until, alas! they reached the town
20. Where men and carts were crawling.
21. Before the city's fevered fumes
22. They sank in helpless flutter,
23. And men came out with spades and brooms
24. And swept them in the gutter.
