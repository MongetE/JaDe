1. Twenty-Two stalwarts in stripes and shorts
2. Kicking a ball along,
3. Set in a square of leather-lunged sports
4. Twenty-two thousand strong,
5. Some of them shabby, some of them spruce,
6. Savagely clamorous all,
7. Hurling endearments, advice or abuse,
8. At the muscular boys on the ball.

9. Stark and stiff 'neath a stranger's sky
10. A few hundred miles away,
11. War-worn, khaki-clad figures lie,
12. Their faces rigid and grey
13. Stagger and drop where the bullets swarm,
14. Where the shrapnel is bursting loud,
15. Die, to keep England safe and warm
16. For a vigorous football crowd !

17. Football's a sport, and a rare sport too,
18. Don't make it a source of shame.
19. To-day there are worthier things to do.
20. Englishmen, play the game!
21. A truce to the League, a truce to the Cup,
22. Get to work with a gun,
23. When our country's at war we must all back up
24. It's the only thing to be done!
