1. Time was, not very long ago,
2. When Mabel's walking skirt
3. Trailed half a yard behind to show
4. How well she swept the dirt.
5. But 'short and sweet' are in again ;
6. No more the grievance rankles,
7. For Mabel's now curtailed her train
8. And shows her dainty ankles.

9. But Mabel has a thrifty mind
10. To supplement her charms.
11. The frills that once she wore behind
12. She fastens on her arms.
13. Her sleeves are made in open bags
14. Like trousers in the navy ;
15. No more she sweeps the streets, but drags
16. Her sleeve across the gravy.
