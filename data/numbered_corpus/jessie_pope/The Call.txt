3. Who'll follow French-
4. Will you, my laddie?Who's fretting to begin,
5. Who's going out to win?

7. Do you, my laddie?

8. Who's for the khaki suit-
9. Are you, my laddie?
10. Who longs to charge and shoot-
11. Do you, my laddie?
12. Who's keen on getting fit,
13. Who means to show his grit,
14. And who'd rather wait a bit-
15. Would you, my laddie?

16. Who'll earn the Empire's thanks-
17. Will you, my laddie?Who'll swell the victor's ranks-
18. Will you, my laddie?When that procession comes,
19. Banners and rolling drums-
20. Who'll stand and bite his thumbs-
21. Will you, my laddie?
