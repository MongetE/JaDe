1. Here's a prominent person
2. I must write a verse on
3. His ways are so strictly impartial,
4. His power is great,
5. His word carries weight
6. In matters domestic and martial.
7. He never takes sides,
8. But rough-shod he rides
9. Over General French and the Kaiser;
10. Party spirit he shuns,
11. He hinders the Huns
12. And makes Tommy sadder and wiser.

13. When in genial mood
14. He's so kindly and good
15. You'd never believe he could vary.
16. But when out for a grumble
17. He's rough to your humble
18. And equally rude to Queen Mary.
19. Entente and Alliance
20. Endure his defiance
21. In mute resignation together.
22. His name is suppressed,
23. But you'll doubtless have guessed
24. That by trade he's the Clerk of the Weather.
