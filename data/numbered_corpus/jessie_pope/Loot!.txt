1. When Blucher helped us make an end
2. Of Bonaparte, the common foe,
3. He came to England as a friend,
4. About a hundred years ago.
5. The sight of London fired his breast,
6. He gazed with eagerness and wonder,
7. And, brimming with Teutonic zest,
8. He cried, 'Oh, what a town to plunder! '

9. Der Tag, however, was not yet.
10. A century has passed away.
11. Blucher has settled Nature's debt,
12. But his example lives to-day
13. And kindles in the German mind
14. An altar that there's no uprooting,
15. Where love of power is enshrined,
16. Together with a love of looting.

17. They spoil and pillage, smash and swill ;
18. And helpless cities they have racked
19. Must, willy nilly, pay the bill
20. For the delight of being sacked,
21. That motto 'Blood and Iron' is done ;
22. A newer one must be enscrolled ;
23. The carte de visite of the Hun
24. Should now be printed, ' Blood and Gold.'
