1. Take them, O Death! and bear away
2. Whatever thou canst call thine own!
3. Thine image, stamped upon this clay,
4. Doth give thee that, but that alone!

5. Take them, O Grave! and let them lie
6. Folded upon thy narrow shelves,
7. As garments by the soul laid by,
8. And precious only to ourselves!

9. Take them, O great Eternity!
10. Our little life is but a gust
11. That bends the branches of thy tree,
12. And trails its blossoms in the dust!
