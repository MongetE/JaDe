1. Dead he lay among his books!
2. The peace of God was in his looks.

3. As the statues in the gloom
4. Watch o'er Maximilian's tomb,

5. So those volumes from their shelves
6. Watched him, silent as themselves.

7. Ah! his hand will nevermore
8. Turn their storied pages o'er;

9. Nevermore his lips repeat
10. Songs of theirs, however sweet.

11. Let the lifeless body rest!
12. He is gone, who was its guest;

13. Gone, as travellers haste to leave
14. An inn, nor tarry until eve.

15. Traveller! in what realms afar,
16. In what planet, in what star,

17. In what vast, aerial space,
18. Shines the light upon thy face?

19. In what gardens of delight
20. Rest thy weary feet to-night?

21. Poet! thou, whose latest verse
22. Was a garland on thy hearse;

23. Thou hast sung, with organ tone,
24. In Deukalion's life, thine own;

25. On the ruins of the Past
26. Blooms the perfect flower at last.

27. Friend! but yesterday the bells
28. Rang for thee their loud farewells;

29. And to-day they toll for thee,
30. Lying dead beyond the sea;

31. Lying dead among thy books,
32. The peace of God in all thy looks!
