1. O ye dead Poets, who are living still
2. Immortal in your verse, though life be fled,
3. And ye, O living Poets, who are dead
4. Though ye are living, if neglect can kill,
5. Tell me if in the darkest hours of ill,
6. With drops of anguish falling fast and red
7. From the sharp crown of thorns upon your head
8. Ye were not glad your errand to fulfill?
9. Yes; for the gift and ministry of Song
10. Have something in them so divinely sweet,
11. It can assuage the bitterness of wrong;
12. Not in the clamour of the crowded street,
13. Not in the shouts and plaudits of the throng,
14. But in ourselves, are triumph and defeat.
