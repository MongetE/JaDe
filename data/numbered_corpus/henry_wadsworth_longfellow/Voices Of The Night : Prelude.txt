1. Pleasant it was, when woods were green,
2. And winds were soft and low,
3. To lie amid some sylvan scene,
4. Where, the long drooping boughs between
5. Shadows dark and sunlight sheen
6. Alternate come and go;

7. Or where the denser grove receives
8. No sunlight from above
9. But the dark foliage interweaves
10. In one unbroken roof of leaves,
11. Underneath whose sloping eaves
12. The shadows hardly move.

13. Beneath some patriarchal tree
14. I lay upon the ground;
15. His hoary arms uplifted he,
16. And all the broad leaves over me
17. Clapped their little hands in glee,
18. With one continuous sound;--

19. A slumberous sound,--a sound that brings
20. The feelings of a dream,--
21. As of innumerable wings,
22. As, when a bell no longer swings,
23. Faint the hollow murmur rings
24. O'er meadow, lake, and stream.

25. And dreams of that which cannot die,
26. Bright visins, came to me,
27. As lapped in thought I used to lie,
28. And gaze into the summer sky,
29. Where the sailing clouds went by,
30. Like ships upon the sea;

31. Dreams that the soul of youth engage
32. Ere Fancy has been quelled;
33. Old legends of the monkish page.
34. Traditions of the saint and sage,
35. Tales that have the rime of age,
36. And chronicles of Eld.

37. And, loving still these quaint old themes,
38. Even in the city's throng
39. I feel the freshness of the streams,
40. That, crossed by shades and sunny gleams,
41. Water the green land of dreams,
42. The holy land of song.

43. Therefore, at Pentecost, which brings
44. The Spring, clothed like a bride,
45. When nestling buds unfold their wings,
46. And bishop's-caps have golden rings,
47. Musing upon many things,
48. I sought the woodlands wide.

49. The green trees whispered low and mild,
50. It was a sound of joy!
51. They were my playmates when a child
52. And rocked me in their arms so wild!
53. Still they looked at me and smiled
54. As if I were a boy;

55. And ever whispered, mild and low,
56. 'Come, be a child once more!'
57. And waved their long arms to and fro,
58. And beckoned solemnly and slow;
59. O, I could not choose but go
60. Into the woodlands hoar;

61. Into the blithe and breathing air,
62. Into the solemn wood.
63. Solemn and silent everywhere!
64. Nature with folded hands seemed there,
65. Kneeling at her evening prayer!
66. Like one in prayer I stood.

67. Before me rose an avenue
68. Of tall and sombrous pines;
69. Abroad their fan-like branches grew,
70. And, where the sunshine darted throught
71. Spread a vapor soft and blue,
72. In long and sloping lines.

73. And, falling on my weary brain,
74. Like a fast-falling shower,
75. The dreams of youth came back again,
76. Low lispings of the summer rain,
77. Dropping on the ripened grain,
78. As once upon the flower.

79. Visions of childhood! Stay, O stay!
80. Ye were so sweet and wild!
81. And distant voices seemed to say,
82. 'It cannot be! They pass away!
83. Other themes demand thy lay;
84. Thou art no more a child!

85. 'The land of Song within thee lies,
86. Watered by living springs;
87. The lids of Fancy's sleepless eyes
88. Are gates unto that Paradise;
89. Holy thoughts, like stars, arise,
90. Its clouds are angels' wings.

91. 'Learn, that henceforth thy song shall be
92. Not mountains capped with snow,
93. Nor forests sounding like the sea,
94. Nor rivers flowing ceaselessly,
95. Where the woodlands bend to see
96. The bending heavens below.

97. 'There is a forest where the din
98. Of iron branches sounds!
99. A mighty river roara between,
100. And whosoever looks therein,
101. Sees the heavens all black with sin,--
102. Sees not ita depths, nor bounds.

103. 'Athwart the swinging branches cast,
104. Soft rays of sunshine pour;
105. Then comes the fearful wintry blast;
106. Our hopes, like withered leaves, fall fast;
107. Pallid lips say, 'It is past!
108. We can return no more!'

109. 'Look, then, into thine heart, and write!
110. Yes, into Life's deep stream!
111. All forms of sorrow and delight,
112. All solemn Voices of the Night,
113. That can soothe thee, or affright,--
114. Be these henceforth thy theme.'
