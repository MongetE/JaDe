1. Much it behoveth
2. Each one of mortals,
3. That he his soul's journey
4. In himself ponder,
5. How deep it may be.
6. When Death cometh,
7. The bonds he breaketh
8. By which were united
9. The soul and the body.

10. Long it is thenceforth
11. Ere the soul taketh
12. From God himself
13. Its woe or its weal;
14. As in the world erst,
15. Even in its earth-vessel,
16. It wrought before.

17. The soul shall come
18. Wailing with loud voice,
19. After a sennight,
20. The soul, to find
21. The body
22. That it erst dwelt in;--
23. Three hundred winters,
24. Unless ere that worketh
25. The Eternal Lord,
26. The Almighty God,
27. The end of the world.

28. Crieth then, so care-worn,
29. With cold utterance,
30. And speaketh grimly,
31. The ghost to the dust:
32. 'Dry dust! thou dreary one!
33. How little didst thou labor for me!
34. In the foulness of earth
35. Thou all wearest away
36. Like to the loam!
37. Little didst thou think
38. How thy soul's journey
39. Would be thereafter,
40. When from the body
41. It should be led forth.'
