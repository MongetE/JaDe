1. TRAVELLER
2. Why dost thou wildly rush and roar,
3. Mad River, O Mad River?
4. Wilt thou not pause and cease to pour
5. Thy hurrying, headlong waters o'er
6. This rocky shelf forever?

7. What secret trouble stirs thy breast?
8. Why all this fret and flurry?
9. Dost thou not know that what is best
10. In this too restless world is rest
11. From over-work and worry?

12. THE RIVER
13. What wouldst thou in these mountains seek,
14. O stranger from the city?
15. Is it perhaps some foolish freak
16. Of thine, to put the words I speak
17. Into a plaintive ditty?

18. TRAVELLER
19. Yes; I would learn of thee thy song,
20. With all its flowing numbers,
21. And in a voice as fresh and strong
22. As thine is, sing it all day long,
23. And hear it in my slumbers.

24. THE RIVER
25. A brooklet nameless and unknown
26. Was I at first, resembling
27. A little child, that all alone
28. Comes venturing down the stairs of stone,
29. Irresolute and trembling.

30. Later, by wayward fancies led,
31. For the wide world I panted;
32. Out of the forest dark and dread
33. Across the open fields I fled,
34. Like one pursued and haunted.

35. I tossed my arms, I sang aloud,
36. My voice exultant blending
37. With thunder from the passing cloud,
38. The wind, the forest bent and bowed,
39. The rush of rain descending.

40. I heard the distant ocean call,
41. Imploring and entreating;
42. Drawn onward, o'er this rocky wall
43. I plunged, and the loud waterfall
44. Made answer to the greeting.

45. And now, beset with many ills,
46. A toilsome life I follow;
47. Compelled to carry from the hills
48. These logs to the impatient mills
49. Below there in the hollow.

50. Yet something ever cheers and charms
51. The rudeness of my labors;
52. Daily I water with these arms
53. The cattle of a hundred farms,
54. And have the birds for neighbors.

55. Men call me Mad, and well they may,
56. When, full of rage and trouble,
57. I burst my banks of sand and clay,
58. And sweep their wooden bridge away,
59. Like withered reeds or stubble.

60. Now go and write thy little rhyme,
61. As of thine own creating.
62. Thou seest the day is past its prime;
63. I can no longer waste my time;
64. The mills are tired of waiting.
