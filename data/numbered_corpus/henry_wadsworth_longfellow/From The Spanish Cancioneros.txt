1. I.
2. Eyes so tristful, eyes so tristful,
3. Heart so full of care and cumber,
4. I was lapped in rest and slumber,
5. Ye have made me wakeful, wistful!
6. In this life of labor endless
7. Who shall comfort my distresses?
8. Querulous my soul and friendless
9. In its sorrow shuns caresses.
10. Ye have made me, ye have made me
11. Querulous of you, that care not,
12. Eyes so tristful, yet I dare not
13. Say to what ye have betrayed me.

14. II.
15. Some day, some day
16. O troubled breast,
17. Shalt thou find rest.

18. If Love in thee
19. To grief give birth,
20. Six feet of earth
21. Can more than he;
22. There calm and free
23. And unoppressed
24. Shalt thou find rest.

25. The unattained
26. In life at last,
27. When life is passed,
28. Shall all be gained;
29. And no more pained,
30. No more distressed,
31. Shalt thou find rest.

32. III.
33. Come, O Death, so silent flying
34. That unheard thy coming be,
35. Lest the sweet delight of dying
36. Bring life back again to me.
37. For thy sure approach perceiving,
38. In my constancy and pain
39. I new life should win again,
40. Thinking that I am not living.
41. So to me, unconscious lying,
42. All unknown thy coming be,
43. Lest the sweet delight of dying
44. Bring life back again to me.
45. Unto him who finds thee hateful,
46. Death, thou art inhuman pain;
47. But to me, who dying gain,
48. Life is but a task ungrateful.
49. Come, then, with my wish complying,
50. All unheard thy coming be,
51. Lest the sweet delight of dying
52. Bring life back again to me.

53. IV.
54. Glove of black in white hand bare,
55. And about her forehead pale
56. Wound a thin, transparent veil,
57. That doth not conceal her hair;
58. Sovereign attitude and air,
59. Cheek and neck alike displayed
60. With coquettish charms arrayed,
61. Laughing eyes and fugitive;--
62. This is killing men that live,
63. 'Tis not mourning for the dead.
