1. Ye voices, that arose
2. After the Evening's close,
3. And whispered to my restless heart repose!

4. Go, breathe it in the ear
5. Of all who doubt and fear,
6. And say to them, 'Be of good cheer!'

7. Ye sounds, so low and calm,
8. That in the groves of balm
9. Seemed to me like an angel's psalm!

10. Go, mingle yet once more
11. With the perpetual roar
12. Of the pine forest dark and hoar!

13. Tongues of the dead, not lost
14. But speaking from deaths frost,
15. Like fiery tongues at Pentecost!

16. Glimmer, as funeral lamps,
17. Amid the chills and damps
18. Of the vast plain where Death encamps!
