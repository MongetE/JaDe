1. Forms of saints and kings are standing
2. The cathedral door above;
3. Yet I saw but one among them
4. Who hath soothed my soul with love.

5. In his mantle,--wound about him,
6. As their robes the sowers wind,--
7. Bore he swallows and their fledglings,
8. Flowers and weeds of every kind.

9. And so stands he calm and childlike,
10. High in wind and tempest wild;
11. O, were I like him exalted,
12. I would be like him, a child!

13. And my songs,--green leaves and blossoms,--
14. To the doors of heaven would hear,
15. Calling even in storm and tempest,
16. Round me still these birds of air.
