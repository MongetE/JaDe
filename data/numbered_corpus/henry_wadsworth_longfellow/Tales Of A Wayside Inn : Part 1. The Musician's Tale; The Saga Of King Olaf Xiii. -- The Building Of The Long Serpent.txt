1. Thorberg Skafting, master-builder,
2. In his ship-yard by the sea,
3. Whistling, said, 'It would bewilder
4. Any man but Thorberg Skafting,
5. Any man but me!'

6. Near him lay the Dragon stranded,
7. Built of old by Raud the Strong,
8. And King Olaf had commanded
9. He should build another Dragon,
10. Twice as large and long.

11. Therefore whistled Thorberg Skafting,
12. As he sat with half-closed eyes,
13. And his head turned sideways, drafting
14. That new vessel for King Olaf
15. Twice the Dragon's size.

16. Round him busily hewed and hammered
17. Mallet huge and heavy axe;
18. Workmen laughed and sang and clamored;
19. Whirred the wheels, that into rigging
20. Spun the shining flax!

21. All this tumult heard the master,--
22. It was music to his ear;
23. Fancy whispered all the faster,
24. 'Men shall hear of Thorberg Skafting
25. For a hundred year!'

26. Workmen sweating at the forges
27. Fashioned iron bolt and bar,
28. Like a warlock's midnight orgies
29. Smoked and bubbled the black caldron
30. With the boiling tar.

31. Did the warlocks mingle in it,
32. Thorberg Skafting, any curse?
33. Could you not be gone a minute
34. But some mischief must be doing,
35. Turning bad to worse?

36. 'T was an ill wind that came wafting,
37. From his homestead words of woe;
38. To his farm went Thorberg Skafting,
39. Oft repeating to his workmen,
40. Build ye thus and so.

41. After long delays returning
42. Came the master back by night;
43. To his ship-yard longing, yearning,
44. Hurried he, and did not leave it
45. Till the morning's light.

46. 'Come and see my ship, my darling!?
47. On the morrow said the King;
48. 'Finished now from keel to carling;
49. Never yet was seen in Norway
50. Such a wondrous thing!'

51. In the ship-yard, idly talking,
52. At the ship the workmen stared:
53. Some one, all their labor balking,
54. Down her sides had cut deep gashes,
55. Not a plank was spared!

56. 'Death be to the evil-doer!'
57. With an oath King Olaf spoke;
58. 'But rewards to his pursuer!?
59. And with wrath his face grew redder
60. Than his scarlet cloak.

61. Straight the master-builder, smiling,
62. Answered thus the angry King:
63. 'Cease blaspheming and reviling,
64. Olaf, it was Thorberg Skafting
65. Who has done this thing!'

66. Then he chipped and smoothed the planking,
67. Till the King, delighted, swore,
68. With much lauding and much thanking,
69. 'Handsomer is now my Dragon
70. Than she was before!'

71. Seventy ells and four extended
72. On the grass the vessel's keel;
73. High above it, gilt and splendid,
74. Rose the figure-head ferocious
75. With its crest of steel.

76. Then they launched her from the tressels,
77. In the ship-yard by the sea;
78. She was the grandest of all vessels,
79. Never ship was built in Norway
80. Half so fine as she!

81. The Long Serpent was she christened,
82. 'Mid the roar of cheer on cheer!
83. They who to the Saga listened
84. Heard the name of Thorberg Skafting
85. For a hundred year!
