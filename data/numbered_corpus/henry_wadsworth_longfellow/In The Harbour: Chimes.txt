1. Sweet chimes! that in the loneliness of night
2. Salute the passing hour, and in the dark
3. And silent chambers of the household mark
4. The movements of the myriad orbs of light!
5. Through my closed eyelids, by the inner sight,
6. I see the constellations in the arc
7. Of their great circles moving on, and hark!
8. I almost hear them singing in their flight.
9. Better than sleep it is to lie awake,
10. O'er-canopied by the vast starry dome
11. Of the immeasurable sky; to feel
12. The slumbering world sink under us, and make
13. Hardly an eddy,--a mere rush of foam
14. On the great sea beneath a sinking keel.
