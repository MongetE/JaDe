1. By his evening fire the artist
2. Pondered o'er his secret shame;
3. Baffled, weary, and disheartened,
4. Still he mused, and dreamed of fame.

5. 'T was an image of the Virgin
6. That had tasked his utmost skill;
7. But, alas! his fair ideal
8. Vanished and escaped him still.

9. From a distant Eastern island
10. Had the precious wood been brought
11. Day and night the anxious master
12. At his toil untiring wrought;

13. Till, discouraged and desponding,
14. Sat he now in shadows deep,
15. And the day's humiliation
16. Found oblivion in sleep.

17. Then a voice cried, 'Rise, O master!
18. From the burning brand of oak
19. Shape the thought that stirs within thee!'
20. And the startled artist woke,--

21. Woke, and from the smoking embers
22. Seized and quenched the glowing wood;
23. And therefrom he carved an image,
24. And he saw that it was good.

25. O thou sculptor, painter, poet!
26. Take this lesson to thy heart:
27. That is best which lieth nearest;
28. Shape from that thy work of art.
