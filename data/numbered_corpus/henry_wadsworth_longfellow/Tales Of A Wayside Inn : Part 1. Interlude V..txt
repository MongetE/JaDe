1. A strain of music closed the tale,
2. A low, monotonous, funeral wail,
3. That with its cadence, wild and sweet,
4. Made the long Saga more complete.

5. 'Thank God,' the Theologian said,
6. 'The reign of violence is dead,
7. Or dying surely from the world;
8. While Love triumphant reigns instead,
9. And in a brighter sky o'erhead
10. His blessed banners are unfurled.
11. And most of all thank God for this:
12. The war and waste of clashing creeds
13. Now end in words, and not in deeds,
14. And no one suffers loss, or bleeds,
15. For thoughts that men call heresies.

16. 'I stand without here in the porch,
17. I hear the bell's melodious din,
18. I hear the organ peal within,
19. I hear the prayer, with words that scorch
20. Like sparks from an inverted torch,
21. I hear the sermon upon sin,
22. With threatenings of the last account.
23. And all, translated in the air,
24. Reach me but as our dear Lord's Prayer,
25. And as the Sermon on the Mount.

26. 'Must it be Calvin, and not Christ?
27. Must it be Athanasian creeds,
28. Or holy water, books, and beads?
29. Must struggling souls remain content
30. With councils and decrees of Trent?
31. And can it be enough for these
32. The Christian Church the year embalms
33. With evergreens and boughs of palms,
34. And fills the air with litanies?

35. 'I know that yonder Pharisee
36. Thanks God that he is not like me;
37. In my humiliation dressed,
38. I only stand and beat my breast,
39. And pray for human charity.

40. 'Not to one church alone, but seven,
41. The voice prophetic spake from heaven;
42. And unto each the promise came,
43. Diversified, but still the same;
44. For him that overcometh are
45. The new name written on the stone,
46. The raiment white, the crown, the throne,
47. And I will give him the Morning Star!

48. 'Ah! to how many Faith has been
49. No evidence of things unseen,
50. But a dim shadow, that recasts
51. The creed of the Phantasiasts,
52. For whom no Man of Sorrows died,
53. For whom the Tragedy Divine
54. Was but a symbol and a sign,
55. And Christ a phantom crucified!

56. 'For others a diviner creed
57. Is living in the life they lead.
58. The passing of their beautiful feet
59. Blesses the pavement of the street
60. And all their looks and words repeat
61. Old Fuller's saying, wise and sweet,
62. Not as a vulture, but a dove,
63. The Holy Ghost came from above.

64. 'And this brings back to me a tale
65. So sad the hearer well may quail,
66. And question if such things can be;
67. Yet in the chronicles of Spain
68. Down the dark pages runs this stain,
69. And naught can wash them white again,
70. So fearful is the tragedy.'
