1. Nothing the greatest artist can conceive
2. That every marble block doth not confine
3. Within itself; and only its design
4. The hand that follows intellect can achieve.
5. The ill I flee, the good that I believe,
6. In thee, fair lady, lofty and divine,
7. Thus hidden lie; and so that death be mine
8. Art, of desired success, doth me bereave.
9. Love is not guilty, then, nor thy fair face,
10. Nor fortune, cruelty, nor great disdain,
11. Of my disgrace, nor chance, nor destiny,
12. If in thy heart both death and love find place
13. At the same time, and if my humble brain,
14. Burning, can nothing draw but death from thee.
