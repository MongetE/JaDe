1. In that building, long and low,
2. With its windows all a-row,
3. Like the port-holes of a hulk,
4. Human spiders spin and spin,
5. Backward down their threads so thin
6. Dropping, each a hempen bulk.

7. At the end, an open door;
8. Squares of sunshine on the floor
9. Light the long and dusky lane;
10. And the whirring of a wheel,
11. Dull and drowsy, makes me feel
12. All its spokes are in my brain.

13. As the spinners to the end
14. Downward go and reascend,
15. Gleam the long threads in the sun;
16. While within this brain of mine
17. Cobwebs brighter and more fine
18. By the busy wheel are spun.

19. Two fair maidens in a swing,
20. Like white doves upon the wing,
21. First before my vision pass;
22. Laughing, as their gentle hands
23. Closely clasp the twisted strands,
24. At their shadow on the grass.

25. Then a booth of mountebanks,
26. With its smell of tan and planks,
27. And a girl poised high in air
28. On a cord, in spangled dress,
29. With a faded loveliness,
30. And a weary look of care.

31. Then a homestead among farms,
32. And a woman with bare arms
33. Drawing water from a well;
34. As the bucket mounts apace,
35. With it mounts her own fair face,
36. As at some magician's spell.

37. Then an old man in a tower,
38. Ringing loud the noontide hour,
39. While the rope coils round and round
40. Like a serpent at his feet,
41. And again, in swift retreat,
42. Nearly lifts him from the ground.

43. Then within a prison-yard,
44. Faces fixed, and stern, and hard,
45. Laughter and indecent mirth;
46. Ah! it is the gallows-tree!
47. Breath of Christian charity,
48. Blow, and sweep it from the earth!

49. Then a school-boy, with his kite
50. Gleaming in a sky of light,
51. And an eager, upward look;
52. Steeds pursued through lane and field;
53. Fowlers with their snares concealed;
54. And an angler by a brook.

55. Ships rejoicing in the breeze,
56. Wrecks that float o'er unknown seas,
57. Anchors dragged through faithless sand;
58. Sea-fog drifting overhead,
59. And, with lessening line and lead,
60. Sailors feeling for the land.

61. All these scenes do I behold,
62. These, and many left untold,
63. In that building long and low;
64. While the wheel goes round and round,
65. With a drowsy, dreamy sound,
66. And the spinners backward go.
