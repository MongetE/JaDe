1. Have you read in the Talmud of old,
2. In the Legends the Rabbins have told
3. Of the limitless realms of the air,--
4. Have you read it,--the marvellous story
5. Of Sandalphon, the Angel of Glory,
6. Sandalphon, the Angel of Prayer?

7. How, erect, at the outermost gates
8. Of the City Celestial he waits,
9. With his feet on the ladder of light,
10. That, crowded with angels unnumbered,
11. By Jacob was seen, as he slumbered
12. Alone in the desert at night?

13. The Angels of Wind and of Fire
14. Chant only one hymn, and expire
15. With the song's irresistible stress;
16. Expire in their rapture and wonder,
17. As harp-strings are broken asunder
18. By music they throb to express.

19. But serene in the rapturous throng,
20. Unmoved by the rush of the song,
21. With eyes unimpassioned and slow,
22. Among the dead angels, the deathless
23. Sandalphon stands listening breathless
24. To sounds that ascend from below;--

25. From the spirits on earth that adore,
26. From the souls that entreat and implore
27. In the fervor and passion of prayer;
28. From the hearts that are broken with losses,
29. And weary with dragging the crosses
30. Too heavy for mortals to bear.

31. And he gathers the prayers as he stands,
32. And they change into flowers in his hands,
33. Into garlands of purple and red;
34. And beneath the great arch of the portal,
35. Through the streets of the City Immortal
36. Is wafted the fragrance they shed.

37. It is but a legend, I know,--
38. A fable, a phantom, a show,
39. Of the ancient Rabbinical lore;
40. Yet the old mediaeval tradition,
41. The beautiful, strange superstition,
42. But haunts me and holds me the more.

43. When I look from my window at night,
44. And the welkin above is all white,
45. All throbbing and panting with stars,
46. Among them majestic is standing
47. Sandalphon the angel, expanding
48. His pinions in nebulous bars.

49. And the legend, I feel, is a part
50. Of the hunger and thirst of the heart,
51. The frenzy and fire of the brain,
52. That grasps at the fruitage forbidden,
53. The golden pomegranates of Eden,
54. To quiet its fever and pain.
