1. THE SPIRE OF STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.

2. Night and storm. LUCIFER, with the Powers of the
3. Air, trying to tear down the Cross.

4. _Lucifer._ HASTEN! hasten!
5. O ye spirits!
6. From its station drag the ponderous
7. Cross of iron, that to mock us
8. Is uplifted high in air!

9. _Voices._ O, we cannot!
10. For around it
11. All the Saints and Guardian Angels
12. Throng in legions to protect it;
13. They defeat us everywhere!

14. _The Bells._ Laudo Deum verum
15. Plebem voco!
16. Congrego clerum!

17. _Lucifer._ Lower! lower!
18. Hover downward!
19. Seize the loud, vociferous bells, and
20. Clashing, clanging, to the pavement
21. Hurl them from their windy tower!

22. _Voices._ All thy thunders
23. Here are harmless!
24. For these bells have been anointed,
25. And baptized with holy water!
26. They defy our utmost power.

27. _The Bells. Defunctos ploro!
28. Pestem fugo!
29. Festa decoro!

30. _Lucifer._ Shake the casements!
31. Break the painted
32. Panes that flame with gold and crimson!
33. Scatter them like leaves of Autumn,
34. Swept away before the blast!

35. _Voices._ O, we cannot!
36. The Archangel
37. Michael flames from every window,
38. With the sword of fire that drove us
39. Headlong, out of heaven, aghast!

40. _The Bells._ Funera plango!
41. Fulgora frango!
42. Sabbata pango!

43. _Lucifer._ Aim your lightnings
44. At the oaken,
45. Massive, iron-studded portals!
46. Sack the house of God, and scatter
47. Wide the ashes of the dead!

48. _Voices._ O, we cannot!
49. The Apostles
50. And the Martyrs, wrapped in mantles,
51. Stand as wardens at the entrance,
52. Stand as sentinels o'erhead!

53. _The Bells._ Excito lentos!
54. Dissipo ventos!
55. Paco cruentos!

56. _Lucifer._ Baffled! baffled!
57. Inefficient,
58. Craven spirits! leave this labor
59. Unto Time, the great Destroyer!
60. Come away, ere night is gone!

61. _Voices._ Onward! onward!
62. With the night-wind,
63. Over field and farm and forest,
64. Lonely homestead, darksome hamlet,
65. Blighting all we breathe upon!

66. (They sweep away. Organ and Gregorian Chant.)

67. Choir. Nocte surgentes
68. Vig lemus omnes!

69. * * * * *

70. I. THE CASTLE OF VAUTSBERG ON THE RHINE.

71. A chamber in a tower. PRINCE HENRY, sitting alone,
72. ill and restless.

73. _Prince Henry. I cannot sleep! my fervid brain
74. Calls up the vanished Past again,
75. And throws its misty splendors deep
76. Into the pallid realms of sleep!
77. A breath from that far-distant shore
78. Comes freshening ever more and more,
79. And wafts o'er intervening seas
80. Sweet odors from the Hesperides!
81. A wind, that through the corridor
82. Just stirs the curtain, and no more,
83. And, touching the aeolian strings,
84. Faints with the burden that it brings!
85. Come back! ye friendships long departed!
86. That like o'erflowing streamlets started,
87. And now are dwindled, one by one,
88. To stony channels in the sun!
89. Come back! ye friends, whose lives are ended!
90. Come back, with all that light attended,
91. Which seemed to darken and decay
92. When ye arose and went away!
93. They come, the shapes of joy and woe,
94. The airy crowds of long-ago,
95. The dreams and fancies known of yore,
96. That have been, and shall be no more.
97. They change the cloisters of the night
98. Into a garden of delight;
99. They make the dark and dreary hours
100. Open and blossom into flowers!
101. I would not sleep! I love to be
102. Again in their fair company;
103. But ere my lips can bid them stay,
104. They pass and vanish quite away!

105. Alas! our memories may retrace
106. Each circumstance of time and place,
107. Season and scene come back again,
108. And outward things unchanged remain;
109. The rest we cannot reinstate;
110. Ourselves we cannot re-create,
111. Nor set our souls to the same key
112. Of the remembered harmony!

113. Rest! rest! O, give me rest and peace!
114. The thought of life that ne'er shall cease
115. Has something in it like despair,
116. A weight I am too weak to bear!
117. Sweeter to this afflicted breast
118. The thought of never-ending rest!
119. Sweeter the undisturbed and deep
120. Tranquillity of endless sleep!


121. (_A flash of lightning, out of which_ LUCIFER _appears,
122. in the garb of a travelling Physician._)

123. _Lucifer_. All hail Prince Henry!

124. _Prince Henry_ (_starting_). Who is it speaks?
125. Who and what are you?

126. _Lucifer_. One who seeks
127. A moment's audience with the Prince.

128. _Prince Henry_. When came you in?

129. _Lucifer_. A moment since.
130. I found your study door unlocked,
131. And thought you answered when I knocked.

132. _Prince Henry_. I did not hear you.

133. _Lucifer_. You heard the thunder;
134. It was loud enough to waken the dead.
135. And it is not a matter of special wonder
136. That, when God is walking overhead,
137. You should not have heard my feeble tread.

138. _Prince Henry_. What may your wish or purpose be?

139. _Lucifer_. Nothing or everything, as it pleases
140. Your Highness. You behold in me
141. Only a traveling Physician;
142. One of the few who have a mission
143. To cure incurable diseases,
144. Or those that are called so.

145. _Prince Henry_. Can you bring
146. The dead to life?

147. _Lucifer_. Yes; very nearly.
148. And, what is a wiser and better thing,
149. Can keep the living from ever needing
150. Such an unnatural, strange proceeding,
151. By showing conclusively and clearly
152. That death is a stupid blunder merely,
153. And not a necessity of our lives.
154. My being here is accidental;
155. The storm, that against your casement drives,
156. In the little village below waylaid me.
157. And there I heard, with a secret delight,
158. Of your maladies physical and mental,
159. Which neither astonished nor dismayed me.
160. And I hastened hither, though late in the night,
161. To proffer my aid!

162. _Prince Henry (ironically)_ For this you came!
163. Ah, how can I ever hope to requite
164. This honor from one so erudite?

165. _Lucifer_. The honor is mine, or will be when
166. I have cured your disease.

167. _Prince Henry_. But not till then.

168. _Lucifer_. What is your illness?

169. _Prince Henry_. It has no name.
170. A smouldering, dull, perpetual flame,
171. As in a kiln, burns in my veins,
172. Sending up vapors to the head,
173. My heart has become a dull lagoon,
174. Which a kind of leprosy drinks and drains;
175. I am accounted as one who is dead,
176. And, indeed, I think that I shall be soon.

177. _Lucifer_ And has Gordonius the Divine,
178. In his famous Lily of Medicine,--
179. I see the book lies open before you,--
180. No remedy potent enough to restore you?

181. _Prince Henry_. None whatever!

182. _Lucifer_ The dead are dead,
183. And their oracles dumb, when questioned
184. Of the new diseases that human life
185. Evolves in its progress, rank and rife.
186. Consult the dead upon things that were,
187. But the living only on things that are.
188. Have you done this, by the appliance
189. And aid of doctors?

190. _Prince Henry_. Ay, whole schools
191. Of doctors, with their learned rules,
192. But the case is quite beyond their science.
193. Even the doctors of Salern
194. Send me back word they can discern
195. No cure for a malady like this,
196. Save one which in its nature is
197. Impossible, and cannot be!

198. _Lucifer_ That sounds oracular!

199. _Prince Henry_ Unendurable!

200. _Lucifer_ What is their remedy?

201. _Prince Henry_ You shall see;
202. Writ in this scroll is the mystery.

203. _Lucifer (reading)._ 'Not to be cured, yet not incurable!
204. The only remedy that remains
205. Is the blood that flows from a maiden's veins,
206. Who of her own free will shall die,
207. And give her life as the price of yours!'
208. That is the strangest of all cures,
209. And one, I think, you will never try;
210. The prescription you may well put by,
211. As something impossible to find
212. Before the world itself shall end!
213. And yet who knows? One cannot say
214. That into some maiden's brain that kind
215. Of madness will not find its way.
216. Meanwhile permit me to recommend,
217. As the matter admits of no delay,
218. My wonderful Catholicon,
219. Of very subtile and magical powers!

220. _Prince Henry._ Purge with your nostrums and drugs infernal
221. The spouts and gargoyles of these towers,
222. Not me! My faith is utterly gone
223. In every power but the Power Supernal!
224. Pray tell me, of what school are you?

225. _Lucifer._ Both of the Old and of the New!
226. The school of Hermes Trismegistus,
227. Who uttered his oracles sublime
228. Before the Olympiads, in the dew
229. Of the early dawn and dusk of Time,
230. The reign of dateless old Hephaestus!
231. As northward, from its Nubian springs,
232. The Nile, forever new and old,
233. Among the living and the dead,
234. Its mighty, mystic stream has rolled;
235. So, starting from its fountain-head
236. Under the lotus-leaves of Isis,
237. From the dead demigods of eld,
238. Through long, unbroken lines of kings
239. Its course the sacred art has held,
240. Unchecked, unchanged by man's devices.
241. This art the Arabian Geber taught,
242. And in alembics, finely wrought,
243. Distilling herbs and flowers, discovered
244. The secret that so long had hovered
245. Upon the misty verge of Truth,
246. The Elixir of Perpetual Youth,
247. Called Alcohol, in the Arab speech!
248. Like him, this wondrous lore I teach!

249. _Prince Henry._ What! an adept?

250. _Lucifer._ Nor less, nor more!

251. _Prince Henry._ I am a reader of such books,
252. A lover of that mystic lore!
253. With such a piercing glance it looks
254. Into great Nature's open eye,
255. And sees within it trembling lie
256. The portrait of the Deity!
257. And yet, alas! with all my pains,
258. The secret and the mystery
259. Have baffled and eluded me,
260. Unseen the grand result remains!

261. _Lucifer (showing a flask)._ Behold it here! this little flask
262. Contains the wonderful quintessence,
263. The perfect flower and efflorescence,
264. Of all the knowledge man can ask!
265. Hold it up thus against the light!

266. _Prince Henry._ How limpid, pure, and crystalline,
267. How quick, and tremulous, and bright
268. The little wavelets dance and shine,
269. As were it the Water of Life in sooth!

270. _Lucifer._ It is! It assuages every pain,
271. Cures all disease, and gives again
272. To age the swift delights of youth.
273. Inhale its fragrance.

274. _Prince Henry._ It is sweet.
275. A thousand different odors meet
276. And mingle in its rare perfume,
277. Such as the winds of summer waft
278. At open windows through a room!

279. _Lucifer._ Will you not taste it?

280. _Prince Henry._ Will one draught
281. Suffice?

282. _Lucifer._ If not, you can drink more.

283. _Prince Henry._ Into this crystal goblet pour
284. So much as safely I may drink.

285. _Lucifer (pouring)._ Let not the quantity alarm you:
286. You may drink all; it will not harm you.

287. _Prince Henry._ I am as one who on the brink
288. Of a dark river stands and sees
289. The waters flow, the landscape dim
290. Around him waver, wheel, and swim,
291. And, ere he plunges, stops to think
292. Into what whirlpools he may sink;
293. One moment pauses, and no more,
294. Then madly plunges from the shore!
295. Headlong into the dark mysteries
296. Of life and death I boldly leap,
297. Nor fear the fateful current's sweep,
298. Nor what in ambush lurks below!
299. For death is better than disease!

300. (_An_ ANGEL _with an aeolian harp hovers in the air_.)

301. _Angel._ Woe! woe! eternal woe!
302. Not only the whispered prayer
303. Of love,
304. But the imprecations of hate,
305. Reverberate
306. Forever and ever through the air
307. Above!
308. This fearful curse
309. Shakes the great universe!

310. _Lucifer (disappearing)._ Drink! drink!
311. And thy soul shall sink
312. Down into the dark abyss,
313. Into the infinite abyss,
314. From which no plummet nor rope
315. Ever drew up the silver sand of hope!

316. _Prince Henry (drinking)._ It is like a draught of fire!
317. Through every vein
318. I feel again
319. The fever of youth, the soft desire;
320. A rapture that is almost pain
321. Throbs in my heart and fills my brain!
322. O joy! O joy! I feel
323. The band of steel
324. That so long and heavily has pressed
325. Upon my breast
326. Uplifted, and the malediction
327. Of my affliction
328. Is taken from me, and my weary breast
329. At length finds rest.

330. _The Angel._ It is but the rest of the fire, from which the air
331. has been taken!
332. It is but the rest of the sand, when the hour-glass is not shaken!
333. It is but the rest of the tide between the ebb and the flow!
334. It is but the rest of the wind between the flaws that blow!
335. With fiendish laughter,
336. Hereafter,
337. This false physician
338. Will mock thee in thy perdition.

339. _Prince Henry._ Speak! speak!
340. Who says that I am ill?
341. I am not ill! I am not weak!
342. The trance, the swoon, the dream, is o'er!
343. I feel the chill of death no more!
344. At length,
345. I stand renewed in all my strength!
346. Beneath me I can feel
347. The great earth stagger and reel,
348. As it the feet of a descending God
349. Upon its surface trod,
350. And like a pebble it rolled beneath his heel!
351. This, O brave physician! this
352. Is thy great Palingenesis!

353. (_Drinks again_.)

354. _The Angel._ Touch the goblet no more!
355. It will make thy heart sore
356. To its very core!
357. Its perfume is the breath
358. Of the Angel of Death,
359. And the light that within it lies
360. Is the flash of his evil eyes.
361. Beware! O, beware!
362. For sickness, sorrow, and care
363. All are there!

364. _Prince Henry (sinking back)._ O thou voice within my breast!
365. Why entreat me, why upbraid me,
366. When the steadfast tongues of truth
367. And the flattering hopes of youth
368. Have all deceived me and betrayed me?
369. Give me, give me rest, O, rest!
370. Golden visions wave and hover,
371. Golden vapors, waters streaming,
372. Landscapes moving, changing, gleaming!
373. I am like a happy lover
374. Who illumines life with dreaming!
375. Brave physician! Rare physician!
376. Well hast thou fulfilled thy mission!

377. (_His head falls On his book_.)

378. _The Angel (receding)._ Alas! alas!
379. Like a vapor the golden vision
380. Shall fade and pass,
381. And thou wilt find in thy heart again
382. Only the blight of pain,
383. And bitter, bitter, bitter contrition!

384. * * * * *

385. COURT-YARD OF THE CASTLE.

386. * * * * *

387. HUBERT _standing by the gateway._

388. _Hubert._ How sad the grand old castle looks!
389. O'erhead, the unmolested rooks
390. Upon the turret's windy top
391. Sit, talking of the farmer's crop;
392. Here in the court-yard springs the grass,
393. So few are now the feet that pass;
394. The stately peacocks, bolder grown,
395. Come hopping down the steps of stone,
396. As if the castle were their own;
397. And I, the poor old seneschal,
398. Haunt, like a ghost, the banquet-hall.
399. Alas! the merry guests no more
400. Crowd through the hospital door;
401. No eyes with youth and passion shine,
402. No cheeks glow redder than the wine;
403. No song, no laugh, no jovial din
404. Of drinking wassail to the pin;
405. But all is silent, sad, and drear,
406. And now the only sounds I hear
407. Are the hoarse rooks upon the walls,
408. And horses stamping in their stalls!

409. (_A horn sounds_.)

410. What ho! that merry, sudden blast
411. Reminds me of the days long past!
412. And, as of old resounding, grate
413. The heavy hinges of the gate,
414. And, clattering loud, with iron clank,
415. Down goes the sounding bridge of plank,
416. As if it were in haste to greet
417. The pressure of a traveler's feet!

418. (_Enter_ WALTER _the Minnesinger_.)

419. _Walter._ How now, my friend! This looks quite lonely!
420. No banner flying from the walls,
421. No pages and no seneschals,
422. No wardens, and one porter only!
423. Is it you, Hubert?

424. _Hubert._ Ah! Master Walter!

425. _Walter._ Alas! how forms and faces alter!
426. I did not know you. You look older!
427. Your hair has grown much grayer and thinner,
428. And you stoop a little in the shoulder!

429. _Hubert._ Alack! I am a poor old sinner,
430. And, like these towers, begin to moulder;
431. And you have been absent many a year!

432. _Walter._ How is the Prince?

433. _Hubert._ He is not here;
434. He has been ill: and now has fled.

435. _Walter._ Speak it out frankly: say he's dead!
436. Is it not so?

437. _Hubert._ No; if you please;
438. A strange, mysterious disease
439. Fell on him with a sudden blight.
440. Whole hours together he would stand
441. Upon the terrace, in a dream,
442. Resting his head upon his hand,
443. Best pleased when he was most alone,
444. Like Saint John Nepomuck in stone,
445. Looking down into a stream.
446. In the Round Tower, night after night,
447. He sat, and bleared his eyes with books;
448. Until one morning we found him there
449. Stretched on the floor, as if in a swoon
450. He had fallen from his chair.
451. We hardly recognized his sweet looks!

452. _Walter._ Poor Prince!

453. _Hubert._ I think he might have mended;
454. And he did mend; but very soon
455. The Priests came flocking in, like rooks,
456. With all their crosiers and their crooks,
457. And so at last the matter ended.

458. _Walter._ How did it end?

459. _Hubert._ Why, in Saint Rochus
460. They made him stand, and wait his doom;
461. And, as if he were condemned to the tomb,
462. Began to mutter their hocus pocus.
463. First, the Mass for the Dead they chaunted.
464. Then three times laid upon his head
465. A shovelful of church-yard clay,
466. Saying to him, as he stood undaunted,
467. 'This is a sign that thou art dead,
468. So in thy heart be penitent!'
469. And forth from the chapel door he went
470. Into disgrace and banishment,
471. Clothed in a cloak of hodden gray,
472. And bearing a wallet, and a bell,
473. Whose sound should be a perpetual knell
474. To keep all travelers away.

475. _Walter._ O, horrible fate! Outcast, rejected,
476. As one with pestilence infected!

477. _Hubert._ Then was the family tomb unsealed,
478. And broken helmet, sword and shield,
479. Buried together, in common wreck,
480. As is the custom, when the last
481. Of any princely house has passed,
482. And thrice, as with a trumpet-blast,
483. A herald shouted down the stair
484. The words of warning and despair,--
485. 'O Hoheneck! O Hoheneck!'

486. _Walter_. Still in my soul that cry goes on,--
487. Forever gone! forever gone!
488. Ah, what a cruel sense of loss,
489. Like a black shadow, would fall across
490. The hearts of all, if he should die!
491. His gracious presence upon earth
492. Was as a fire upon a hearth;
493. As pleasant songs, at morning sung,
494. The words that dropped from his sweet tongue
495. Strengthened our hearts; or, heard at night,
496. Made all our slumbers soft and light.
497. Where is he?

498. _Hubert._ In the Odenwald.
499. Some of his tenants, unappalled
500. By fear of death, or priestly word,--
501. A holy family, that make
502. Each meal a Supper of the Lord,--
503. Have him beneath their watch and ward,
504. For love of him, and Jesus' sake!
505. Pray you come in. For why should I
506. With outdoor hospitality
507. My prince's friend thus entertain?

508. _Walter._ I would a moment here remain.
509. But you, good Hubert, go before,
510. Fill me a goblet of May-drink,
511. As aromatic as the May
512. From which it steals the breath away,
513. And which he loved so well of yore;
514. It is of him that I would think
515. You shall attend me, when I call,
516. In the ancestral banquet hall.
517. Unseen companions, guests of air,
518. You cannot wait on, will be there;
519. They taste not food, they drink not wine,
520. But their soft eyes look into mine,
521. And their lips speak to me, and all
522. The vast and shadowy banquet-hall
523. Is full of looks and words divine!

524. (_Leaning over the parapet_.)

525. The day is done; and slowly from the scene
526. The stooping sun upgathers his spent shafts,
527. And puts them back into his golden quiver!
528. Below me in the valley, deep and green
529. As goblets are, from which in thirsty draughts
530. We drink its wine, the swift and mantling river
531. Flows on triumphant through these lovely regions,
532. Etched with the shadows of its sombre margent,
533. And soft, reflected clouds of gold and argent!
534. Yes, there it flows, forever, broad and still,
535. As when the vanguard of the Roman legions
536. First saw it from the top of yonder hill!
537. How beautiful it is! Fresh fields of wheat,
538. Vineyard, and town, and tower with fluttering flag,
539. The consecrated chapel on the crag,
540. And the white hamlet gathered round its base,
541. Like Mary sitting at her Saviour's feet,
542. And looking up at his beloved face!
543. O friend! O best of friends! Thy absence more
544. Than the impending night darkens the landscape o'er!
