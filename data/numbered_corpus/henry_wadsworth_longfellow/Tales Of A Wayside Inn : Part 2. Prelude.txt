1. A cold, uninterrupted rain,
2. That washed each southern window-pane,
3. And made a river of the road;
4. A sea of mist that overflowed
5. The house, the barns, the gilded vane,
6. And drowned the upland and the plain,
7. Through which the oak-trees, broad and high,
8. Like phantom ships went drifting by;
9. And, hidden behind a watery screen,
10. The sun unseen, or only seen
11. As a faint pallor in the sky;--
12. Thus cold and colorless and gray,
13. The morn of that autumnal day,
14. As if reluctant to begin,
15. Dawned on the silent Sudbury Inn,
16. And all the guests that in it lay.

17. Full late they slept. They did not hear
18. The challenge of Sir Chanticleer,
19. Who on the empty threshing-floor,
20. Disdainful of the rain outside,
21. Was strutting with a martial stride,
22. As if upon his thigh he wore
23. The famous broadsword of the Squire,
24. And said, 'Behold me, and admire!'

25. Only the Poet seemed to hear,
26. In drowse or dream, more near and near
27. Across the border-land of sleep,
28. The blowing of a blithesome horn,
29. That laughed the dismal day to scorn;
30. A splash of hoofs and rush of wheels
31. Through sand and mire like stranding keels,
32. As from the road with sudden sweep
33. The Mail drove up the little steep,
34. And stopped beside the tavern door;
35. A moment stopped, and then again
36. With crack of whip and bark of dog
37. Plunged forward through the sea of fog,
38. And all was silent as before,--
39. All silent save the dripping rain.

40. Then one by one the guests came down,
41. And greeted with a smile the Squire,
42. Who sat before the parlor fire,
43. Reading the paper fresh from town.
44. First the Sicilian, like a bird,
45. Before his form appeared, was heard
46. Whistling and singing down the stair;
47. Then came the Student, with a look
48. As placid as a meadow-brook;
49. The Theologian, still perplexed
50. With thoughts of this world and the next;
51. The Poet then, as one who seems
52. Walking in visions and in dreams;
53. Then the Musician, like a fair
54. Hyperion from whose golden hair
55. The radiance of the morning streams;
56. And last the aromatic Jew
57. Of Alicant, who, as he threw
58. The door wide open, on the air
59. Breathed round about him a perfume
60. Of damask roses in full bloom,
61. Making a garden of the room.

62. The breakfast ended, each pursued
63. The promptings of his various mood;
64. Beside the fire in silence smoked
65. The taciturn, impassive Jew,
66. Lost in a pleasant revery;
67. While, by his gravity provoked,
68. His portrait the Sicilian drew,
69. And wrote beneath it 'Edrehi,
70. At the Red Horse in Sudbury.'

71. By far the busiest of them all,
72. The Theologian in the hall
73. Was feeding robins in a cage,--
74. Two corpulent and lazy birds,
75. Vagrants and pilferers at best,
76. If one might trust the hostler's words,
77. Chief instrument of their arrest;
78. Two poets of the Golden Age,
79. Heirs of a boundless heritage
80. Of fields and orchards, east and west,
81. And sunshine of long summer days,
82. Though outlawed now and dispossessed!--
83. Such was the Theologian's phrase.

84. Meanwhile the Student held discourse
85. With the Musician, on the source
86. Of all the legendary lore
87. Among the nations, scattered wide
88. Like silt and seaweed by the force
89. And fluctuation of the tide;
90. The tale repeated o'er and o'er,
91. With change of place and change of name,
92. Disguised, transformed, and yet the same
93. We've heard a hundred times before.

94. The Poet at the window mused,
95. And saw, as in a dream confused,
96. The countenance of the Sun, discrowned,
97. And haggard with a pale despair,
98. And saw the cloud-rack trail and drift
99. Before it, and the trees uplift
100. Their leafless branches, and the air
101. Filled with the arrows of the rain,
102. And heard amid the mist below,
103. Like voices of distress and pain,
104. That haunt the thoughts of men insane,
105. The fateful cawings of the crow.

106. Then down the road, with mud besprent,
107. And drenched with rain from head to hoof,
108. The rain-drops dripping from his mane
109. And tail as from a pent-house roof,
110. A jaded horse, his head down bent,
111. Passed slowly, limping as he went.

112. The young Sicilian--who had grown
113. Impatient longer to abide
114. A prisoner, greatly mortified
115. To see completely overthrown
116. His plans for angling in the brook,
117. And, leaning o'er the bridge of stone,
118. To watch the speckled trout glide by,
119. And float through the inverted sky,
120. Still round and round the baited hook--
121. Now paced the room with rapid stride,
122. And, pausing at the Poet's side,
123. Looked forth, and saw the wretched steed,
124. And said: 'Alas for human greed,
125. That with cold hand and stony eye
126. Thus turns an old friend out to die,
127. Or beg his food from gate to gate!
128. This brings a tale into my mind,
129. Which, if you are not disinclined
130. To listen, I will now relate.'

131. All gave assent; all wished to hear,
132. Not without many a jest and jeer,
133. The story of a spavined steed;
134. And even the Student with the rest
135. Put in his pleasant little jest
136. Out of Malherbe, that Pegasus
137. Is but a horse that with all speed
138. Bears poets to the hospital;
139. While the Sicilian, self-possessed,
140. After a moment's interval
141. Began his simple story thus.
