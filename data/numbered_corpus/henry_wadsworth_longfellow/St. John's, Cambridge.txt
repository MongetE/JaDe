1. I stand beneath the tree, whose branches shade
2. Thy western window, Chapel of St. John!
3. And hear its leaves repeat their benison
4. On him, whose hand thy stones memorial laid;
5. Then I remember one of whom was said
6. In the world's darkest hour, "Behold thy son!"
7. And see him living still, and wandering on
8. And waiting for the advent long delayed.
9. Not only tongues of the apostles teach
10. Lessons of love and light, but these expanding
11. And sheltering boughs with all their leaves implore,
12. And say in language clear as human speech,
13. "The peace of God, that passeth understanding,
14. Be and abide with you forevermore!"
