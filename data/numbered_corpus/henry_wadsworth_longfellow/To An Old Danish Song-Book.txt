1. Welcome, my old friend,
2. Welcome to a foreign fireside,
3. While the sullen gales of autumn
4. Shake the windows.

5. The ungrateful world
6. Has, it seems, dealt harshly with thee,
7. Since, beneath the skies of Denmark,
8. First I met thee.

9. There are marks of age,
10. There are thumb-marks on thy margin,
11. Made by hands that clasped thee rudely,
12. At the alehouse.

13. Soiled and dull thou art;
14. Yellow are thy time-worn pages,
15. As the russet, rain-molested
16. Leaves of autumn.

17. Thou art stained with wine
18. Scattered from hilarious goblets,
19. As the leaves with the libations
20. Of Olympus.

21. Yet dost thou recall
22. Days departed, half-forgotten,
23. When in dreamy youth I wandered
24. By the Baltic,--

25. When I paused to hear
26. The old ballad of King Christian
27. Shouted from suburban taverns
28. In the twilight.

29. Thou recallest bards,
30. Who in solitary chambers,
31. And with hearts by passion wasted,
32. Wrote thy pages.

33. Thou recallest homes
34. Where thy songs of love and friendship
35. Made the gloomy Northern winter
36. Bright as summer.

37. Once some ancient Scald,
38. In his bleak, ancestral Iceland,
39. Chanted staves of these old ballads
40. To the Vikings.

41. Once in Elsinore,
42. At the court of old King Hamlet
43. Yorick and his boon companions
44. Sang these ditties.

45. Once Prince Frederick's Guard
46. Sang them in their smoky barracks;--
47. Suddenly the English cannon
48. Joined the chorus!

49. Peasants in the field,
50. Sailors on the roaring ocean,
51. Students, tradesmen, pale mechanics,
52. All have sung them.

53. Thou hast been their friend;
54. They, alas! have left thee friendless!
55. Yet at least by one warm fireside
56. Art thou welcome.

57. And, as swallows build
58. In these wide, old-fashioned chimneys,
59. So thy twittering songs shall nestle
60. In my bosom,--

61. Quiet, close, and warm,
62. Sheltered from all molestation,
63. And recalling by their voices
64. Youth and travel.
