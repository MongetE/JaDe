1. No sound of wheels or hoof-beat breaks
2. The silence of the summer day,
3. As by the loveliest of all lakes
4. I while the idle hours away.

5. I pace the leafy colonnade,
6. Where level branches of the plane
7. Above me weave a roof of shade
8. Impervious to the sun and rain.

9. At times a sudden rush of air
10. Flutters the lazy leaves o'erhead,
11. And gleams of sunshine toss and flare
12. Like torches down the path I tread.

13. By Somariva's garden gate
14. I make the marble stairs my seat,
15. And hear the water, as I wait,
16. Lapping the steps beneath my feet.

17. The undulation sinks and swells
18. Along the stony parapets,
19. And far away the floating bells
20. Tinkle upon the fisher's nets.

21. Silent and slow, by tower and town
22. The freighted barges come and go,
23. Their pendent shadows gliding down
24. By town and tower submerged below.

25. The hills sweep upward from the shore,
26. With villas scattered one by one
27. Upon their wooded spurs, and lower
28. Bellaggio blazing in the sun.

29. And dimly seen, a tangled mass
30. Of walls and woods, of light and shade,
31. Stands, beckoning up the Stelvio Pass,
32. Varenna with its white cascade.

33. I ask myself, Is this a dream?
34. Will it all vanish into air?
35. Is there a land of such supreme
36. And perfect beauty anywhere?

37. Sweet vision! Do not fade away;
38. Linger, until my heart shall take
39. Into itself the summer day,
40. And all the beauty of the lake;

41. Linger until upon my brain
42. Is stamped an image of the scene,
43. Then fade into the air again,
44. And be as if thou hadst not been.
