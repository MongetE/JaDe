1. It was Sir Christopher Gardiner,
2. Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,
3. From Merry England over the sea,
4. Who stepped upon this continent
5. As if his august presence lent
6. A glory to the colony.

7. You should have seen him in the street
8. Of the little Boston of Winthrop's time,
9. His rapier dangling at his feet
10. Doublet and hose and boots complete,
11. Prince Rupert hat with ostrich plume,
12. Gloves that exhaled a faint perfume,
13. Luxuriant curls and air sublime,
14. And superior manners now obsolete!

15. He had a way of saying things
16. That made one think of courts and kings,
17. And lords and ladies of high degree;
18. So that not having been at court
19. Seemed something very little short
20. Of treason or lese-majesty,
21. Such an accomplished knight was he.

22. His dwelling was just beyond the town,
23. At what he called his country-seat;
24. For, careless of Fortune's smile or frown,
25. And weary grown of the world and its ways,
26. He wished to pass the rest of his days
27. In a private life and a calm retreat.

28. But a double life was the life he led,
29. And, while professing to be in search
30. Of a godly course, and willing, he said,
31. Nay, anxious to join the Puritan church,
32. He made of all this but small account,
33. And passed his idle hours instead
34. With roystering Morton of Merry Mount,
35. That pettifogger from Furnival's Inn,
36. Lord of misrule and riot and sin,
37. Who looked on the wine when it was red.

38. This country-seat was little more
39. Than a cabin of log's; but in front of the door
40. A modest flower-bed thickly sown
41. With sweet alyssum and columbine
42. Made those who saw it at once divine
43. The touch of some other hand than his own.
44. And first it was whispered, and then it was known,
45. That he in secret was harboring there
46. A little lady with golden hair,
47. Whom he called his cousin, but whom he had wed
48. In the Italian manner, as men said,
49. And great was the scandal everywhere.
50. But worse than this was the vague surmise,
51. Though none could vouch for it or aver,
52. That the Knight of the Holy Sepulchre
53. Was only a Papist in disguise;
54. And the more to imbitter their bitter lives,
55. And the more to trouble the public mind,
56. Came letters from England, from two other wives,
57. Whom he had carelessly left behind;
58. Both of them letters of such a kind
59. As made the governor hold his breath;
60. The one imploring him straight to send
61. The husband home, that he might amend;
62. The other asking his instant death,
63. As the only way to make an end.

64. The wary governor deemed it right,
65. When all this wickedness was revealed,
66. To send his warrant signed and sealed,
67. And take the body of the knight.
68. Armed with this mighty instrument,
69. The marshal, mounting his gallant steed,
70. Rode forth from town at the top of his speed,
71. And followed by all his bailiffs bold,
72. As if on high achievement bent,
73. To storm some castle or stronghold,
74. Challenge the warders on the wall,
75. And seize in his ancestral hall
76. A robber-baron grim and old.

77. But when though all the dust and heat
78. He came to Sir Christopher's country-seat,
79. No knight he found, nor warder there,
80. But the little lady with golden hair,
81. Who was gathering in the bright sunshine
82. The sweet alyssum and columbine;
83. While gallant Sir Christopher, all so gay,
84. Being forewarned, through the postern gate
85. Of his castle wall had tripped away,
86. And was keeping a little holiday
87. In the forests, that bounded his estate.

88. Then as a trusty squire and true
89. The marshal searched the castle through,
90. Not crediting what the lady said;
91. Searched from cellar to garret in vain,
92. And, finding no knight, came out again
93. And arrested the golden damsel instead,
94. And bore her in triumph into the town,
95. While from her eyes the tears rolled down
96. On the sweet alyssum and columbine,
97. That she held in her fingers white and fine.
98. The governor's heart was moved to see
99. So fair a creature caught within
100. The snares of Satan and of sin,
101. And he read her a little homily
102. On the folly and wickedness of the lives
103. Of women half cousins and half wives;
104. But, seeing that naught his words availed,
105. He sent her away in a ship that sailed
106. For Merry England over the sea,
107. To the other two wives in the old countree,
108. To search her further, since he had failed
109. To come at the heart of the mystery.

110. Meanwhile Sir Christopher wandered away
111. Through pathless woods for a month and a day,
112. Shooting pigeons, and sleeping at night
113. With the noble savage, who took delight
114. In his feathered hat and his velvet vest,
115. His gun and his rapier and the rest.
116. But as soon as the noble savage heard
117. That a bounty was offered for this gay bird,
118. He wanted to slay him out of hand,
119. And bring in his beautiful scalp for a show,
120. Like the glossy head of a kite or crow,
121. Until he was made to understand
122. They wanted the bird alive, not dead;
123. Then he followed him whithersoever he fled,
124. Through forest and field, and hunted him down,
125. And brought him prisoner into the town.

126. Alas! it was a rueful sight,
127. To see this melancholy knight
128. In such a dismal and hapless case;
129. His hat deformed by stain and dent,
130. His plumage broken, his doublet rent,
131. His beard and flowing locks forlorn,
132. Matted, dishevelled, and unshorn,
133. His boots with dust and mire besprent;
134. But dignified in his disgrace,
135. And wearing an unblushing face.
136. And thus before the magistrate
137. He stood to hear the doom of fate.
138. In vain he strove with wonted ease
139. To modify and extenuate
140. His evil deeds in church and state,
141. For gone was now his power to please;
142. And his pompous words had no more weight
143. Than feathers flying in the breeze.

144. With suavity equal to his own
145. The governor lent a patient ear
146. To the speech evasive and highflown,
147. In which he endeavored to make clear
148. That colonial laws were too severe
149. When applied to a gallant cavalier,
150. A gentleman born, and so well known,
151. And accustomed to move in a higher sphere.

152. All this the Puritan governor heard,
153. And deigned in answer never a word;
154. But in summary manner shipped away,
155. In a vessel that sailed from Salem Bay,
156. This splendid and famous cavalier,
157. With his Rupert hat and his popery,
158. To Merry England over the sea,
159. As being unmeet to inhabit here.

160. Thus endeth the Rhyme of Sir Christopher,
161. Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,
162. The first who furnished this barren land
163. With apples of Sodom and ropes of sand.
