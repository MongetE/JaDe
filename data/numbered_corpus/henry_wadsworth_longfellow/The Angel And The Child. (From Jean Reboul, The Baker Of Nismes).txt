1. An angel with a radiant face,
2. Above a cradle bent to look,
3. Seemed his own image there to trace,
4. As in the waters of a brook.

5. 'Dear child! who me resemblest so,'
6. It whispered, 'come, O come with me!
7. Happy together let us go,
8. The earth unworthy is of thee!

9. 'Here none to perfect bliss attain;
10. The soul in pleasure suffering lies;
11. Joy hath an undertone of pain,
12. And even the happiest hours their sighs.

13. 'Fear doth at every portal knock;
14. Never a day serene and pure
15. From the o'ershadowing tempest's shock
16. Hath made the morrow's dawn secure.

17. 'What then, shall sorrows and shall fears
18. Come to disturb so pure a brow?
19. And with the bitterness of tears
20. These eyes of azure troubled grow?

21. 'Ah no! into the fields of space,
22. Away shalt thou escape with me;
23. And Providence will grant thee grace
24. Of all the days that were to be.

25. 'Let no one in thy dwelling cower,
26. In sombre vestments draped and veiled;
27. But let them welcome thy last hour,
28. As thy first moments once they hailed.

29. 'Without a cloud be there each brow;
30. There let the grave no shadow cast;
31. When one is pure as thou art now,
32. The fairest day is still the last.'

33. And waving wide his wings of white,
34. The angel, at these words, had sped
35. Towards the eternal realms of light!--
36. Poor mother! see, thy son is dead!
