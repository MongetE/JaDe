1. Whene'er a noble deed is wrought,
2. Whene'er is spoken a noble thought,
3. Our hearts, in glad surprise,
4. To higher levels rise.

5. The tidal wave of deeper souls
6. Into our inmost being rolls,
7. And lifts us unawares
8. Out of all meaner cares.

9. Honor to those whose words or deeds
10. Thus help us in our daily needs,
11. And by their overflow
12. Raise us from what is low!

13. Thus thought I, as by night I read
14. Of the great army of the dead,
15. The trenches cold and damp,
16. The starved and frozen camp,--

17. The wounded from the battle-plain,
18. In dreary hospitals of pain,
19. The cheerless corridors,
20. The cold and stony floors.

21. Lo! in that house of misery
22. A lady with a lamp I see
23. Pass through the glimmering gloom,
24. And flit from room to room.

25. And slow, as in a dream of bliss,
26. The speechless sufferer turns to kiss
27. Her shadow, as it falls
28. Upon the darkening walls.

29. As if a door in heaven should be
30. Opened and then closed suddenly,
31. The vision came and went,
32. The light shone and was spent.

33. On England's annals, through the long
34. Hereafter of her speech and song,
35. That light its rays shall cast
36. From portals of the past.

37. A Lady with a Lamp shall stand
38. In the great history of the land,
39. A noble type of good,
40. Heroic womanhood.

41. Nor even shall be wanting here
42. The palm, the lily, and the spear,
43. The symbols that of yore
44. Saint Filomena bore.
