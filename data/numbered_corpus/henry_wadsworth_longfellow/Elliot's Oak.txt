1. Thou ancient oak! whose myriad leaves are loud
2. With sounds of unintelligible speech,
3. Sounds as of surges on a shingly beach,
4. Or multitudinous murmurs of a crowd;
5. With some mysterious gift of tongues endowed,
6. Thou speakest a different dialect to each;
7. To me a language that no man can teach,
8. Of a lost race, long vanished like a cloud.
9. For underneath thy shade, in days remote,
10. Seated like Abraham at eventide
11. Beneath the oaks of Mamre, the unknown
12. Apostle of the Indians, Eliot, wrote
13. His Bible in a language that hath died
14. And is forgotten, save by thee alone.
