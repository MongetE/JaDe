1. As the birds come in the Spring,
2. We know not from where;
3. As the stars come at evening
4. From depths of the air;

5. As the rain comes from the cloud,
6. And the brook from the ground;
7. As suddenly, low or loud,
8. Out of silence a sound;

9. As the grape comes to the vine,
10. The fruit to the tree;
11. As the wind comes to the pine,
12. And the tide to the sea;

13. As come the white sails of ships
14. O'er the ocean's verge;
15. As comes the smile to the lips,
16. The foam to the surge;

17. So come to the Poet his songs,
18. All hitherward blown
19. From the misty realm, that belongs
20. To the vast Unknown.

21. His, and not his, are the lays
22. He sings; and their fame
23. Is his, and not his; and the praise
24. And the pride of a name.

25. For voices pursue him by day,
26. And haunt him by night,
27. And he listens, and needs must obey,
28. When the Angel says: 'Write!'
