1. How much of my young heart, O Spain,
2. Went out to thee in days of yore!
3. What dreams romantic filled my brain,
4. And summoned back to life again
5. The Paladins of Charlemagne,
6. The Cid Campeador!

7. And shapes more shadowy than these,
8. In the dim twilight half revealed;
9. Phoenician galleys on the seas,
10. The Roman camps like hives of bees,
11. The Goth uplifting from his knees
12. Pelayo on his shield.

13. It was these memories perchance,
14. From annals of remotest eld,
15. That lent the colors of romance
16. To every trivial circumstance,
17. And changed the form and countenance
18. Of all that I beheld.

19. Old towns, whose history lies hid
20. In monkish chronicle or rhyme,--
21. Burgos, the birthplace of the Cid,
22. Zamora and Valladolid,
23. Toledo, built and walled amid
24. The wars of Wamba's time;

25. The long, straight line of the highway,
26. The distant town that seems so near,
27. The peasants in the fields, that stay
28. Their toil to cross themselves and pray,
29. When from the belfry at midday
30. The Angelus they hear;

31. White crosses in the mountain pass,
32. Mules gay with tassels, the loud din
33. Of muleteers, the tethered ass
34. That crops the dusty wayside grass,
35. And cavaliers with spurs of brass
36. Alighting at the inn;

37. White hamlets hidden in fields of wheat,
38. White cities slumbering by the sea,
39. White sunshine flooding square and street,
40. Dark mountain ranges, at whose feet
41. The river beds are dry with heat,--
42. All was a dream to me.

43. Yet something sombre and severe
44. O'er the enchanted landscape reigned;
45. A terror in the atmosphere
46. As if King Philip listened near,
47. Or Torquemada, the austere,
48. His ghostly sway maintained.

49. The softer Andalusian skies
50. Dispelled the sadness and the gloom;
51. There Cadiz by the seaside lies,
52. And Seville's orange-orchards rise,
53. Making the land a paradise
54. Of beauty and of bloom.

55. There Cordova is hidden among
56. The palm, the olive, and the vine;
57. Gem of the South, by poets sung,
58. And in whose Mosque Ahmanzor hung
59. As lamps the bells that once had rung
60. At Compostella's shrine.

61. But over all the rest supreme,
62. The star of stars, the cynosure,
63. The artist's and the poet's theme,
64. The young man's vision, the old man's dream,--
65. Granada by its winding stream,
66. The city of the Moor!

67. And there the Alhambra still recalls
68. Aladdin's palace of delight;
69. Allah il Allah! through its halls
70. Whispers the fountain as it falls,
71. The Darro darts beneath its walls,
72. The hills with snow are white.

73. Ah yes, the hills are white with snow,
74. And cold with blasts that bite and freeze;
75. But in the happy vale below
76. The orange and pomegranate grow,
77. And wafts of air toss to and fro
78. The blossoming almond trees.

79. The Vega cleft by the Xenil,
80. The fascination and allure
81. Of the sweet landscape chains the will;
82. The traveller lingers on the hill,
83. His parted lips are breathing still
84. The last sigh of the Moor.

85. How like a ruin overgrown
86. With flowers that hide the rents of time,
87. Stands now the Past that I have known;
88. Castles in Spain, not built of stone
89. But of white summer clouds, and blown
90. Into this little mist of rhyme!
