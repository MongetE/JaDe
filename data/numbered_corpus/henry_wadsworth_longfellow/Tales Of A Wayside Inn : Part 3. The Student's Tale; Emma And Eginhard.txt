1. When Alcuin taught the sons of Charlemagne,
2. In the free schools of Aix, how kings should reign,
3. And with them taught the children of the poor
4. How subjects should be patient and endure,
5. He touched the lips of some, as best befit,
6. With honey from the hives of Holy Writ;
7. Others intoxicated with the wine
8. Of ancient history, sweet but less divine;
9. Some with the wholesome fruits of grammar fed;
10. Others with mysteries of the stars o'er-head,
11. That hang suspended in the vaulted sky
12. Like lamps in some fair palace vast and high.
13. In sooth, it was a pleasant sight to see
14. That Saxon monk, with hood and rosary,
15. With inkhorn at his belt, and pen and book,
16. And mingled lore and reverence in his look,
17. Or hear the cloister and the court repeat
18. The measured footfalls of his sandaled feet,
19. Or watch him with the pupils of his school,
20. Gentle of speech, but absolute of rule.

21. Among them, always earliest in his place.
22. Was Eginhard, a youth of Frankish race,
23. Whose face was bright with flashes that forerun
24. The splendors of a yet unrisen sun.
25. To him all things were possible, and seemed
26. Not what he had accomplished, but had dreamed,
27. And what were tasks to others were his play,
28. The pastime of an idle holiday.

29. Smaragdo, Abbot of St. Michael's, said,
30. With many a shrug and shaking of the head,
31. Surely some demon must possess the lad,
32. Who showed more wit than ever schoolboy had,
33. And learned his Trivium thus without the rod;
34. But Alcuin said it was the grace of God.

35. Thus he grew up, in Logic point-device,
36. Perfect in Grammar, and in Rhetoric nice;
37. Science of Numbers, Geometric art,
38. And lore of Stars, and Music knew by heart;
39. A Minnesinger, long before the times
40. Of those who sang their love in Suabian rhymes.

41. The Emperor, when he heard this good report
42. Of Eginhard much buzzed about the court,
43. Said to himself, 'This stripling seems to be
44. Purposely sent into the world for me;
45. He shall become my scribe, and shall be schooled
46. In all the arts whereby the world is ruled.'
47. Thus did the gentle Eginhard attain
48. To honor in the court of Charlemagne;
49. Became the sovereign's favorite, his right hand,
50. So that his fame was great in all the land,
51. And all men loved him for his modest grace
52. And comeliness of figure and of face.
53. An inmate of the palace, yet recluse,
54. A man of books, yet sacred from abuse
55. Among the armed knights with spur on heel,
56. The tramp of horses and the clang of steel;
57. And as the Emperor promised he was schooled
58. In all the arts by which the world is ruled.
59. But the one art supreme, whose law is fate,
60. The Emperor never dreamed of till too late.

61. Home from her convent to the palace came
62. The lovely Princess Emma, whose sweet name,
63. Whispered by seneschal or sung by bard,
64. Had often touched the soul of Eginhard.
65. He saw her from his window, as in state
66. She came, by knights attended through the gate;
67. He saw her at the banquet of that day,
68. Fresh as the morn, and beautiful as May;
69. He saw her in the garden, as she strayed
70. Among the flowers of summer with her maid,
71. And said to him, 'O Eginhard, disclose
72. The meaning and the mystery of the rose';
73. And trembling he made answer: 'In good sooth,
74. Its mystery is love, its meaning youth!'

75. How can I tell the signals and the signs
76. By which one heart another heart divines?
77. How can I tell the many thousand ways
78. By which it keeps the secret it betrays?

79. O mystery of love! O strange romance!
80. Among the Peers and Paladins of France,
81. Shining in steel, and prancing on gay steeds,
82. Noble by birth, yet nobler by great deeds,
83. The Princess Emma had no words nor looks
84. But for this clerk, this man of thought and books.

85. The summer passed, the autumn came; the stalks
86. Of lilies blackened in the garden walks;
87. The leaves fell, russet-golden and blood-red,
88. Love-letters thought the poet fancy-led,
89. Or Jove descending in a shower of gold
90. Into the lap of DanaÃ« of old;
91. For poets cherish many a strange conceit,
92. And love transmutes all nature by its heat.
93. No more the garden lessons, nor the dark
94. And hurried meetings in the twilight park;
95. But now the studious lamp, and the delights
96. Of firesides in the silent winter nights,
97. And watching from his window hour by hour
98. The light that burned in Princess Emma's tower.

99. At length one night, while musing by the fire,
100. O'ercome at last by his insane desire,--
101. For what will reckless love not do and dare??
102. He crossed the court, and climbed the winding stair,
103. With some feigned message in the Emperor's name;
104. But when he to the lady's presence came
105. He knelt down at her feet, until she laid
106. Her hand upon him, like a naked blade,
107. And whispered in his ear: 'Arise, Sir Knight,
108. To my heart's level, O my heart's delight.'

109. And there he lingered till the crowing cock,
110. The Alectryon of the farmyard and the flock,
111. Sang his aubade with lusty voice and clear,
112. To tell the sleeping world that dawn was near.
113. And then they parted; but at parting, lo!
114. They saw the palace courtyard white with snow,
115. And, placid as a nun, the moon on high
116. Gazing from cloudy cloisters of the sky.
117. 'Alas!' he said, 'how hide the fatal line
118. Of footprints leading from thy door to mine,
119. And none returning!' Ah, he little knew
120. What woman's wit, when put to proof, can do!

121. That night the Emperor, sleepless with the cares
122. And troubles that attend on state affairs,
123. Had risen before the dawn, and musing gazed
124. Into the silent night, as one amazed
125. To see the calm that reigned o'er all supreme,
126. When his own reign was but a troubled dream.
127. The moon lit up the gables capped with snow,
128. And the white roofs, and half the court below,
129. And he beheld a form, that seemed to cower
130. Beneath a burden, come from Emma's tower,--
131. A woman, who upon her shoulders bore
132. Clerk Eginhard to his own private door,
133. And then returned in haste, but still essayed
134. To tread the footprints she herself had made;
135. And as she passed across the lighted space,
136. The Emperor saw his daughter Emma's face!

137. He started not; he did not speak or moan,
138. But seemed as one who hath been turned to stone;
139. And stood there like a statue, nor awoke
140. Out of his trance of pain, till morning broke,
141. Till the stars faded, and the moon went down,
142. And o'er the towers and steeples of the town
143. Came the gray daylight; then the sun, who took
144. The empire of the world with sovereign look,
145. Suffusing with a soft and golden glow
146. All the dead landscape in its shroud of snow,
147. Touching with flame the tapering chapel spires,
148. Windows and roofs, and smoke of household fires,
149. And kindling park and palace as he came;
150. The stork's nest on the chimney seemed in flame.
151. And thus he stood till Eginhard appeared,
152. Demure and modest with his comely beard
153. And flowing flaxen tresses, come to ask,
154. As was his wont, the day's appointed task.
155. The Emperor looked upon him with a smile,
156. And gently said: 'My son, wait yet awhile;
157. This hour my council meets upon some great
158. And very urgent business of the state.
159. Come back within the hour. On thy return
160. The work appointed for thee shalt thou learn.?
161. Having dismissed this gallant Troubadour,
162. He summoned straight his council, and secure
163. And steadfast in his purpose, from the throne
164. All the adventure of the night made known;
165. Then asked for sentence; and with eager breath
166. Some answered banishment, and others death.

167. Then spake the king: 'Your sentence is not mine;
168. Life is the gift of God, and is divine;
169. Nor from these palace walls shall one depart
170. Who carries such a secret in his heart;
171. My better judgment points another way.
172. Good Alcuin, I remember how one day
173. When my Pepino asked you, 'What are men?'
174. You wrote upon his tablets with your pen,
175. 'Guests of the grave and travellers that pass!'
176. This being true of all men, we, alas!
177. Being all fashioned of the selfsame dust,
178. Let us be merciful as well as just;
179. This passing traveller, who hath stolen away
180. The brightest jewel of my crown to-day,
181. Shall of himself the precious gem restore;
182. By giving it, I make it mine once more.
183. Over those fatal footprints I will throw
184. My ermine mantle like another snow.'

185. Then Eginhard was summoned to the hall,
186. And entered, and in presence of them all,
187. The Emperor said: 'My son, for thou to me
188. Hast been a son, and evermore shalt be,
189. Long hast thou served thy sovereign, and thy zeal
190. Pleads to me with importunate appeal,
191. While I have been forgetful to requite
192. Thy service and affection as was right.
193. But now the hour is come, when I, thy Lord,
194. Will crown thy love with such supreme reward,
195. A gift so precious kings have striven in vain
196. To win it from the hands of Charlemagne.'
197. Then sprang the portals of the chamber wide,
198. And Princess Emma entered, in the pride
199. Of birth and beauty, that in part o'er-came
200. The conscious terror and the blush of shame.
201. And the good Emperor rose up from his throne,
202. And taking her white hand within his own
203. Placed it in Eginhard's, and said: 'My son
204. This is the gift thy constant zeal hath won;
205. Thus I repay the royal debt I owe,
206. And cover up the footprints in the snow.'
