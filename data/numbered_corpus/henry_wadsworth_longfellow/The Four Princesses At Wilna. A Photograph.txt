1. Sweet faces, that from pictured casements lean
2. As from a castle window, looking down
3. On some gay pageant passing through a town,
4. Yourselves the fairest figures in the scene;
5. With what a gentle grace, with what serene
6. Unconsciousness ye wear the triple crown
7. Of youth and beauty and the fair renown
8. Of a great name, that ne'er hath tarnished been!
9. From your soft eyes, so innocent and sweet,
10. Four spirits, sweet and innocent as they,
11. Gaze on the world below, the sky above;
12. Hark! there is some one singing in the street;
13. 'Faith, Hope, and Love! these three,' he seems to say;
14. 'These three; and greatest of the three is Love.'
