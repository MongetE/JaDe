1. Short of stature, large of limb,
2. Burly face and russet beard,
3. All the women stared at him,
4. When in Iceland he appeared.
5. 'Look!' they said,
6. With nodding head,
7. 'There goes Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.'

8. All the prayers he knew by rote,
9. He could preach like Chrysostome,
10. From the Fathers he could quote,
11. He had even been at Rome,
12. A learned clerk,
13. A man of mark,
14. Was this Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

15. He was quarrelsome and loud,
16. And impatient of control,
17. Boisterous in the market crowd,
18. Boisterous at the wassail-bowl,
19. Everywhere
20. Would drink and swear,
21. Swaggering Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest

22. In his house this malcontent
23. Could the King no longer bear,
24. So to Iceland he was sent
25. To convert the heathen there,
26. And away
27. One summer day
28. Sailed this Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

29. There in Iceland, o'er their books
30. Pored the people day and night,
31. But he did not like their looks,
32. Nor the songs they used to write.
33. 'All this rhyme
34. Is waste of time!'
35. Grumbled Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

36. To the alehouse, where he sat
37. Came the Scalds and Saga-men;
38. Is it to be wondered at,
39. That they quarrelled now and then,
40. When o'er his beer
41. Began to leer
42. Drunken Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest?

43. All the folk in Altafiord
44. Boasted of their island grand;
45. Saying in a single word,
46. 'Iceland is the finest land
47. That the sun
48. Doth shine upon!'
49. Loud laughed Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

50. And he answered: 'What's the use
51. Of this bragging up and down,
52. When three women and one goose
53. Make a market in your town!'
54. Every Scald
55. Satires drawled
56. On poor Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

57. Something worse they did than that;
58. And what vexed him most of all
59. Was a figure in shovel hat,
60. Drawn in charcoal on the wall;
61. With words that go
62. Sprawling below,
63. 'This is Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.'

64. Hardly knowing what he did,
65. Then he smote them might and main,
66. Thorvald Veile and Veterlid
67. Lay there in the alehouse slain.
68. 'To-day we are gold,
69. To-morrow mould!'
70. Muttered Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.

71. Much in fear of axe and rope,
72. Back to Norway sailed he then.
73. 'O King Olaf! little hope
74. Is there of these Iceland men!'
75. Meekly said,
76. With bending head,
77. Pious Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.
