1. For thee was a house built
2. Ere thou wast born,
3. For thee was a mould meant
4. Ere thou of mother camest.
5. But it is not made ready,
6. Nor its depth measured,
7. Nor is it seen
8. How long it shall be.
9. Now I bring thee
10. Where thou shalt be;
11. Now I shall measure thee,
12. And the mould afterwards.

13. Thy house is not
14. Highly timbered,
15. It is unhigh and low;
16. When thou art therein,
17. The heel-ways are low,
18. The side-ways unhigh.
19. The roof is built
20. Thy breast full nigh,
21. So thou shalt in mould
22. Dwell full cold,
23. Dimly and dark.

24. Doorless is that house,
25. And dark it is within;
26. There thou art fast detained
27. And Death hath the key.
28. Loathsome is that earth-house,
29. And grim within to dwell.
30. There thou shalt dwell,
31. And worms shall divide thee.

32. Thus thou art laid,
33. And leavest thy friends
34. Thou hast no friend,
35. Who will come to thee,
36. Who will ever see
37. How that house pleaseth thee;
38. Who will ever open
39. The door for thee,
40. And descend for thee;
41. For soon thou art loathsome
42. And hateful to see.
