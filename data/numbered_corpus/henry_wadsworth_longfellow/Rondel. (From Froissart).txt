1. Love, love, what wilt thou with this heart of mine?
2. Naught see I fixed or sure in thee!
3. I do not know thee,--nor what deeds are thine:
4. Love, love, what wilt thou with this heart of mine?
5. Naught see I fixed or sure in thee!

6. Shall I be mute, or vows with prayers combine?
7. Ye who are blessed in loving, tell it me:
8. Love, love, what wilt thou with this heart of mine?
9. Naught see I permanent or sure in thee!
