1. Now from all King Olaf's farms
2. His men-at-arms
3. Gathered on the Eve of Easter;
4. To his house at Angvalds-ness
5. Fast they press,
6. Drinking with the royal feaster.

7. Loudly through the wide-flung door
8. Came the roar
9. Of the sea upon the Skerry;
10. And its thunder loud and near
11. Reached the ear,
12. Mingling with their voices merry.

13. 'Hark!' said Olaf to his Scald,
14. Halfred the Bald,
15. 'Listen to that song, and learn it!
16. Half my kingdom would I give,
17. As I live,
18. If by such songs you would earn it!

19. 'For of all the runes and rhymes
20. Of all times,
21. Best I like the ocean's dirges,
22. When the old harper heaves and rocks,
23. His hoary locks
24. Flowing and flashing in the surges!'

25. Halfred answered: 'I am called
26. The Unappalled!
27. Nothing hinders me or daunts me.
28. Hearken to me, then, O King,
29. While I sing
30. The great Ocean Song that haunts me.'

31. 'I will hear your song sublime
32. Some other time,'
33. Says the drowsy monarch, yawning,
34. And retires; each laughing guest
35. Applauds the jest;
36. Then they sleep till day is dawning.

37. Facing up and down the yard,
38. King Olaf's guard
39. Saw the sea-mist slowly creeping
40. O'er the sands, and up the hill,
41. Gathering still
42. Round the house where they were sleeping.

43. It was not the fog he saw,
44. Nor misty flaw,
45. That above the landscape brooded;
46. It was Eyvind Kallda's crew
47. Of warlocks blue
48. With their caps of darkness hooded!

49. Round and round the house they go,
50. Weaving slow
51. Magic circles to encumber
52. And imprison in their ring
53. Olaf the King,
54. As he helpless lies in slumber.

55. Then athwart the vapors dun
56. The Easter sun
57. Streamed with one broad track of splendor!
58. In their real forms appeared
59. The warlocks weird,
60. Awful as the Witch of Endor.

61. Blinded by the light that glared,
62. They groped and stared,
63. Round about with steps unsteady;
64. From his window Olaf gazed,
65. And, amazed,
66. 'Who are these strange people?' said he.

67. 'Eyvind Kallda and his men!'
68. Answered then
69. From the yard a sturdy farmer;
70. While the men-at-arms apace
71. Filled the place,
72. Busily buckling on their armor.

73. From the gates they sallied forth,
74. South and north,
75. Scoured the island coast around them,
76. Seizing all the warlock band,
77. Foot and hand
78. On the Skerry's rocks they bound them.

79. And at eve the king again
80. Called his train,
81. And, with all the candles burning,
82. Silent sat and heard once more
83. The sullen roar
84. Of the ocean tides returning.

85. Shrieks and cries of wild despair
86. Filled the air,
87. Growing fainter as they listened;
88. Then the bursting surge alone
89. Sounded on;--
90. Thus the sorcerers were christened!

91. 'Sing, O Scald, your song sublime,
92. Your ocean-rhyme,'
93. Cried King Olaf: 'it will cheer me!'
94. Said the Scald, with pallid cheeks,
95. 'The Skerry of Shrieks
96. Sings too loud for you to hear me!'
