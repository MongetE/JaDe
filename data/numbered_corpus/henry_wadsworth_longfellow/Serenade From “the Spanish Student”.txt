1. STARS of the summer night!
2. Far in yon azure deeps,
3. Hide, hide your golden light!
4. She sleeps!
5. My lady sleeps!
6. Sleeps!
7. Moon of the summer night!
8. Far down yon western steeps,
9. Sink, sink in silver light!
10. She sleeps!
11. My lady sleeps!
12. Sleeps!
13. Wind of the summer night!
14. Where yonder woodbine creeps,
15. Fold, fold thy pinions light!
16. She sleeps!
17. My lady sleeps!
18. Sleeps!
19. Dreams of the summer night!
20. Tell her, her lover keeps
21. Watch! while in slumbers light
22. She sleeps!
23. My lady sleeps!
24. Sleeps!
