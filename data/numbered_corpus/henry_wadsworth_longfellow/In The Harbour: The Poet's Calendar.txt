1. JANUARY

2. Janus am I; oldest of potentates;
3. Forward I look, and backward, and below
4. I count, as god of avenues and gates,
5. The years that through my portals come and go.

6. I block the roads, and drift the fields with snow;
7. I chase the wild-fowl from the frozen fen;
8. My frosts congeal the rivers in their flow,
9. My fires light up the hearths and hearts of men.


10. FEBRUARY

11. I am lustration, and the sea is mine!
12. I wash the sands and headlands with my tide;
13. My brow is crowned with branches of the pine;
14. Before my chariot-wheels the fishes glide.
15. By me all things unclean are purified,
16. By me the souls of men washed white again;
17. E'en the unlovely tombs of those who died
18. Without a dirge, I cleanse from every stain.


19. MARCH

20. I Martius am! Once first, and now the third!
21. To lead the Year was my appointed place;
22. A mortal dispossessed me by a word,
23. And set there Janus with the double face.
24. Hence I make war on all the human race;
25. I shake the cities with my hurricanes;
26. I flood the rivers and their banks efface,
27. And drown the farms and hamlets with my rains.


28. APRIL

29. I open wide the portals of the Spring
30. To welcome the procession of the flowers,
31. With their gay banners, and the birds that sing
32. Their song of songs from their aerial towers.
33. I soften with my sunshine and my showers
34. The heart of earth; with thoughts of love I glide
35. Into the hearts of men; and with the Hours
36. Upon the Bull with wreathed horns I ride.


37. MAY

38. Hark! The sea-faring wild-fowl loud proclaim
39. My coming, and the swarming of the bees.
40. These are my heralds, and behold! my name
41. Is written in blossoms on the hawthorn-trees.
42. I tell the mariner when to sail the seas;
43. I waft o'er all the land from far away
44. The breath and bloom of the Hesperides,
45. My birthplace. I am Maia. I am May.


46. JUNE

47. Mine is the Month of Roses; yes, and mine
48. The Month of Marriages! All pleasant sights
49. And scents, the fragrance of the blossoming vine,
50. The foliage of the valleys and the heights.
51. Mine are the longest days, the loveliest nights;
52. The mower's scythe makes music to my ear;
53. I am the mother of all dear delights;
54. I am the fairest daughter of the year.


55. JULY

56. My emblem is the Lion, and I breathe
57. The breath of Libyan deserts o'er the land;
58. My sickle as a sabre I unsheathe,
59. And bent before me the pale harvests stand.
60. The lakes and rivers shrink at my command,
61. And there is thirst and fever in the air;
62. The sky is changed to brass, the earth to sand;
63. I am the Emperor whose name I bear.


64. AUGUST

65. The Emperor Octavian, called the August,
66. I being his favorite, bestowed his name
67. Upon me, and I hold it still in trust,
68. In memory of him and of his fame.
69. I am the Virgin, and my vestal flame
70. Burns less intensely than the Lion's rage;
71. Sheaves are my only garlands, and I claim
72. The golden Harvests as my heritage.


73. SEPTEMBER

74. I bear the Scales, where hang in equipoise
75. The night and day; and when unto my lips
76. I put my trumpet, with its stress and noise
77. Fly the white clouds like tattered sails of ships;
78. The tree-tops lash the air with sounding whips;
79. Southward the clamorous sea-fowl wing their flight;
80. The hedges are all red with haws and hips,
81. The Hunter's Moon reigns empress of the night.


82. OCTOBER

83. My ornaments are fruits; my garments leaves,
84. Woven like cloth of gold, and crimson dyed;
85. I do not boast the harvesting of sheaves,
86. O'er orchards and o'er vineyards I preside.
87. Though on the frigid Scorpion I ride,
88. The dreamy air is full, and overflows
89. With tender memories of the summer-tide,
90. And mingled voices of the doves and crows.

91. NOVEMBER

92. The Centaur, Sagittarius, am I,
93. Born of Ixion's and the cloud's embrace;
94. With sounding hoofs across the earth I fly,
95. A steed Thessalian with a human face.
96. Sharp winds the arrows are with which I chase
97. The leaves, half dead already with affright;
98. I shroud myself in gloom; and to the race
99. Of mortals bring nor comfort nor delight.


100. DECEMBER

101. Riding upon the Goat, with snow-white hair,
102. I come, the last of all. This crown of mine
103. Is of the holly; in my hand I bear
104. The thyrsus, tipped with fragrant cones of pine.
105. I celebrate the birth of the Divine,
106. And the return of the Saturnian reign;--
107. My songs are carols sung at every shrine.
108. Proclaiming 'Peace on earth, good will to men.'
