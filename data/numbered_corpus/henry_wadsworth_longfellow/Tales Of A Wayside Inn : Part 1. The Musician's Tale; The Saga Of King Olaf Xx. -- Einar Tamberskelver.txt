1. It was Einar Tamberskelver
2. Stood beside the mast;
3. From his yew-bow, tipped with silver,
4. Flew the arrows fast;
5. Aimed at Eric unavailing,
6. As he sat concealed,
7. Half behind the quarter-railing,
8. Half behind his shield.

9. First an arrow struck the tiller,
10. Just above his head;
11. 'Sing, O Eyvind Skaldaspiller,'
12. Then Earl Eric said.
13. 'Sing the song of Hakon dying,
14. Sing his funeral wail!'
15. And another arrow flying
16. Grazed his coat of mail.

17. Turning to a Lapland yeoman,
18. As the arrow passed,
19. Said Earl Eric, 'Shoot that bowman
20. Standing by the mast.'
21. Sooner than the word was spoken
22. Flew the yeoman's shaft;
23. Einar's bow in twain was broken,
24. Einar only laughed.

25. 'What was that?' said Olaf, standing
26. On the quarter-deck.
27. 'Something heard I like the stranding
28. Of a shattered wreck.'
29. Einar then, the arrow taking
30. From the loosened string,
31. Answered, 'That was Norway breaking
32. From thy hand, O King!'

33. 'Thou art but a poor diviner,'
34. Straightway Olaf said;
35. 'Take my bow, and swifter, Einar,
36. Let thy shafts be sped.'
37. Of his bows the fairest choosing,
38. Reached he from above;
39. Einar saw the blood-drops oozing
40. Through his iron glove.

41. But the bow was thin and narrow;
42. At the first assay,
43. O'er its head he drew the arrow,
44. Flung the bow away;
45. Said, with hot and angry temper
46. Flushing in his cheek,
47. 'Olaf! for so great a KÃ¤mper
48. Are thy bows too weak!'

49. Then, with smile of joy defiant
50. On his beardless lip,
51. Scaled he, light and self-reliant,
52. Eric's dragon-ship.
53. Loose his golden locks were flowing,
54. Bright his armor gleamed;
55. Like Saint Michael overthrowing
56. Lucifer he seemed.
