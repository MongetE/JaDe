1. Taddeo Gaddi built me. I am old,
2. Five centuries old. I plant my foot of stone
3. Upon the Arno, as St. Michael's own
4. Was planted on the dragon. Fold by fold
5. Beneath me as it struggles. I behold
6. Its glistening scales. Twice hath it overthrown
7. My kindred and companions. Me alone
8. It moveth not, but is by me controlled.
9. I can remember when the Medici
10. Were driven from Florence; longer still ago
11. The final wars of Ghibelline and Guelf.
12. Florence adorns me with her jewelry;
13. And when I think that Michael Angelo
14. Hath leaned on me, I glory in myself.
