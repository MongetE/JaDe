1. I stood on the bridge at midnight,
2. As the clocks were striking the hour,
3. And the moon rose o'er the city,
4. Behind the dark church-tower.

5. I saw her bright reflection
6. In the watrers under me,
7. Like a golden goblet falling
8. And sinking into the sea.

9. And far in the hazy distance
10. Of that lovely night in June,
11. The blaze of the gleaming furnace
12. Gleamed redder than the moon.

13. Among the long, black rafters
14. The wavering shadows lay,
15. And the current that came from the ocean
16. Seemed to lift and bear them away.

17. As, sweeping and eddying through them
18. Rose the belated tide,
19. And, streaming into the moonlight,
20. The seaweed floated wide.

21. And like those waters rushing
22. Among the wooden piers,
23. A flood of thoughts came o'er me
24. That filled my eyes with tears.

25. How often, oh how often,
26. In the days that had gone by,
27. I had stood on that bridge at midnight
28. And gazed on that wave and sky!

29. How often oh how often,
30. I had wished that the ebbing tide
31. Would bear me away on its bosom
32. O'er the ocean wild and wide!

33. For my heart was hot and restless,
34. And my life was full of care,
35. And the burden laid upon me
36. Seemed greater than I could bear.

37. But now it has fallen from me,
38. It is buried in the sea;
39. And only the sorrow of others
40. Throws its shadow over me.

41. Yet whenever I cross the river
42. On its bridge with wooden piers,
43. Like the odor of brine from the ocean
44. Comes the thought of other years.

45. And I think how many thousands
46. Of care-encumbered men,
47. Each bearing his burden of sorrow,
48. Have crossed the bridge since then.

49. I see the long procession
50. Still passing to and fro,
51. The young heart hot and restless,
52. And the old subdued and slow!

53. And forever and forever,
54. As long as the river flows,
55. As long as the heart has passions,
56. As long as life has woes;

57. The moon and its broken reflection
58. Aand its shadows shall appear,
59. As the symbol of love in heaven,
60. And its wavering image here.
