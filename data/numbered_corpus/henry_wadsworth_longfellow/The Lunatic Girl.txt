1. Most beautiful, most gentle! Yet how lost
2. To all that gladdens the fair earth; the eye
3. That watched her being; the maternal care
4. That kept and nourished her; and the calm light
5. That steals from our own thoughts, and softly rests
6. On youth's green vallies and smooth-sliding waters.
7. Alas! few suns of life, and fewer winds,
8. Had withered or had wasted the fresh rose
9. That bloomed upon her cheek; but one chill frost
10. Came in that early Autumn, when ripe thought
11. Is rich and beautiful, and blighted it;
12. And the fair stalk grew languid day by day,
13. And drooped -- and drooped, and shed its many leaves.
14. 'Tis said that some have died of love; and some,
15. Love's passionate feelings and heart-wasting cares,
16. have spurned life's threshold with a desperate foot:
17. And others have gone mad,-- and she was one!--
18. Her lover died at sea; and they had felt
19. A coldness for each other when they parted;
20. But love returned again, and to her ear
21. Came tidings that the ship which bore her lover
22. Had sullenly gone down at sea, and all were lost.
23. I saw her in her native vale, when high
24. The aspiring lark up from the reedy river
25. Mounted, on cheerful pinion; and she sat
26. Casting smooth pebbles into a clear fountain,
27. And marking how they sunk; and oft she sighed
28. For him that perished thus in the vast deep.
29. She had a sea-shell, that her lover brought
30. From the far-distant ocean, and she pressed
31. Its smooth cold lips unto her ear, and thought
32. It whispered tiding of the dark blue sea;
33. And sad, she cried, 'The tides are out!-- and now
34. I see his corse upon the stormy beach!'
35. Around her neck a string of rose-lipped shells,
36. And coral, and white pearl, was loosely hung;
37. And close beside her lay a delicate fan,
38. Made of the halcyon's blue wing; and when
39. She looked upon it, it would calm her thoughts
40. As that bird calms the ocean,-- for it gave
41. Mournful, yet pleasant, memory. Once I marked,
42. When through the mountain hollows and green woods,
43. That bent beneath its footsteps, the loud wind
44. Came with a voice as of the restless deep,
45. She raised her head, and on her pale, cold cheek
46. A beauty of diviner seeming came;
47. And then she spread her hands, and smiled, as if
48. She welcomed a long absent friend,-- and then
49. Shrunk timorously back again, and wept.
50. I turned away a multitude of thoughts,
51. Mournful and dark, were crowding on my mind;
52. And as I left that lost and ruined one,--
53. A living monument that still on earth
54. There is warm love and deep sincerity,--
55. She gazed upon the west, where the blue sky
56. Held, like an ccean, in its wide embrace
57. Those fairy islands of bright cloud, that lay
58. So calm and quietly in the thin ether.
59. And then she pointed where, alone and high,
60. One little cloud sailed onward, like a lost
61. And wandering bark, and fainter grew, and fainter,
62. And soon was swallowed up in the blue depths;
63. And, when it sunk away, she turned again
64. With sad despondency and tears to earth.

65. Three long and weary months -- yet not a whisper
66. Of stern reproach for that cold parting! Then
67. She sat no longer by her favorite fountain!--
68. She was at rest forever.
