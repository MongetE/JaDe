1. Well pleased the audience heard the tale.
2. The Theologian said: 'Indeed,
3. To praise you there is little need;
4. One almost hears the farmers flail
5. Thresh out your wheat, nor does there fail
6. A certain freshness, as you said,
7. And sweetness as of home-made bread.
8. But not less sweet and not less fresh
9. Are many legends that I know,
10. Writ by the monks of long-ago,
11. Who loved to mortify the flesh,
12. So that the soul might purer grow,
13. And rise to a diviner state;
14. And one of these--perhaps of all
15. Most beautiful--I now recall,
16. And with permission will narrate;
17. Hoping thereby to make amends
18. For that grim tragedy of mine,
19. As strong and black as Spanish wine,
20. I told last night, and wish almost
21. It had remained untold, my friends;
22. For Torquemada's awful ghost
23. Came to me in the dreams I dreamed,
24. And in the darkness glared and gleamed
25. Like a great lighthouse on the coast.'

26. The Student laughing said: 'Far more
27. Like to some dismal fire of bale
28. Flaring portentous on a hill;
29. Or torches lighted on a shore
30. By wreckers in a midnight gale.
31. No matter; be it as you will,
32. Only go forward with your tale.'
