1. Southward with fleet of ice
2. Sailed the corsair Death;
3. Wild and gast blew the blast,
4. And the east-wind was his breath.
5. His lordly ships of ice
6. Glisten in the sun;
7. On each side, like pennons wide,
8. Flashing crystal streamlets run.
9. His sails of white sea-mist
10. Dripped with silver rain;
11. But where he passed there were cast
12. Leaden shadows o'er the main.

13. Eastward from Campobello
14. Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed;
15. Three days or more seaward he bore,
16. Then, alas! the land-wind failed.

17. Alas! the land-wind failed,
18. And ice-cold grew the night;
19. And nevermore, on sea or shore,
20. Should Sir Humphrey see the light.

21. He sat upon the deck,
22. The Book was in his hand;
23. "Do not fear! Heaven is as near,"
24. He said, "by water as by land!"

25. In the first watch of the night,
26. Without a signal's sound,
27. Out of the sea, mysteriously,
28. The fleet of Death rose all around.

29. The moon and the evening star
30. Were hanging in the shrouds;
31. Every mast, as it passed,
32. Seemed to rake the passing clouds.

33. They grappled with their prize,
34. At midnight black and cold!
35. As of a rock was the shock;
36. Heavily the ground-swell rolled.

37. Southward through day and dark,
38. They drift in cold embrace,
39. With mist and rain, o'er the open main;
40. Yet there seems no change of place.

41. Southward, forever southward,
42. They drift through dark and day;
43. And like a dream, in the Gulf-Stream
44. Sinking, vanish all away.
