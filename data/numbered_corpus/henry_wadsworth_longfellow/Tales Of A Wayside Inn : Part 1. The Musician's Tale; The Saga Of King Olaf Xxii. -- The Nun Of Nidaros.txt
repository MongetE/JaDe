1. In the convent of Drontheim,
2. Alone in her chamber
3. Knelt Astrid the Abbess,
4. At midnight, adoring,
5. Beseeching, entreating
6. The Virgin and Mother.

7. She heard in the silence
8. The voice of one speaking,
9. Without in the darkness,
10. In gusts of the night-wind,
11. Now louder, now nearer,
12. Now lost in the distance.

13. The voice of a stranger
14. It seemed as she listened,
15. Of some one who answered,
16. Beseeching, imploring,
17. A cry from afar off
18. She could not distinguish.

19. The voice of Saint John,
20. The beloved disciple,
21. Who wandered and waited
22. The Master's appearance,
23. Alone in the darkness,
24. Unsheltered and friendless.

25. 'It is accepted
26. The angry defiance,
27. The challenge of battle!
28. It is accepted,
29. But not with the weapons
30. Of war that thou wieldest!

31. 'Cross against corselet,
32. Love against hatred,
33. Peace-cry for war-cry!
34. Patience is powerful;
35. He that o'ercometh
36. Hath power o'er the nations!

37. 'As torrents in summer,
38. Half dried in their channels,
39. Suddenly rise, though the
40. Sky is still cloudless,
41. For rain has been falling
42. Far off at their fountains;

43. So hearts that are fainting
44. Grow full to o'erflowing,
45. And they that behold it
46. Marvel, and know not
47. That God at their fountains
48. Far off has been raining!

49. 'Stronger than steel
50. Is the sword of the Spirit;
51. Swifter than arrows
52. The light of the truth is,
53. Greater than anger
54. Is love, and subdueth!

55. 'Thou art a phantom,
56. A shape of the sea-mist,
57. A shape of the brumal
58. Rain, and the darkness
59. Fearful and formless;
60. Day dawns and thou art not!

61. 'The dawn is not distant,
62. Nor is the night starless;
63. Love is eternal!
64. God is still God, and
65. His faith shall not fail us;
66. Christ is eternal!'
