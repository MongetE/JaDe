1. When the warm sun, that brings
2. Seed-time and harvest, has returned again,
3. 'T is sweet to visit the still wood, where springs
4. The first flower of the plain.

5. I love the season well,
6. When forest glades are teeming with bright forms,
7. Nor dark and many-folded clouds foretell
8. The coming-on of storms.

9. From the earth's loosened mould
10. The sapling draws its sustenance, and thrives;
11. Though stricken to the heart with winter's cold,
12. The drooping tree revives.

13. The softly-warbled song
14. Comes from the pleasant woods, and colored wings
15. Glance quick in the bright sun, that moves along
16. The forest openings.

17. When the bright sunset fills
18. The silver woods with light, the green slope throws
19. Its shadows in the hollows of the hills,
20. And wide the upland glows.

21. And when the eve is born,
22. In the blue lake the sky, o'er-reaching far,
23. Is hollowed out and the moon dips her horn,
24. And twinkles many a star.

25. Inverted in the tide
26. Stand the gray rocks, and trembling shadows throw,
27. And the fair trees look over, side by side,
28. And see themselves below.

29. Sweet April! many a thought
30. Is wedded unto thee, as hearts are wed;
31. Nor shall they fail, till, to its autumn brought,
32. Life's golden fruit is shed.
