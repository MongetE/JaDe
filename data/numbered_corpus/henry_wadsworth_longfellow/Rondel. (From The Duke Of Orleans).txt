1. Hence away, begone, begone,
2. Carking care and melancholy!Think ye thus to govern me
3. All my life long, as ye have done?
4. That shall ye not, I promise ye;
5. Reason shall have the mastery.
6. So hence away, begone, begone,
7. Carking care and melancholy!
8. If ever ye return this way,
9. With your mournful company,
10. A curse be on ye, and the day
11. That brings ye moping back to me!
12. Hence away, begone, I say!
13. Carking care and melancholy!
