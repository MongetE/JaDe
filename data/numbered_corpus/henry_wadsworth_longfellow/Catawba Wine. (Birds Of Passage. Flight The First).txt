1. This song of mine
2. Is a Song of the Vine,
3. To be sung by the glowing embers
4. Of wayside inns,
5. When the rain begins
6. To darken the drear Novembers.

7. It is not a song
8. Of the Scuppernong,
9. From warm Carolinian valleys,
10. Nor the Isabel
11. And the Muscadel
12. That bask in our garden alleys.

13. Nor the red Mustang,
14. Whose clusters hang
15. O'er the waves of the Colorado,
16. And the fiery flood
17. Of whose purple blood
18. Has a dash of Spanish bravado.

19. For richest and best
20. Is the wine of the West,
21. That grows by the Beautiful River;
22. Whose sweet perfume
23. Fills all the room
24. With a benison on the giver.

25. And as hollow trees
26. Are the haunts of bees,
27. Forever going and coming;
28. So this crystal hive
29. Is all alive
30. With a swarming and buzzing and humming.

31. Very good in its way
32. Is the Verzenay,
33. Or the Sillery soft and creamy;
34. But Catawba wine
35. Has a taste more divine,
36. More dulcet, delicious, and dreamy.

37. There grows no vine
38. By the haunted Rhine,
39. By Danube or Guadalquivir,
40. Nor on island or cape,
41. That bears such a grape
42. As grows by the Beautiful River.

43. Drugged is their juice
44. For foreign use,
45. When shipped o'er the reeling Atlantic,
46. To rack our brains
47. With the fever pains,
48. That have driven the Old World frantic.

49. To the sewers and sinks
50. With all such drinks,
51. And after them tumble the mixer;
52. For a poison malign
53. Is such Borgia wine,
54. Or at best but a Devil's Elixir.

55. While pure as a spring
56. Is the wine I sing,
57. And to praise it, one needs but name it;
58. For Catawba wine
59. Has need of no sign,
60. No tavern-bush to proclaim it.

61. And this Song of the Vine,
62. This greeting of mine,
63. The winds and the birds shall deliver
64. To the Queen of the West,
65. In her garlands dressed,
66. On the banks of the Beautiful River.
