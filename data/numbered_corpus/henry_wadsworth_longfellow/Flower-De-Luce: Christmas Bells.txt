1. I heard the bells on Christmas Day
2. Their old familiar carols play,
3. And wild and sweet
4. The words repeat
5. Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

6. And thought how, as the day had come,
7. The belfries of all Christendom
8. Had rolled along
9. The unbroken song
10. Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

11. Till, ringing, singing on its way,
12. The world revolved from night to day,
13. A voice, a chime
14. A chant sublime
15. Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

16. Then from each black accursed mouth
17. The cannon thundered in the South,
18. And with the sound
19. The carols drowned
20. Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

21. It was as if an earthquake rent
22. The hearth-stones of a continent,
23. And made forlorn
24. The households born
25. Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

26. And in despair I bowed my head;
27. 'There is no peace on earth,' I said;
28. 'For hate is strong,
29. And mocks the song
30. Of peace on earth, good-will to men!'

31. Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
32. 'God is not dead; nor doth he sleep!
33. The Wrong shall fail,
34. The Right prevail,
35. With peace on earth, good-will to men!'
