1. At The Consecration Of Pulaski's Banner.

2. When the dying flame of day
3. Through the chancel shot its ray,
4. Far the glimmering tapers shed
5. Faint light on the cowl√©d head;
6. And the censer burning swung,
7. Where, before the altar, hung
8. The crimson banner, that with prayer
9. Had been consecrated there.
10. And the nuns' sweet hymn was heard the while,
11. Sung low, in the dim, mysterious aisle.

12. 'Take thy banner! May it wave
13. Proudly o'er the good and brave;
14. When the battle's distant wail
15. Breaks the sabbath of our vale.
16. When the clarion's music thrills
17. To the hearts of these lone hills,
18. When the spear in conflict shakes,
19. And the strong lance shivering breaks.

20. 'Take thy banner! and, beneath
21. The battle-cloud's encircling wreath,
22. Guard it, till our homes are free!
23. Guard it! God will prosper thee!
24. In the dark and trying hour,
25. In the breaking forth of power,
26. In the rush of steeds and men,
27. His right hand will shield thee then.

28. 'Take thy banner! But when night
29. Closes round the ghastly fight,
30. If the vanquished warrior bow,
31. Spare him! By our holy vow,
32. By our prayers and many tears,
33. By the mercy that endears,
34. Spare him! he our love hath shared!
35. Spare him! as thou wouldst be spared!

36. 'Take thy banner! and if e'er
37. Thou shouldst press the soldier's bier,
38. And the muffled drum should beat
39. To the tread of mournful feet,
40. Then this crimson flag shall be
41. Martial cloak and shroud for thee.'

42. The warrior took that banner proud,
43. And it was his martial cloak and shroud!
