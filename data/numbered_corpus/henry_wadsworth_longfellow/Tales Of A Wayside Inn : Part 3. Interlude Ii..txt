1. Well pleased all listened to the tale,
2. That drew, the Student said, its pith
3. And marrow from the ancient myth
4. Of some one with an iron flail;
5. Or that portentous Man of Brass
6. Hephaestus made in days of yore,
7. Who stalked about the Cretan shore,
8. And saw the ships appear and pass,
9. And threw stones at the Argonauts,
10. Being filled with indiscriminate ire
11. That tangled and perplexed his thoughts;
12. But, like a hospitable host,
13. When strangers landed on the coast,
14. Heated himself red-hot with fire,
15. And hugged them in his arms, and pressed
16. Their bodies to his burning breast.

17. The Poet answered: 'No, not thus
18. The legend rose; it sprang at first
19. Out of the hunger and the thirst
20. In all men for the marvellous.
21. And thus it filled and satisfied
22. The imagination of mankind,
23. And this ideal to the mind
24. Was truer than historic fact.
25. Fancy enlarged and multiplied
26. The tenors of the awful name
27. Of Charlemagne, till he became
28. Armipotent in every act,
29. And, clothed in mystery, appeared
30. Not what men saw, but what they feared.

31. Besides, unless my memory fail,
32. Your some one with an iron flail
33. Is not an ancient myth at all,
34. But comes much later on the scene
35. As Talus in the Faerie Queene,
36. The iron groom of Artegall,
37. Who threshed out falsehood and deceit,
38. And truth upheld, and righted wrong,
39. As was, as is the swallow, fleet,
40. And as the lion is, was strong.'

41. The Theologian said: 'Perchance
42. Your chronicler in writing this
43. Had in his mind the Anabasis,
44. Where Xenophon describes the advance
45. Of Artaxerxes to the fight;
46. At first the low gray cloud of dust,
47. And then a blackness o'er the fields
48. As of a passing thunder-gust,
49. Then flash of brazen armor bright,
50. And ranks of men, and spears up-thrust,
51. Bowmen and troops with wicker shields,
52. And cavalry equipped in white,
53. And chariots ranged in front of these
54. With scythes upon their axle-trees.'

55. To this the Student answered: 'Well,
56. I also have a tale to tell
57. Of Charlemagne; a tale that throws
58. A softer light, more tinged with rose,
59. Than your grim apparition cast
60. Upon the darkness of the past.
61. Listen, and hear in English rhyme
62. What the good Monk of Lauresheim
63. Gives as the gossip of his time,
64. In mediaeval Latin prose.'
