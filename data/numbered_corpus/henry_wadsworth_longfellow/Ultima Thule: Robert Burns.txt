1. I see amid the fields of Ayr
2. A ploughman, who, in foul and fair,
3. Sings at his task
4. So clear, we know not if it is
5. The laverock's song we hear, or his,
6. Nor care to ask.

7. For him the ploughing of those fields
8. A more ethereal harvest yields
9. Than sheaves of grain;
10. Songs flush with purple bloom the rye,
11. The plover's call, the curlew's cry,
12. Sing in his brain.

13. Touched by his hand, the wayside weed
14. Becomes a flower; the lowliest reed
15. Beside the stream
16. Is clothed with beauty; gorse and grass
17. And heather, where his footsteps pass,
18. The brighter seem.

19. He sings of love, whose flame illumes
20. The darkness of lone cottage rooms;
21. He feels the force,
22. The treacherous undertow and stress
23. Of wayward passions, and no less
24. The keen remorse.

25. At moments, wrestling with his fate,
26. His voice is harsh, but not with hate;
27. The brushwood, hung
28. Above the tavern door, lets fall
29. Its bitter leaf, its drop of gall
30. Upon his tongue.

31. But still the music of his song
32. Rises o'er all, elate and strong;
33. Its master-chords
34. Are Manhood, Freedom, Brotherhood,
35. Its discords but an interlude
36. Between the words.

37. And then to die so young and leave
38. Unfinished what he might achieve!
39. Yet better sure
40. Is this, than wandering up and down
41. An old man in a country town,
42. Infirm and poor.

43. For now he haunts his native land
44. As an immortal youth; his hand
45. Guides every plough;
46. He sits beside each ingle-nook,
47. His voice is in each rushing brook,
48. Each rustling bough.

49. His presence haunts this room to-night,
50. A form of mingled mist and light
51. From that far coast.
52. Welcome beneath this roof of mine!
53. Welcome! this vacant chair is thine,
54. Dear guest and ghost!
