1. Torrent of light and river of the air,
2. Along whose bed the glimmering stars are seen
3. Like gold and silver sands in some ravine
4. Where mountain streams have left their channels bare!
5. The Spaniard sees in thee the pathway, where
6. His patron saint descended in the sheen
7. Of his celestial armor, on serene
8. And quiet nights, when all the heavens were fair.
9. Not this I see, nor yet the ancient fable
10. Of Phaeton's wild course, that scorched the skies
11. Where'er the hoofs of his hot coursers trod;
12. But the white drift of worlds o'er chasms of sable,
13. The star-dust that is whirled aloft and flies
14. From the invisible chariot-wheels of God.
