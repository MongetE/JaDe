1. He is dead, the beautiful youth,
2. The heart of honor, the tongue of truth,
3. He, the life and light of us all,
4. Whose voice was blithe as a bugle-call,
5. Whom all eyes followed with one consent,
6. The cheer of whose laugh, and whose pleasant word,
7. Hushed all murmurs of discontent.

8. Only last night, as we rode along,
9. Down the dark of the mountain gap,
10. To visit the picket-guard at the ford,
11. Little dreaming of any mishap,
12. He was humming the words of some old song:
13. 'Two red roses he had on his cap
14. And another he bore at the point of his sword.'

15. Sudden and swift a whistling ball
16. Came out of a wood, and the voice was still;
17. Something I heard in the darkness fall,
18. And for a moment my blood grew chill;
19. I spoke in a whisper, as he who speaks
20. In a room where some one is lying dead;
21. But he made no answer to what I said.

22. We lifted him up to his saddle again,
23. And through the mire and the mist and the rain
24. Carried him back to the silent camp,
25. And laid him as if asleep on his bed;
26. And I saw by the light of the surgeon's lamp
27. Two white roses upon his cheeks,
28. And one, just over his heart, blood red!

29. And I saw in a vision how far and fleet
30. That fatal bullet went speeding forth,
31. Till it reached a town in the distant North,
32. Till it reached a house in a sunny street,
33. Till it reached a heart that ceased to beat
34. Without a murmur, without a cry;
35. And a bell was tolled in that far-off town,
36. For one who had passed from cross to crown,
37. And the neighbors wondered that she should die.
