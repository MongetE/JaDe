1. As a pale phantom with a lamp
2. Ascends some ruin's haunted stair,
3. So glides the moon along the damp
4. Mysterious chambers of the air.

5. Now hidden in cloud, and now revealed,
6. As if this phantom, full of pain,
7. Were by the crumbling walls concealed,
8. And at the windows seen again.

9. Until at last, serene and proud
10. In all the splendor of her light,
11. She walks the terraces of cloud,
12. Supreme as Empress of the Night.

13. I look, but recognize no more
14. Objects familiar to my view;
15. The very pathway to my door
16. Is an enchanted avenue.

17. All things are changed. One mass of shade,
18. The elm-trees drop their curtains down;
19. By palace, park, and colonnade
20. I walk as in a foreign town.

21. The very ground beneath my feet
22. Is clothed with a diviner air;
23. While marble paves the silent street
24. And glimmers in the empty square.

25. Illusion! Underneath there lies
26. The common life of every day;
27. Only the spirit glorifies
28. With its own tints the sober gray.

29. In vain we look, in vain uplift
30. Our eyes to heaven, if we are blind;
31. We see but what we have the gift
32. Of seeing; what we bring we find.
