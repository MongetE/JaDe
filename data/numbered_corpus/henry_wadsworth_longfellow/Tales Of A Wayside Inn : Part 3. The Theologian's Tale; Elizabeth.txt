1. 'Ah, how short are the days! How soon the night overtakes us!
2. In the old country the twilight is longer; but here in the forest
3. Suddenly comes the dark, with hardly a pause in its coming,
4. Hardly a moment between the two lights, the day and the lamplight;
5. Yet how grand is the winter! How spotless the snow is, and perfect!'

6. Thus spake Elizabeth Haddon at nightfall to Hannah the housemaid,
7. As in the farm-house kitchen, that served for kitchen and parlor,
8. By the window she sat with her work, and looked on a landscape
9. White as the great white sheet that Peter saw in his vision,
10. By the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens.
