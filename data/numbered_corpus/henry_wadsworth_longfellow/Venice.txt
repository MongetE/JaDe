1. White swan of cities, slumbering in thy nest
2. So wonderfully built among the reeds
3. Of the lagoon, that fences thee and feeds,
4. As sayeth thy old historian and thy guest!
5. White water-lily, cradled and caressed
6. By ocean streams, and from the silt and weeds
7. Lifting thy golden filaments and seeds,
8. Thy sun-illumined spires, thy crown and crest!
9. White phantom city, whose untrodden streets
10. Are rivers, and whose pavements are the shifting
11. Shadows of palaces and strips of sky;
12. I wait to see thee vanish like the fleets
13. Seen in mirage, or towers of cloud uplifting
14. In air their unsubstantial masonry.
