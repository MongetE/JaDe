1. She dwells by Great Kenhawa's side,
2. In valleys green and cool;
3. And all her hope and all her pride
4. Are in the village school.

5. Her soul, like the transparent air
6. That robes the hills above,
7. Though not of earth, encircles there
8. All things with arms of love.

9. And thus she walks among her girls
10. With praise and mild rebukes;
11. Subduing e'en rude village churls
12. By her angelic looks.

13. She reads to them at eventide
14. Of One who came to save;
15. To cast the captive's chains aside
16. And liberate the slave.

17. And oft the blessed time foretells
18. When all men shall be free;
19. And musical, as silver bells,
20. Their falling chains shall be.

21. And following her beloved Lord,
22. In decent poverty,
23. She makes her life one sweet record
24. And deed of charity.

25. For she was rich, and gave up all
26. To break the iron bands
27. Of those who waited in her hall,
28. And labored in her lands.

29. Long since beyond the Southern Sea
30. Their outbound sails have sped,
31. While she, in meek humility,
32. Now earns her daily bread.

33. It is their prayers, which never cease,
34. That clothe her with such grace;
35. Their blessing is the light of peace
36. That shines upon her face.
