1. Four by the clock! and yet not day;
2. But the great world rolls and wheels away,
3. With its cities on land, and its ships at sea,
4. Into the dawn that is to be!

5. Only the lamp in the anchored bark
6. Sends its glimmer across the dark,
7. And the heavy breathing of the sea
8. Is the only sound that comes to me.
