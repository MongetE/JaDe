1. On King Olaf's bridal night
2. Shines the moon with tender light,
3. And across the chamber streams
4. Its tide of dreams.

5. At the fatal midnight hour,
6. When all evil things have power,
7. In the glimmer of the moon
8. Stands Gudrun.

9. Close against her heaving breast
10. Something in her hand is pressed;
11. Like an icicle, its sheen
12. Is cold and keen.

13. On the cairn are fixed her eyes
14. Where her murdered father lies,
15. And a voice remote and drear
16. She seems to hear.

17. What a bridal night is this!
18. Cold will be the dagger's kiss;
19. Laden with the chill of death
20. Is its breath.

21. Like the drifting snow she sweeps
22. To the couch where Olaf sleeps;
23. Suddenly he wakes and stirs,
24. His eyes meet hers.

25. 'What is that,' King Olaf said,
26. 'Gleams so bright above my head?
27. Wherefore standest thou so white
28. In pale moonlight?'

29. ''T is the bodkin that I wear
30. When at night I bind my hair;
31. It woke me falling on the floor;
32. 'T is nothing more.'

33. 'Forests have ears, and fields have eyes;
34. Often treachery lurking lies
35. Underneath the fairest hair!
36. Gudrun beware!'

37. Ere the earliest peep of morn
38. Blew King Olaf's bugle-horn;
39. And forever sundered ride
40. Bridegroom and bride!
