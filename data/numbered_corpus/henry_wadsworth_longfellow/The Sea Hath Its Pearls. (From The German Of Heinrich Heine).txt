1. The sea hath its pearls,
2. The heaven hath its stars;
3. But my heart, my heart,
4. My heart hath its love.

5. Great are the sea and the heaven;
6. Yet greater is my heart,
7. And fairer than pearls and stars
8. Flashes and beams my love.

9. Thou little, youthful maiden,
10. Come unto my great heart;
11. My heart, and the sea, and the heaven
12. Are melting away with love!
