1. Once more, once more, Inarimé,
2. I see thy purple hills!--once more
3. I hear the billows of the bay
4. Wash the white pebbles on thy shore.

5. High o'er the sea-surge and the sands,
6. Like a great galleon wrecked and cast
7. Ashore by storms, thy castle stands,
8. A mouldering landmark of the Past.

9. Upon its terrace-walk I see
10. A phantom gliding to and fro;
11. It is Colonna,--it is she
12. Who lived and loved so long ago.

13. Pescara's beautiful young wife,
14. The type of perfect womanhood,
15. Whose life was love, the life of life,
16. That time and change and death withstood.

17. For death, that breaks the marriage band
18. In others, only closer pressed
19. The wedding-ring upon her hand
20. And closer locked and barred her breast.

21. She knew the life-long martyrdom,
22. The weariness, the endless pain
23. Of waiting for some one to come
24. Who nevermore would come again.

25. The shadows of the chestnut trees,
26. The odor of the orange blooms,
27. The song of birds, and, more than these,
28. The silence of deserted rooms;

29. The respiration of the sea,
30. The soft caresses of the air,
31. All things in nature seemed to be
32. But ministers of her despair;

33. Till the o'erburdened heart, so long
34. Imprisoned in itself, found vent
35. And voice in one impassioned song
36. Of inconsolable lament.

37. Then as the sun, though hidden from sight,
38. Transmutes to gold the leaden mist,
39. Her life was interfused with light,
40. From realms that, though unseen, exist,

41. Inarimé! Inarimé!
42. Thy castle on the crags above
43. In dust shall crumble and decay,
44. But not the memory of her love.
