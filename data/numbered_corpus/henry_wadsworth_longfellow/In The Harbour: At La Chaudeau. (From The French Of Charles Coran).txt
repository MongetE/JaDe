1. At La Chaudeau,--'tis long since then:
2. I was young,--my years twice ten;
3. All things smiled on the happy boy,
4. Dreams of love and songs of joy,
5. Azure of heaven and wave below,
6. At La Chaudeau.
7. At La Chaudeau I come back old:
8. My head is gray, my blood is cold;
9. Seeking along the meadow ooze,
10. Seeking beside the river Seymouse,
11. The days of my spring-time of long ago
12. At La Chaudeau.
13. At La Chaudeau nor heart nor brain
14. Ever grows old with grief and pain;
15. A sweet remembrance keeps off age;
16. A tender friendship doth still assuage
17. The burden of sorrow that one may know
18. At La Chaudeau.
19. At La Chaudeau, had fate decreed
20. To limit the wandering life I lead,
21. Peradventure I still, forsooth,
22. Should have preserved my fresh green youth,
23. Under the shadows the hill-tops throw
24. At La Chaudeau.
25. At La Chaudeau, live on, my friends,
26. Happy to be where God intends;
27. And sometimes, by the evening fire,
28. Think of him whose sole desire
29. Is again to sit in the old chateau
30. At La Chaudeau.
