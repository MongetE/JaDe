1. Olger the Dane and Desiderio,
2. King of the Lombards, on a lofty tower
3. Stood gazing northward o'er the rolling plains,
4. League after league of harvests, to the foot
5. Of the snow-crested Alps, and saw approach
6. A mighty army, thronging all the roads
7. That led into the city. And the King
8. Said unto Olger, who had passed his youth
9. As hostage at the court of France, and knew
10. The Emperor's form and face 'Is Charlemagne
11. Among that host?' And Olger answered: 'No.'

12. And still the innumerable multitude
13. Flowed onward and increased, until the King
14. Cried in amazement: 'Surely Charlemagne
15. Is coming in the midst of all these knights!'
16. And Olger answered slowly: 'No; not yet;
17. He will not come so soon.' Then much disturbed
18. King Desiderio asked: 'What shall we do,
19. if he approach with a still greater army!'
20. And Olger answered: 'When he shall appear,
21. You will behold what manner of man he is;
22. But what will then befall us I know not.'

23. Then came the guard that never knew repose,
24. The Paladins of France; and at the sight
25. The Lombard King o'ercome with terror cried:
26. 'This must be Charlemagne!' and as before
27. Did Olger answer: 'No; not yet, not yet.'

28. And then appeared in panoply complete
29. The Bishops and the Abbots and the Priests
30. Of the imperial chapel, and the Counts
31. And Desiderio could no more endure
32. The light of day, nor yet encounter death,
33. But sobbed aloud and said: 'Let us go down
34. And hide us in the bosom of the earth,
35. Far from the sight and anger of a foe
36. So terrible as this!' And Olger said:
37. 'When you behold the harvests in the fields
38. Shaking with fear, the Po and the Ticino
39. Lashing the city walls with iron waves,
40. Then may you know that Charlemagne is come.
41. And even as he spake, in the northwest,
42. Lo! there uprose a black and threatening cloud,
43. Out of whose bosom flashed the light of arms
44. Upon the people pent up in the city;
45. A light more terrible than any darkness;
46. And Charlemagne appeared;--a Man of Iron!

47. His helmet was of iron, and his gloves
48. Of iron, and his breastplate and his greaves
49. And tassets were of iron, and his shield.
50. In his left hand he held an iron spear,
51. In his right hand his sword invincible.
52. The horse he rode on had the strength of iron,
53. And color of iron. All who went before him
54. Beside him and behind him, his whole host,
55. Were armed with iron, and their hearts within them
56. Were stronger than the armor that they wore.
57. The fields and all the roads were filled with iron,
58. And points of iron glistened in the sun
59. And shed a terror through the city streets.

60. This at a single glance Olger the Dane
61. Saw from the tower, and turning to the King
62. Exclaimed in haste: 'Behold! this is the man
63. You looked for with such eagerness!' and then
64. Fell as one dead at Desiderio's feet.
