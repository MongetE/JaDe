1. Bell! thou soundest merrily,
2. When the bridal party
3. To the church doth hie!
4. Bell! thou soundest solemnly.
5. When, on Sabbath morning,
6. Fields deserted lie!

7. Bell! thou soundest merrily;
8. Tellest thou at evening,
9. Bed-time draweth nigh!
10. Bell! thou soundest mournfully.
11. Tellest thou the bitter
12. Parting hath gone by!

13. Say! how canst thou mourn?
14. How canst thou rejoice?
15. Thou art but metal dull!
16. And yet all our sorrowings,
17. Arid all our rejoicings,
18. Thou dost feel them all!

19. God hath wonders many,
20. Which we cannot fathom,
21. Placed within thy form!
22. When the heart is sinking,
23. Thou alone canst raise it,
24. Trembling in the storm!
