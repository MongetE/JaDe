1. Burn, O evening hearth, and waken
2. Pleasant visions, as of old!
3. Though the house by winds be shaken,
4. Safe I keep this room of gold!

5. Ah, no longer wizard Fancy
6. Builds her castles in the air,
7. Luring me by necromancy
8. Up the never-ending stair!


9. But, instead, she builds me bridges
10. Over many a dark ravine,
11. Where beneath the gusty ridges
12. Cataracts dash and roar unseen.

13. And I cross them, little heeding
14. Blast of wind or torrent's roar,
15. As I follow the receding
16. Footsteps that have gone before.

17. Naught avails the imploring gesture,
18. Naught avails the cry of pain!
19. When I touch the flying vesture,
20. 'Tis the gray robe of the rain.

21. Baffled I return, and, leaning
22. O'er the parapets of cloud,
23. Watch the mist that intervening
24. Wraps the valley in its shroud.

25. And the sounds of life ascending
26. Faintly, vaguely, meet the ear,
27. Murmur of bells and voices blending
28. With the rush of waters near.

29. Well I know what there lies hidden,
30. Every tower and town and farm,
31. And again the land forbidden
32. Reassumes its vanished charm.

33. Well I know the secret places,
34. And the nests in hedge and tree;
35. At what doors are friendly faces,
36. In what hearts are thoughts of me.

37. Through the mist and darkness sinking,
38. Blown by wind and beaten by shower,
39. Down I fling the thought I'm thinking,
40. Down I toss this Alpine flower.
