1. The brooklet came from the mountain,
2. As sang the bard of old,
3. Running with feet of silver
4. Over the sands of gold!

5. Far away in the briny ocean
6. There rolled a turbulent wave,
7. Now singing along the sea-beach,
8. Now howling along the cave.

9. And the brooklet has found the billow,
10. Though they flowed so far apart,
11. And has filled with its freshness and sweetness
12. That turbulent, bitter heart!
