1. 'Hads't thou stayed, I must have fled!'
2. That is what the Vision said.

3. In his chamber all alone,
4. Kneeling on the floor of stone,
5. Prayed the Monk in deep contrition
6. For his sins of indecision,
7. Prayed for greater self-denial
8. In temptation and in trial;
9. It was noonday by the dial,
10. And the Monk was all alone.
11. Suddenly, as if it lightened,
12. An unwonted splendor brightened
13. All within him and without him
14. In that narrow cell of stone;
15. And he saw the Blessed Vision
16. Of our Lord, with light Elysian
17. Like a vesture wrapped about him,
18. Like a garment round him thrown.

19. Not as crucified and slain,
20. Not in agonies of pain,
21. Not with bleeding hands and feet,
22. Did the Monk his Master see;
23. But as in the village street,
24. In the house or harvest-field,
25. Halt and lame and blind he healed,
26. When he walked in Galilee.

27. In an attitude imploring,
28. Hands upon his bosom crossed,
29. Wondering, worshipping, adoring,
30. Knelt the Monk in rapture lost.
31. Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,
32. Who am I, that thus thou deignest
33. To reveal thyself to me?
34. Who am I, that from the centre
35. Of thy glory thou shouldst enter
36. This poor cell, my guest to be?

37. Then amid his exaltation,
38. Loud the convent bell appalling,
39. From its belfry calling, calling,
40. Rang through court and corridor
41. With persistent iteration
42. He had never heard before.
43. It was now the appointed hour
44. When alike in shine or shower,
45. Winter's cold or summer's heat,
46. To the convent portals came
47. All the blind and halt and lame,
48. All the beggars of the street,
49. For their daily dole of food
50. Dealt them by the brotherhood;
51. And their almoner was he
52. Who upon his bended knee,
53. Rapt in silent ecstasy
54. Of divinest self-surrender,
55. Saw the Vision and the Splendor.
56. Deep distress and hesitation
57. Mingled with his adoration;_
58. Should he go, or should he stay?
59. Should he leave the poor to wait
60. Hungry at the convent gate,
61. Till the Vision passed away?
62. Should he slight his radiant guest,
63. Slight this visitant celestial,
64. For a crowd of ragged, bestial
65. Beggars at the convent gate?
66. Would the Vision there remain?
67. Would the Vision come again?
68. Then a voice within his breast
69. Whispered, audible and clear
70. As if to the outward ear:
71. 'Do thy duty; that is best;
72. Leave unto thy Lord the rest!'

73. Straightway to his feet he started,
74. And with longing look intent
75. On the Blessed Vision bent,
76. Slowly from his cell departed,
77. Slowly on his errand went.

78. At the gate the poor were waiting,
79. Looking through the iron grating,_
80. With that terror in the eye
81. That is only seen in those
82. Who amid their wants and woes
83. Hear the sound of doors that close,
84. And of feet that pass them by;
85. Grown familiar with disfavor,
86. Grown familiar with the savor
87. Of the bread by which men die!
88. But to-day, they knew not why,
89. Like the gate of Paradise
90. Seemed the convent sate to rise,
91. Like a sacrament divine
92. Seemed to them the bread and wine.
93. In his heart the Monk was praying,
94. Thinking of the homeless poor,
95. What they suffer and endure;
96. What we see not, what we see;
97. And the inward voice was saying:
98. 'Whatsoever thing thou doest
99. To the least of mine and lowest,
100. That thou doest unto me!'

101. Unto me! but had the Vision
102. Come to him in beggar's clothing,
103. Come a mendicant imploring,
104. Would he then have knelt adoring,
105. Or have listened with derision,
106. And have turned away with loathing.

107. Thus his conscience put the question,
108. Full of troublesome suggestion,
109. As at length, with hurried pace,
110. Towards his cell he turned his face,
111. And beheld the convent bright
112. With a supernatural light,
113. Like a luminous cloud expanding
114. Over floor and wall and ceiling.

115. But he paused with awe-struck feeling
116. At the threshold of his door,
117. For the Vision still was standing
118. As he left it there before,
119. When the convent bell appalling,
120. From its belfry calling, calling,
121. Summoned him to feed the poor.
122. Through the long hour intervening
123. It had waited his return,
124. And he felt his bosom burn,
125. Comprehending all the meaning,
126. When the Blessed Vision said,
127. 'Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!'
