1. 'O Edrehi, forbear to-night
2. Your ghostly legends of affright,
3. And let the Talmud rest in peace;
4. Spare us your dismal tales of death
5. That almost take away one's breath;
6. So doing, may your tribe increase.'

7. Thus the Sicilian said; then went
8. And on the spinet's rattling keys
9. Played Marianina, like a breeze
10. From Naples and the Southern seas,
11. That brings us the delicious scent
12. Of citron and of orange trees,
13. And memories of soft days of ease
14. At Capri and Amalfi spent.

15. 'Not so,' the eager Poet said;
16. 'At least, not so before I tell
17. The story of my Azrael,
18. An angel mortal as ourselves,
19. Which in an ancient tome I found
20. Upon a convent's dusty shelves,
21. Chained with an iron chain, and bound
22. In parchment, and with clasps of brass,
23. Lest from its prison, some dark day,
24. It might be stolen or steal away,
25. While the good friars were singing mass.

26. 'It is a tale of Charlemagne,
27. When like a thunder-cloud, that lowers
28. And sweeps from mountain-crest to coast,
29. With lightning flaming through its showers,
30. He swept across the Lombard plain,
31. Beleaguering with his warlike train
32. Pavia, the country's pride and boast,
33. The City of the Hundred Towers.'

34. Thus heralded the tale began,
35. And thus in sober measure ran.
