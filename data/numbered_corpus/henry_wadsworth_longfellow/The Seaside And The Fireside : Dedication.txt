1. As one who, walking in the twilight gloom,
2. Hears round about him voices as it darkens,
3. And seeing not the forms from which they come,
4. Pauses from time to time, and turns and hearkens;

5. So walking here in twilight, O my friends!
6. I hear your voices, softened by the distance,
7. And pause, and turn to listen, as each sends
8. His words of friendship, comfort, and assistance.

9. If any thought of mine, or sung or told,
10. Has ever given delight or consolation,
11. Ye have repaid me back a thousand-fold,
12. By every friendly sign and salutation.

13. Thanks for the sympathies that ye have shown!
14. Thanks for each kindly word, each silent token,
15. That teaches me, when seeming most alone,
16. Friends are around us, though no word be spoken.

17. Kind messages, that pass from land to land;
18. Kind letters, that betray the heart's deep history,
19. In which we feel the pressure of a hand,--
20. One touch of fire,--and all the rest is mystery!

21. The pleasant books, that silently among
22. Our household treasures take familiar places,
23. And are to us as if a living tongue
24. Spice from the printed leaves or pictured faces!

25. Perhaps on earth I never shall behold,
26. With eye of sense, your outward form and semblance;
27. Therefore to me ye never will grow old,
28. But live forever young in my remembrance!

29. Never grow old, nor change, nor pass away!
30. Your gentle voices will flow on forever,
31. When life grows bare and tarnished with decay,
32. As through a leafless landscape flows a river.

33. Not chance of birth or place has made us friends,
34. Being oftentimes of different tongues and nations,
35. But the endeavor for the selfsame ends,
36. With the same hopes, and fears, and aspirations.

37. Therefore I hope to join your seaside walk,
38. Saddened, and mostly silent, with emotion;
39. Not interrupting with intrusive talk
40. The grand, majestic symphonies of ocean.

41. Therefore I hope, as no unwelcome guest,
42. At your warm fireside, when the lamps are lighted,
43. To have my place reserved among the rest,
44. Nor stand as one unsought and uninvited!
