1. How they so softly rest,
2. All they the holy ones,
3. Unto whose dwelling-place
4. Now doth my soul draw near!
5. How they so softly rest,
6. All in their silent graves,
7. Deep to corruption
8. Slowly don-sinking!

9. And they no longer weep,
10. Here, where complaint is still!
11. And they no longer feel,
12. Here, where all gladness flies!
13. And, by the cypresses
14. Softly o'ershadowed
15. Until the Angel
16. Calls them, they slumber!
