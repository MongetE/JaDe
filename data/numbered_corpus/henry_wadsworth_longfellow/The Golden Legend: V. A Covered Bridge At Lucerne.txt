1. _Prince Henry_. God's blessing on the architects who build
2. The bridges o'er swift rivers and abysses
3. Before impassable to human feet,
4. No less than on the builders of cathedrals,
5. Whose massive walls are bridges thrown across
6. The dark and terrible abyss of Death.
7. Well has the name of Pontifex been given
8. Unto the Church's head, as the chief builder
9. And architect of the invisible bridge
10. That leads from earth to heaven.

11. _Elsie_ How dark it grows!
12. What are these paintings on the walls around us?

13. _Prince Henry_ The Dance Macaber!

14. _Elsie_ What?

15. _Prince Henry_ The Dance of Death!
16. All that go to and fro must look upon it,
17. Mindful of what they shall be, while beneath,
18. Among the wooden piles, the turbulent river
19. Rushes, impetuous as the river of life,
20. With dimpling eddies, ever green and bright,
21. Save where the shadow of this bridge falls on it.

22. _Elsie._ O, yes! I see it now!

23. _Prince Henry_ The grim musician
24. Leads all men through the mazes of that dance,
25. To different sounds in different measures moving;
26. Sometimes he plays a lute, sometimes a drum,
27. To tempt or terrify.

28. _Elsie_ What is this picture?

29. _Prince Henry_ It is a young man singing to a nun,
30. Who kneels at her devotions, but in kneeling
31. Turns round to look at him, and Death, meanwhile,
32. Is putting out the candles on the altar!

33. _Elsie_ Ah, what a pity 't is that she should listen
34. to such songs, when in her orisons
35. She might have heard in heaven the angels singing!

36. _Prince Henry_ Here he has stolen a jester's cap and bells,
37. And dances with the Queen.

38. _Elsie_ A foolish jest!

39. _Prince Henry_ And here the heart of the new-wedded wife,
40. Coming from church with her beloved lord,
41. He startles with the rattle of his drum.

42. _Elsie_ Ah, that is sad! And yet perhaps 't is best
43. That she should die, with all the sunshine on her,
44. And all the benedictions of the morning,
45. Before this affluence of golden light
46. Shall fade into a cold and clouded gray,
47. Then into darkness!

48. _Prince Henry_ Under it is written,
49. 'Nothing but death shall separate thee and me!'

50. _Elsie._ And what is this, that follows close upon it?

51. _Prince Henry_ Death, playing on a ducimer. Behind him,
52. A poor old woman, with a rosary,
53. Follows the sound, and seems to wish her feet
54. Were swifter to o'ertake him. Underneath,
55. The inscription reads, 'Better is Death than Life.'

56. _Elsie._ Better is Death than Life! Ah yes! to thousands
57. Death plays upon a dulcimer, and sings
58. That song of consolation, till the air
59. Rings with it, and they cannot choose but follow
60. Whither he leads. And not the old alone,
61. But the young also hear it, and are still.

62. _Prince Henry_ Yes, in their sadder moments. 'T is the sound
63. Of their own hearts they hear, half full of tears,
64. Which are like crystal cups, half filled with water.
65. Responding to the pressure of a finger
66. With music sweet and low and melancholy.
67. Let us go forward, and no longer stay
68. In this great picture-gallery of Death!
69. I hate it! ay, the very thought of it!

70. _Elsie._ Why is it hateful to you?

71. _Prince Henry._ For the reason
72. That life, and all that speaks of life, is lovely,
73. And death, and all that speaks of death, is hateful.

74. _Elsie._ The grave is but a covered bridge,
75. leading from light to light, through a brief darkness!

76. _Prince Henry (emerging from the bridge)._ I breathe again more
77. freely! Ah, how pleasant
78. To come once more into the light of day,
79. Out of that shadow of death! To hear again
80. The hoof-beats of our horses on firm ground,
81. And not upon those hollow planks, resounding
82. With a sepulchral echo, like the clods
83. On coffins in a churchyard! Yonder lies
84. The Lake of the Four Forest-Towns, apparelled
85. In light, and lingering, like a village maiden,
86. Hid in the bosom of her native mountains,
87. Then pouring all her life into another's,
88. Changing her name and being! Overhead,
89. Shaking his cloudy tresses loose in air,
90. Rises Pilatus, with his windy pines.

91. (_They pass on_.)

92. * * * * *

93. THE DEVIL'S BRIDGE.

94. * * * * *

95. PRINCE HENRY _and_ ELSIE _crossing, with attendants._

96. _Guide._ This bridge is called the Devil's Bridge.
97. With a single arch, from ridge to ridge,
98. It leaps across the terrible chasm
99. Yawning beneath us, black and deep,
100. As if, in some convulsive spasm,
101. the summits of the hills had cracked,
102. and made a road for the cataract,
103. That raves and rages down the steep!

104. _Lucifer (under the bridge)._ Ha! ha!

105. _Guide._ Never any bridge but this
106. Could stand across the wild abyss;
107. All the rest, of wood or stone,
108. By the Devil's hand were overthrown.
109. He toppled crags from the precipice,
110. And whatsoe'er was built by day
111. In the night was swept away;
112. None could stand but this alone.

113. _Lucifer (under the bridge)._ Ha! ha!

114. _Guide._ I showed you in the valley a boulder
115. Marked with the imprint of his shoulder;
116. As he was bearing it up this way,
117. A peasant, passing, cried, 'Herr Je!'
118. And the Devil dropped it in his fright,
119. And vanished suddenly out of sight!

120. _Lucifer (under the bridge)._ Ha! ha!

121. _Guide._ Abbot Giraldus of Einsiedel,
122. For pilgrims on their way to Rome,
123. Built this at last, with a single arch,
124. Under which, on its endless march,
125. Runs the river, white with foam,
126. Like a thread through the eye of a needle.
127. And the Devil promised to let it stand,
128. Under compact and condition
129. That the first living thing which crossed
130. Should be surrendered into his hand,
131. And be beyond redemption lost.

132. _Lucifer (under the bridge)._ Ha! ha! perdition!

133. _Guide._ At length, the bridge being all completed,
134. The Abbot, standing at its head,
135. Threw across it a loaf of bread,
136. Which a hungry dog sprang after,
137. And the rocks reechoed with peals of laughter
138. To see the Devil thus defeated!

139. (_They pass on_)

140. _Lucifer_ (_under the bridge_) Ha! ha! defeated!
141. For journeys and for crimes like this
142. To let the bridge stand o'er the abyss!

143. * * * * *

144. THE ST. GOTHARD PASS.

145. * * * * *

146. _Prince Henry._ This is the highest point. Two ways the rivers
147. Leap down to different seas, and as they roll
148. Grow deep and still, and their majestic presence
149. Becomes a benefaction to the towns
150. They visit, wandering silently among them,
151. Like patriarchs old among their shining tents.

152. _Elsie._ How bleak and bare it is! Nothing but mosses
153. Grow on these rocks.

154. _Prince Henry._ Yet are they not forgotten;
155. Beneficent Nature sends the mists to feed them.

156. _Elsie._ See yonder little cloud, that, borne aloft
157. So tenderly by the wind, floats fast away
158. Over the snowy peaks! It seems to me
159. The body of St. Catherine, borne by angels!

160. _Prince Henry._ Thou art St. Catherine, and invisible angels
161. Bear thee across these chasms and precipices,
162. Lest thou shouldst dash thy feet against a stone!

163. _Elsie._ Would I were borne unto my grave, as she was,
164. Upon angelic shoulders! Even now
165. I Seem uplifted by them, light as air!
166. What sound is that?

167. _Prince Henry_. The tumbling avalanches!

168. _Elsie_ How awful, yet how beautiful!

169. _Prince Henry_. These are
170. The voices of the mountains! Thus they ope
171. Their snowy lips, and speak unto each other,
172. In the primeval language, lost to man.

173. _Elsie_. What land is this that spreads itself beneath us?

174. _Prince Henry_ Italy! Italy!

175. _Elsie_ Land of the Madonna!
176. How beautiful it is! It seems a garden
177. Of Paradise!

178. _Prince Henry_. Nay, of Gethsemane
179. To thee and me, of passion and of prayer!
180. Yet once of Paradise. Long years ago
181. I wandered as a youth among its bowers,
182. And never from my heart has faded quite
183. Its memory, that, like a summer sunset,
184. Encircles with a ring of purple light
185. All the horizon of my youth.

186. _Guide_. O friends!
187. The days are short, the way before us long;
188. We must not linger, if we think to reach
189. The inn at Belinzona before vespers!

190. (_They pass on_.)

191. * * * * *

192. AT THE FOOT OF THE ALPS.

193. * * * * *

194. _A halt under the trees at noon_.

195. _Prince Henry_ Here let us pause a moment in the trembling
196. Shadow and sunshine of the roadside trees,
197. And, our tired horses in a group assembling,
198. Inhale long draughts of this delicious breeze
199. Our fleeter steeds have distanced our attendants;
200. They lag behind us with a slower pace;
201. We will await them under the green pendants
202. Of the great willows in this shady place.
203. Ho, Barbarossa! how thy mottled haunches
204. Sweat with this canter over hill and glade!
205. Stand still, and let these overhanging branches
206. Fan thy hot sides and comfort thee with shade!

207. _Elsie._ What a delightful landscape spreads before us,
208. Marked with a whitewashed cottage here and there!
209. And, in luxuriant garlands drooping o'er us,
210. Blossoms of grapevines scent the sunny air.

211. _Prince Henry._ Hark! what sweet sounds are those, whose accents holy
212. Fill the warm noon with music sad and sweet!

213. _Elsie._ It is a band of pilgrims, moving slowly
214. On their long journey, with uncovered feet.

215. _Pilgrims (chaunting the Hymn of St. Hildebert)_
216. Me receptet Sion illa,
217. Sion David, urbs tranquilla,
218. Cujus faber auctor lucis,
219. Cujus portae lignum crucis,
220. Cujus claves lingua Petri,
221. Cujus cives semper laeti,
222. Cujus muri lapis vivus,
223. Cujus custos Rex festivus!

224. _Lucifer (as a Friar in the procession)._ Here am I, too, in the
225. pious band,
226. In the garb of a barefooted Carmelite dressed!
227. The soles of my feet are as hard and tanned
228. As the conscience of old Pope Hildebrand,
229. The Holy Satan, who made the wives
230. Of the bishops lead such shameful lives.
231. All day long I beat my breast,
232. And chaunt with a most particular zest
233. The Latin hymns, which I understand
234. Quite as well, I think, as the rest.
235. And at night such lodging in barns and sheds,
236. Such a hurly-burly in country inns,
237. Such a clatter of tongues in empty heads,
238. Such a helter-skelter of prayers and sins!
239. Of all the contrivances of the time
240. For sowing broadcast the seeds of crime,
241. There is none so pleasing to me and mine
242. As a pilgrimage to some far-off shrine!

243. _Prince Henry._ If from the outward man we judge the inner,
244. And cleanliness is godliness, I fear
245. A hopeless reprobate, a hardened sinner,
246. Must be that Carmelite now passing near.

247. _Lucifer._ There is my German Prince again,
248. Thus far on his journey to Salern,
249. And the lovesick girl, whose heated brain
250. Is sowing the cloud to reap the rain;
251. But it's a long road that has no turn!
252. Let them quietly hold their way,
253. I have also a part in the play.
254. But first I must act to my heart's content
255. This mummery and this merriment,
256. And drive this motley flock of sheep
257. Into the fold, where drink and sleep
258. The jolly old friars of Benevent.
259. Of a truth, it often provokes me to laugh
260. To see these beggars hobble along,
261. Lamed and maimed, and fed upon chaff,
262. Chanting their wonderful piff and paff,
263. And, to make up for not understanding the song,
264. Singing it fiercely, and wild, and strong!
265. Were it not for my magic garters and staff,
266. And the goblets of goodly wine I quaff,
267. And the mischief I make in the idle throng,
268. I should not continue the business long.

269. _Pilgrims (chaunting)._ In hac uibe, lux solennis,
270. Ver aeternum, pax perennis,
271. In hac odor implens caelos,
272. In hac semper festum melos!

273. _Prince Henry._ Do you observe that monk among the train,
274. Who pours from his great throat the roaring bass,
275. As a cathedral spout pours out the rain,
276. And this way turns his rubicund, round face?

277. _Elsie._ It is the same who, on the Strasburg square,
278. Preached to the people in the open air.

279. _Prince Henry._ And he has crossed o'er mountain, field, and fell,
280. On that good steed, that seems to bear him well,
281. The hackney of the Friars of Orders Gray,
282. His own stout legs! He, too, was in the play,
283. Both as King Herod and Ben Israel.
284. Good morrow, Friar!

285. _Friar Cuthbert._ Good morrow, noble Sir!

286. _Prince Henry._ I speak in German, for, unless I err,
287. You are a German.

288. _Friar Cuthbert._ I cannot gainsay you.
289. But by what instinct, or what secret sign,
290. Meeting me here, do you straightway divine
291. That northward of the Alps my country lies?

292. _Prince Henry._ Your accent, like St, Peter's, would betray you,
293. Did not your yellow beard and your blue eyes,
294. Moreover, we have seen your face before,
295. And heard you preach at the Cathedral door
296. On Easter Sunday, in the Strasburg square
297. We were among the crowd that gathered there,
298. And saw you play the Rabbi with great skill,
299. As if, by leaning o'er so many years
300. To walk with little children, your own will
301. Had caught a childish attitude from theirs,
302. A kind of stooping in its form and gait,
303. And could no longer stand erect and straight.
304. Whence come you now?

305. _Friar Cuthbert._ From the old monastery
306. Of Hirschau, in the forest; being sent
307. Upon a pilgrimage to Benevent,
308. To see the image of the Virgin Mary,
309. That moves its holy eyes, and sometimes speaks,
310. And lets the piteous tears run down its cheeks,
311. To touch the hearts of the impenitent.

312. _Prince Henry._ O, had I faith, as in the days gone by,
313. That knew no doubt, and feared no mystery!

314. _Lucifer (at a distance)._ Ho, Cuthbert! Friar Cuthbert!

315. _Friar Cuthbert._ Farewell, Prince!
316. I cannot stay to argue and convince.

317. _Prince Henry._ This is indeed the blessed Mary's land,
318. Virgin and Mother of our dear Redeemer!
319. All hearts are touched and softened at her name;
320. Alike the bandit, with the bloody hand,
321. The priest, the prince, the scholar, and the peasant,
322. The man of deeds, the visionary dreamer,
323. Pay homage to her as one ever present!
324. And even as children, who have much offended
325. A too indulgent father, in great shame,
326. Penitent, and yet not daring unattended
327. To go into his presence, at the gate
328. Speak with their sister, and confiding wait
329. Till she goes in before and intercedes;
330. So men, repenting of their evil deeds,
331. And yet not venturing rashly to draw near
332. With their requests an angry father's ear,
333. Offer to her their prayers and their confession,
334. And she for them in heaven makes intercession.
335. And if our Faith had given us nothing more
336. Than this example of all womanhood,
337. So mild, so merciful, so strong, so good,
338. So patient, peaceful, loyal, loving, pure,
339. This were enough to prove it higher and truer
340. Than all the creeds the world had known before.

341. _Pilgrims (chaunting afar off)_. Urbs ccelestis, urbs beata,
342. Supra petram collocata,
343. Urbs in portu satis tuto
344. De longinquo te saluto,
345. Te saluto, te suspiro,
346. Te affecto, te requiro!

347. * * * * *

348. THE INN AT GENOA.

349. * * * * *

350. _A terrace overlooking the sea. Night._

351. _Prince Henry._ It is the sea, it is the sea,
352. In all its vague immensity,
353. Fading and darkening in the distance!
354. Silent, majestical, and slow,
355. The white ships haunt it to and fro,
356. With all their ghostly sails unfurled,
357. As phantoms from another world
358. Haunt the dim confines of existence!
359. But ah! how few can comprehend
360. Their signals, or to what good end
361. From land to land they come and go!
362. Upon a sea more vast and dark
363. The spirits of the dead embark,
364. All voyaging to unknown coasts.
365. We wave our farewells from the shore,
366. And they depart, and come no more,
367. Or come as phantoms and as ghosts.

368. Above the darksome sea of death
369. Looms the great life that is to be,
370. A land of cloud and mystery,
371. A dim mirage, with shapes of men
372. Long dead, and passed beyond our ken.
373. Awe-struck we gaze, and hold our breath
374. Till the fair pageant vanisheth,
375. Leaving us in perplexity,
376. And doubtful whether it has been
377. A vision of the world unseen,
378. Or a bright image of our own
379. Against the sky in vapors thrown.

380. _Lucifer (singing from the sea)_. Thou didst not make it, thou
381. canst not mend it,
382. But thou hast the power to end it!
383. The sea is silent, the sea is discreet,
384. Deep it lies at thy very feet;
385. There is no confessor like unto Death!
386. Thou canst not see him, but he is near;
387. Thou needest not whisper above thy breath,
388. And he will hear;
389. He will answer the questions,
390. The vague surmises and suggestions,
391. That fill thy soul with doubt and fear!

392. _Prince Henry_. The fisherman, who lies afloat,
393. With shadowy sail, in yonder boat,
394. Is singing softly to the Night!
395. But do I comprehend aright
396. The meaning of the words he sung
397. So sweetly in his native tongue?
398. Ah, yes! the sea is still and deep.
399. All things within its bosom sleep!
400. A single step, and all is o'er;
401. A plunge, a bubble, and no more;
402. And thou, dear Elsie, wilt be free
403. From martyrdom and agony.

404. _Elsie (coming from her chamber upon the terrace)._
405. The night is calm and cloudless,
406. And still as still can be,
407. And the stars come forth to listen
408. To the music of the sea.
409. They gather, and gather, and gather,
410. Until they crowd the sky,
411. And listen, in breathless silence,
412. To the solemn litany.
413. It begins in rocky caverns,
414. As a voice that chaunts alone
415. To the pedals of the organ
416. In monotonous undertone;
417. And anon from shelving beaches,
418. And shallow sands beyond,
419. In snow-white robes uprising
420. The ghostly choirs respond.
421. And sadly and unceasing
422. The mournful voice sings on,
423. And the snow-white choirs still answer
424. Christe eleison!

425. _Prince Henry._ Angel of God! thy finer sense perceives
426. Celestial and perpetual harmonies!
427. Thy purer soul, that trembles and believes,
428. Hears the archangel's trumpet in the breeze,
429. And where the forest rolls, or ocean heaves,
430. Cecilia's organ sounding in the seas,
431. And tongues of prophets speaking in the leaves.
432. But I hear discord only and despair,
433. And whispers as of demons in the air!

434. * * * * *

435. AT SEA.

436. * * * * *

437. _Il Padrone._ The wind upon our quarter lies,
438. And on before the freshening gale,
439. That fills the snow-white lateen sail,
440. Swiftly our light felucca flies.
441. Around, the billows burst and foam;
442. They lift her o'er the sunken rock,
443. They beat her sides with many a shock,
444. And then upon their flowing dome
445. They poise her, like a weathercock!
446. Between us and the western skies
447. The hills of Corsica arise;
448. Eastward, in yonder long, blue line,
449. The summits of the Apennine,
450. And southward, and still far away,
451. Salerno, on its sunny bay.
452. You cannot see it, where it lies.

453. _Prince Henry._ Ah, would that never more mine eyes
454. Might see its towers by night or day!

455. _Elsie._ Behind us, dark and awfully,
456. There comes a cloud out of the sea,
457. That bears the form of a hunted deer,
458. With hide of brown, and hoofs of black,
459. And antlers laid upon its back,
460. And fleeing fast and wild with fear,
461. As if the hounds were on its track!

462. _Prince Henry._ Lo! while we gaze, it breaks and falls
463. In shapeless masses, like the walls
464. Of a burnt city. Broad and red
465. The fires of the descending sun
466. Glare through the windows, and o'erhead,
467. Athwart the vapors, dense and dun,
468. Long shafts of silvery light arise,
469. Like rafters that support the skies!

470. _Elsie._ See! from its summit the lurid levin
471. Flashes downward without warning,
472. As Lucifer, son of the morning,
473. Fell from the battlements of heaven!

474. _Il Padrone._ I must entreat you, friends, below!
475. The angry storm begins to blow,
476. For the weather changes with the moon.
477. All this morning, until noon,
478. We had baffling winds, and sudden flaws
479. Struck the sea with their cat's-paws.
480. Only a little hour ago
481. I was whistling to Saint Antonio
482. For a capful of wind to fill our sail,
483. And instead of a breeze he has sent a gale.
484. Last night I saw St. Elmo's stars,
485. With their glimmering lanterns, all at play
486. On the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars,
487. And I knew we should have foul weather to-day.
488. Cheerily, my hearties! yo heave ho!
489. Brail up the mainsail, and let her go
490. As the winds will and Saint Antonio!

491. Do you see that Livornese felucca,
492. That vessel to the windward yonder,
493. Running with her gunwale under?
494. I was looking when the wind o'ertook her,
495. She had all sail set, and the only wonder
496. Is that at once the strength of the blast
497. Did not carry away her mast.
498. She is a galley of the Gran Duca,
499. That, through the fear of the Algerines,
500. Convoys those lazy brigantines,
501. Laden with wine and oil from Lucca.
502. Now all is ready, high and low;
503. Blow, blow, good Saint Antonio!

504. Ha! that is the first dash of the rain,
505. With a sprinkle of spray above the rails,
506. Just enough to moisten our sails,
507. And make them ready for the strain.
508. See how she leaps, as the blasts o'ertake her,
509. And speeds away with a bone in her mouth!
510. Now keep her head toward the south,
