1. I.
2. What is this I read in history,
3. Full of marvel, full of mystery,
4. Difficult to understand?
5. Is it fiction, is it truth?
6. Children in the flower of youth,
7. Heart in heart, and hand in hand,
8. Ignorant of what helps or harms,
9. Without armor, without arms,
10. Journeying to the Holy Land!

11. Who shall answer or divine?
12. Never since the world was made
13. Such a wonderful crusade
14. Started forth for Palestine.
15. Never while the world shall last
16. Will it reproduce the past;
17. Never will it see again
18. Such an army, such a band,
19. Over mountain, over main,
20. Journeying to the Holy Land.

21. Like a shower of blossoms blown
22. From the parent trees were they;
23. Like a flock of birds that fly
24. Through the unfrequented sky,
25. Holding nothing as their own,
26. Passed they into lands unknown,
27. Passed to suffer and to die.

28. O the simple, child-like trust!
29. O the faith that could believe
30. What the harnessed, iron-mailed
31. Knights of Christendom had failed,
32. By their prowess, to achieve,
33. They, the children, could and must!

34. Little thought the Hermit, preaching
35. Holy Wars to knight and baron,
36. That the words dropped in his teaching,
37. His entreaty, his beseeching,
38. Would by children's hands be gleaned,
39. And the staff on which he leaned
40. Blossom like the rod of Aaron.

41. As a summer wind upheaves
42. The innumerable leaves
43. In the bosom of a wood,--
44. Not as separate leaves, but massed
45. All together by the blast,--
46. So for evil or for good
47. His resistless breath upheaved
48. All at once the many-leaved,
49. Many-thoughted multitude.

50. In the tumult of the air
51. Rock the boughs with all the nests
52. Cradled on their tossing crests;
53. By the fervor of his prayer
54. Troubled hearts were everywhere
55. Rocked and tossed in human breasts.

56. For a century, at least,
57. His prophetic voice had ceased;
58. But the air was heated still
59. By his lurid words and will,
60. As from fires in far-off woods,
61. In the autumn of the year,
62. An unwonted fever broods
63. In the sultry atmosphere.

64. II.
65. In Cologne the bells were ringing,
66. In Cologne the nuns were singing
67. Hymns and canticles divine;
68. Loud the monks sang in their stalls,
69. And the thronging streets were loud
70. With the voices of the crowd;--
71. Underneath the city walls
72. Silent flowed the river Rhine.

73. From the gates, that summer day,
74. Clad in robes of hodden gray,
75. With the red cross on the breast,
76. Azure-eyed and golden-haired,
77. Forth the young crusaders fared;
78. While above the band devoted
79. Consecrated banners floated,
80. Fluttered many a flag and streamer,
81. And the cross o'er all the rest!
82. Singing lowly, meekly, slowly,
83. 'Give us, give us back the holy
84. Sepulchre of the Redeemer!'
85. On the vast procession pressed,
86. Youths and maidens. . . .

87. III.
88. Ah! what master hand shall paint
89. How they journeyed on their way,
90. How the days grew long and dreary,
91. How their little feet grew weary,
92. How their little hearts grew faint!

93. Ever swifter day by day
94. Flowed the homeward river; ever
95. More and more its whitening current
96. Broke and scattered into spray,
97. Till the calmly-flowing river
98. Changed into a mountain torrent,
99. Rushing from its glacier green
100. Down through chasm and black ravine.

101. Like a phoenix in its nest,
102. Burned the red sun in the West,
103. Sinking in an ashen cloud;
104. In the East, above the crest
105. Of the sea-like mountain chain,
106. Like a phoenix from its shroud,
107. Came the red sun back again.

108. Now around them, white with snow,
109. Closed the mountain peaks. Below,
110. Headlong from the precipice
111. Down into the dark abyss,
112. Plunged the cataract, white with foam;
113. And it said, or seemed to say:
114. 'Oh return, while yet you may,
115. Foolish children, to your home,
116. There the Holy City is!'

117. But the dauntless leader said:
118. 'Faint not, though your bleeding feet
119. O'er these slippery paths of sleet
120. Move but painfully and slowly;
121. Other feet than yours have bled;
122. Other tears than yours been shed
123. Courage! lose not heart or hope;
124. On the mountains' southern slope
125. Lies Jerusalem the Holy!'
126. As a white rose in its pride,
127. By the wind in summer-tide
128. Tossed and loosened from the branch,
129. Showers its petals o'er the ground,
130. From the distant mountain's side,
131. Scattering all its snows around,
132. With mysterious, muffled sound,
133. Loosened, fell the avalanche.
134. Voices, echoes far and near,
135. Roar of winds and waters blending,
136. Mists uprising, clouds impending,
137. Filled them with a sense of fear,
138. Formless, nameless, never ending.
