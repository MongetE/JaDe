1. Three Silences there are: the first of speech,
2. The second of desire, the third of thought;
3. This is the lore a Spanish monk, distraught
4. With dreams and visions, was the first to teach.
5. These Silences, commingling each with each,
6. Made up the perfect Silence, that he sought
7. And prayed for, and wherein at times he caught
8. Mysterious sounds from realms beyond our reach.
9. O thou, whose daily life anticipates
10. The life to come, and in whose thought and word
11. The spiritual world preponderates.
12. Hermit of Amesbury! thou too hast heard
13. Voices and melodies from beyond the gates,
14. And speakest only when thy soul is stirred!
