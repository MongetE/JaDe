1. O Hemlock tree! O hemlock tree! how faithful are thy branches!
2. Green not alone in summer time,
3. But in the winter's frost and rime!
4. O hemlock tree! O hemlock tree! how faithful are thy branches!

5. O maiden fair! O maiden fair! how faithless is thy bosom!
6. To love me in prosperity,
7. And leave me in adversity!
8. O maiden fair! O maiden fair! how faithless is thy bosom!

9. The nightingale, the nightingale, thou tak'st for thine example!
10. So long as summer laughs she sings,
11. But in the autumn spreads her wings!
12. The nightingale, the nightingale, thou tak'st for thine example!

13. The meadow brook, the meadow brook, is mirroro f thy falsehood!
14. It flows so long as falls the rain,
15. In drought its springs soon dry again.
16. The meadow brook, the meadow brook, is mirror of thy falsehood!
