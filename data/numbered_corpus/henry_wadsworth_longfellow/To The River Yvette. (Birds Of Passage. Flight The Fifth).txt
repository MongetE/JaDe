1. O lovely river of Yvette!
2. O darling river! like a bride,
3. Some dimpled, bashful, fair Lisette,
4. Thou goest to wed the Orge's tide.

5. Maincourt, and lordly Dampierre,
6. See and salute thee on thy way,
7. And, with a blessing and a prayer,
8. Ring the sweet bells of St. Forget.

9. The valley of Chevreuse in vain
10. Would hold thee in its fond embrace;
11. Thou glidest from its arms again
12. And hurriest on with swifter pace.

13. Thou wilt not stay; with restless feet,
14. Pursuing still thine onward flight,
15. Thou goest as one in haste to meet
16. Her sole desire, her heart's delight.

17. O lovely river of Yvette!
18. O darling stream! on balanced wings
19. The wood-birds sang the chansonnette
20. That here a wandering poet sings.
