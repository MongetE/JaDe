1. In the Valley of the Vire
2. Still is seen an ancient mill,
3. With its gables quaint and queer,
4. And beneath the window-sill,
5. On the stone,
6. These words alone:
7. 'Oliver Basselin lived here.'

8. Far above it, on the steep,
9. Ruined stands the old Chateau;
10. Nothing but the donjon-keep
11. Left for shelter or for show.
12. Its vacant eyes
13. Stare at the skies,
14. Stare at the valley green and deep.

15. Once a convent, old and brown,
16. Looked, but ah! it looks no more,
17. From the neighboring hillside down
18. On the rushing and the roar
19. Of the stream
20. Whose sunny gleam
21. Cheers the little Norman town.

22. In that darksome mill of stone,
23. To the water's dash and din,
24. Careless, humble, and unknown,
25. Sang the poet Basselin
26. Songs that fill
27. That ancient mill
28. With a splendor of its own.

29. Never feeling of unrest
30. Broke the pleasant dream he dreamed;
31. Only made to be his nest,
32. All the lovely valley seemed;
33. No desire
34. Of soaring higher
35. Stirred or fluttered in his breast.

36. True, his songs were not divine;
37. Were not songs of that high art,
38. Which, as winds do in the pine,
39. Find an answer in each heart;
40. But the mirth
41. Of this green earth
42. Laughed and revelled in his line.

43. From the alehouse and the inn,
44. Opening on the narrow street,
45. Came the loud, convivial din,
46. Singing and applause of feet,
47. The laughing lays
48. That in those days
49. Sang the poet Basselin.

50. In the castle, cased in steel,
51. Knights, who fought at Agincourt,
52. Watched and waited, spur on heel;
53. But the poet sang for sport
54. Songs that rang
55. Another clang,
56. Songs that lowlier hearts could feel.

57. In the convent, clad in gray,
58. Sat the monks in lonely cells,
59. Paced the cloisters, knelt to pray,
60. And the poet heard their bells;
61. But his rhymes
62. Found other chimes,
63. Nearer to the earth than they.

64. Gone are all the barons bold,
65. Gone are all the knights and squires,
66. Gone the abbot stern and cold,
67. And the brotherhood of friars;
68. Not a name
69. Remains to fame,
70. From those mouldering days of old!

71. But the poet's memory here
72. Of the landscape makes a part;
73. Like the river, swift and clear,
74. Flows his song through many a heart;
75. Haunting still
76. That ancient mill,
77. In the Valley of the Vire.
