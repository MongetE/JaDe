1. Up soared the lark into the air,
2. A shaft of song, a wing√©d prayer,
3. As if a soul released from pain
4. Were flying back to heaven again.

5. St. Francis heard: it was to him
6. An emblem of the Seraphim;
7. The upward motion of the fire,
8. The light, the heat, the heart's desire.

9. Around Assisi's convent gate
10. The birds, God's poor who cannot wait,
11. From moor and mere and darksome wood
12. Come flocking for their dole of food.

13. 'O brother birds,' St. Francis said,
14. 'Ye come to me and ask for bread,
15. But not with bread alone to-day
16. Shall ye be fed and sent away.

17. 'Ye shall be fed, ye happy birds,
18. With manna of celestial words;
19. Not mine, though mine they seem to be,
20. Not mine, though they be spoken through me.

21. 'Oh, doubly are ye bound to praise
22. The great Creator in your lays;
23. He giveth you your plumes of down,
24. Your crimson hoods, your cloaks of brown.

25. 'He giveth you your wings to fly
26. And breathe a purer air on high,
27. And careth for you everywhere,
28. Who for yourselves so little care!'

29. With flutter of swift wings and songs
30. Together rose the feathered throngs,
31. And singing scattered far apart;
32. Deep peace was in St. Francis' heart.

33. He knew not if the brotherhood
34. His homily had understood;
35. He only knew that to one ear
36. The meaning of his words was clear.
