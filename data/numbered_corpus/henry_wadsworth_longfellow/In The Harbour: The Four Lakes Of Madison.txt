1. Four limpid lakes,--four Naiades
2. Or sylvan deities are these,
3. In flowing robes of azure dressed;
4. Four lovely handmaids, that uphold
5. Their shining mirrors, rimmed with gold,
6. To the fair city in the West.

7. By day the coursers of the sun
8. Drink of these waters as they run
9. Their swift diurnal round on high;
10. By night the constellations glow
11. Far down the hollow deeps below,
12. And glimmer in another sky.

13. Fair lakes, serene and full of light,
14. Fair town, arrayed in robes of white,
15. How visionary ye appear!
16. All like a floating landscape seems
17. In cloud-land or the land of dreams,
18. Bathed in a golden atmosphere!
