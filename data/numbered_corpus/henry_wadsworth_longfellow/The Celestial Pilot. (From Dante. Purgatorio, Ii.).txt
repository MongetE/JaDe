1. And now, behold! as at the approach of morning,
2. Through the gross vapors, Mars grows fiery red
3. Down in the west upon the ocean floor,
4. Appeared to me,-- may I again behold it!--
5. A light along the sea, so swiftly coming,
6. Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled.
7. And when therefrom I had withdrawn a little
8. Mine eyes, that I might question my conductor,
9. Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.
10. Thereafter, on all sides of it, appeared
11. I knew not what of white, and underneath,
12. Little by little, there came forth another.
13. My master yet had uttered not a word,
14. While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;
15. But, when he clearly recognized the pilot,
16. He cried aloud : 'Quick, quick, and bow the knee!
17. Behold the Angel of God! fold up thy hands!
18. Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!
19. See, how he scorns all human arguments,
20. So that no oar he wants, nor other sail
21. Than his own wings, between so distant shores!
22. See, how he holds them, pointed straight to heaven,
23. Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,
24. That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!'
25. And then, as nearer and more near us came
26. The Bird of Heaven, more glorious he appeared,
27. So that the eye could not sustain his presence,
28. But down I cast it; and he came to shore
29. With a small vessel, gliding swift and light,
30. So that the waters swallowed nought thereof.
31. Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot!
32. Beatitude seemed written on his face!
33. And more than a hundred spirits sat within
34. '
35. In exitu Israel de AEgypto!
36. '
37. Thus sang they all together in one voice,
38. With whatso in that Psalm is after written.
39. Then made he sight of holy rood upon them,
40. Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,
41. And he departed swiftly as he came.
