1. Northward over Drontheim,
2. Flew the clamorous sea-gulls,
3. Sang the lark and linnet
4. From the meadows green;

5. Weeping in her chamber,
6. Lonely and unhappy,
7. Sat the Drottning Thyri,
8. Sat King Olaf's Queen.

9. In at all the windows
10. Streamed the pleasant sunshine,
11. On the roof above her
12. Softly cooed the dove;

13. But the sound she heard not,
14. Nor the sunshine heeded,
15. For the thoughts of Thyri
16. Were not thoughts of love,

17. Then King Olaf entered,
18. Beautiful as morning,
19. Like the sun at Easter
20. Shone his happy face;

21. In his hand he carried
22. Angelicas uprooted,
23. With delicious fragrance
24. Filling all the place.

25. Like a rainy midnight
26. Sat the Drottning Thyri,
27. Even the smile of Olaf
28. Could not cheer her gloom;

29. Nor the stalks he gave her
30. With a gracious gesture,
31. And with words as pleasant
32. As their own perfume.

33. In her hands he placed them,
34. And her jewelled fingers
35. Through the green leaves glistened
36. Like the dews of morn;

37. But she cast them from her,
38. Haughty and indignant,
39. On the floor she threw them
40. With a look of scorn.

41. 'Richer presents,' said she,
42. 'Gave King Harald Gormson
43. To the Queen, my mother,
44. Than such worthless weeds;

45. 'When he ravaged Norway,
46. Laying waste the kingdom,
47. Seizing scatt and treasure
48. For her royal needs.

49. 'But thou darest not venture
50. Through the Sound to Vendland,
51. My domains to rescue
52. From King Burislaf;

53. 'Lest King Svend of Denmark,
54. Forked Beard, my brother,
55. Scatter all thy vessels
56. As the wind the chaff.'

57. Then up sprang King Olaf,
58. Like a reindeer bounding,
59. With an oath he answered
60. Thus the luckless Queen:

61. 'Never yet did Olaf
62. Fear King Svend of Denmark;
63. This right hand shall hale him
64. By his forked chin!'

65. Then he left the chamber,
66. Thundering through the doorway,
67. Loud his steps resounded
68. Down the outer stair.

69. Smarting with the insult,
70. Through the streets of Drontheim
71. Strode he red and wrathful,
72. With his stately air.

73. All his ships he gathered,
74. Summoned all his forces,
75. Making his war levy
76. In the region round;

77. Down the coast of Norway,
78. Like a flock of sea-gulls,
79. Sailed the fleet of Olaf
80. Through the Danish Sound.

81. With his own hand fearless,
82. Steered he the Long Serpent,
83. Strained the creaking cordage,
84. Bent each boom and gaff;

85. Till in Venland landing,
86. The domains of Thyri
87. He redeemed and rescued
88. From King Burislaf.

89. Then said Olaf, laughing,
90. 'Not ten yoke of oxen
91. Have the power to draw us
92. Like a woman's hair!

93. 'Now will I confess it,
94. Better things are jewels
95. Than angelica stalks are
96. For a Queen to wear.'
