1. It is the Harvest Moon! On gilded vanes
2. And roofs of villages, on woodland crests
3. And their aerial neighborhoods of nests
4. Deserted, on the curtained window-panes
5. Of rooms where children sleep, on country lanes
6. And harvest-fields, its mystic splendor rests!
7. Gone are the birds that were our summer guests,
8. With the last sheaves return the laboring wains!
9. All things are symbols: the external shows
10. Of Nature have their image in the mind,
11. As flowers and fruits and falling of the leaves;
12. The song-birds leave us at the summer's close,
13. Only the empty nests are left behind,
14. And pipings of the quail among the sheaves.
