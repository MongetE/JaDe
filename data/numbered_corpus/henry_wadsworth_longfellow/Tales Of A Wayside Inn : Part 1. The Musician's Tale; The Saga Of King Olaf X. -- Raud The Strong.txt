1. 'All the old gods are dead,
2. All the wild warlocks fled;
3. But the White Christ lives and reigns,
4. And throughout my wide domains
5. His Gospel shall be spread!'
6. On the Evangelists
7. Thus swore King Olaf.

8. But still in dreams of the night
9. Beheld he the crimson light,
10. And heard the voice that defied
11. Him who was crucified,
12. And challenged him to the fight.
13. To Sigurd the Bishop
14. King Olaf confessed it.

15. And Sigurd the Bishop said,
16. 'The old gods are not dead,
17. For the great Thor still reigns,
18. And among the Jarls and Thanes
19. The old witchcraft still is spread.'
20. Thus to King Olaf
21. Said Sigurd the Bishop.

22. 'Far north in the Salten Fiord,
23. By rapine, fire, and sword,
24. Lives the Viking, Raud the Strong;
25. All the Godoe Isles belong
26. To him and his heathen horde.'
27. Thus went on speaking
28. Sigurd the Bishop.

29. 'A warlock, a wizard is he,
30. And lord of the wind and the sea;
31. And whichever way he sails,
32. He has ever favoring gales,
33. By his craft in sorcery.'
34. Here the sign of the cross
35. Made devoutly King Olaf.

36. 'With rites that we both abhor,
37. He worships Odin and Thor;
38. So it cannot yet be said,
39. That all the old gods are dead,
40. And the warlocks are no more,'
41. Flushing with anger
42. Said Sigurd the Bishop.

43. Then King Olaf cried aloud:
44. 'I will talk with this mighty Raud,
45. And along the Salten Fiord
46. Preach the Gospel with my sword,
47. Or be brought back in my shroud!'
48. So northward from Drontheim
49. Sailed King Olaf!
