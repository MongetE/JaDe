1. Clear fount of light! my native land on high,
2. Bright with a glory that shall never fade!
3. Mansion of truth! without a veil or shade,
4. Thy holy quiet meets the spirit's eye.
5. There dwells the soul in its ethereal essence,
6. Gasping no longer for life's feeble breath;
7. But, sentinelled in heaven, its glorious presence
8. With pitying eye beholds, yet fears not, death.
9. Beloved country! banished from thy shore,
10. A stranger in this prison-house of clay,
11. The exiled spirit weeps and sighs for thee!
12. Heavenward the bright perfections I adore
13. Direct, and the sure promise cheers the way,
14. That, whither love aspires, there shall my dwelling be.
