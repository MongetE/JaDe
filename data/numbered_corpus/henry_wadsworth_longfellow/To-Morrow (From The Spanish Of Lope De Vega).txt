1. Lord, what am I, that with unceasing care
2. Thou did'st seek after me, that Thou did'st wait
3. Wet with unhealthy dews before my gate,
4. And pass the gloomy nights of winter there?
5. Oh, strange delusion, that I did not greet
6. Thy blest approach, and oh, to heaven how lost
7. If my ingratitude's unkindly frost
8. Has chilled the bleeding wounds upon Thy feet.
9. How oft my guardian angel gently cried,
10. 'Soul, from thy casement look, and thou shalt see
11. How He persists to knock and wait for thee!'
12. And oh, how often to that Voice of sorrow,
13. 'Tomorrow we will open,' I replied,
14. And when the morrow came I answered still 'Tomorrow.'
