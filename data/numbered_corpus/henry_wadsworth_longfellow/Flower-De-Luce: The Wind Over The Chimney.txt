1. See, the fire is sinking low,
2. Dusky red the embers glow,
3. While above them still I cower,
4. While a moment more I linger,
5. Though the clock, with lifted finger,
6. Points beyond the midnight hour.

7. Sings the blackened log a tune
8. Learned in some forgotten June
9. From a school-boy at his play,
10. When they both were young together,
11. Heart of youth and summer weather
12. Making all their holiday.

13. And the night-wind rising, hark!
14. How above there in the dark,
15. In the midnight and the snow,
16. Ever wilder, fiercer, grander,
17. Like the trumpets of Iskander,
18. All the noisy chimneys blow!

19. Every quivering tongue of flame
20. Seems to murmur some great name,
21. Seems to say to me, 'Aspire!'
22. But the night-wind answers, 'Hollow
23. Are the visions that you follow,
24. Into darkness sinks your fire!'

25. Then the flicker of the blaze
26. Gleams on volumes of old days,
27. Written by masters of the art,
28. Loud through whose majestic pages
29. Rolls the melody of ages,
30. Throb the harp-strings of the heart.

31. And again the tongues of flame
32. Start exulting and exclaim:
33. 'These are prophets, bards, and seers;
34. In the horoscope of nations,
35. Like ascendant constellations,
36. They control the coming years.'

37. But the night-wind cries: 'Despair!
38. Those who walk with feet of air
39. Leave no long-enduring marks;
40. At God's forges incandescent
41. Mighty hammers beat incessant,
42. These are but the flying sparks.

43. 'Dust are all the hands that wrought;
44. Books are sepulchres of thought;
45. The dead laurels of the dead
46. Rustle for a moment only,
47. Like the withered leaves in lonely
48. Churchyards at some passing tread.'

49. Suddenly the flame sinks down;
50. Sink the rumors of renown;
51. And alone the night-wind drear
52. Clamors louder, wilder, vaguer,--
53. ''Tis the brand of Meleager
54. Dying on the hearth-stone here!'

55. And I answer,--'Though it be,
56. Why should that discomfort me?
57. No endeavor is in vain;
58. Its reward is in the doing,
59. And the rapture of pursuing
60. Is the prize the vanquished gain.'
