1. You shall hear how Hiawatha
2. Prayed and fasted in the forest,
3. Not for greater skill in hunting,
4. Not for greater craft in fishing,
5. Not for triumphs in the battle,
6. And renown among the warriors,
7. But for profit of the people,
8. For advantage of the nations.
9. First he built a lodge for fasting,
10. Built a wigwam in the forest,
11. By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
12. In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time,
13. In the Moon of Leaves he built it,
14. And, with dreams and visions many,
15. Seven whole days and nights he fasted.
16. On the first day of his fasting
17. Through the leafy woods he wandered;
18. Saw the deer start from the thicket,
19. Saw the rabbit in his burrow,
20. Heard the pheasant, Bena, drumming,
21. Heard the squirrel, Adjidaumo,
22. Rattling in his hoard of acorns,
23. Saw the pigeon, the Omeme,
24. Building nests among the pinetrees,
25. And in flocks the wild-goose, Wawa,
26. Flying to the fen-lands northward,
27. Whirring, wailing far above him.
28. 'Master of Life!' he cried, desponding,
29. 'Must our lives depend on these things?'
30. On the next day of his fasting
31. By the river's brink he wandered,
32. Through the Muskoday, the meadow,
33. Saw the wild rice, Mahnomonee,
34. Saw the blueberry, Meenahga,
35. And the strawberry, Odahmin,
36. And the gooseberry, Shahbomin,
37. And the grape.vine, the Bemahgut,
38. Trailing o'er the alder-branches,
39. Filling all the air with fragrance!
40. 'Master of Life!' he cried, desponding,
41. 'Must our lives depend on these things?'
42. On the third day of his fasting
43. By the lake he sat and pondered,
44. By the still, transparent water;
45. Saw the sturgeon, Nahma, leaping,
46. Scattering drops like beads of wampum,
47. Saw the yellow perch, the Sahwa,
48. Like a sunbeam in the water,
49. Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,
50. And the herring, Okahahwis,
51. And the Shawgashee, the crawfish!
52. 'Master of Life!' he cried, desponding,
53. 'Must our lives depend on these things?'
54. On the fourth day of his fasting
55. In his lodge he lay exhausted;
56. From his couch of leaves and branches
57. Gazing with half-open eyelids,
58. Full of shadowy dreams and visions,
59. On the dizzy, swimming landscape,
60. On the gleaming of the water,
61. On the splendor of the sunset.
62. And he saw a youth approaching,
63. Dressed in garments green and yellow,
64. Coming through the purple twilight,
65. Through the splendor of the sunset;
66. Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead,
67. And his hair was soft and golden.
68. Standing at the open doorway,
69. Long he looked at Hiawatha,
70. Looked with pity and compassion
71. On his wasted form and features,
72. And, in accents like the sighing
73. Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops,
74. Said he, 'O my Hiawatha!
75. All your prayers are heard in heaven,
76. For you pray not like the others;
77. Not for greater skill in hunting,
78. Not for greater craft in fishing,
79. Not for triumph in the battle,
80. Nor renown among the warriors,
81. But for profit of the people,
82. For advantage of the nations.
83. 'From the Master of Life descending,
84. I, the friend of man, Mondamin,
85. Come to warn you and instruct you,
86. How by struggle and by labor
87. You shall gain what you have prayed for.
88. Rise up from your bed of branches,
89. Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!'
90. Faint with famine, Hiawatha
91. Started from his bed of branches,
92. From the twilight of his wigwam
93. Forth into the flush of sunset
94. Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;
95. At his touch he felt new courage
96. Throbbing in his brain and bosom,
97. Felt new life and hope and vigor
98. Run through every nerve and fibre.
99. So they wrestled there together
100. In the glory of the sunset,
101. And the more they strove and struggled,
102. Stronger still grew Hiawatha;
103. Till the darkness fell around them,
104. And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
105. From her nest among the pine-trees,
106. Gave a cry of lamentation,
107. Gave a scream of pain and famine.
108. ''T Is enough!' then said Mondamin,
109. Smiling upon Hiawatha,
110. 'But tomorrow, when the sun sets,
111. I will come again to try you.'
112. And he vanished, and was seen not;
113. Whether sinking as the rain sinks,
114. Whether rising as the mists rise,
115. Hiawatha saw not, knew not,
116. Only saw that he had vanished,
117. Leaving him alone and fainting,
118. With the misty lake below him,
119. And the reeling stars above him.
120. On the morrow and the next day,
121. When the sun through heaven descending,
122. Like a red and burning cinder
123. From the hearth of the Great Spirit,
124. Fell into the western waters,
125. Came Mondamin for the trial,
126. For the strife with Hiawatha;
127. Came as silent as the dew comes,
128. From the empty air appearing,
129. Into empty air returning,
130. Taking shape when earth it touches,
131. But invisible to all men
132. In its coming and its going.
133. Thrice they wrestled there together
134. In the glory of the sunset,
135. Till the darkness fell around them,
136. Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
137. From her nest among the pine-trees,
138. Uttered her loud cry of famine,
139. And Mondamin paused to listen.
140. Tall and beautiful he stood there,
141. In his garments green and yellow;
142. To and fro his plumes above him,
143. Waved and nodded with his breathing,
144. And the sweat of the encounter
145. Stood like drops of dew upon him.
146. And he cried, 'O Hiawatha!
147. Bravely have you wrestled with me,
148. Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me,
149. And the Master of Life, who sees us,
150. He will give to you the triumph!'
151. Then he smiled, and said: 'To-morrow
152. Is the last day of your conflict,
153. Is the last day of your fasting.
154. You will conquer and o'ercome me;
155. Make a bed for me to lie in,
156. Where the rain may fall upon me,
157. Where the sun may come and warm me;
158. Strip these garments, green and yellow,
159. Strip this nodding plumage from me,
160. Lay me in the earth, and make it
161. Soft and loose and light above me.
162. 'Let no hand disturb my slumber,
163. Let no weed nor worm molest me,
164. Let not Kahgahgee, the raven,
165. Come to haunt me and molest me,
166. Only come yourself to watch me,
167. Till I wake, and start, and quicken,
168. Till I leap into the sunshine'
169. And thus saying, he departed;
170. Peacefully slept Hiawatha,
171. But he heard the Wawonaissa,
172. Heard the whippoorwill complaining,
173. Perched upon his lonely wigwam;
174. Heard the rushing Sebowisha,
175. Heard the rivulet rippling near him,
176. Talking to the darksome forest;
177. Heard the sighing of the branches,
178. As they lifted and subsided
179. At the passing of the night-wind,
180. Heard them, as one hears in slumber
181. Far-off murmurs, dreamy whispers:
182. Peacefully slept Hiawatha.
183. On the morrow came Nokomis,
184. On the seventh day of his fasting,
185. Came with food for Hiawatha,
186. Came imploring and bewailing,
187. Lest his hunger should o'ercome him,
188. Lest his fasting should be fatal.
189. But he tasted not, and touched not,
190. Only said to her, 'Nokomis,
191. Wait until the sun is setting,
192. Till the darkness falls around us,
193. Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
194. Crying from the desolate marshes,
195. Tells us that the day is ended.'
196. Homeward weeping went Nokomis,
197. Sorrowing for her Hiawatha,
198. Fearing lest his strength should fail him,
199. Lest his fasting should be fatal.
200. He meanwhile sat weary waiting
201. For the coming of Mondamin,
202. Till the shadows, pointing eastward,
203. Lengthened over field and forest,
204. Till the sun dropped from the heaven,
205. Floating on the waters westward,
206. As a red leaf in the Autumn
207. Falls and floats upon the water,
208. Falls and sinks into its bosom.
209. And behold! the young Mondamin,
210. With his soft and shining tresses,
211. With his garments green and yellow,
212. With his long and glossy plumage,
213. Stood and beckoned at the doorway.
214. And as one in slumber walking,
215. Pale and haggard, but undaunted,
216. From the wigwam Hiawatha
217. Came and wrestled with Mondamin.
218. Round about him spun the landscape,
219. Sky and forest reeled together,
220. And his strong heart leaped within him,
221. As the sturgeon leaps and struggles
222. In a net to break its meshes.
223. Like a ring of fire around him
224. Blazed and flared the red horizon,
225. And a hundred suns seemed looking
226. At the combat of the wrestlers.
227. Suddenly upon the greensward
228. All alone stood Hiawatha,
229. Panting with his wild exertion,
230. Palpitating with the struggle;
231. And before him breathless, lifeless,
232. Lay the youth, with hair dishevelled,
233. Plumage torn, and garments tattered,
234. Dead he lay there in the sunset.
235. And victorious Hiawatha
236. Made the grave as he commanded,
237. Stripped the garments from Mondamin,
238. Stripped his tattered plumage from him,
239. Laid him in the earth, and made it
240. Soft and loose and light above him;
241. And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
242. From the melancholy moorlands,
243. Gave a cry of lamentation,
244. Gave a cry of pain and anguish!
245. Homeward then went Hiawatha
246. To the lodge of old Nokomis,
247. And the seven days of his fasting
248. Were accomplished and completed.
249. But the place was not forgotten
250. Where he wrestled with Mondamin;
251. Nor forgotten nor neglected
252. Was the grave where lay Mondamin,
253. Sleeping in the rain and sunshine,
254. Where his scattered plumes and garments
255. Faded in the rain and sunshine.
256. Day by day did Hiawatha
257. Go to wait and watch beside it;
258. Kept the dark mould soft above it,
259. Kept it clean from weeds and insects,
260. Drove away, with scoffs and shoutings,
261. Kahgahgee, the king of ravens.
262. Till at length a small green feather
263. From the earth shot slowly upward,
264. Then another and another,
265. And before the Summer ended
266. Stood the maize in all its beauty,
267. With its shining robes about it,
268. And its long, soft, yellow tresses;
269. And in rapture Hiawatha
270. Cried aloud, 'It is Mondamin!
271. Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin!'
272. Then he called to old Nokomis
273. And Iagoo, the great boaster,
274. Showed them where the maize was growing,
275. Told them of his wondrous vision,
276. Of his wrestling and his triumph,
277. Of this new gift to the nations,
278. Which should be their food forever.
279. And still later, when the Autumn
280. Changed the long, green leaves to yellow,
281. And the soft and juicy kernels
282. Grew like wampum hard and yellow,
283. Then the ripened ears he gathered,
284. Stripped the withered husks from off them,
285. As he once had stripped the wrestler,
286. Gave the first Feast of Mondamin,
287. And made known unto the people
288. This new gift of the Great Spirit.
