1. I trust that somewhere and somehow
2. You all have heard of Hagenau,
3. A quiet, quaint, and ancient town
4. Among the green Alsatian hills,
5. A place of valleys, streams, and mills,
6. Where Barbarossa's castle, brown
7. With rust of centuries, still looks down
8. On the broad, drowsy land below,--
9. On shadowy forests filled with game,
10. And the blue river winding slow
11. Through meadows, where the hedges grow
12. That give this little town its name.

13. It happened in the good old times,
14. While yet the Master-singers filled
15. The noisy workshop and the guild
16. With various melodies and rhymes,
17. That here in Hagenau there dwelt
18. A cobbler,--one who loved debate,
19. And, arguing from a postulate,
20. Would say what others only felt;
21. A man of forecast and of thrift,
22. And of a shrewd and careful mind
23. In this world's business, but inclined
24. Somewhat to let the next world drift.

25. Hans Sachs with vast delight he read,
26. And Regenbogen's rhymes of love,
27. For their poetic fame had spread
28. Even to the town of Hagenau;
29. And some Quick Melody of the Plough,
30. Or Double Harmony of the Dove,
31. Was always running in his head.
32. He kept, moreover, at his side,
33. Among his leathers and his tools,
34. Reynard the Fox, the Ship of Fools,
35. Or Eulenspiegel, open wide;
36. With these he was much edified:
37. He thought them wiser than the Schools.

38. His good wife, full of godly fear,
39. Liked not these worldly themes to hear;
40. The Psalter was her book of songs;
41. The only music to her ear
42. Was that which to the Church belongs,
43. When the loud choir on Sunday chanted,
44. And the two angels carved in wood,
45. That by the windy organ stood,
46. Blew on their trumpets loud and clear,
47. And all the echoes, far and near,
48. Gibbered as if the church were haunted.

49. Outside his door, one afternoon,
50. This humble votary of the muse
51. Sat in the narrow strip of shade
52. By a projecting cornice made,
53. Mending the Burgomaster's shoes,
54. And singing a familiar tune:--

55. 'Our ingress into the world
56. Was naked and bare;
57. Our progress through the world
58. Is trouble and care;
59. Our egress from the world
60. Will be nobody knows where;
61. But if we do well here
62. We shall do well there;
63. And I could tell you no more,
64. Should I preach a whole year!'

65. Thus sang the cobbler at his work;
66. And with his gestures marked the time
67. Closing together with a jerk
68. Of his waxed thread the stitch and rhyme.

69. Meanwhile his quiet little dame
70. Was leaning o'er the window-sill,
71. Eager, excited, but mouse-still,
72. Gazing impatiently to see
73. What the great throng of folk might be
74. That onward in procession came,
75. Along the unfrequented street,
76. With horns that blew, and drums that beat,
77. And banners flying, and the flame
78. Of tapers, and, at times, the sweet
79. Voices of nuns; and as they sang
80. Suddenly all the church-bells rang.

81. In a gay coach, above the crowd,
82. There sat a monk in ample hood,
83. Who with his right hand held aloft
84. A red and ponderous cross of wood,
85. To which at times he meekly bowed.
86. In front three horsemen rode, and oft,
87. With voice and air importunate,
88. A boisterous herald cried aloud:
89. 'The grace of God is at your gate!'
90. So onward to the church they passed.
91. The cobbler slowly tuned his last,
92. And, wagging his sagacious head,
93. Unto his kneeling housewife said:
94. ''Tis the monk Tetzel. I have heard
95. The cawings of that reverend bird.
96. Don't let him cheat you of your gold;
97. Indulgence is not bought and sold.'
98. The church of Hagenau, that night,
99. Was full of people, full of light;
100. An odor of incense filled the air,
101. The priest intoned, the organ groaned
102. Its inarticulate despair;
103. The candles on the altar blazed,
104. And full in front of it upraised
105. The red cross stood against the glare.
106. Below, upon the altar-rail
107. Indulgences were set to sale,
108. Like ballads at a country fair.
109. A heavy strong-box, iron-bound
110. And carved with many a quaint device,
111. Received, with a melodious sound,
112. The coin that purchased Paradise.

113. Then from the pulpit overhead,
114. Tetzel the monk, with fiery glow,
115. Thundered upon the crowd below.
116. Good people all, draw near!' he said;
117. 'Purchase these letters, signed and sealed,
118. By which all sins, though unrevealed
119. And unrepented, are forgiven!
120. Count but the gain, count not the loss
121. Your gold and silver are but dross,
122. And yet they pave the way to heaven.
123. I hear your mothers and your sires
124. Cry from their purgatorial fires,
125. And will ye not their ransom pay?
126. O senseless people! when the gate
127. Of heaven is open, will ye wait?
128. Will ye not enter in to-day?
129. To-morrow it will be too late;
130. I shall be gone upon my way.
131. Make haste! bring money while ye may!'

132. The women shuddered, and turned pale;
133. Allured by hope or driven by fear,
134. With many a sob and many a tear,
135. All crowded to the altar-rail.
136. Pieces of silver and of gold
137. Into the tinkling strong-box fell
138. Like pebbles dropped into a well;
139. And soon the ballads were all sold.
140. The cobbler's wife among the rest
141. Slipped into the capacious chest
142. A golden florin; then withdrew,
143. Hiding the paper in her breast;
144. And homeward through the darkness went
145. Comforted, quieted, content;
146. She did not walk, she rather flew,
147. A dove that settles to her nest,
148. When some appalling bird of prey
149. That scared her has been driven away.

150. The days went by, the monk was gone,
151. The summer passed, the winter came;
152. Though seasons changed, yet still the same
153. The daily round of life went on;
154. The daily round of household care,
155. The narrow life of toil and prayer.
156. But in her heart the cobbler's dame
157. Had now a treasure beyond price,
158. A secret joy without a name,
159. The certainty of Paradise.
160. Alas, alas! Dust unto dust!
161. Before the winter wore away,
162. Her body in the churchyard lay,
163. Her patient soul was with the Just!
164. After her death, among the things
165. That even the poor preserve with care,--
166. Some little trinkets and cheap rings,
167. A locket with her mother's hair,
168. Her wedding gown, the faded flowers
169. She wore upon her wedding day,--
170. Among these memories of past hours,
171. That so much of the heart reveal,
172. Carefully kept and put away,
173. The Letter of Indulgence lay
174. Folded, with signature and seal.

175. Meanwhile the Priest, aggrieved and pained,
176. Waited and wondered that no word
177. Of mass or requiem he heard,
178. As by the Holy Church ordained;
179. Then to the Magistrate complained,
180. That as this woman had been dead
181. A week or more, and no mass said,
182. It was rank heresy, or at least
183. Contempt of Church; thus said the Priest
184. And straight the cobbler was arraigned.

185. He came, confiding in his cause,
186. But rather doubtful of the laws.
187. The Justice from his elbow-chair
188. Gave him a look that seemed to say:
189. 'Thou standest before a Magistrate,
190. Therefore do not prevaricate!'
191. Then asked him in a business way,
192. Kindly but cold: 'Is thy wife dead?'
193. The cobbler meekly bowed his head;
194. 'She is,' came struggling from his throat
195. Scarce audibly. The Justice wrote
196. The words down in a book, and then
197. Continued, as he raised his pen:
198. 'She is; and hath a mass been said
199. For the salvation of her soul?
200. Come, speak the truth! confess the whole!'
201. The cobbler without pause replied:
202. 'Of mass or prayer there was no need;
203. For at the moment when she died
204. Her soul was with the glorified!'
205. And from his pocket with all speed
206. He drew the priestly title-deed,
207. And prayed the Justice he would read.

208. The Justice read, amused, amazed;
209. And as he read his mirth increased;
210. At times his shaggy brows he raised,
211. Now wondering at the cobbler gazed,
212. Now archly at the angry Priest.
213. 'From all excesses, sins, and crimes
214. Thou hast committed in past times_
215. Thee I absolve! And furthermore,
216. Purified from all earthly taints,
217. To the communion of the Saints
218. And to the sacraments restore!
219. All stains of weakness, and all trace
220. Of shame and censure I efface;
221. Remit the pains thou shouldst endure,
222. And make thee innocent and pure,
223. So that in dying, unto thee
224. The gates of heaven shall open be!
225. Though long thou livest, yet this grace
226. Until the moment of thy death
227. Unchangeable continueth!'

228. Then said he to the Priest: 'I find
229. This document is duly signed
230. Brother John Tetzel, his own hand.
231. At all tribunals in the land
232. In evidence it may be used;
233. Therefore acquitted is the accused.'
234. Then to the cobbler turned: 'My friend,
235. Pray tell me, didst thou ever read
236. Reynard the Fox?'--'O yes, indeed!'?
237. 'I thought so. Don't forget the end.'
