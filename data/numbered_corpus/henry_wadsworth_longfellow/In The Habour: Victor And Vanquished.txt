1. As one who long hath fled with panting breath
2. Before his foe, bleeding and near to fall,
3. I turn and set my back against the wall,
4. And look thee in the face, triumphant Death,
5. I call for aid, and no one answereth;
6. I am alone with thee, who conquerest all;
7. Yet me thy threatening form doth not appall,
8. For thou art but a phantom and a wraith.
9. Wounded and weak, sword broken at the hilt,
10. With armor shattered, and without a shield,
11. I stand unmoved; do with me what thou wilt;
12. I can resist no more, but will not yield.
13. This is no tournament where cowards tilt;
14. The vanquished here is victor of the field.
