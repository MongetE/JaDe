1. I heard a voice, that cried,
2. 'Balder the Beautiful
3. Is dead, is dead!'
4. And through the misty air
5. Passed like the mournful cry
6. Of sunward sailing cranes.

7. I saw the pallid corpse
8. Of the dead sun
9. Borne through the Northern sky.
10. Blasts from Niffelheim
11. Lifted the sheeted mists
12. Around him as he passed.

13. And the voice forever cried,
14. 'Balder the Beautiful
15. Is dead, is dead!'
16. And died away
17. Through the dreary night,
18. In accents of despair.

19. Balder the Beautiful,
20. God of the summer sun,
21. Fairest of all the Gods!
22. Light from his forehead beamed,
23. Runes were upon his tongue,
24. As on the warrior's sword.

25. All things in earth and air
26. Bound were by magic spell
27. Never to do him harm;
28. Even the plants and stones;
29. All save the mistletoe,
30. The sacred mistletoe!

31. Hoeder, the blind old God,
32. Whose feet are shod with silence,
33. Pierced through that gentle breast
34. With his sharp spear, by fraud
35. Made of the mistletoe,
36. The accursed mistletoe!

37. They laid him in his ship,
38. With horse and harness,
39. As on a funeral pyre.
40. Odin placed
41. A ring upon his finger,
42. And whispered in his ear.

43. They launched the burning ship!
44. It floated far away
45. Over the misty sea,
46. Till like the sun it seemed,
47. Sinking beneath the waves.
48. Balder returned no more!

49. So perish the old Gods!
50. But out of the sea of Time
51. Rises a new land of song,
52. Fairer than the old.
53. Over its meadows green
54. Walk the young bards and sing.

55. Build it again,
56. O ye bards,
57. Fairer than before!
58. Ye fathers of the new race,
59. Feed upon morning dew,
60. Sing the new Song of Love!

61. The law of force is dead!
62. The law of love prevails!
63. Thor, the thunderer,
64. Shall rule the earth no more,
65. No more, with threats,
66. Challenge the meek Christ.

67. Sing no more,
68. O ye bards of the North,
69. Of Vikings and of Jarls!
70. Of the days of Eld
71. Preserve the freedom only,
72. Not the deeds of blood!
