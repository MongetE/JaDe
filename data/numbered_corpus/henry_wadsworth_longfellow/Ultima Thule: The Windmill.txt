1. Behold! a giant am I!
2. Aloft here in my tower,
3. With my granite jaws I devour
4. The maize, and the wheat, and the rye,
5. And grind them into flour.

6. I look down over the farms;
7. In the fields of grain I see
8. The harvest that is to be,
9. And I fling to the air my arms,
10. For I know it is all for me.

11. I hear the sound of flails
12. Far off, from the threshing-floors
13. In barns, with their open doors,
14. And the wind, the wind in my sails,
15. Louder and louder roars.

16. I stand here in my place,
17. With my foot on the rock below,
18. And whichever way it may blow,
19. I meet it face to face,
20. As a brave man meets his foe.

21. And while we wrestle and strive,
22. My master, the miller, stands
23. And feeds me with his hands;
24. For he knows who makes him thrive,
25. Who makes him lord of lands.

26. On Sundays I take my rest;
27. Church-going bells begin
28. Their low, melodious din;
29. I cross my arms on my breast,
30. And all is peace within.
