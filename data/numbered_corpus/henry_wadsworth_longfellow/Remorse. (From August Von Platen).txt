1. How I started up in the night, in the night,
2. Drawn on without rest or reprieval!
3. The streets, with their watchmen, were lost to my sight,
4. As I wandered so light
5. In the night, in the night,
6. Through the gate with the arch mediaeval.

7. The mill-brook rushed from the rocky height,
8. I leaned o'er the bridge in my yearning;
9. Deep under me watched I the waves in their flight,
10. As they glided so light
11. In the night, in the night,
12. Yet backward not one was returning.

13. O'erhead were revolving, so countless and bright,
14. The stars in melodious existence;
15. And with them the moon, more serenely bedight;--
16. They sparkled so light
17. In the night, in the night,
18. Through the magical, measureless distance.

19. And upward I gazed in the night, in the night,
20. And again on the waves in their fleeting;
21. Ah woe! thou hast wasted thy days in delight,
22. Now silence thou light,
23. In the night, in the night,
24. The remorse in thy heart that is beating.
