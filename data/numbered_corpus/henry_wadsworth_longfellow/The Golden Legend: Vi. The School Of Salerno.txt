1. A traveling Scholastic affixing his Theses to the gate
2. of the College.

3. _Scholastic._ There, that is my gauntlet, my banner, my shield,
4. Hung up as a challenge to all the field!
5. One hundred and twenty-five propositions,
6. Which I will maintain with the sword of the tongue
7. Against all disputants, old and young.
8. Let us see if doctors or dialecticians
9. Will dare to dispute my definitions,
10. Or attack any one of my learned theses.
11. Here stand I; the end shall be as God pleases.
12. I think I have proved, by profound research
13. The error of all those doctrines so vicious
14. Of the old Areopagite Dionysius,
15. That are making such terrible work in the churches,
16. By Michael the Stammerer sent from the East,
17. And done into Latin by that Scottish beast,
18. Erigena Johannes, who dares to maintain,
19. In the face of the truth, the error infernal,
20. That the universe is and must be eternal;
21. At first laying down, as a fact fundamental,
22. That nothing with God can be accidental;
23. Then asserting that God before the creation
24. Could not have existed, because it is plain
25. That, had he existed, he would have created;
26. Which is begging the question that should be debated,
27. And moveth me less to anger than laughter.
28. All nature, he holds, is a respiration
29. Of the Spirit of God, who, in breathing, hereafter
30. Will inhale it into his bosom again,
31. So that nothing but God alone will remain.
32. And therein he contradicteth himself;
33. For he opens the whole discussion by stating,
34. That God can only exist in creating.
35. That question I think I have laid on the shelf!

36. (_He goes out. Two Doctors come in disputing, and
37. followed by pupils._)

38. _Doctor Serafino._ I, with the Doctor Seraphic, maintain,
39. That a word which is only conceived in the brain
40. Is a type of eternal Generation;
41. The spoken word is the Incarnation.

42. _Doctor Cherubino._ What do I care for the Doctor Seraphic,
43. With all his wordy chaffer and traffic?

44. _Doctor Serafino._ You make but a paltry show of resistance;
45. Universals have no real existence!

46. _Doctor Cherubino._ Your words are but idle and empty chatter;
47. Ideas are eternally joined to matter!

48. _Doctor Serafino_. May the Lord have mercy on your position,
49. You wretched, wrangling culler of herbs!

50. _Doctor Cherubino_. May he send your soul to eternal perdition,
51. For your Treatise on the Irregular Verbs!

52. (_They rush out fighting. Two Scholars come in._)

53. _First Scholar_. Monte Cassino, then, is your College.
54. What think you of ours here at Salern?

55. _Second Scholar_. To tell the truth, I arrived so lately,
56. I hardly yet have had time to discern.
57. So much, at least, I am bound to acknowledge:
58. The air seems healthy, the buildings stately,
59. And on the whole I like it greatly.

60. _First Scholar_. Yes, the air is sweet; the Calabrian hills
61. Send us down puffs of mountain air;
62. And in summer time the sea-breeze fills
63. With its coolness cloister, and court, and square.
64. Then at every season of the year
65. There are crowds of guests and travellers here;
66. Pilgrims, and mendicant friars, and traders
67. From the Levant, with figs and wine,
68. And bands of wounded and sick Crusaders,
69. Coming back from Palestine.

70. _Second Scholar_. And what are the studies you pursue?
71. What is the course you here go through?

72. _First Scholar_. The first three years of the college course
73. Are given to Logic alone, as the source
74. Of all that is noble, and wise, and true.

75. _Second Scholar_. That seems rather strange, I must confess.
76. In a Medical School; yet, nevertheless,
77. You doubtless have reasons for that.

78. _First Scholar_. Oh yes!
79. For none but a clever dialectician
80. Can hope to become a great physician;
81. That has been settled long ago.
82. Logic makes an important part
83. Of the mystery of the healing art;
84. For without it how could you hope to show
85. That nobody knows so much as you know?
86. After this there are five years more
87. Devoted wholly to medicine,
88. With lectures on chirurgical lore,
89. And dissections of the bodies of swine,
90. As likest the human form divine.

91. _Second Scholar_. What are the books now most in vogue?

92. _First Scholar_. Quite an extensive catalogue;
93. Mostly, however, books of our own;
94. As Gariopontus' Passionarius,
95. And the writings of Matthew Platearius;
96. And a volume universally known
97. As the Regimen of the School of Salern,
98. For Robert of Normandy written in terse
99. And very elegant Latin verse.
100. Each of these writings has its turn.
101. And when at length we have finished these,
102. Then comes the struggle for degrees,
103. With all the oldest and ablest critics;
104. The public thesis and disputation,
105. Question, and answer, and explanation
106. Of a passage out of Hippocrates,
107. Or Aristotle's Analytics.
108. There the triumphant Magister stands!
109. A book is solemnly placed in his hands,
110. On which he swears to follow the rule
111. And ancient forms of the good old School;
112. To report if any confectionarius
113. Mingles his drugs with matters various,
114. And to visit his patients twice a day,
115. And once in the night, if they live in town,
116. And if they are poor, to take no pay.
117. Having faithfully promised these,
118. His head is crowned with a laurel crown;
119. A kiss on his cheek, a ring on his hand,
120. The Magister Artium et Physices
121. Goes forth from the school like a lord of the land.
122. And now, as we have the whole morning before us
123. Let us go in, if you make no objection,
124. And listen awhile to a learned prelection
125. On Marcus Aurelius Cassiodorus.

126. (_They go in. Enter_ LUCIFER _as a Doctor._)

127. _Lucifer_. This is the great School of Salern!
128. A land of wrangling and of quarrels,
129. Of brains that seethe, and hearts that burn,
130. Where every emulous scholar hears,
131. In every breath that comes to his ears,
132. The rustling of another's laurels!
133. The air of the place is called salubrious;
134. The neighborhood of Vesuvius lends it
135. An odor volcanic, that rather mends it,
136. And the buildings have an aspect lugubrious,
137. That inspires a feeling of awe and terror
138. Into the heart of the beholder,
139. And befits such an ancient homestead of error,
140. Where the old falsehoods moulder and smoulder,
141. And yearly by many hundred hands
142. Are carried away, in the zeal of youth,
143. And sown like tares in the field of truth,
144. To blossom and ripen in other lands.
145. What have we here, affixed to the gate?
146. The challenge of some scholastic wight,
147. Who wishes to hold a public debate
148. On sundry questions wrong or right!
149. Ah, now this is my great delight!
150. For I have often observed of late
151. That such discussions end in a fight.
152. Let us see what the learned wag maintains
153. With such a prodigal waste of brains.

154. (_Reads._)

155. 'Whether angels in moving from place to place
156. Pass through the intermediate space.
157. Whether God himself is the author of evil,
158. Or whether that is the work of the Devil.
159. When, where, and wherefore Lucifer fell,
160. And whether he now is chained in hell.'

161. I think I can answer that question well!
162. So long as the boastful human mind
163. Consents in such mills as this to grind,
164. I sit very firmly upon my throne!
165. Of a truth it almost makes me laugh,
166. To see men leaving the golden grain
167. To gather in piles the pitiful chaff
168. That old Peter Lombard thrashed with his brain,
169. To have it caught up and tossed again
170. On the horns of the Dumb Ox of Cologne!

171. But my guests approach! there is in the air
172. A fragrance, like that of the Beautiful Garden
173. Of Paradise, in the days that were!
174. An odor of innocence, and of prayer,
175. And of love, and faith that never fails,
176. Which as the fresh-young heart exhales
177. Before it begins to wither and harden!
178. I cannot breathe such an atmosphere!
179. My soul is filled with a nameless fear,
180. That, after all my trouble and pain,
181. After all my restless endeavor,
182. The youngest, fairest soul of the twain,
183. The most ethereal, most divine,
184. Will escape from my hands forever and ever.
185. But the other is already mine!
186. Let him live to corrupt his race,
187. Breathing among them, with every breath,
188. Weakness, selfishness, and the base
189. And pusillanimous fear of death.
190. I know his nature, and I know
191. That of all who in my ministry
192. Wander the great earth to and fro,
193. And on my errands come and go,
194. The safest and subtlest are such as he.

195. (_Enter_ PRINCE HENRY _and_ ELSIE _with
196. attendants_.)

197. _Prince Henry._ Can you direct us to Friar Angelo?

198. _Lucifer._ He stands before you.

199. _Prince Henry._ Then you know our purpose.
200. I am Prince Henry of Hoheneck, and this
201. The maiden that I spake of in my letters.

202. _Lucifer._ It is a very grave and solemn business!
203. We must not be precipitate. Does she
204. Without compulsion, of her own free will,
205. Consent to this?

206. _Prince Henry._ Against all opposition,
207. Against all prayers, entreaties, protestations.
208. She will not be persuaded.

209. _Lucifer._ That is strange!
210. Have you thought well of it?

211. _Elsie._ I come not here
212. To argue, but to die. Your business is not
213. to question, but to kill me. I am ready.
214. I am impatient to be gone from here
215. Ere any thoughts of earth disturb again
216. The spirit of tranquillity within me.

217. _Prince Henry._ Would I had not come here
218. Would I were dead,
219. And thou wert in thy cottage in the forest,
220. And hadst not known me! Why have I done this?
221. Let me go back and die.

222. _Elsie._ It cannot be;
223. Not if these cold, flat stones on which we tread
224. Were coulters heated white, and yonder gateway
225. Flamed like a furnace with a sevenfold heat.
226. I must fulfil my purpose.

227. _Prince Henry._ I forbid it!
228. Not one step farther. For I only meant
229. To put thus far thy courage to the proof.
230. It is enough. I, too, have courage to die,
231. For thou hast taught me!

232. _Elsie._ O my Prince! remember
233. Your promises. Let me fulfill my errand.
234. You do not look on life and death as I do.
235. There are two angels, that attend unseen
236. Each one of us, and in great books record
237. Our good and evil deeds. He who writes down
238. The good ones, after every action closes
239. His volume, and ascends with it to God.
240. The other keeps his dreadful day-book open
241. Till sunset, that we may repent; which doing,
242. The record of the action fades away,
243. And leaves a line of white across the page.
244. Now if my act be good, as I believe it,
245. It cannot be recalled. It is already
246. Sealed up in heaven, as a good deed accomplished.
247. The rest is yours. Why wait you? I am ready.

248. (_To her attendants._)

249. Weep not, my friends! rather rejoice with me.
250. I shall not feel the pain, but shall be gone,
251. And you will have another friend in heaven.
252. Then start not at the creaking of the door
253. Through which I pass. I see what lies beyond it.

254. (_To_ PRINCE HENRY.)

255. And you, O Prince! bear back my benison
256. Unto my father's house, and all within it.
257. This morning in the church I prayed for them,
258. After confession, after absolution,
259. When my whole soul was white, I prayed for them.
260. God will take care of them, they need me not.
261. And in your life let my remembrance linger,
262. As something not to trouble and disturb it,
263. But to complete it, adding life to life.
264. And if at times beside the evening fire
265. You see my face among the other faces,
266. Let it not be regarded as a ghost
267. That haunts your house, but as a guest that loves you.
268. Nay, even as one of your own family,
269. Without whose presence there were something wanting.
270. I have no more to say. Let us go in.

271. _Prince Henry._ Friar Angelo! I charge you on your life,
272. Believe not what she says, for she is mad,
273. And comes here not to die, but to be healed.

274. _Elsie._ Alas! Prince Henry!

275. _Lucifer._ Come with me; this way.

276. (ELSIE _goes in with_ LUCIFER, _who thrusts_ PRINCE
277. HENRY _back and closes the door._)

278. _Prince Henry._ Gone! and the light of all my life gone with her!
279. A sudden darkness falls upon the world!

280. _Forester._ News from the Prince!

281. _Ursula._ Of death or life?

282. _Forester._ You put your questions eagerly!

283. _Ursula._ Answer me, then! How is the Prince?

284. _Forester._ I left him only two hours since
285. Homeward returning down the river,
286. As strong and well as if God, the Giver,
287. Had given him back in his youth again.

288. _Ursula (despairing)._ Then Elsie, my poor child, is dead!

289. _Forester._ That, my good woman, I have not said.
290. Don't cross the bridge till you come to it,
291. Is a proverb old, and of excellent wit.

292. _Ursula._ Keep me no longer in this pain!

293. _Forester._ It is true your daughter is no more;--
294. That is, the peasant she was before.

295. _Ursula._ Alas! I am simple and lowly bred
296. I am poor, distracted, and forlorn.
297. And it is not well that you of the court
298. Should mock me thus, and make a sport
299. Of a joyless mother whose child is dead,
300. For you, too, were of mother, born!

301. _Forester._ Your daughter lives, and the Prince is well!
302. You will learn ere long how it all befell.
303. Her heart for a moment never failed;
304. But when they reached Salerno's gate,
305. The Prince's nobler self prevailed,
306. And saved her for a nobler fate,
307. And he was healed, in his despair,
308. By the touch of St. Matthew's sacred bones;
309. Though I think the long ride in the open air,
310. That pilgrimage over stocks and stones,
311. In the miracle must come in for a share!

312. _Ursula._ Virgin! who lovest the poor and lonely,
313. If the loud cry of a mother's heart
314. Can ever ascend to where thou art,
315. Into thy blessed hands and holy
316. Receive my prayer of praise and thanksgiving!
317. Let the hands that bore our Saviour bear it
318. Into the awful presence of God;
319. For thy feet with holiness are shod,
320. And if thou bearest it he will hear it.
321. Our child who was dead again is living!

322. _Forester._ I did not tell you she was dead;
323. If you thought so 'twas no fault of mine;
324. At this very moment, while I speak,
325. They are sailing homeward down the Rhine,
326. In a splendid barge, with golden prow,
327. And decked with banners white and red
328. As the colors on your daughter's cheek.
329. They call her the Lady Alicia now;
330. For the Prince in Salerno made a vow
331. That Elsie only would he wed.

332. _Ursula._ Jesu Maria! what a change!
333. All seems to me so weird and strange!

334. _Forester._ I saw her standing on the deck,
335. Beneath an awning cool and shady;
336. Her cap of velvet could not hold
337. The tresses of her hair of gold,
338. That flowed and floated like the stream,
339. And fell in masses down her neck.
340. As fair and lovely did she seem
341. As in a story or a dream
342. Some beautiful and foreign lady.
343. And the Prince looked so grand and proud,
344. And waved his hand thus to the crowd
345. That gazed and shouted from the shore,
346. All down the river, long and loud.

347. _Ursula._ We shall behold our child once more;
348. She is not dead! She is not dead!
349. God, listening, must have overheard
350. The prayers, that, without sound or word,
351. Our hearts in secrecy have said!
352. O, bring me to her; for mine eyes
353. Are hungry to behold her face;
354. My very soul within me cries;
355. My very hands seem to caress her,
356. To see her, gaze at her, and bless her;
357. Dear Elsie, child of God and grace!

358. (_Goes out toward the garden._)

359. _Forester._ There goes the good woman out of her head;
360. And Gottlieb's supper is waiting here;
361. A very capacious flagon of beer,
362. And a very portentous loaf of bread.
363. One would say his grief did not much oppress him.
364. Here's to the health of the Prince, God bless him!

365. (_He drinks._)

366. Ha! it buzzes and stings like a hornet!
367. And what a scene there, through the door!
368. The forest behind and the garden before,
369. And midway an old man of threescore,
370. With a wife and children that caress him.
371. Let me try still further to cheer and adorn it
372. With a merry, echoing blast of my cornet!

373. (_Goes out blowing his horn._)

374. * * * * *

375. THE CASTLE OF VAUTSBERG ON THE RHINE.

376. * * * * *

377. PRINCE HENRY _and_ ELSIE _standing on the terrace at
378. evening. The sound of bells heard from a distance._


379. _Prince Henry._ We are alone. The wedding guests
380. Ride down the hill, with plumes and cloaks,
381. And the descending dark invests
382. The Niederwald, and all the nests
383. Among its hoar and haunted oaks.

384. _Elsie._ What bells are those, that ring so slow,
385. So mellow, musical, and low?

386. _Prince Henry._ They are the bells of Geisenheim,
387. That with their melancholy chime
388. Ring out the curfew of the sun.

389. _Elsie._ Listen, beloved.

390. _Prince Henry._ They are done!
391. Dear Elsie! many years ago
392. Those same soft bells at eventide
393. Rang in the ears of Charlemagne,
394. As, seated by Fastrada's side
395. At Ingelheim, in all his pride
396. He heard their sound with secret pain.

397. _Elsie._ Their voices only speak to me
398. Of peace and deep tranquillity,
399. And endless confidence in thee!

400. _Prince Henry._ Thou knowest the story of her ring,
401. How, when the court went back to Aix,
402. Fastrada died; and how the king
403. Sat watching by her night and day,
404. Till into one of the blue lakes,
405. That water that delicious land,
406. They cast the ring, drawn from her hand;
407. And the great monarch sat serene
408. And sad beside the fated shore,
409. Nor left the land forever more.

410. _Elsie._ That was true love.

411. _Prince Henry._ For him the queen
412. Ne'er did what thou hast done for me.

413. _Elsie._ Wilt thou as fond and faithful be?
414. Wilt thou so love me after death?

415. _Prince Henry._ In life's delight, in death's dismay,
416. In storm and sunshine, night and day,
417. In health, in sickness, in decay,
418. Here and hereafter, I am thine!
419. Thou hast Fastrada's ring. Beneath
420. The calm, blue waters of thine eyes
421. Deep in thy steadfast soul it lies,
422. And, undisturbed by this world's breath,
423. With magic light its jewels shine!
424. This golden ring, which thou hast worn
425. Upon thy finger since the morn,
426. Is but a symbol and a semblance,
427. An outward fashion, a remembrance,
428. Of what thou wearest within unseen,
429. O my Fastrada, O my queen!
430. Behold! the hilltops all aglow
431. With purple and with amethyst;
432. While the whole valley deep below
433. Is filled, and seems to overflow,
434. With a fast-rising tide of mist.
435. The evening air grows damp and chill;
436. Let us go in.

437. _Elsie._ Ah, not so soon.
438. See yonder fire! It is the moon
439. Slow rising o'er the eastern hill.
440. It glimmers on the forest tips,
441. And through the dewy foliage drips
442. In little rivulets of light,
443. And makes the heart in love with night.

444. _Prince Henry._ Oft on this terrace, when the day
445. Was closing, have I stood and gazed,
446. And seen the landscape fade away,
447. And the white vapors rise and drown
448. Hamlet and vineyard, tower and town
449. While far above the hilltops blazed.
450. But men another hand than thine
451. Was gently held and clasped in mine;
452. Another head upon my breast
453. Was laid, as thine is now, at rest.
454. Why dost thou lift those tender eyes
455. With so much sorrow and surprise?
456. A minstrel's, not a maiden's hand,
457. Was that which in my own was pressed.
458. A manly form usurped thy place,
459. A beautiful, but bearded face,
460. That now is in the Holy Land,
461. Yet in my memory from afar
462. Is shining on us like a star.
463. But linger not. For while I speak,
464. A sheeted spectre white and tall,
465. The cold mist climbs the castle wall,
466. And lays his hand upon thy cheek!

467. (_They go in._)

468. * * * * *

469. EPILOGUE.

470. * * * * *

471. THE TWO RECORDING ANGELS ASCENDING.

472. _The Angel of Good Deeds (with closed book_). God sent his
473. messenger the rain,
474. And said unto the mountain brook,
475. 'Rise up, and from thy caverns look
476. And leap, with naked, snow-white feet.
477. From the cool hills into the heat
478. Of the broad, arid plain.'

479. God sent his messenger of faith,
480. And whispered in the maiden's heart,
481. 'Rise up, and look from where thou art,
482. And scatter with unselfish hands
483. Thy freshness on the barren sands
484. And solitudes of Death.'
485. O beauty of holiness,
486. Of self-forgetfulness, of lowliness!
487. O power of meekness,
488. Whose very gentleness and weakness
489. Are like the yielding, but irresistible air!
490. Upon the pages
491. Of the sealed volume that I bear,
492. The deed divine
493. Is written in characters of gold,
494. That never shall grow old,
495. But all through ages
496. Burn and shine,
497. With soft effulgence!
498. O God! it is thy indulgence
499. That fills the world with the bliss
500. Of a good deed like this!

501. _The Angel of Evil Deeds (with open book)._ Not yet, not yet
502. Is the red sun wholly set,
503. But evermore recedes,
504. While open still I bear
505. The Book of Evil Deeds,
506. To let the breathings of the upper air
507. Visit its pages and erase
508. The records from its face!
509. Fainter and fainter as I gaze
510. On the broad blaze
511. The glimmering landscape shines,
512. And below me the black river
513. Is hidden by wreaths of vapor!
514. Fainter and fainter the black lines
515. Begin to quiver
516. Along the whitening surface of the paper;
517. Shade after shade
518. The terrible words grow faint and fade,
519. And in their place
520. Runs a white space!

521. Down goes the sun!
522. But the soul of one,
523. Who by repentance
524. Has escaped the dreadful sentence,
525. Shines bright below me as I look.
526. It is the end!
527. With closed Book
528. To God do I ascend.

529. Lo! over the mountain steeps
530. A dark, gigantic shadow sweeps
531. Beneath my feet;
532. A blackness inwardly brightening
533. With sullen heat,
534. As a storm-cloud lurid with lightning.
535. And a cry of lamentation,
536. Repeated and again repeated,
537. Deep and loud
538. As the reverberation
539. Of cloud answering unto cloud,
540. Swells and rolls away in the distance,
541. As if the sheeted
542. Lightning retreated,
543. Baffled and thwarted by the wind's resistance.

544. It is Lucifer,
545. The son of mystery;
546. And since God suffers him to be,
547. He, too, is God's minister,
548. And labors for some good
549. By us not understood!
