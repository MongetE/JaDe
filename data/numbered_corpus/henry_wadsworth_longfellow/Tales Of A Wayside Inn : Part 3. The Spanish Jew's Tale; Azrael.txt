1. King Solomon, before his palace gate
2. At evening, on the pavement tessellate
3. Was walking with a stranger from the East,
4. Arrayed in rich attire as for a feast,
5. The mighty Runjeet-Sing, a learned man,
6. And Rajah of the realms of Hindostan.
7. And as they walked the guest became aware
8. Of a white figure in the twilight air,
9. Gazing intent, as one who with surprise
10. His form and features seemed to recognize;
11. And in a whisper to the king he said:
12. 'What is yon shape, that, pallid as the dead,
13. Is watching me, as if he sought to trace_
14. In the dim light the features of my face?'

15. The king looked, and replied: 'I know him well;
16. It is the Angel men call Azrael,
17. 'T is the Death Angel; what hast thou to fear?'
18. And the guest answered: 'Lest he should come near,
19. And speak to me, and take away my breath!
20. Save me from Azrael, save me from death!
21. O king, that hast dominion o'er the wind,
22. Bid it arise and bear me hence to Ind.'

23. The king gazed upward at the cloudless sky,
24. Whispered a word, and raised his hand on high,
25. And lo! the signet-ring of chrysoprase
26. On his uplifted finger seemed to blaze
27. With hidden fire, and rushing from the west
28. There came a mighty wind, and seized the guest
29. And lifted him from earth, and on they passed,
30. His shining garments streaming in the blast,
31. A silken banner o'er the walls upreared,
32. A purple cloud, that gleamed and disappeared.
33. Then said the Angel, smiling: 'If this man
34. Be Rajah Runjeet-Sing of Hindostan,
35. Thou hast done well in listening to his prayer;
36. I was upon my way to seek him there.'
