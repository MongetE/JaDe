1. "Speak! speak! thou fearful guest!
2. Who, with thy hollow breast
3. Still in rude armor drest,
4. Comest to daunt me!
5. Wrapt not in eastern balms,
6. But with thy fleshless palms
7. Stretched, as if asking alms,
8. Why dost thou haunt me?"

9. Then from those cavernous eyes
10. Pale flashes seemed to rise,
11. As when the northern skies
12. Gleam in December;
13. And, like the water's flow
14. Under December's snow,
15. Came a dull voice of woe
16. From the heart's chamber.

17. "I was a Viking old!
18. My deeds, though manifold,
19. No Skald in song has told,
20. No Saga taught thee!
21. Take heed, that in thy verse
22. Thou dost the tale rehearse,
23. Else drear a dead man's curse;
24. For this I sought thee.

25. "Far in the Northern Land,
26. By the wild Baltic's strand,
27. I, with my childish hand,
28. Tamed the gerfalcon;
29. And, with my skates fast-bound,
30. Skimmed the half-frozen Sound,
31. That the poor whimpering hound
32. Trembled to walk on.

33. "Oft to his frozen lair
34. Tracked I the grisly bear,
35. While from my path the hare
36. Fled like a shadow;
37. Oft through the forest dark
38. Followed the were-wolf's bark,
39. Until the soaring lark
40. Sang from the meadow.

41. "But when I older grew,
42. Joining a corsair's crew,
43. O'er the dark sea flew
44. With the marauders.
45. Wild was the life we led;
46. Many the sould that sped,
47. Many the hearts that bled,
48. By our stern orders.

49. "Manu a wassail bout
50. Wore the long Winter out;
51. Often our midnight shout
52. Set the cocks crowing;
53. As we the Berserk's tale
54. Measured in cups of ale,
55. Draining the oaken pail,
56. Filled to o'erflowing.

57. "Once as I told in glee
58. Tales of the stormy sea,
59. Soft eyes did gaze on me,
60. Burning yet tender;
61. And as the white stars shine
62. On the dark Norway pine,
63. On that dark heart of mine
64. Fell their soft splendor.

65. "I wooed the blue-eyed maid,
66. Yielding, yet half afraid,
67. And in the forests shade
68. Our vows were plighted.
69. Under its loosened vest
70. Fluttered her little breast,
71. Like birds within their nest
72. By the hawk frighted.

73. "Bright in her father's hall
74. Shields gleamed upon the wall,
75. Loud sang the minstrels all,
76. Chanting his glory;
77. When of old Hildebrand
78. I asked his daughter's hand,
79. Mute did the minstrels stand
80. To hear my story.

81. "While the brown ale he quaffed,
82. Loud then the champion laughed,
83. And as the wind-gusts waft
84. The sea-foam brightly,
85. So the loud laugh of scorn,
86. Out of those lips unshorn,
87. From the deep drinking-horn
88. Blew the foam lightly.

89. "She was a Prince's child,
90. I but a Viking wild,
91. And though she blushed and smiled,
92. I was discarded!
93. Should not the dove so white
94. Follow the sea-mew's flight,
95. Why did they leave that night
96. Her nest unguarded?

97. "Scarce had I put to sea,
98. Bearing the maid with me,
99. Fairest of all was she
100. Among the Norsemen!
101. When on the white sea-strand,
102. Waving his arm√®d hand,
103. Saw we old Hildebrand,
104. With twenty horsemen.

105. "Then launched they to the blast,
106. Bent like a reed each mast,
107. Yet we were gaining fast,
108. When the wind failed us;
109. And with a sudden flaw
110. Came round the gusty Skaw,
111. So that our foe we saw
112. Laugh as he hailed us.

113. "And as to catch the gale
114. Round veered the flapping sail,
115. 'Death!' was the helmsman's hail,
116. 'Death without quarter!'
117. Mid-ships with iron keel
118. Struck we her ribs of steel;
119. Down her black hulk did reel
120. Through the black water!

121. "As with his wings aslant,
122. Sails the fierce cororant,
123. Seeking some rocky haunt,
124. With its prey laden,--
125. So toward the open main,
126. Beating to sea again,
127. Through the wild hurricane,
128. Bore I the maiden.

129. "Three weeks we westward bore,
130. And when the storm was o'er,
131. Cloud-like we saw the shore
132. Stretching to leeward;
133. There for my lady's bower
134. Built there the lofty tower,
135. Which, to this very hour
136. Stands looking seaward.

137. "There lived we many years;
138. Time dried the maiden's tears;
139. She had forgot her fears;
140. She was a mother;
141. Death closed her mild blue eyes,
142. Under that tower she lies;
143. Ne'er shall the sun arise
144. On such another!

145. "Still grew my bosom then,
146. Still as a stagnant fen!
147. Hateful to me were men,
148. The sunlight hateful!
149. In the vast forest here,
150. Clad in my warlike gear,
151. Fell I upon my spear,
152. Oh, death was greatful!

153. "Thus, seamed with my scars,
154. Bursting these prison bars,
155. Up to its native stars
156. My soul ascended!
157. There from the flowing bowl
158. Deep drinks the warrior's soul,
159. Skoal! to the Northland! skoal!"
160. Thus the tale ended.
