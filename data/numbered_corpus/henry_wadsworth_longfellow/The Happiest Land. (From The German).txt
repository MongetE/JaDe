1. There sat one day in quiet,
2. By an alehouse on the Rhine,
3. Four hale and hearty fellows,
4. And drank the precious wine.

5. The landlord's daughter filled their cups
6. Around the rustic board;
7. Then sat they all so calm and still,
8. And spake not one rude word.

9. But, when the maid departed,
10. A Swabian raised his hand,
11. And cried, all hot and flushed with wine,
12. 'Long live the Swabian land!

13. 'The greatest kingdom upon earth
14. Cannot with that compare;
15. With all the stout and hardy men
16. And the nut-brown maidens there.'

17. Ha! cried a Saxon, laughing,--
18. And dashed his beard with wine;
19. ' I had rather live in Lapland,
20. Than that Swabian land of thine!

21. The goodliest land on all this earth,
22. It is the Saxon land!
23. There have I as many maidens
24. As fingers on this hand!

25. Hold your tongues! both Swabian and Saxon!
26. A bold Bohemian cries;
27. 'If there's a heaven upon this earth,
28. In Bohemia it lies.

29. There the tailor blows the flute,
30. And the cobbler blows the horn,
31. And the miner blows the bugle,
32. Over mountain gorge and bourn.

33. ****

34. And then the landlord's daughter
35. Up to heaven raised her hand,
36. And said, Ye may no more contend,--
37. There lies the happiest land!
