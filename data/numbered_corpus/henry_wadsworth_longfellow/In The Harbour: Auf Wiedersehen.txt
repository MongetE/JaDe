1. Until we meet again! That is the meaning
2. Of the familiar words, that men repeat
3. At parting in the street.
4. Ah yes, till then! but when death intervening
5. Rends us asunder, with what ceaseless pain
6. We wait for the Again!

7. The friends who leave us do not feel the sorrow
8. Of parting, as we feel it, who must stay
9. Lamenting day by day,
10. And knowing, when we wake upon the morrow,
11. We shall not find in its accustomed place
12. The one beloved face.

13. It were a double grief, if the departed,
14. Being released from earth, should still retain
15. A sense of earthly pain;
16. It were a double grief, if the true-hearted,
17. Who loved us here, should on the farther shore
18. Remember us no more.

19. Believing, in the midst of our afflictions,
20. That death is a beginning, not an end,
21. We cry to them, and send
22. Farewells, that better might be called predictions,
23. Being fore-shadowings of the future, thrown
24. Into the vast Unknown.

25. Faith overleaps the confines of our reason,
26. And if by faith, as in old times was said,
27. Women received their dead
28. Raised up to life, then only for a season
29. Our partings are, nor shall we wait in vain
30. Until we meet again!
