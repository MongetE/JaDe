1. 'E venni dal martirio a questa pace.'

2. These words the poet heard in Paradise,
3. Uttered by one who, bravely dying here,
4. In the true faith was living in that sphere
5. Where the celestial cross of sacrifice
6. Spread its protecting arms athwart the skies;
7. And set thereon, like jewels crystal clear,
8. The souls magnanimous, that knew not fear,
9. Flashed their effulgence on his dazzled eyes.
10. Ah me! how dark the discipline of pain,
11. Were not the suffering followed by the sense
12. Of infinite rest and infinite release!
13. This is our consolation; and again
14. A great soul cries to us in our suspense,
15. 'I came from martyrdom unto this peace!'
