1. 'Yes, well your story pleads the cause
2. Of those dumb mouths that have no speech,
3. Only a cry from each to each
4. In its own kind, with its own laws;
5. Something that is beyond the reach
6. Of human power to learn or teach,--
7. An inarticulate moan of pain,
8. Like the immeasurable main
9. Breaking upon an unknown beach.'
10. Thus spake the Poet with a sigh;
11. Then added, with impassioned cry,
12. As one who feels the words he speaks,
13. The color flushing in his cheeks,
14. The fervor burning in his eye:
15. 'Among the noblest in the land,
16. Though he may count himself the least,
17. That man I honor and revere
18. Who without favor, without fear,
19. In the great city dares to stand
20. The friend of every friendless beast,
21. And tames with his unflinching hand
22. The brutes that wear our form and face,
23. The were-wolves of the human race!'
24. Then paused, and waited with a frown,
25. Like some old champion of romance,
26. Who, having thrown his gauntlet down,
27. Expectant leans upon his lance;
28. But neither Knight nor Squire is found
29. To raise the gauntlet from the ground,
30. And try with him the battle's chance.
31. 'Wake from your dreams, O Edrehi!
32. Or dreaming speak to us, and make
33. A feint of being half awake,
34. And tell us what your dreams may be.
35. Out of the hazy atmosphere
36. Of cloud-land deign to reappear
37. Among us in this Wayside Inn;
38. Tell us what visions and what scenes
39. Illuminate the dark ravines
40. In which you grope your way. Begin!'
41. Thus the Sicilian spake. The Jew
42. Made no reply, but only smiled,
43. As men unto a wayward child,
44. Not knowing what to answer, do.
45. As from a cavern's mouth, o'ergrown
46. With moss and intertangled vines,
47. A streamlet leaps into the light
48. And murmurs over root and stone
49. In a melodious undertone;
50. Or as amid the noonday night
51. Of sombre and wind-haunted pines,
52. There runs a sound as of the sea;
53. So from his bearded lips there came
54. A melody without a name,
55. A song, a tale, a history,
56. Or whatsoever it may be,
57. Writ and recorded in these lines.
