1. Garlands upon his grave
2. And flowers upon his hearse,
3. And to the tender heart and brave
4. The tribute of this verse.

5. His was the troubled life,
6. The conflict and the pain,
7. The grief, the bitterness of strife,
8. The honor without stain.

9. Like Winkelried, he took
10. Into his manly breast
11. The sheaf of hostile spears, and broke
12. A path for the oppressed.

13. Then from the fatal field
14. Upon a nation's heart
15. Borne like a warrior on his shield!--
16. So should the brave depart.

17. Death takes us by surprise,
18. And stays our hurrying feet;
19. The great design unfinished lies,
20. Our lives are incomplete.

21. But in the dark unknown
22. Perfect their circles seem,
23. Even as a bridge's arch of stone
24. Is rounded in the stream.

25. Alike are life and death,
26. When life in death survives,
27. And the uninterrupted breath
28. Inspires a thousand lives.

29. Were a star quenched on high,
30. For ages would its light,
31. Still travelling downward from the sky,
32. Shine on our mortal sight.

33. So when a great man dies,
34. For years beyond our ken,
35. The light he leaves behind him lies
36. Upon the paths of men.
