1. I heard a brooklet gushing
2. From its rocky fountain near,
3. Down into the valley rushing,
4. So fresh and wondrous clear.

5. I know not what came o'er me,
6. Nor who the counsel gave;
7. But I must hasten downward,
8. All with my pilgrim-stave;

9. Downward, and ever farther,
10. And ever the brook beside;
11. And ever fresher murmured,
12. And ever clearer, the tide.

13. Is this the way I was going?
14. Whither, O brooklet, say I
15. Thou hast, with thy soft murmur,
16. Murmured my senses away.

17. What do I say of a murmur?
18. That can no murmur be;
19. 'Tis the water-nymphs, that are singing
20. Their roundelays under me.

21. Let them sing, my friend, let them murmur,
22. And wander merrily near;
23. The wheels of a mill are going
24. In every brooklet clear.
