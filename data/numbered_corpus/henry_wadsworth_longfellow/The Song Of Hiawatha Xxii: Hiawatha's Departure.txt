1. By the shore of Gitche Gumee,
2. By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
3. At the doorway of his wigwam,
4. In the pleasant Summer morning,
5. Hiawatha stood and waited.
6. All the air was full of freshness,
7. All the earth was bright and joyous,
8. And before him, through the sunshine,
9. Westward toward the neighboring forest
10. Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo,
11. Passed the bees, the honey-makers,
12. Burning, singing In the sunshine.

13. Bright above him shone the heavens,
14. Level spread the lake before him;
15. From its bosom leaped the sturgeon,
16. Sparkling, flashing in the sunshine;
17. On its margin the great forest
18. Stood reflected in the water,
19. Every tree-top had its shadow,
20. Motionless beneath the water.

21. From the brow of Hiawatha
22. Gone was every trace of sorrow,
23. As the fog from off the water,
24. As the mist from off the meadow.
25. With a smile of joy and triumph,
26. With a look of exultation,
27. As of one who in a vision
28. Sees what is to be, but is not,
29. Stood and waited Hiawatha.

30. Toward the sun his hands were lifted,
31. Both the palms spread out against it,
32. And between the parted fingers
33. Fell the sunshine on his features,
34. Flecked with light his naked shoulders,
35. As it falls and flecks an oak-tree
36. Through the rifted leaves and branches.

37. O'er the water floating, flying,
38. Something in the hazy distance,
39. Something in the mists of morning,
40. Loomed and lifted from the water,
41. Now seemed floating, now seemed flying,
42. Coming nearer, nearer, nearer.

43. Was it Shingebis the diver?
44. Or the pelican, the Shada?
45. Or the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah?
46. Or the white goose, Waw-be-wawa,
47. With the water dripping, flashing,
48. From its glossy neck and feathers?

49. It was neither goose nor diver,
50. Neither pelican nor heron,
51. O'er the water floating, flying,
52. Through the shining mist of morning,
53. But a birch canoe with paddles,
54. Rising, sinking on the water,
55. Dripping, flashing in the sunshine;
56. And within it came a people
57. From the distant land of Wabun,
58. From the farthest realms of morning
59. Came the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,
60. He the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face,
61. With his guides and his companions.

62. And the noble Hiawatha,
63. With his hands aloft extended,
64. Held aloft in sign of welcome,
65. Waited, full of exultation,
66. Till the birch canoe with paddles
67. Grated on the shining pebbles,
68. Stranded on the sandy margin,
69. Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,
70. With the cross upon his bosom,
71. Landed on the sandy margin.

72. Then the joyous Hiawatha
73. Cried aloud and spake in this wise:
74. 'Beautiful is the sun, O strangers,
75. When you come so far to see us!
76. All our town in peace awaits you,
77. All our doors stand open for you;
78. You shall enter all our wigwams,
79. For the heart's right hand we give you.

80. 'Never bloomed the earth so gayly,
81. Never shone the sun so brightly,
82. As to-day they shine and blossom
83. When you come so far to see us!
84. Never was our lake so tranquil,
85. Nor so free from rocks, and sand-bars;
86. For your birch canoe in passing
87. Has removed both rock and sand-bar.

88. 'Never before had our tobacco
89. Such a sweet and pleasant flavor,
90. Never the broad leaves of our cornfields
91. Were so beautiful to look on,
92. As they seem to us this morning,
93. When you come so far to see us!'

94. And the Black-Robe chief made answer,
95. Stammered In his speech a little,
96. Speaking words yet unfamiliar:
97. 'Peace be with you, Hiawatha,
98. Peace be with you and your people,
99. Peace of prayer, and peace of pardon,
100. Peace of Christ, and joy of Mary!'

101. Then the generous Hiawatha
102. Led the strangers to his wigwam,
103. Seated them on skins of bison,
104. Seated them on skins of ermine,
105. And the careful old Nokomis
106. Brought them food in bowls of basswood,
107. Water brought in birchen dippers,
108. And the calumet, the peace-pipe,
109. Filled and lighted for their smoking.

110. All the old men of the village,
111. All the warriors of the nation,
112. All the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,
113. The magicians, the Wabenos,
114. And the Medicine-men, the Medas,
115. Came to bid the strangers welcome;
116. 'It is well', they said, 'O brothers,
117. That you come so far to see us!'

118. In a circle round the doorway,
119. With their pipes they sat In silence,
120. Waiting to behold the strangers,
121. Waiting to receive their message;
122. Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,
123. From the wigwam came to greet them,
124. Stammering in his speech a little,
125. Speaking words yet unfamiliar;
126. 'It Is well,' they said, 'O brother,
127. That you come so far to see us!'

128. Then the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,
129. Told his message to the people,
130. Told the purport of his mission,
131. Told them of the Virgin Mary,
132. And her blessed Son, the Saviour,
133. How in distant lands and ages
134. He had lived on earth as we do;
135. How he fasted, prayed, and labored;
136. How the Jews, the tribe accursed,
137. Mocked him, scourged him, crucified him;
138. How he rose from where they laid him,
139. Walked again with his disciples,
140. And ascended into heaven.

141. And the chiefs made answer, saying:
142. 'We have listened to your message,
143. We have heard your words of wisdom,
144. We will think on what you tell us.
145. It is well for us, O brothers,
146. That you come so far to see us!'

147. Then they rose up and departed
148. Each one homeward to his wigwam,
149. To the young men and the women
150. Told the story of the strangers
151. Whom the Master of Life had sent them
152. From the shining land of Wabun.

153. Heavy with the heat and silence
154. Grew the afternoon of Summer;
155. With a drowsy sound the forest
156. Whispered round the sultry wigwam,
157. With a sound of sleep the water
158. Rippled on the beach below it;
159. From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless
160. Sang the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;
161. And the guests of Hiawatha,
162. Weary with the heat of Summer,
163. Slumbered in the sultry wigwam.

164. Slowly o'er the simmering landscape
165. Fell the evening's dusk and coolness,
166. And the long and level sunbeams
167. Shot their spears into the forest,
168. Breaking through its shields of shadow,
169. Rushed into each secret ambush,
170. Searched each thicket, dingle, hollow;
171. Still the guests of Hiawatha
172. Slumbered In the silent wigwam.

173. From his place rose Hiawatha,
174. Bade farewell to old Nokomis,
175. Spake in whispers, spake in this wise,
176. Did not wake the guests, that slumbered.

177. 'I am going, O Nokomis,
178. On a long and distant journey,
179. To the portals of the Sunset.
180. To the regions of the home-wind,
181. Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin.
182. But these guests I leave behind me,
183. In your watch and ward I leave them;
184. See that never harm comes near them,
185. See that never fear molests them,
186. Never danger nor suspicion,
187. Never want of food or shelter,
188. In the lodge of Hiawatha!'

189. Forth into the village went he,
190. Bade farewell to all the warriors,
191. Bade farewell to all the young men,
192. Spake persuading, spake in this wise:

193. I am going, O my people,
194. On a long and distant journey;
195. Many moons and many winters
196. Will have come, and will have vanished,
197. Ere I come again to see you.
198. But my guests I leave behind me;
199. Listen to their words of wisdom,
200. Listen to the truth they tell you,
201. For the Master of Life has sent them
202. From the land of light and morning!'

203. On the shore stood Hiawatha,
204. Turned and waved his hand at parting;
205. On the clear and luminous water
206. Launched his birch canoe for sailing,
207. From the pebbles of the margin
208. Shoved it forth into the water;
209. Whispered to it, 'Westward! westward!'
210. And with speed it darted forward.

211. And the evening sun descending
212. Set the clouds on fire with redness,
213. Burned the broad sky, like a prairie,
214. Left upon the level water
215. One long track and trail of splendor,
216. Down whose stream, as down a river,
217. Westward, westward Hiawatha
218. Sailed into the fiery sunset,
219. Sailed into the purple vapors,
220. Sailed into the dusk of evening:

221. And the people from the margin
222. Watched him floating, rising, sinking,
223. Till the birch canoe seemed lifted
224. High into that sea of splendor,
225. Till it sank into the vapors
226. Like the new moon slowly, slowly
227. Sinking in the purple distance.

228. And they said, 'Farewell forever!'
229. Said, 'Farewell, O Hiawatha!'
230. And the forests, dark and lonely,
231. Moved through all their depths of darkness,
232. Sighed, 'Farewell, O Hiawatha!'
233. And the waves upon the margin
234. Rising, rippling on the pebbles,
235. Sobbed, 'Farewell, O Hiawatha!'
236. And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,
237. From her haunts among the fen-lands,
238. Screamed, 'Farewell, O Hiawatha!'

239. Thus departed Hiawatha,
240. Hiawatha the Beloved,
241. In the glory of the sunset,.
242. In the purple mists of evening,
243. To the regions of the home-wind,
244. Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,
245. To the Islands of the Blessed,
246. To the Kingdom of Ponemah,
247. To the Land of the Hereafter!
