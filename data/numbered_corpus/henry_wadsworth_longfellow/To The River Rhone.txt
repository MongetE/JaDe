1. Thou Royal River, born of sun and shower
2. In chambers purple with the Alpine glow,
3. Wrapped in the spotless ermine of the snow
4. And rocked by tempests!--at the appointed hour
5. Forth, like a steel-clad horseman from a tower,
6. With clang and clink of harness dost thou go
7. To meet thy vassal torrents, that below
8. Rush to receive thee and obey thy power.
9. And now thou movest in triumphal march,
10. A king among the rivers! On thy way
11. A hundred towns await and welcome thee;
12. Bridges uplift for thee the stately arch,
13. Vineyards encircle thee with garlands gay,
14. And fleets attend thy progress to the sea!
