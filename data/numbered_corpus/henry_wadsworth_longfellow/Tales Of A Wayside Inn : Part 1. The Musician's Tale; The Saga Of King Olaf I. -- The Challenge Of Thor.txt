1. I am the God Thor,
2. I am the War God,
3. I am the Thunderer!
4. Here in my Northland,
5. My fastness and fortress,
6. Reign I forever!

7. Here amid icebergs
8. Rule I the nations;
9. This is my hammer,
10. Mi√∂lner the mighty;
11. Giants and sorcerers
12. Cannot withstand it!

13. These are the gauntlets
14. Wherewith I wield it,
15. And hurl it afar off;
16. This is my girdle;
17. Whenever I brace it,
18. Strength is redoubled!

19. The light thou beholdest
20. Stream through the heavens,
21. In flashes of crimson,
22. Is but my red beard
23. Blown by the night-wind,
24. Affrighting the nations!

25. Jove is my brother;
26. Mine eyes are the lightning;
27. The wheels of my chariot
28. Roll in the thunder,
29. The blows of my hammer
30. Ring in the earthquake!

31. Force rules the world still,
32. Has ruled it, shall rule it;
33. Meekness is weakness,
34. Strength is triumphant,
35. Over the whole earth
36. Still is it Thor's-Day!

37. Thou art a God too,
38. O Galilean!
39. And thus single-handed
40. Unto the combat,
41. Gauntlet or Gospel,
42. Here I defy thee!
