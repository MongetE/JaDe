1. Will ever the dear days come back again,
2. Those days of June, when lilacs were in bloom,
3. And bluebirds sang their sonnets in the gloom
4. Of leaves that roofed them in from sun or rain?
5. I know not; but a presence will remain
6. For ever and for ever in this room,
7. Formless, diffused in air, like a perfume,--
8. A phantom of the heart, and not the brain.
9. Delicious days! when every spoken word
10. Was like a foot-fall nearer and more near
11. And a mysterious knocking at the gate
12. Of the heart's secret places, and we heard
13. In the sweet tumult of delight and fear
14. A voice that whispered, 'Open, I cannot wait!'
