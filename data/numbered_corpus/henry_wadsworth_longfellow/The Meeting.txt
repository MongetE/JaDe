1. After so long an absence
2. At last we meet agin:
3. Does the meeting give us pleasure,
4. Or does it give us pain?

5. The tree of life has been shaken,
6. And but few of us linger now,
7. Like the prophets two or three berries
8. In the top of the uppermost bough.

9. We cordially greet each other
10. In the old, familiar tone;
11. And we think, though we do not say it,
12. How old and gray he is grown!

13. We speak of a Merry Christmas
14. And many a Happy New Year;
15. But each in his heart is thinking
16. Of those that are not here.

17. We speak of friends and their fortunes,
18. And of what they did and said,
19. Till the dead alone seem living,
20. And the living alone seem dead.

21. And at last we hardly distinguish
22. Between the ghosts and the guests;
23. And a mist and shadow of sadness
24. Steals over our merriest jests.
