1. In St. Luke's Gospel we are told
2. How Peter in the days of old
3. Was sifted;
4. And now, though ages intervene,
5. Sin is the same, while time and scene
6. Are shifted.

7. Satan desires us, great and small,
8. As wheat to sift us, and we all
9. Are tempted;
10. Not one, however rich or great,
11. Is by his station or estate
12. Exempted.

13. No house so safely guarded is
14. But he, by some device of his,
15. Can enter;
16. No heart hath armor so complete
17. But he can pierce with arrows fleet
18. Its centre.

19. For all at last the cock will crow,
20. Who hear the warning voice, but go
21. Unheeding,
22. Till thrice and more they have denied
23. The Man of Sorrows, crucified
24. And bleeding.

25. One look of that pale, suffering face
26. Will make us feel the deep disgrace
27. Of weakness;
28. We shall be sifted till the strength
29. Of self-conceit be changed at length
30. To meekness.

31. Wounds of the soul, though healed, will ache;
32. The reddening scars remain, and make
33. Confession;
34. Lost innocence returns no more;
35. We are not what we were before
36. Transgression.

37. But noble souls, through dust and heat,
38. Rise from disaster and defeat
39. The stronger,
40. And conscious still of the divine
41. Within them, lie on earth supine
42. No longer.
