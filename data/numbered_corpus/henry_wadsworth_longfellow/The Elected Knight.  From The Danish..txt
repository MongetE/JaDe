1. Sir Oluf he rideth over the plain,
2. Full seven miles broad and seven miles wide,
3. But never, ah never, can meet with the man,
4. A tilt with him dare ride.

5. He saw under the hill-side
6. A Knight full well equipped;
7. His steed was black, his helm was barred;
8. He was riding at full speed.

9. He wore upon his spurs
10. Twelve little golden birds;
11. Anon he spurred his steed with a clang,
12. And there sat all the birds and sang.

13. He wore upon his mail
14. Twelve little golden wheels;
15. Anon in eddies the wild wind blew,
16. And round and round the wheels they flew.

17. He wore before his breast
18. A lance that was poised in rest;
19. And it was sharper than diamond-stone.
20. It made Sir Oluf's heart to groan.

21. He wore upon his helm
22. A wreath of ruddy gold;
23. And that gave him the Maidens Three,
24. The youngest was fair to behold.

25. Sir Oluf questioned the Knight eftsoon
26. If he were come from heaven down;
27. 'Art thou Christ of Heaven,' quoth he,
28. 'So will I yield me unto thee.'

29. 'I am not Christ the Great,
30. Thou shalt not yield thee yet;
31. I am an Unknown Knight,
32. Three modest maidens have me bedight.'

33. 'Art thou a Knight elected,
34. And have three Maidens thee bedight;
35. So shalt thou ride a tilt this day,
36. For all the Maidens' honour!'

37. The first tilt they together rode
38. They put their steeds to the test;
39. The second tilt they together rode,
40. They proved their manhood best;

41. The third tilt they together rode,
42. Neither of them would yield;
43. The fourth tilt they together rode,
44. They both fell on the field.

45. Now lie the Lords upon the plain,
46. And their blood runs unto death:
47. Now sit the Maidens in the high tower,
48. The youngest sorrows till death.
