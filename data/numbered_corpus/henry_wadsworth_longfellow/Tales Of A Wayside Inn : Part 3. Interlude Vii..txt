1. Touched by the pathos of these rhymes,
2. The Theologian said: 'All praise
3. Be to the ballads of old times
4. And to the bards of simple ways,
5. Who walked with Nature hand in hand,
6. Whose country was their Holy Land,
7. Whose singing robes were homespun brown
8. From looms of their own native town,
9. Which they were not ashamed to wear,
10. And not of silk or sendal gay,
11. Nor decked with fanciful array
12. Of cockle-shells from Outre-Mer.'

13. To whom the Student answered: 'Yes;
14. All praise and honor! I confess
15. That bread and ale, home-baked, home-brewed,
16. Are wholesome and nutritious food,
17. But not enough for all our needs;
18. Poets--the best of them--are birds
19. Of passage; where their instinct leads
20. They range abroad for thoughts and words,
21. And from all climes bring home the seeds
22. That germinate in flowers or weeds.
23. They are not fowls in barnyards born
24. To cackle o'er a grain of corn;
25. And, if you shut the horizon down
26. To the small limits of their town,
27. What do you but degrade your bard
28. Till he at last becomes as one
29. Who thinks the all-encircling sun
30. Rises and sets in his back yard?'

31. The Theologian said again:
32. 'It may be so; yet I maintain
33. That what is native still is best,
34. And little care I for the rest.
35. 'T is a long story; time would fail
36. To tell it, and the hour is late;
37. We will not waste it in debate,
38. But listen to our Landlord's tale.'

39. And thus the sword of Damocles
40. Descending not by slow degrees,
41. But suddenly, on the Landlord fell,
42. Who blushing, and with much demur
43. And many vain apologies,
44. Plucking up heart, began to tell
45. The Rhyme of one Sir Christopher.
