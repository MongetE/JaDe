1. Safe at anchor in Drontheim bay
2. King Olaf's fleet assembled lay,
3. And, striped with white and blue,
4. Downward fluttered sail and banner,
5. As alights the screaming lanner;
6. Lustily cheered, in their wild manner,
7. The Long Serpent's crew.

8. Her forecastle man was Ulf the Red,
9. Like a wolf's was his shaggy head,
10. His teeth as large and white;
11. His beard, of gray and russet blended,
12. Round as a swallow's nest descended;
13. As standard-bearer he defended
14. Olaf's flag in the fight.

15. Near him Kolbiorn had his place,
16. Like the King in garb and face,
17. So gallant and so hale;
18. Every cabin-boy and varlet
19. Wondered at his cloak of scarlet;
20. Like a river, frozen and star-lit,
21. Gleamed his coat of mail.

22. By the bulkhead, tall and dark,
23. Stood Thrand Rame of Thelemark,
24. A figure gaunt and grand;
25. On his hairy arm imprinted
26. Was an anchor, azure-tinted;
27. Like Thor's hammer, huge and dinted
28. Was his brawny hand.

29. Einar Tamberskelver, bare
30. To the winds his golden hair,
31. By the mainmast stood;
32. Graceful was his form, and slender,
33. And his eyes were deep and tender
34. As a woman's, in the splendor
35. Of her maidenhood.

36. In the fore-hold Biorn and Bork
37. Watched the sailors at their work:
38. Heavens! how they swore!
39. Thirty men they each commanded,
40. Iron-sinewed, horny-handed,
41. Shoulders broad, and chests expanded.
42. Tugging at the oar.

43. These, and many more like these,
44. With King Olaf sailed the seas,
45. Till the waters vast
46. Filled them with a vague devotion,
47. With the freedom and the motion,
48. With the roll and roar of ocean
49. And the sounding blast.

50. When they landed from the fleet,
51. How they roared through Drontheim's street,
52. Boisterous as the gale!
53. How they laughed and stamped and pounded,
54. Till the tavern roof resounded,
55. And the host looked on astounded
56. As they drank the ale!

57. Never saw the wild North Sea
58. Such a gallant company
59. Sail its billows blue!
60. Never, while they cruised and quarrelled,
61. Old King Gorm, or Blue-Tooth Harald,
62. Owned a ship so well apparelled,
63. Boasted such a crew!
