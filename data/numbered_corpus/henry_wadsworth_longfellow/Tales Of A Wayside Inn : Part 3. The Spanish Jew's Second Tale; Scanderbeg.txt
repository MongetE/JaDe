1. The battle is fought and won
2. By King Ladislaus, the Hun,
3. In fire of hell and death's frost,
4. On the day of Pentecost.
5. And in rout before his path
6. From the field of battle red
7. Flee all that are not dead
8. Of the army of Amurath.

9. In the darkness of the night
10. Iskander, the pride and boast
11. Of that mighty Othman host,
12. With his routed Turks, takes flight
13. From the battle fought and lost
14. On the day of Pentecost;
15. Leaving behind him dead
16. The army of Amurath,
17. The vanguard as it led,
18. The rearguard as it fled,
19. Mown down in the bloody swath
20. Of the battle's aftermath.

21. But he cared not for Hospodars,
22. Nor for Baron or Voivode,
23. As on through the night he rode
24. And gazed at the fateful stars,
25. That were shining overhead;
26. But smote his steed with his staff,
27. And smiled to himself, and said;
28. 'This is the time to laugh.'

29. In the middle of the night,
30. In a halt of the hurrying flight,
31. There came a Scribe of the King
32. Wearing his signet ring,
33. And said in a voice severe:
34. 'This is the first dark blot
35. On thy name, George Castriot!
36. Alas! why art thou here,
37. And the army of Amurath slain,
38. And left on the battle plain?'

39. And Iskander answered and said:
40. 'They lie on the bloody sod
41. By the hoofs of horses trod;
42. But this was the decree
43. Of the watchers overhead;
44. For the war belongeth to God,
45. And in battle who are we,
46. Who are we, that shall withstand
47. The wind of his lifted hand?'

48. Then he bade them bind with chains
49. This man of books and brains;
50. And the Scribe said: 'What misdeed
51. Have I done, that, without need,
52. Thou doest to me this thing?'
53. And Iskander answering
54. Said unto him: 'Not one
55. Misdeed to me hast thou done;
56. But for fear that thou shouldst run
57. And hide thyself from me,
58. Have I done this unto thee.

59. 'Now write me a writing, O Scribe,
60. And a blessing be on thy tribe!
61. A writing sealed with thy ring,
62. To King Amurath's Pasha
63. In the city of Croia,
64. The city moated and walled,
65. That he surrender the same
66. In the name of my master, the King;
67. For what is writ in his name
68. Can never be recalled.'

69. And the Scribe bowed low in dread,
70. And unto Iskander said:
71. 'Allah is great and just,
72. But we are as ashes and dust;
73. How shall I do this thing,
74. When I know that my guilty head
75. Will be forfeit to the King?'

76. Then swift as a shooting star
77. The curved and shining blade
78. Of Iskander's scimetar
79. From its sheath, with jewels bright,
80. Shot, as he thundered: 'Write!'
81. And the trembling Scribe obeyed,
82. And wrote in the fitful glare
83. Of the bivouac fire apart,
84. With the chill of the midnight air
85. On his forehead white and bare,
86. And the chill of death in his heart.

87. Then again Iskander cried:
88. 'Now follow whither I ride,
89. For here thou must not stay.
90. Thou shalt be as my dearest friend,
91. And honors without end
92. Shall surround thee on every side,
93. And attend thee night and day.'
94. But the sullen Scribe replied
95. 'Our pathways here divide;
96. Mine leadeth not thy way.'

97. And even as he spoke
98. Fell a sudden scimetar-stroke,
99. When no one else was near;
100. And the Scribe sank to the ground,
101. As a stone, pushed from the brink
102. Of a black pool, might sink
103. With a sob and disappear;
104. And no one saw the deed;
105. And in the stillness around
106. No sound was heard but the sound
107. Of the hoofs of Iskander's steed,
108. As forward he sprang with a bound.

109. Then onward he rode and afar,
110. With scarce three hundred men,
111. Through river and forest and fen,
112. O'er the mountains of Argentar;
113. And his heart was merry within,
114. When he crossed the river Drin,
115. And saw in the gleam of the morn
116. The White Castle Ak-Hissar,
117. The city Croia called,
118. The city moated and walled,
119. The city where he was born,--
120. And above it the morning star.

121. Then his trumpeters in the van
122. On their silver bugles blew,
123. And in crowds about him ran
124. Albanian and Turkoman,
125. That the sound together drew.
126. And he feasted with his friends,
127. And when they were warm with wine,
128. He said: 'O friends of mine,
129. Behold what fortune sends,
130. And what the fates design!
131. King Amurath commands
132. That my father's wide domain,
133. This city and all its lands,
134. Shall be given to me again.'

135. Then to the Castle White
136. He rode in regal state,
137. And entered in at the gate
138. In all his arms bedight,
139. And gave to the Pasha
140. Who ruled in Croia
141. The writing of the King,
142. Sealed with his signet ring.
143. And the Pasha bowed his head,
144. And after a silence said:
145. 'Allah is just and great!
146. I yield to the will divine,
147. The city and lands are thine;
148. Who shall contend with fate?'

149. Anon from the castle walls
150. The crescent banner falls,
151. And the crowd beholds instead,
152. Like a portent in the sky,
153. Iskander's banner fly,
154. The Black Eagle with double head;
155. And a shout ascends on high,
156. For men's souls are tired of the Turks,
157. And their wicked ways and works,
158. That have made of Ak-Hissar
159. A city of the plague;
160. And the loud, exultant cry
161. That echoes wide and far
162. Is: 'Long live Scanderbeg!'

163. It was thus Iskander came
164. Once more unto his own;
165. And the tidings, like the flame
166. Of a conflagration blown
167. By the winds of summer, ran,
168. Till the land was in a blaze,
169. And the cities far and near,
170. Sayeth Ben Joshua Ben Meir,
171. In his Book of the Words of the Days,
172. 'Were taken as a man
173. Would take the tip of his ear.'
