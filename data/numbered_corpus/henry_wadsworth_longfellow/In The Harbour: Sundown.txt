1. The summer sun is sinking low;
2. Only the tree-tops redden and glow:
3. Only the weathercock on the spire
4. Of the neighboring church is a flame of fire;
5. All is in shadow below.

6. O beautiful, awful summer day,
7. What hast thou given, what taken away?
8. Life and death, and love and hate,
9. Homes made happy or desolate,
10. Hearts made sad or gay!

11. On the road of life one mile-stone more!
12. In the book of life one leaf turned o'er!
13. Like a red seal is the setting sun
14. On the good and the evil men have done,--
15. Naught can to-day restore!
