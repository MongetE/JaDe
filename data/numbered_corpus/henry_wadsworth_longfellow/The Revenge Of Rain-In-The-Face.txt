1. In that desolate land and lone,
2. Where the Big Horn and Yellowstone
3. Roar down their mountain path,
4. By their fires the Sioux Chiefs
5. Muttered their woes and griefs
6. And the menace of their wrath.

7. "Revenge!" cried Rain-in-the-Face,
8. "Revenue upon all the race
9. Of the White Chief with yellow hair!"
10. And the mountains dark and high
11. From their crags re-echoed the cry
12. Of his anger and despair.

13. In the meadow, spreading wide
14. By woodland and riverside
15. The Indian village stood;
16. All was silent as a dream,
17. Save the rushing a of the stream
18. And the blue-jay in the wood.

19. In his war paint and his beads,
20. Like a bison among the reeds,
21. In ambush the Sitting Bull
22. Lay with three thousand braves
23. Crouched in the clefts and caves,
24. Savage, unmerciful!

25. Into the fatal snare
26. The White Chief with yellow hair
27. And his three hundred men
28. Dashed headlong, sword in hand;
29. But of that gallant band
30. Not one returned again.

31. The sudden darkness of death
32. Overwhelmed them like the breath
33. And smoke of a furnace fire:
34. By the river's bank, and between
35. The rocks of the ravine,
36. They lay in their bloody attire.

37. But the foemen fled in the night,
38. And Rain-in-the-Face, in his flight
39. Uplifted high in air
40. As a ghastly trophy, bore
41. The brave heart, that beat no more,
42. Of the White Chief with yellow hair.

43. Whose was the right and the wrong?
44. Sing it, O funeral song,
45. With a voice that is full of tears,
46. And say that our broken faith
47. Wrought all this ruin and scathe,
48. In the Year of a Hundred Years.
