1. What say the Bells of San Blas
2. To the ships that southward pass
3. From the harbor of Mazatlan?
4. To them it is nothing more
5. Than the sound of surf on the shore,--
6. Nothing more to master or man.

7. But to me, a dreamer of dreams,
8. To whom what is and what seems
9. Are often one and the same,--
10. The Bells of San Blas to me
11. Have a strange, wild melody,
12. And are something more than a name.

13. For bells are the voice of the church;
14. They have tones that touch and search
15. The hearts of young and old;
16. One sound to all, yet each
17. Lends a meaning to their speech,
18. And the meaning is manifold.

19. They are a voice of the Past,
20. Of an age that is fading fast,
21. Of a power austere and grand,
22. When the flag of Spain unfurled
23. Its folds o'er this western world,
24. And the Priest was lord of the land.

25. The chapel that once looked down
26. On the little seaport town
27. Has crumbled into the dust;
28. And on oaken beams below
29. The bells swing to and fro,
30. And are green with mould and rust.

31. 'Is, then, the old faith dead,'
32. They say, 'and in its stead
33. Is some new faith proclaimed,
34. That we are forced to remain
35. Naked to sun and rain,
36. Unsheltered and ashamed?

37. 'Once, in our tower aloof,
38. We rang over wall and roof
39. Our warnings and our complaints;
40. And round about us there
41. The white doves filled the air,
42. Like the white souls of the saints.

43. 'The saints! Ah, have they grown
44. Forgetful of their own?
45. Are they asleep, or dead,
46. That open to the sky
47. Their ruined Missions lie,
48. No longer tenanted?

49. 'Oh, bring us back once more
50. The vanished days of yore,
51. When the world with faith was filled;
52. Bring back the fervid zeal,
53. The hearts of fire and steel,
54. The hands that believe and build.

55. 'Then from our tower again
56. We will send over land and main
57. Our voices of command,
58. Like exiled kings who return
59. To their thrones, and the people learn
60. That the Priest is lord of the land!'

61. O Bells of San Blas in vain
62. Ye call back the Past again;
63. The Past is deaf to your prayer!
64. Out of the shadows of night
65. The world rolls into light;
66. It is daybreak everywhere.
