1. O little feet! that such long years
2. Must wander on through hopes and fears,
3. Must ache and bleed beneath your load;
4. I, nearer to the wayside inn
5. Where toil shall cease and rest begin,
6. Am weary, thinking of your road!

7. O little hands! that, weak or strong,
8. Have still to serve or rule so long,
9. Have still so long to give or ask;
10. I, who so much with book and pen
11. Have toiled among my fellow-men,
12. Am weary, thinking of your task.

13. O little hearts! that throb and beat
14. With such impatient, feverish heat,
15. Such limitless and strong desires;
16. Mine that so long has glowed and burned,
17. With passions into ashes turned
18. Now covers and conceals its fires.

19. O little souls! as pure and white
20. And crystalline as rays of light
21. Direct from heaven, their source divine;
22. Refracted through the mist of years,
23. How red my setting sun appears,
24. How lurid looks this soul of mine!
