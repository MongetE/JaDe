1. Now Time throws off his cloak again
2. Of ermined frost, and cold and rain,
3. And clothes him in the embroidery
4. Of glittering son and clear blue sky.
5. With beast and bird the forest rings,
6. Each in his jargon cries or sings;
7. And Time throws off his cloak again
8. Of ermined frost, and cold and rain.
9. River, and fount, and tinkling brook
10. Wear in their dainty livery
11. Drops of silver jewelry;
12. In new-made suit they merry look;
13. And Time throws off his cloak again
14. Of ermined frost, and cold and rain.
