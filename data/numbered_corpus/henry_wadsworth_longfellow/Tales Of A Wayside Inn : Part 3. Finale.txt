1. These are the tales those merry guests
2. Told to each other, well or ill;
3. Like summer birds that lift their crests
4. Above the borders of their nests
5. And twitter, and again are still.

6. These are the tales, or new or old,
7. In idle moments idly told;
8. Flowers of the field with petals thin,
9. Lilies that neither toil nor spin,
10. And tufts of wayside weeds and gorse
11. Hung in the parlor of the inn
12. Beneath the sign of the Red Horse.

13. And still, reluctant to retire,
14. The friends sat talking by the fire
15. And watched the smouldering embers burn
16. To ashes, and flash up again
17. Into a momentary glow,
18. Lingering like them when forced to go,
19. And going when they would remain;
20. For on the morrow they must turn
21. Their faces homeward, and the pain
22. Of parting touched with its unrest
23. A tender nerve in every breast.

24. But sleep at last the victory won;
25. They must be stirring with the sun,
26. And drowsily good night they said,
27. And went still gossiping to bed,
28. And left the parlor wrapped in gloom,
29. The only live thing in the room
30. Was the old clock, that in its pace
31. Kept time with the revolving spheres
32. And constellations in their flight,
33. And struck with its uplifted mace
34. The dark, unconscious hours of night,
35. To senseless and unlistening ears.

36. Uprose the sun; and every guest,
37. Uprisen, was soon equipped and dressed
38. For journeying home and city-ward;
39. The old stage-coach was at the door,
40. With horses harnessed, long before
41. The sunshine reached the withered sward
42. Beneath the oaks, whose branches hoar
43. Murmured: ?Farewell forevermore.?

44. ?Farewell!? the portly Landlord cried;
45. ?Farewell!? the parting guests replied,
46. But little thought that nevermore
47. Their feet would pass that thershold o?er;
48. That nevermore together there
49. Would they assemble, free from care,
50. To hear the oaks? mysterious roar,
51. And breathe the wholesome country air.

52. Where are they now? What lands and skies
53. Paint pictures in their friendly eyes?
54. What hope deludes, what promise cheers,
55. What pleasant voices fill their ears?
56. Two are beyond the salt sea waves,
57. And three already in their graves.
58. Perchance the living still may look
59. Into the pages of this book,
60. And see the days of long ago
61. Floating and fleeting to and fro,
62. As in the well-remembered brook
63. They saw the inverted landscape gleam,
64. And their own faces like a dream
65. Look up upon them from below.
