1. Thou mighty Prince of Church and State,
2. Richelieu! until the hour of death,
3. Whatever road man chooses, Fate
4. Still holds him subject to her breath.
5. Spun of all silks, our days and nights
6. Have sorrows woven with delights;
7. And of this intermingled shade
8. Our various destiny appears,
9. Even as one sees the course of years
10. Of summers and of winters made.
11. Sometimes the soft, deceitful hours
12. Let us enjoy the halcyon wave;
13. Sometimes impending peril lowers
14. Beyond the seaman's skill to save,
15. The Wisdom, infinitely wise,
16. That gives to human destinies
17. Their foreordained necessity,
18. Has made no law more fixed below,
19. Than the alternate ebb and flow
20. Of Fortune and Adversity.
