1. Will then, Duperrier, thy sorrow be eternal?
2. And shall the sad discourse
3. Whispered within thy heart, by tenderness paternal,
4. Only augment its force?

5. Thy daughter's mournful fate, into the tomb descending
6. By death's frequented ways,
7. Has it become to thee a labyrinth never ending,
8. Where thy lost reason strays?

9. I know the charms that made her youth a benediction:
10. Nor should I be content,
11. As a censorious friend, to solace thine affliction
12. By her disparagement.

13. But she was of the world, which fairest things exposes
14. To fates the most forlorn;
15. A rose, she too hath lived as long as live the roses,
16. The space of one brief morn.

18. Death has his rigorous laws, unparalleled, unfeeling;
19. All prayers to him are vain;
20. Cruel, he stops his ears, and, deaf to our appealing,
21. He leaves us to complain.

22. The poor man in his hut, with only thatch for cover,
23. Unto these laws must bend;
24. The sentinel that guards the barriers of the Louvre
25. Cannot our kings defend.

26. To murmur against death, in petulant defiance,
27. Is never for the best;
28. To will what God doth will, that is the only science
29. That gives us any rest.
