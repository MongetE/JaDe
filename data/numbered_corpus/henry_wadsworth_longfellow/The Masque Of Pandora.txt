1. THE WORKSHOP OF HEPHAESTUS

2. HEPHAESTUS (standing before the statue of Pandora.)
3. Not fashioned out of gold, like Hera's throne,
4. Nor forged of iron like the thunderbolts
5. Of Zeus omnipotent, or other works
6. Wrought by my hands at Lemnos or Olympus,
7. But moulded in soft clay, that unresisting
8. Yields itself to the touch, this lovely form
9. Before me stands, perfect in every part.
10. Not Aphrodite's self appeared more fair,
11. When first upwafted by caressing winds
12. She came to high Olympus, and the gods
13. Paid homage to her beauty. Thus her hair
14. Was cinctured; thus her floating drapery
15. Was like a cloud about her, and her face
16. Was radiant with the sunshine and the sea.

17. THE VOICE OF ZEUS.
18. Is thy work done, Hephaestus?

19. HEPHAESTUS.
20. It is finished!

21. THE VOICE.
22. Not finished till I breathe the breath of life
23. Into her nostrils, and she moves and speaks.

24. HEPHAESTUS.
25. Will she become immortal like ourselves?

26. THE VOICE.
27. The form that thou hast fashioned out of clay
28. Is of the earth and mortal; but the spirit,
29. The life, the exhalation of my breath,
30. Is of diviner essence and immortal.
31. The gods shall shower on her their benefactions,
32. She shall possess all gifts: the gift of song,
33. The gift of eloquence, the gift of beauty,
34. The fascination and the nameless charm
35. That shall lead all men captive.

36. HEPHAESTUS.
37. Wherefore? wherefore?

38. (A wind shakes the house.)

39. I hear the rushing of a mighty wind
40. Through all the halls and chambers of my house!
41. Her parted lips inhale it, and her bosom
42. Heaves with the inspiration. As a reed
43. Beside a river in the rippling current
44. Bends to and fro, she bows or lifts her head.
45. She gazes round about as if amazed;
46. She is alive; she breathes, but yet she speaks not!

47. (PANDORA descends from the pedestal.)

48. CHORUS OF THE GRACES

49. AGLAIA.
50. In the workshop of Hephaestus
51. What is this I see?
52. Have the Gods to four increased us
53. Who were only three?
54. Beautiful in form and feature,
55. Lovely as the day,
56. Can there be so fair a creature
57. Formed of common clay?

58. THALIA.
59. O sweet, pale face! O lovely eyes of azure,
60. Clear as the waters of a brook that run
61. Limpid and laughing in the summer sun!
62. O golden hair that like a miser's treasure
63. In its abundance overflows the measure!
64. O graceful form, that cloudlike floatest on
65. With the soft, undulating gait of one
66. Who moveth as if motion were a pleasure!
67. By what name shall I call thee? Nymph or Muse,
68. Callirrhoe or Urania? Some sweet name
69. Whose every syllable is a caress
70. Would best befit thee; but I cannot choose,
71. Nor do I care to choose; for still the same,
72. Nameless or named, will be thy loveliness.

73. EUPHROSYNE.
74. Dowered with all celestial gifts,
75. Skilled in every art
76. That ennobles and uplifts
77. And delights the heart,
78. Fair on earth shall be thy fame
79. As thy face is fair,
80. And Pandora be the name
81. Thou henceforth shalt bear.

82. II.

83. OLYMPUS

84. HERMES (putting on his sandals.)
85. Much must he toil who serves the Immortal Gods,
86. And I, who am their herald, most of all.
87. No rest have I, nor respite. I no sooner
88. Unclasp the winged sandals from my feet,
89. Than I again must clasp them, and depart
90. Upon some foolish errand. But to-day
91. The errand is not foolish. Never yet
92. With greater joy did I obey the summons
93. That sends me earthward. I will fly so swiftly
94. That my caduceus in the whistling air
95. Shall make a sound like the Pandaean pipes,
96. Cheating the shepherds; for to-day I go,
97. Commissioned by high-thundering Zeus, to lead
98. A maiden to Prometheus, in his tower,
99. And by my cunning arguments persuade him
100. To marry her. What mischief lies concealed
101. In this design I know not; but I know
102. Who thinks of marrying hath already taken
103. One step upon the road to penitence.
104. Such embassies delight me. Forth I launch
105. On the sustaining air, nor fear to fall
106. Like Icarus, nor swerve aside like him
107. Who drove amiss Hyperion's fiery steeds.
108. I sink, I fly! The yielding element
109. Folds itself round about me like an arm,
110. And holds me as a mother holds her child.

111. III.

112. TOWER OF PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS

113. PROMETHEUS.
114. I hear the trumpet of Alectryon
115. Proclaim the dawn. The stars begin to fade,
116. And all the heavens are full of prophecies
117. And evil auguries. Blood-red last night
118. I saw great Kronos rise; the crescent moon
119. Sank through the mist, as if it were the scythe
120. His parricidal hand had flung far down
121. The western steeps. O ye Immortal Gods,
122. What evil are ye plotting and contriving?

123. (HERMES and PANDORA at the threshold.)

124. PANDORA.
125. I cannot cross the threshold. An unseen
126. And icy hand repels me. These blank walls
127. Oppress me with their weight!

128. PROMETHEUS.
129. Powerful ye are,
130. But not omnipotent. Ye cannot fight
131. Against Necessity. The Fates control you,
132. As they do us, and so far we are equals!

133. PANDORA.
134. Motionless, passionless, companionless,
135. He sits there muttering in his beard. His voice
136. Is like a river flowing underground!

137. HERMES.
138. Prometheus, hail!

139. PROMETHEUS.
140. Who calls me?

141. HERMES.
142. It is I.
143. Dost thou not know me?

144. PROMETHEUS.
145. By thy winged cap
146. And winged heels I know thee. Thou art Hermes,
147. Captain of thieves! Hast thou again been stealing
148. The heifers of Admetus in the sweet
149. Meadows of asphodel? or Hera's girdle?
150. Or the earth-shaking trident of Poseidon?

151. HERMES.
152. And thou, Prometheus; say, hast thou again
153. Been stealing fire from Helios' chariot-wheels
154. To light thy furnaces?

155. PROMETHEUS.
156. Why comest thou hither
157. So early in the dawn?

158. HERMES.
159. The Immortal Gods
160. Know naught of late or early. Zeus himself
161. The omnipotent hath sent me.

162. PROMETHEUS.
163. For what purpose?

164. HERMES.
165. To bring this maiden to thee.

166. PROMETHEUS.
167. I mistrust
168. The Gods and all their gifts. If they have sent her
169. It is for no good purpose.

170. HERMES.
171. What disaster
172. Could she bring on thy house, who is a woman?

173. PROMETHEUS.
174. The Gods are not my friends, nor am I theirs.
175. Whatever comes from them, though in a shape
176. As beautiful as this, is evil only.
177. Who art thou?

178. PANDORA.
179. One who, though to thee unknown,
180. Yet knoweth thee.

181. PROMETHEUS.
182. How shouldst thou know me, woman?

183. PANDORA.
184. Who knoweth not Prometheus the humane?

185. PROMETHEUS.
186. Prometheus the unfortunate; to whom
187. Both Gods and men have shown themselves ungrateful.
188. When every spark was quenched on every hearth
189. Throughout the earth, I brought to man the fire
190. And all its ministrations. My reward
191. Hath been the rock and vulture.

192. HERMES.
193. But the Gods
194. At last relent and pardon.

195. PROMETHEUS.
196. They relent not;
197. They pardon not; they are implacable,
198. Revengeful, unforgiving!

199. HERMES.
200. As a pledge
201. Of reconciliation they have sent to thee
202. This divine being, to be thy companion,
203. And bring into thy melancholy house
204. The sunshine and the fragrance of her youth.

205. PROMETHEUS.
206. I need them not. I have within myself
207. All that my heart desires; the ideal beauty
208. Which the creative faculty of mind
209. Fashions and follows in a thousand shapes
210. More lovely than the real. My own thoughts
211. Are my companions; my designs and labors
212. And aspirations are my only friends.

213. HERMES.
214. Decide not rashly. The decision made
215. Can never be recalled. The Gods implore not,
216. Plead not, solicit not; they only offer
217. Choice and occasion, which once being passed
218. Return no more. Dost thou accept the gift?

219. PROMETHEUS.
220. No gift of theirs, in whatsoever shape
221. It comes to me, with whatsoever charm
222. To fascinate my sense, will I receive.
223. Leave me.

224. PANDORA.
225. Let us go hence. I will not stay.

226. HERMES.
227. We leave thee to thy vacant dreams, and all
228. The silence and the solitude of thought,
229. The endless bitterness of unbelief,
230. The loneliness of existence without love.

231. CHORUS OF THE FATES

232. CLOTHO.
233. How the Titan, the defiant,
234. The self-centred, self-reliant,
235. Wrapped in visions and illusions,
236. Robs himself of life's best gifts!
237. Till by all the storm-winds shaken,
238. By the blast of fate o'ertaken,
239. Hopeless, helpless, and forsaken,
240. In the mists of his confusions
241. To the reefs of doom he drifts!

242. LACHESIS.
243. Sorely tried and sorely tempted,
244. From no agonies exempted,
245. In the penance of his trial,
246. And the discipline of pain;
247. Often by illusions cheated,
248. Often baffled and defeated
249. In the tasks to be completed,
250. He, by toil and self-denial,
251. To the highest shall attain.


252. ATROPOS.
253. Tempt no more the noble schemer;
254. Bear unto some idle dreamer
255. This new toy and fascination,
256. This new dalliance and delight!
257. To the garden where reposes
258. Epimetheus crowned with roses,
259. To the door that never closes
260. Upon pleasure and temptation,
261. Bring this vision of the night!

262. IV.

263. THE AIR

264. HERMES (returning to Olympus.)
265. As lonely as the tower that he inhabits,
266. As firm and cold as are the crags about him,
267. Prometheus stands. The thunderbolts of Zeus
268. Alone can move him; but the tender heart
269. Of Epimetheus, burning at white heat,
270. Hammers and flames like all his brother's forges!
271. Now as an arrow from Hyperion's bow,
272. My errand done, I fly, I float, I soar
273. Into the air, returning to Olympus.
274. O joy of motion! O delight to cleave
275. The infinite realms of space, the liquid ether,
276. Through the warm sunshine and the cooling cloud,
277. Myself as light as sunbeam or as cloud!
278. With one touch of my swift and winged feet,
279. I spurn the solid earth, and leave it rocking
280. As rocks the bough from which a bird takes wing.

281. V.

282. THE HOUSE OF EPIMETHEUS

283. EPIMETHEUS.
284. Beautiful apparition! go not hence!
285. Surely thou art a Goddess, for thy voice
286. Is a celestial melody, and thy form
287. Self-poised as if it floated on the air!

288. PANDORA.
289. No Goddess am I, nor of heavenly birth,
290. But a mere woman fashioned out of clay
291. And mortal as the rest.

292. EPIMETHEUS.
293. Thy face is fair;
294. There is a wonder in thine azure eyes
295. That fascinates me. Thy whole presence seems
296. A soft desire, a breathing thought of love.
297. Say, would thy star like Merope's grow dim
298. If thou shouldst wed beneath thee?

299. PANDORA.
300. Ask me not;
301. I cannot answer thee. I only know
302. The Gods have sent me hither.

303. EPIMETHEUS.
304. I believe,
305. And thus believing am most fortunate.
306. It was not Hermes led thee here, but Eros,
307. And swifter than his arrows were thine eves
308. In wounding me. There was no moment's space
309. Between my seeing thee and loving thee.
310. O, what a telltale face thou hast! Again
311. I see the wonder in thy tender eyes.

312. PANDORA.
313. They do but answer to the love in thine,
314. Yet secretly I wonder thou shouldst love me.
315. Thou knowest me not.

316. EPIMETHEUS.
317. Perhaps I know thee better
318. Than had I known thee longer. Yet it seems
319. That I have always known thee, and but now
320. Have found thee. Ah, I have been waiting long.

321. PANDORA.
322. How beautiful is this house! The atmosphere
323. Breathes rest and comfort, and the many chambers
324. Seem full of welcomes.

325. EPIMETHEUS.
326. They not only seem,
327. But truly are. This dwelling and its master
328. Belong to thee.

329. PANDORA.
330. Here let me stay forever!
331. There is a spell upon me.

332. EPIMETHEUS.
333. Thou thyself
334. Art the enchantress, and I feel thy power
335. Envelop me, and wrap my soul and sense
336. In an Elysian dream.

337. PANDORA.
338. O, let me stay.
339. How beautiful are all things round about me,
340. Multiplied by the mirrors on the walls!
341. What treasures hast thou here! Yon oaken chest,
342. Carven with figures and embossed with gold,
343. Is wonderful to look upon! What choice
344. And precious things dost thou keep hidden in it?

345. EPIMETHEUS.
346. I know not. 'T is a mystery.

347. PANDORA.
348. Hast thou never
349. Lifted the lid?

350. EPIMETHEUS.
351. The oracle forbids.
352. Safely concealed there from all mortal eyes
353. Forever sleeps the secret of the Gods.
354. Seek not to know what they have hidden from thee,
355. Till they themselves reveal it.

356. PANDORA.
357. As thou wilt.

358. EPIMETHEUS.
359. Let us go forth from this mysterious place.
360. The garden walks are pleasant at this hour;
361. The nightingales among the sheltering boughs
362. Of populous and many-nested trees
363. Shall teach me how to woo thee, and shall tell me
364. By what resistless charms or incantations
365. They won their mates.

366. PANDORA.
367. Thou dost not need a teacher.

368. (They go out.)

369. CHORUS OF THE EUMENIDES.
370. What the Immortals
371. Confide to thy keeping,
372. Tell unto no man;
373. Waking or sleeping,
374. Closed be thy portals
375. To friend as to foeman.

376. Silence conceals it;
377. The word that is spoken
378. Betrays and reveals it;
379. By breath or by token
380. The charm may be broken.

381. With shafts of their splendors
382. The Gods unforgiving
383. Pursue the offenders,
384. The dead and the living!
385. Fortune forsakes them,
386. Nor earth shall abide them,
387. Nor Tartarus hide them;
388. Swift wrath overtakes them!

389. With useless endeavor,
390. Forever, forever,
391. Is Sisyphus rolling
392. His stone up the mountain!
393. Immersed in the fountain,
394. Tantalus tastes not
395. The water that wastes not!
396. Through ages increasing
397. The pangs that afflict him,
398. With motion unceasing
399. The wheel of Ixion
400. Shall torture its victim!

401. VI.

402. IN THE GARDEN

403. EPIMETHEUS.
404. Yon snow-white cloud that sails sublime in ether
405. Is but the sovereign Zeus, who like a swan
406. Flies to fair-ankled Leda!

407. PANDORA.
408. Or perchance
409. Ixion's cloud, the shadowy shape of Hera,
410. That bore the Centaurs.

411. EPIMETHEUS.
412. The divine and human.

413. CHORUS OF BIRDS.
414. Gently swaying to and fro,
415. Rocked by all the winds that blow,
416. Bright with sunshine from above
417. Dark with shadow from below,
418. Beak to beak and breast to breast
419. In the cradle of their nest,
420. Lie the fledglings of our love.

421. ECHO.
422. Love! love!

423. EPIMETHEUS.
424. Hark! listen! Hear how sweetly overhead
425. The feathered flute-players pipe their songs of love,
426. And echo answers, love and only love.

427. CHORUS OF BIRDS.
428. Every flutter of the wing,
429. Every note of song we sing,
430. Every murmur, every tone,
431. Is of love and love alone.

432. ECHO.
433. Love alone!

434. EPIMETHEUS.
435. Who would not love, if loving she might be
436. Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven?

437. PANDORA.
438. Ah, who would love, if loving she might be
439. Like Semele consumed and burnt to ashes?

440. EPIMETHEUS.
441. Whence knowest thou these stories?

442. PANDORA.
443. Hermes taught me;
444. He told me all the history of the Gods.

445. CHORUS OF REEDS.
446. Evermore a sound shall be
447. In the reeds of Arcady,
448. Evermore a low lament
449. Of unrest and discontent,
450. As the story is retold
451. Of the nymph so coy and cold,
452. Who with frightened feet outran
453. The pursuing steps of Pan.

454. EPIMETHEUS.
455. The pipe of Pan out of these reeds is made,
456. And when he plays upon it to the shepherds
457. They pity him, so mournful is the sound.
458. Be thou not coy and cold as Syrinx was.

459. PANDORA.
460. Nor thou as Pan be rude and mannerless.

461. PROMETHEUS (without).
462. Ho! Epimetheus!

463. EPIMETHEUS.
464. 'T is my brother's voice;
465. A sound unwelcome and inopportune
466. As was the braying of Silenus' ass,
467. Once heard in Cybele's garden.

468. PANDORA.
469. Let me go.
470. I would not be found here. I would not see him.

471. (She escapes among the trees.)

472. CHORUS OF DRYADES.
473. Haste and hide thee,
474. Ere too late,
475. In these thickets intricate;
476. Lest Prometheus
477. See and chide thee,
478. Lest some hurt
479. Or harm betide thee,
480. Haste and hide thee!

481. PROMETHEUS (entering.)
482. Who was it fled from here? I saw a shape
483. Flitting among the trees.

484. EPIMETHEUS.
485. It was Pandora.

486. PROMETHEUS.
487. O Epimetheus! Is it then in vain
488. That I have warned thee? Let me now implore.
489. Thou harborest in thy house a dangerous guest.

490. EPIMETHEUS.
491. Whom the Gods love they honor with such guests.

492. PROMETHEUS.
493. Whom the Gods would destroy they first make mad.

494. EPIMETHEUS.
495. Shall I refuse the gifts they send to me?

496. PROMETHEUS.
497. Reject all gifts that come from higher powers.

498. EPIMETHEUS.
499. Such gifts as this are not to be rejected.

500. PROMETHEUS.
501. Make not thyself the slave of any woman.

502. EPIMETHEUS.
503. Make not thyself the judge of any man.

504. PROMETHEUS.
505. I judge thee not; for thou art more than man;
506. Thou art descended from Titanic race,
507. And hast a Titan's strength, and faculties
508. That make thee godlike; and thou sittest here
509. Like Heracles spinning Omphale's flax,
510. And beaten with her sandals.

511. EPIMETHEUS.
512. O my brother!
513. Thou drivest me to madness with thy taunts.

514. PROMETHEUS.
515. And me thou drivest to madness with thy follies.
516. Come with me to my tower on Caucasus:
517. See there my forges in the roaring caverns,
518. Beneficent to man, and taste the joy
519. That springs from labor. Read with me the stars,
520. And learn the virtues that lie hidden in plants,
521. And all things that are useful.

522. EPIMETHEUS.
523. O my brother!
524. I am not as thou art. Thou dost inherit
525. Our father's strength, and I our mother's weakness:
526. The softness of the Oceanides,
527. The yielding nature that cannot resist.

528. PROMETHEUS.
529. Because thou wilt not.

530. EPIMETHEUS.
531. Nay; because I cannot.

532. PROMETHEUS.
533. Assert thyself; rise up to thy full height;
534. Shake from thy soul these dreams effeminate,
535. These passions born of indolence and ease.
536. Resolve, and thou art free. But breathe the air
537. Of mountains, and their unapproachable summits
538. Will lift thee to the level of themselves.

539. EPIMETHEUS.
540. The roar of forests and of waterfalls,
541. The rushing of a mighty wind, with loud
542. And undistinguishable voices calling,
543. Are in my ear!

544. PROMETHEUS.
545. O, listen and obey.

546. EPIMETHEUS.
547. Thou leadest me as a child, I follow thee.

548. (They go out.)

549. CHORUS OF OREADES.
550. Centuries old are the monntains;
551. Their foreheads wrinkled and rifted
552. Helios crowns by day,
553. Pallid Selene by night;
554. From their bosoms uptossed
555. The snows are driven and drifted,
556. Like Tithonus' beard
557. Streaming dishevelled and white.

558. Thunder and tempest of wind
559. Their trumpets blow in the vastness;
560. Phantoms of mist and rain,
561. Cloud and the shadow of cloud,
562. Pass and repass by the gates
563. Of their inaccessible fastness;
564. Ever unmoved they stand,
565. Solemn, eternal, and proud,

566. VOICES OF THE WATERS.
567. Flooded by rain and snow
568. In their inexhaustible sources,
569. Swollen by affluent streams
570. Hurrying onward and hurled
571. Headlong over the crags,
572. The impetuous water-courses,
573. Rush and roar and plunge
574. Down to the nethermost world.

575. Say, have the solid rocks
576. Into streams of silver been melted,
577. Flowing over the plains,
578. Spreading to lakes in the fields?
579. Or have the mountains, the giants,
580. The ice-helmed, the forest-belted,
581. Scattered their arms abroad;
582. Flung in the meadows their shields?

583. VOICES OF THE WINDS.
584. High on their turreted cliffs
585. That bolts of thunder have shattered,
586. Storm-winds muster and blow
587. Trumpets of terrible breath;
588. Then from the gateways rush,
589. And before them routed and scattered
590. Sullen the cloud-rack flies,
591. Pale with the pallor of death.

592. Onward the hurricane rides,
593. And flee for shelter the shepherds;
594. White are the frightened leaves,
595. Harvests with terror are white;
596. Panic seizes the herds,
597. And even the lions and leopards,
598. Prowling no longer for prey,
599. Crouch in their caverns with fright.

600. VOICES OF THE FOREST.
601. Guarding the mountains around
602. Majestic the forests are standing,
603. Bright are their crested helms,
604. Dark is their armor of leaves;
605. Filled with the breath of freedom
606. Each bosom subsiding, expanding,
607. Now like the ocean sinks,
608. Now like the ocean upheaves.

609. Planted firm on the rock,
610. With foreheads stern and defiant,
611. Loud they shout to the winds,
612. Loud to the tempest they call;
613. Naught but Olympian thunders,
614. That blasted Titan and Giant,
615. Them can uproot and o'erthrow,
616. Shaking the earth with their fall.

617. CHORUS OF OREADES.
618. These are the Voices Three
619. Of winds and forests and fountains,
620. Voices of earth and of air,
621. Murmur and rushing of streams,
622. Making together one sound,
623. The mysterious voice of the mountains,
624. Waking the sluggard that sleeps,
625. Waking the dreamer of dreams.

626. These are the Voices Three,
627. That speak of endless endeavor,
628. Speak of endurance and strength,
629. Triumph and fulness of fame,
630. Sounding about the world,
631. An inspiration forever,
632. Stirring the hearts of men,
633. Shaping their end and their aim.

634. VII.

635. THE HOUSE OF EPIMETHEUS

636. PANDORA.
637. Left to myself I wander as I will,
638. And as my fancy leads me, through this house,
639. Nor could I ask a dwelling more complete
640. Were I indeed the Goddess that he deems me.
641. No mansion of Olympus, framed to be
642. The habitation of the Immortal Gods,
643. Can be more beautiful. And this is mine
644. And more than this, the love wherewith he crowns me.
645. As if impelled by powers invisible
646. And irresistible, my steps return
647. Unto this spacious hall. All corridors
648. And passages lead hither, and all doors
649. But open into it. Yon mysterious chest
650. Attracts and fascinates me. Would I knew
651. What there lies hidden! But the oracle
652. Forbids. Ah me! The secret then is safe.
653. So would it be if it were in my keeping.
654. A crowd of shadowy faces from the mirrors
655. That line these walls are watching me. I dare not
656. Lift up the lid. A hundred times the act
657. Would be repeated, and the secret seen
658. By twice a hundred incorporeal eyes.

659. (She walks to the other side of the hall.)

660. My feet are weary, wandering to and fro,
661. My eyes with seeing and my heart with waiting.
662. I will lie here and rest till he returns,
663. Who is my dawn, my day, my Helios.

664. (Throws herself upon a couch, and falls asleep.)

665. ZEPHYRUS.
666. Come from thy caverns dark and deep.
667. O son of Erebus and Night;
668. All sense of hearing and of sight
669. Enfold in the serene delight
670. And quietude of sleep!

671. Set all the silent sentinels
672. To bar and guard the Ivory Gate,
673. And keep the evil dreams of fate
674. And falsehood and infernal hate
675. Imprisoned in their cells.

676. But open wide the Gate of Horn,
677. Whence, beautiful as planets, rise
678. The dreams of truth, with starry eyes,
679. And all the wondrous prophecies
680. And visions of the morn.

681. CHORUS OF DREAMS FROM THE IVORY GATE.
682. Ye sentinels of sleep,
683. It is in vain ye keep
684. Your drowsy watch before the Ivory Gate;
685. Though closed the portal seems,
686. The airy feet of dreams
687. Ye cannot thus in walls incarcerate.

688. We phantoms are and dreams
689. Born by Tartarean streams,
690. As ministers of the infernal powers;
691. O son of Erebus
692. And Night, behold! we thus
693. Elude your watchful warders on the towers!

694. From gloomy Tartarus
695. The Fates have summoned us
696. To whisper in her ear, who lies asleep,
697. A tale to fan the fire
698. Of her insane desire
699. To know a secret that the Gods would keep.

700. This passion, in their ire,
701. The Gods themselves inspire,
702. To vex mankind with evils manifold,
703. So that disease and pain
704. O'er the whole earth may reign,
705. And nevermore return the Age of Gold.

706. PANDORA (waking).
707. A voice said in my sleep: 'Do not delay:
708. Do not delay; the golden moments fly!
709. The oracle hath forbidden; yet not thee
710. Doth it forbid, but Epimetheus only!'
711. I am alone. These faces in the mirrors
712. Are but the shadows and phantoms of myself;
713. They cannot help nor hinder. No one sees me,
714. Save the all-seeing Gods, who, knowing good
715. And knowing evil, have created me
716. Such as I am, and filled me with desire
717. Of knowing good and evil like themselves.

718. (She approaches the chest.)

719. I hesitate no longer. Weal or woe,
720. Or life or death, the moment shall decide.

721. (She lifts the lid. A dense mist rises from
722. the chest, and fills the room. PANDORA
723. falls senseless on the floor. Storm without.)

724. CHORUS OF DREAMS FROM THE GATE OF HORN.
725. Yes, the moment shall decide!
726. It already hath decided;
727. And the secret once confided
728. To the keeping of the Titan
729. Now is flying far and wide,
730. Whispered, told on every side,
731. To disquiet and to frighten.

732. Fever of the heart and brain,
733. Sorrow, pestilence, and pain,
734. Moans of anguish, maniac laughter,
735. All the evils that hereafter
736. Shall afflict and vex mankind,
737. All into the air have risen
738. From the chambers of their prison;
739. Only Hope remains behind.

740. VIII.

741. IN THE GARDEN

742. EPIMETHEUS.
743. The storm is past, but it hath left behind it
744. Ruin and desolation. All the walks
745. Are strewn with shattered boughs; the birds are silent;
746. The flowers, downtrodden by the wind, lie dead;
747. The swollen rivulet sobs with secret pain,
748. The melancholy reeds whisper together
749. As if some dreadful deed had been committed
750. They dare not name, and all the air is heavy
751. With an unspoken sorrow! Premonitions,
752. Foreshadowings of some terrible disaster
753. Oppress my heart. Ye Gods, avert the omen!

754. PANDORA (coming from the house).
755. O Epimetheus, I no longer dare
756. To lift mine eyes to thine, nor hear thy voice,
757. Being no longer worthy of thy love.

758. EPIMETHEUS.
759. What hast thou done?

760. PANDORA.
761. Forgive me not, but kill me.

762. EPIMETHEUS.
763. What hast thou done?

764. PANDORA.
765. I pray for death, not pardon.

766. EPIMETHEUS.
767. What hast thou done?

768. PANDORA.
769. I dare not speak of it.

770. EPIMETHEUS.
771. Thy pallor and thy silence terrify me!

772. PANDORA.
773. I have brought wrath and ruin on thy house!
774. My heart hath braved the oracle that guarded
775. The fatal secret from us, and my hand
776. Lifted the lid of the mysterious chest!

777. EPIMETHEUS.
778. Then all is lost! I am indeed undone.

779. PANDORA.
780. I pray for punishment, and not for pardon.

781. EPIMETHEUS.
782. Mine is the fault not thine. On me shall fall
783. The vengeance of the Gods, for I betrayed
784. Their secret when, in evil hour, I said
785. It was a secret; when, in evil hour,
786. I left thee here alone to this temptation.
787. Why did I leave thee?

788. PANDORA.
789. Why didst thou return?
790. Eternal absence would have been to me
791. The greatest punishment. To be left alone
792. And face to face with my own crime, had been
793. Just retribution. Upon me, ye Gods,
794. Let all your vengeance fall!

795. EPIMETHEUS.
796. On thee and me.
797. I do not love thee less for what is done,
798. And cannot be undone. Thy very weakness
799. Hath brought thee nearer to me, and henceforth
800. My love will have a sense of pity in it,
801. Making it less a worship than before.

802. PANDORA.
803. Pity me not; pity is degradation.
804. Love me and kill me.

805. EPIMETHEUS.
806. Beautiful Pandora!
807. Thou art a Goddess still!

808. PANDORA.
809. I am a woman;
810. And the insurgent demon in my nature,
811. That made me brave the oracle, revolts
812. At pity and compassion. Let me die;
813. What else remains for me?

814. EPIMETHEUS.
815. Youth, hope, and love:
816. To build a new life on a ruined life,
817. To make the future fairer than the past,
818. And make the past appear a troubled dream.
819. Even now in passing through the garden walks
820. Upon the ground I saw a fallen nest
821. Ruined and full of rain; and over me
822. Beheld the uncomplaining birds already
823. Busy in building a new habitation.

824. PANDORA.
825. Auspicious omen!

826. EPIMETHEUS.
827. May the Eumenides
828. Put out their torches and behold us not,
829. And fling away their whips of scorpions
830. And touch us not.

831. PANDORA.
832. Me let them punish.
833. Only through punishment of our evil deeds,
834. Only through suffering, are we reconciled
835. To the immortal Gods and to ourselves.

836. CHORUS OF THE EUMENIDES.
837. Never shall souls like these
838. Escape the Eumenides,
839. The daughters dark of Acheron and Night!
840. Unquenched our torches glare,
841. Our scourges in the air
842. Send forth prophetic sounds before they smite.

843. Never by lapse of time
844. The soul defaced by crime
845. Into its former self returns again;
846. For every guilty deed
847. Holds in itself the seed
848. Of retribution and undying pain.

849. Never shall be the loss
850. Restored, till Helios
851. Hath purified them with his heavenly fires;
852. Then what was lost is won,
853. And the new life begun,
854. Kindled with nobler passions and desires.
