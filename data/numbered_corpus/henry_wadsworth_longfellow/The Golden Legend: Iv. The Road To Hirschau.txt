1. PRINCE HENRY _and_ ELSIE, _with their attendants, on
2. horseback._

3. _Elsie._ Onward and onward the highway runs
4. to the distant city, impatiently bearing
5. Tidings of human joy and disaster, of love and of
6. hate, of doing and daring!

7. _Prince Henry._ This life of ours is a wild aeolian
8. harp of many a joyous strain,
9. But under them all there runs a loud perpetual wail,
10. as of souls in pain.

11. _Elsie._ Faith alone can interpret life, and the heart
12. that aches and bleeds with the stigma
13. Of pain, alone bears the likeness of Christ, and can
14. comprehend its dark enigma.

15. _Prince Henry._ Man is selfish, and seeketh pleasure
16. with little care of what may betide;
17. Else why am I travelling here beside thee, a demon
18. that rides by an angel's side?

19. _Elsie._ All the hedges are white with dust, and
20. the great dog under the creaking wain
21. Hangs his head in the lazy heat, while onward the
22. horses toil and strain

23. _Prince Henry._ Now they stop at the wayside inn,
24. and the wagoner laughs with the landlord's daughter,
25. While out of the dripping trough the horses distend
26. their leathern sides with water.

27. _Elsie._ All through life there are wayside inns,
28. where man may refresh his soul with love;
29. Even the lowest may quench his thirst at rivulets fed
30. by springs from above.

31. _Prince Henry._ Yonder, where rises the cross of
32. stone, our journey along the highway ends,
33. And over the fields, by a bridle path, down into the
34. broad green valley descends.

35. _Elsie._ I am not sorry to leave behind the beaten
36. road with its dust and heat;
37. The air will be sweeter far, and the turf will be softer
38. under our horses' feet.

39. (_They turn down a green lane._)

40. _Elsie._ Sweet is the air with the budding haws,
41. and the valley stretching for miles below
42. Is white with blossoming cheery trees, as if just covered
43. with lightest snow.

44. _Prince Henry._ Over our heads a white cascade is
45. gleaming against the distant hill;
46. We cannot hear it, nor see it move, but it hangs like
47. a banner when winds are still.

48. _Elsie._ Damp and cool is this deep ravine, and
49. cool the sound of the brook by our side!
50. What is this castle that rises above us, and lords it
51. over a land so wide?

52. _Prince Henry._ It is the home of the Counts of
53. Calva; well have I known these scenes of old,
54. Well I remember each tower and turret, remember the
55. brooklet, the wood, and the wold.

56. _Elsie._ Hark! from the little village below us the
57. bells of the church are ringing for rain!
58. Priests and peasants in long procession come forth
59. and kneel on the arid plain.

60. _Prince Henry._ They have not long to wait, for I
61. see in the south uprising a little cloud,
62. That before the sun shall be set will cover the sky
63. above us as with a shroud.

64. (_They pass on._)

65. * * * * *

66. THE CONVENT OF HIRSCHAU IN THE BLACK FOREST.

67. * * * * *

68. _The Convent cellar._ FRIAR CLAUS _comes in with a
69. light and a basket of empty flagons._

70. _Friar Claus._ I always enter this sacred place
71. With a thoughtful, solemn, and reverent pace,
72. Pausing long enough on each stair
73. To breathe an ejaculatory prayer,
74. And a benediction on the vines
75. That produce these various sorts of wines!

76. For my part, I am well content
77. That we have got through with the tedious Lent!
78. Fasting is all very well for those
79. Who have to contend with invisible foes;
80. But I am quite sure it does not agree
81. With a quiet, peaceable man like me,
82. Who am not of that nervous and meagre kind
83. That are always distressed in body and mind!
84. And at times it really does me good
85. To come down among this brotherhood,
86. Dwelling forever under ground,
87. Silent, contemplative, round and sound;
88. Each one old, and brown with mould,
89. But filled to the lips with the ardor of youth,
90. With the latent power and love of truth,
91. And with virtues fervent and manifold.

92. I have heard it said, that at Easter-tide,
93. When buds are swelling on every side,
94. And the sap begins to move in the vine.
95. Then in all the cellars, far and wide,
96. The oldest, as well as the newest, wine
97. Begins to stir itself, and ferment,
98. With a kind of revolt and discontent
99. At being so long in darkness pent,
100. And fain would burst from its sombre tun
101. To bask on the hillside in the sun;
102. As in the bosom of us poor friars,
103. The tumult of half-subdued desires
104. For the world that we have left behind
105. Disturbs at times all peace of mind!
106. And now that we have lived through Lent,
107. My duty it is, as often before,
108. To open awhile the prison-door,
109. And give these restless spirits vent.

110. Now here is a cask that stands alone,
111. And has stood a hundred years or more,
112. Its beard of cobwebs, long and hoar,
113. Trailing and sweeping along the floor,
114. Like Barbarossa, who sits in his cave,
115. Taciturn, sombre, sedate, and grave,
116. Till his beard has grown through the table of stone!
117. It is of the quick and not of the dead!
118. In its veins the blood is hot and red,
119. And a heart still beats in those ribs of oak
120. That time may have tamed, but has not broke;
121. It comes from Bacharach on the Rhine,
122. Is one of the three best kinds of wine,
123. And costs some hundred florins the ohm;
124. But that I do not consider dear,
125. When I remember that every year
126. Four butts are sent to the Pope of Rome.
127. And whenever a goblet thereof I drain,
128. The old rhyme keeps running in my brain:

129. At Bacharach on the Rhine,
130. At Hochheim on the Main,
131. And at Wuerzburg on the Stein,
132. Grow the three best kinds of wine!

133. They are all good wines, and better far
134. Than those of the Neckar, or those of the Ahr
135. In particular, Wuerzburg well may boast
136. Of its blessed wine of the Holy Ghost,
137. Which of all wines I like the most.
138. This I shall draw for the Abbot's drinking,
139. Who seems to be much of my way of thinking.

140. (_Fills a flagon._)

141. Ah! how the streamlet laughs and sings!
142. What a delicious fragrance springs
143. From the deep flagon, while it fills,
144. As of hyacinths and daffodils!
145. Between this cask and the Abbot's lips
146. Many have been the sips and slips;
147. Many have been the draughts of wine,
148. On their way to his, that have stopped at mine;
149. And many a time my soul has hankered
150. For a deep draught out of his silver tankard,
151. When it should have been busy with other affairs,
152. Less with its longings and more with its prayers.
153. But now there is no such awkward condition,
154. No danger of death and eternal perdition;
155. So here's to the Abbot and Brothers all,
156. Who dwell in this convent of Peter and Paul!

157. (_He drinks._)

158. O cordial delicious! O soother of pain!
159. It flashes like sunshine into my brain!
160. A benison rest on the Bishop who sends
161. Such a fudder of wine as this to his friends!

162. And now a flagon for such as may ask
163. A draught from the noble Bacharach cask,
164. And I will be gone, though I know full well
165. The cellar's a cheerfuller place than the cell.
166. Behold where he stands, all sound and good,
167. Brown and old in his oaken hood;
168. Silent he seems externally
169. As any Carthusian monk may be;
170. But within, what a spirit of deep unrest!
171. What a seething and simmering in his breast!
172. As if the heaving of his great heart
173. Would burst his belt of oak apart!
174. Let me unloose this button of wood,
175. And quiet a little his turbulent mood.

176. (_Sets it running._)

177. See! how its currents gleam and shine,
178. As if they had caught the purple hues
179. Of autumn sunsets on the Rhine,
180. Descending and mingling with the dews;
181. Or as if the grapes were stained with the blood
182. Of the innocent boy, who, some years back,
183. Was taken and crucified by the Jews,
184. In that ancient town of Bacharach;
185. Perdition upon those infidel Jews,
186. In that ancient town of Bacharach!
187. The beautiful town, that gives us wine
188. With the fragrant odor of Muscadine!
189. I should deem it wrong to let this pass
190. Without first touching my lips to the glass,
191. For here in the midst of the current I stand,
192. Like the stone Pfalz in the midst of the river
193. Taking toll upon either hand,
194. And much more grateful to the giver.

195. (_He drinks._)

196. Here, now, is a very inferior kind,
197. Such as in any town you may find,
198. Such as one might imagine would suit
199. The rascal who drank wine out of a boot,
200. And, after all, it was not a crime,
201. For he won thereby Dorf Hueffelsheim.
202. A jolly old toper! who at a pull
203. Could drink a postilion's jack boot full,
204. And ask with a laugh, when that was done,
205. If the fellow had left the other one!
206. This wine is as good as we can afford
207. To the friars, who sit at the lower board,
208. And cannot distinguish bad from good,
209. And are far better off than if they could,
210. Being rather the rude disciples of beer
211. Than of anything more refined and dear!

212. (_Fills the other flagon and departs._)

213. * * * * *

214. THE SCRIPTORIUM.

215. FRIAR PACIFICUS _transcribing and illuminating._

216. _Friar Pacificus_ It is growing dark! Yet one line more,
217. And then my work for today is o'er.
218. I come again to the name of the Lord!
219. Ere I that awful name record,
220. That is spoken so lightly among men,
221. Let me pause awhile, and wash my pen;
222. Pure from blemish and blot must it be
223. When it writes that word of mystery!

224. Thus have I labored on and on,
225. Nearly through the Gospel of John.
226. Can it be that from the lips
227. Of this same gentle Evangelist,
228. That Christ himself perhaps has kissed,
229. Came the dread Apocalypse!
230. It has a very awful look,
231. As it stands there at the end of the book,
232. Like the sun in an eclipse.
233. Ah me! when I think of that vision divine,
234. Think of writing it, line by line,
235. I stand in awe of the terrible curse,
236. Like the trump of doom, in the closing verse!
237. God forgive me! if ever I
238. Take aught from the book of that Prophecy,
239. Lest my part too should be taken away
240. From the Book of Life on the Judgment Day.

241. This is well written, though I say it!
242. I should not be afraid to display it,
243. In open day, on the selfsame shelf
244. With the writings of St Thecla herself,
245. Or of Theodosius, who of old
246. Wrote the Gospels in letters of gold!
247. That goodly folio standing yonder,
248. Without a single blot or blunder,
249. Would not bear away the palm from mine,
250. If we should compare them line for line.

251. There, now, is an initial letter!
252. King Rene himself never made a better!
253. Finished down to the leaf and the snail,
254. Down to the eyes on the peacock's tail!
255. And now, as I turn the volume over,
256. And see what lies between cover and cover,
257. What treasures of art these pages hold,
258. All ablaze with crimson and gold,
259. God forgive me! I seem to feel
260. A certain satisfaction steal
261. Into my heart, and into my brain,
262. As if my talent had not lain
263. Wrapped in a napkin, and all in vain.
264. Yes, I might almost say to the Lord,
265. Here is a copy of thy Word,
266. Written out with much toil and pain;
267. Take it, O Lord, and let it be
268. As something I have done for thee!

269. (_He looks from the window._)

270. How sweet the air is! How fair the scene!
271. I wish I had as lovely a green
272. To paint my landscapes and my leaves!
273. How the swallows twitter under the eaves!
274. There, now, there is one in her nest;
275. I can just catch a glimpse of her head and breast,
276. And will sketch her thus, in her quiet nook,
277. In the margin of my Gospel book.

278. (_He makes a sketch._)

279. I can see no more. Through the valley yonder
280. A shower is passing; I hear the thunder
281. Mutter its curses in the air,
282. The Devil's own and only prayer!
283. The dusty road is brown with rain,
284. And speeding on with might and main,
285. Hitherward rides a gallant train.
286. They do not parley, they cannot wait,
287. But hurry in at the convent gate.
288. What a fair lady! and beside her
289. What a handsome, graceful, noble rider!
290. Now she gives him her hand to alight;
291. They will beg a shelter for the night.
292. I will go down to the corridor,
293. And try to see that face once more;
294. It will do for the face of some beautiful Saint,
295. Or for one of the Maries I shall paint.

296. (_Goes out._)

297. * * * * *

298. THE CLOISTERS.

299. * * * * *

300. _The_ ABBOT ERNESTUS _pacing to and fro._

301. _Abbot._ Slowly, slowly up the wall
302. Steals the sunshine, steals the shade;
303. Evening damps begin to fall,
304. Evening shadows are displayed.
305. Round me, o'er me, everywhere,
306. All the sky is grand with clouds,
307. And athwart the evening air
308. Wheel the swallows home in crowds.
309. Shafts of sunshine from the west
310. Paint the dusky windows red;
311. Darker shadows, deeper rest,
312. Underneath and overhead.
313. Darker, darker, and more wan,
314. In my breast the shadows fall;
315. Upward steals the life of man,
316. As the sunshine from the wall.
317. From the wall into the sky,
318. From the roof along the spire;
319. Ah, the souls of those that die
320. Are but sunbeams lifted higher.

321. (_Enter_ PRINCE HENRY.)

322. _Prince Henry._ Christ is arisen!

323. _Abbot._ Amen! he is arisen!
324. His peace be with you!

325. _Prince Henry._ Here it reigns forever!
326. The peace of God, that passeth understanding,
327. Reigns in these cloisters and these corridors,
328. Are you Ernestus, Abbot of the convent?

329. _Abbot._ I am.

330. _Prince Henry._ And I Prince Henry of Hoheneck,
331. Who crave your hospitality to-night.

332. _Abbot._ You are thrice welcome to our humble walls.
333. You do us honor; and we shall requite it,
334. I fear, but poorly, entertaining you
335. With Paschal eggs, and our poor convent wine,
336. The remnants of our Easter holidays.

337. _Prince Henry._ How fares it with the holy monks of Hirschau?
338. Are all things well with them?

339. _Abbot._ All things are well.

340. _Prince Henry._ A noble convent! I have known it long
341. By the report of travellers. I now see
342. Their commendations lag behind the truth.
343. You lie here in the valley of the Nagold
344. As in a nest: and the still river, gliding
345. Along its bed, is like an admonition
346. How all things pass. Your lands are rich and ample,
347. And your revenues large. God's benediction
348. Rests on your convent.

349. _Abbot._ By our charities
350. We strive to merit it. Our Lord and Master,
351. When he departed, left us in his will,
352. As our best legacy on earth, the poor!
353. These we have always with us; had we not,
354. Our hearts would grow as hard as are these stones.

355. _Prince Henry._ If I remember right, the Counts of Calva
356. Founded your convent.

357. _Abbot._ Even as you say.

358. _Prince Henry._ And, if I err not, it is very old.

359. _Abbot._ Within these cloisters lie already buried
360. Twelve holy Abbots. Underneath the flags
361. On which we stand, the Abbot William lies,
362. Of blessed memory.

363. _Prince Henry._ And whose tomb is that,
364. Which bears the brass escutcheon?

365. _Abbot._ A benefactor's.
366. Conrad, a Count of Calva, he who stood
367. Godfather to our bells.

368. _Prince Henry._ Your monks are learned
369. And holy men, I trust.

370. _Abbot._ There are among them
371. Learned and holy men. Yet in this age
372. We need another Hildebrand, to shake
373. And purify us like a mighty wind.
374. The world is wicked, and sometimes I wonder
375. God does not lose his patience with it wholly,
376. And shatter it like glass! Even here, at times,
377. Within these walls, where all should be at peace,
378. I have my trials. Time has laid his hand
379. Upon my heart, gently, not smiting it,
380. But as a harper lays his open palm
381. Upon his harp, to deaden its vibrations.
382. Ashes are on my head, and on my lips
383. Sackcloth, and in my breast a heaviness
384. And weariness of life, that makes me ready
385. To say to the dead Abbots under us,
386. 'Make room for me!' Only I see the dusk
387. Of evening twilight coming, and have not
388. Completed half my task; and so at times
389. The thought of my shortcomings in this life
390. Falls like a shadow on the life to come.

391. _Prince Henry._ We must all die, and not the old alone;
392. The young have no exemption from that doom.

393. _Abbot._ Ah, yes! the young may die, but the old must!
394. That is the difference.

395. _Prince Henry._ I have heard much laud
396. Of your transcribers. Your Scriptorium
397. Is famous among all, your manuscripts
398. Praised for their beauty and their excellence.

399. _Abbot._ That is indeed our boast. If you desire it,
400. You shall behold these treasures. And meanwhile
401. Shall the Refectorarius bestow
402. Your horses and attendants for the night.

403. (_They go in. The Vesper-bell rings._)

404. * * * * *

405. THE CHAPEL.

406. * * * * *

407. _Vespers; after which the monks retire, a chorister
408. leading an old monk who is blind_.

409. _Prince Henry._ They are all gone, save one who lingers,
410. Absorbed in deep and silent prayer.
411. As if his heart could find no rest,
412. At times he beats his heaving breast
413. With clenched and convulsive fingers,
414. Then lifts them trembling in the air.
415. A chorister, with golden hair,
416. Guides hitherward his heavy pace.
417. Can it be so? Or does my sight
418. Deceive me in the uncertain light?
419. Ah no! I recognize that face,
420. Though Time has touched it in his flight,
421. And changed the auburn hair to white.
422. It is Count Hugo of the Rhine,
423. The deadliest foe of all our race,
424. And hateful unto me and mine!

425. _The Blind Monk_. Who is it that doth stand so near
426. His whispered words I almost hear?

427. _Prince Henry_. I am Prince Henry of Hoheneck,
428. And you, Count Hugo of the Rhine!
429. I know you, and I see the scar,
430. The brand upon your forehead, shine
431. And redden like a baleful star!

432. _The Blind Monk_. Count Hugo once, but now the wreck
433. Of what I was. O Hoheneck!
434. The passionate will, the pride, the wrath
435. That bore me headlong on my path,
436. Stumbled and staggered into fear,
437. And failed me in my mad career,
438. As a tired steed some evil-doer,
439. Alone upon a desolate moor,
440. Bewildered, lost, deserted, blind,
441. And hearing loud and close behind
442. The o'ertaking steps of his pursuer.
443. Then suddenly, from the dark there came
444. A voice that called me by my name,
445. And said to me, 'Kneel down and pray!'
446. And so my terror passed away,
447. Passed utterly away forever.
448. Contrition, penitence, remorse,
449. Came on me, with o'erwhelming force;
450. A hope, a longing, an endeavor,
451. By days of penance and nights of prayer,
452. To frustrate and defeat despair!
453. Calm, deep, and still is now my heart.
454. With tranquil waters overflowed;
455. A lake whose unseen fountains start,
456. Where once the hot volcano glowed.
457. And you, O Prince of Hoheneck!
458. Have known me in that earlier time,
459. A man of violence and crime,
460. Whose passions brooked no curb nor check.
461. Behold me now, in gentler mood,
462. One of this holy brotherhood.
463. Give me your hand; here let me kneel;
464. Make your reproaches sharp as steel;
465. Spurn me, and smite me on each cheek;
466. No violence can harm the meek,
467. There is no wound Christ cannot heal!
468. Yes; lift your princely hand, and take
469. Revenge, if 't is revenge you seek,
470. Then pardon me, for Jesus' sake!

471. _Prince Henry._ Arise, Count Hugo! let there be
472. No farther strife nor enmity
473. Between us twain; we both have erred!
474. Too rash in act, too wroth in word,
475. From the beginning have we stood
476. In fierce, defiant attitude,
477. Each thoughtless of the other's right,
478. And each reliant on his might.
479. But now our souls are more subdued;
480. The hand of God, and not in vain,
481. Has touched us with the fire of pain.
482. Let us kneel down, and side by side
483. Pray, till our souls are purified,
484. And pardon will not be denied!

485. (_They kneel._)

487. THE REFECTORY.

488. * * * * *

489. _Gaudiolum of Monks at midnight. LUCIFER disguised
490. as a Friar._

491. _Friar Paul (sings)._ Ave! color vini clari,
492. Dulcis potus, non aman,
493. Tua nos inebriari
494. Digneris potentia!

495. _Friar Cuthbert._ Not so much noise, my worthy freres,
496. You'll disturb the Abbot at his prayers.

497. _Friar Paul (sings)._ O! quam placens in colore!
498. O! quam fragrans in odore!
499. O! quam sapidum in ore!
500. Dulce linguse vinculum!

501. _Friar Cuthbert._ I should think your tongue had
502. broken its chain!

503. _Friar Paul (sings)._ Felix venter quern intrabis!
504. Felix guttur quod rigabis!
505. Felix os quod tu lavabis!
506. Et beata labia!

507. _Friar Cuthbert._ Peace! I say, peace!
508. Will you never cease!
509. You will rouse up the Abbot, I tell you again!

510. _Friar John._ No danger! to-night he will let us alone,
511. As I happen to know he has guests of his own.

512. _Friar Cuthbert._ Who are they?

513. _Friar John._ A German Prince and his train,
514. Who arrived here just before the rain.
515. There is with him a damsel fair to see,
516. As slender and graceful as a reed!
517. When she alighted from her steed,
518. It seemed like a blossom blown from a tree.

519. _Friar Cuthbert._ None of your pale-faced girls for me!

520. (_Kisses the girl at his side_.)

521. _Friar John._ Come, old fellow, drink down to your peg!
522. do not drink any farther, I beg!

523. _Friar Paul (sings)._ In the days of gold,
524. The days of old,
525. Cross of wood
526. And bishop of gold!

527. _Friar Cuthbert (to the girl)._ What an infernal racket and din!
528. No need not blush so, that's no sin.
529. You look very holy in this disguise,
530. Though there's something wicked in your eyes!

531. _Friar Paul (continues.)_ Now we have changed
532. That law so good,
533. To cross of gold
534. And bishop of wood!

535. _Friar Cuthbert._ I like your sweet face under a hood.
536. Sister! how came you into this way?

537. _Girl._ It was you, Friar Cuthbert, who led me astray.
538. Have you forgotten that day in June,
539. When the church was so cool in the afternoon,
540. And I came in to confess my sins?
541. That is where my ruin begins.

542. _Friar John._ What is the name of yonder friar,
543. With an eye that glows like a coal of fire,
544. And such a black mass of tangled hair?

545. _Friar Paul._ He who is sitting there,
546. With a rollicking,
547. Devil may care,
548. Free and easy look and air,
549. As if he were used to such feasting and frollicking?

550. _Friar John._ The same.

551. _Friar Paul._ He's a stranger. You had better ask his name,
552. And where he is going, and whence he came.

553. _Friar John._ Hallo! Sir Friar!

554. _Friar Paul._ You must raise your voice a little higher,
555. He does not seem to hear what you say.
556. Now, try again! He is looking this way.

557. _Friar John._ Hallo! Sir Friar,
558. We wish to inquire
559. Whence you came, and where you are going,
560. And anything else that is worth the knowing.
561. So be so good as to open your head.

562. _Lucifer._ I am a Frenchman born and bred,
563. Going on a pilgrimage to Rome.
564. My home
565. Is the convent of St. Gildas de Rhuys,
566. Of which, very like, you never have heard.

567. _Monks._ Never a word!

568. _Lucifer._ You must know, then, it is in the diocese
569. Called the Diocese of Vannes,
570. In the province of Brittany.
571. From the gray rocks of Morbihan
572. It overlooks the angry sea;
573. The very seashore where,
574. In his great despair,
575. Abbot Abelard walked to and fro,
576. Filling the night with woe,
577. And wailing aloud to the merciless seas
578. The name of his sweet Heloise!
579. Whilst overhead
580. The convent windows gleamed as red
581. As the fiery eyes of the monks within,
582. Who with jovial din
583. Gave themselves up to all kinds of sin!
584. Ha! that is a convent! that is an abbey!
585. Over the doors,
586. None of your death-heads carved in wood,
587. None of your Saints looking pious and good,
588. None of your Patriarchs old and shabby!
589. But the heads and tusks of boars,
590. And the cells
591. Hung all round with the fells
592. of the fallow-deer,
593. And then what cheer!
594. What jolly, fat friars,
595. Sitting round the great, roaring fires,
596. Roaring louder than they,
597. With their strong wines,
598. And their concubines,
599. And never a bell,
600. With its swagger and swell,
601. Calling you up with a start of affright
602. In the dead of night,
603. To send you grumbling down dark stairs,
604. To mumble your prayers,
605. But the cheery crow
606. Of cocks in the yard below,
607. After daybreak, an hour or so,
608. And the barking of deep-mouthed hounds,
609. These are the sounds
610. That, instead of bells, salute the ear.
611. And then all day
612. Up and away
613. Through the forest, hunting the deer!
614. Ah, my friends! I'm afraid that here
615. You are a little too pious, a little too tame,
616. And the more is the shame,
617. It is the greatest folly
618. Not to be jolly;
619. That's what I think!
620. Come, drink, drink,
621. Drink, and die game!

622. _Monks,_ And your Abbot What's-his-name?

623. _Lucifer._ Abelard!

624. _Monks._ Did he drink hard?

625. _Lucifer._ O, no! Not he!
626. He was a dry old fellow,
627. Without juice enough to get thoroughly mellow.
628. There he stood,
629. Lowering at us in sullen mood,
630. As if he had come into Brittany
631. Just to reform our brotherhood!

632. (_A roar of laughter_.)

633. But you see
634. It never would do!
635. For some of us knew a thing or two,
636. In the Abbey of St. Gildas de Rhuys!
637. For instance, the great ado
638. With old Fulbert's niece,
639. The young and lovely Heloise!

640. _Friar John._ Stop there, if you please,
641. Till we drink to the fair Heloise.

642. _All (drinking and shouting)._ Heloise! Heloise!

643. (_The Chapel-bell tolls_.)

644. _Lucifer (starting)._ What is that bell for? Are you such asses
645. As to keep up the fashion of midnight masses?

646. _Friar Cuthbert._ It is only a poor, unfortunate brother,
647. Who is gifted with most miraculous powers
648. Of getting up at all sorts of hours,
649. And, by way of penance and Christian meekness,
650. Of creeping silently out of his cell
651. To take a pull at that hideous bell;
652. So that all the monks who are lying awake
653. May murmur some kind of prayer for his sake,
654. And adapted to his peculiar weakness!

655. _Friar John._ From frailty and fall--

656. _All._ Good Lord, deliver us all!

657. _Friar Cuthbert._ And before the bell for matins sounds,
658. He takes his lantern, and goes the rounds,
659. Flashing it into our sleepy eyes,
660. Merely to say it is time to arise.
661. But enough of that. Go on, if you please,
662. With your story about St. Gildas de Rhuys.

663. _Lucifer._ Well, it finally came to pass
664. That, half in fun and half in malice,
665. One Sunday at Mass
666. We put some poison into the chalice.
667. But, either by accident or design,
668. Peter Abelard kept away
669. From the chapel that day,
670. And a poor, young friar, who in his stead
671. Drank the sacramental wine,
672. Fell on the steps of the altar, dead!
673. But look! do you see at the window there
674. That face, with a look of grief and despair,
675. That ghastly face, as of one in pain?

676. _Monks._ Who? where?

677. _Lucifer._ As I spoke, it vanished away again.

678. _Friar Cuthbert._ It is that nefarious
679. Siebald the Refectorarius.
680. That fellow is always playing the scout,
681. Creeping and peeping and prowling about;
682. And then he regales
683. The Abbot with Scandalous tales.

684. _Lucifer_. A spy in the convent? One of the brothers
685. Telling scandalous tales of the others?
686. Out upon him, the lazy loon!
687. I would put a stop to that pretty soon,
688. In a way he should rue it.

689. _Monks_. How shall we do it?

690. _Lucifer_. Do you, brother Paul,
691. Creep under the window, close to the wall,
692. And open it suddenly when I call.
693. Then seize the villain by the hair,
694. And hold him there,
695. And punish him soundly, once for all.

696. _Friar Cuthbert_. As St. Dustan of old,
697. We are told,
698. Once caught the Devil by the nose!

699. _Lucifer_. Ha! ha! that story is very clever,
700. But has no foundation whatsoever.
701. Quick! for I see his face again
702. Glaring in at the window pane;
703. Now! now! and do not spare your blows.

704. (FRIAR PAUL _opens the window suddenly, and seizes_
705. SIEBALD. _They beat him._)

706. _Friar Siebald_. Help! help! are you going to slay me?

707. _Friar Paul_. That will teach you again to betray me!

708. _Friar Siebald_. Mercy! mercy!

709. _Friar Paul_ (_shouting and beating_). Rumpas bellorum lorum,
710. Vim confer amorum
711. Morum verorum, rorun.
712. Tu plena polorum!

713. _Lucifer_. Who stands in the doorway yonder,
714. Stretching out his trembling hand,
715. Just as Abelard used to stand,
716. The flash of his keen, black eyes
717. Forerunning the thunder?

718. _The Monks (in confusion)_. The Abbot! the
719. Abbot!

720. _Friar Cuthbert (to the girl)_. Put on your disguise!

721. _Friar Francis_. Hide the great flagon
722. From the eyes of the dragon!

723. _Friar Cuthbert_. Pull the brown hood over your face,
724. Lest you bring me into disgrace!

725. _Abbot_. What means this revel and carouse?
726. Is this a tavern and drinking-house?
727. Are you Christian monks, or heathen devils,
728. To pollute this convent with your revels?
729. Were Peter Damian still upon earth,
730. To be shocked by such ungodly mirth,
731. He would write your names, with pen of gall,
732. In his Book of Gomorrah, one and all!
733. Away, you drunkards! to your cells,
734. And pray till you hear the matin-bells;
735. You, Brother Francis, and you, Brother Paul!
736. And as a penance mark each prayer
737. With the scourge upon your shoulders bare;
738. Nothing atones for such a sin
739. But the blood that follows the discipline.
740. And you, Brother Cuthbert, come with me
741. Alone into the sacristy;
742. You, who should be a guide to your brothers,
743. And are ten times worse than all the others,
744. For you I've a draught that has long been brewing
745. You shall do a penance worth the doing!
746. Away to your prayers, then, one and all!
747. I wonder the very, convent wall
748. Does not crumble and crush you in its fall!

749. * * * * *

750. THE NEIGHBORING NUNNERY.

751. * * * * *

752. _The_ ABBESS IRMINGARD _sitting with_ ELSIE _in the
753. moonlight._

754. _Irmingard_ The night is silent, the wind is still,
755. The moon is looking from yonder hill
756. Down upon convent, and grove, and garden;
757. The clouds have passed away from her face,
758. Leaving behind them no sorrowful trace,
759. Only the tender and quiet grace
760. Of one, whose heart had been healed with pardon!

761. And such am I. My soul within
762. Was dark with passion and soiled with sin.
763. But now its wounds are healed again;
764. Gone are the anguish, the terror, and pain;
765. For across that desolate land of woe,
766. O'er whose burning sands I was forced to go,
767. A wind from heaven began to blow;
768. And all my being trembled and shook,
769. As the leaves of the tree, or the grass of the field,
770. And I was healed, as the sick are healed,
771. When fanned by the leaves of the Holy Book!

772. As thou sittest in the moonlight there,
773. Its glory flooding thy golden hair,
774. And the only darkness that which lies
775. In the haunted chambers of thine eyes,
776. I feel my soul drawn unto thee,
777. Strangely, and strongly, and more and more,
778. As to one I have known and loved before;
779. For every soul is akin to me
780. That dwells in the land of mystery!
781. I am the Lady Irmingard,
782. Born of a noble race and name!
783. Many a wandering Suabian bard,
784. Whose life was dreary, and bleak, and hard,
785. Has found through me the way to fame.
786. Brief and bright were those days, and the night
787. Which followed was full of a lurid light.
788. Love, that of every woman's heart
789. Will have the whole, and not a part,
790. That is to her, in Nature's plan,
791. More than ambition is to man,
792. Her light, her life, her very breath,
793. With no alternative but death,
794. Found me a maiden soft and young,
795. Just from the convent's cloistered school,
796. And seated on my lowly stool,
797. Attentive while the minstrels sung.

798. Gallant, graceful, gentle, tall,
799. Fairest, noblest, best of all,
800. Was Walter of the Vogelweid,
801. And, whatsoever may betide,
802. Still I think of him with pride!
803. His song was of the summer-time
804. The very birds sang in his rhyme;
805. The sunshine, the delicious air,
806. The fragrance of the flowers, were there,
807. And I grew restless as I heard,
808. Restless and buoyant as a bird,
809. Down soft, aerial currents sailing,
810. O'er blossomed orchards, and fields in bloom,
811. And through the momentary gloom
812. Of shadows o'er the landscape trailing,
813. Yielding and borne I knew not where,
814. But feeling resistance unavailing.

815. And thus, unnoticed and apart,
816. And more by accident than choice.
817. I listened to that single voice
818. Until the chambers of my heart
819. Were filled with it by night and day,
820. One night,--it was a night in May,--
821. Within the garden, unawares,
822. Under the blossoms in the gloom,
823. I heard it utter my own name
824. With protestations and wild prayers;
825. And it rang through me, and became
826. Like the archangel's trump of doom,
827. Which the soul hears, and must obey;
828. And mine arose as from a tomb.
829. My former life now seemed to me
830. Such as hereafter death may be,
831. When in the great Eternity
832. We shall awake and find it day.

833. It was a dream, and would not stay;
834. A dream, that in a single night
835. Faded and vanished out of sight.
836. My father's anger followed fast
837. This passion, as a freshening blast
838. Seeks out and fans the fire, whose rage
839. It may increase, but not assuage.
840. And he exclaimed: 'No wandering bard
841. Shall win thy hand, O Irmingard!
842. For which Prince Henry of Hoheneck
843. By messenger and letter sues.'

844. Gently, but firmly, I replied:
845. 'Henry of Hoheneck I discard!
846. Never the hand of Irmingard
847. Shall lie in his as the hand of a bride!'
848. This said I, Walter, for thy sake:
849. This said I, for I could not choose.
850. After a pause, my father spake
851. In that cold and deliberate tone
852. Which turns the hearer into stone,
853. And seems itself the act to be
854. That follows with such dread certainty;
855. 'This, or the cloister and the veil!'
856. No other words than these he said,
857. But they were like a funeral wail;
858. My life was ended, my heart was dead.

859. That night from the castle-gate went down,
860. With silent, slow, and stealthy pace,
861. Two shadows, mounted on shadowy steeds,
862. Taking the narrow path that leads
863. Into the forest dense and brown,
864. In the leafy darkness of the place,
865. One could not distinguish form nor face,
866. Only a bulk without a shape,
867. A darker shadow in the shade;
868. One scarce could say it moved or stayed,
869. Thus it was we made our escape!
870. A foaming brook, with many a bound,
871. Followed us like a playful hound;
872. Then leaped before us, and in the hollow
873. Paused, and waited for us to follow,
874. And seemed impatient, and afraid
875. That our tardy flight should be betrayed
876. By the sound our horses' hoof-beats made,
877. And when we reached the plain below,
878. He paused a moment and drew rein
879. To look back at the castle again;
880. And we saw the windows all aglow
881. With lights, that were passing to and fro;
882. Our hearts with terror ceased to beat;
883. The brook crept silent to our feet;
884. We knew what most we feared to know.
885. Then suddenly horns began to blow;
886. And we heard a shout, and a heavy tramp,
887. And our horses snorted in the damp
888. Night-air of the meadows green and wide,
889. And in a moment, side by side,
890. So close, they must have seemed but one,
891. The shadows across the moonlight run,
892. And another came, and swept behind,
893. Like the shadow of clouds before the wind!

894. How I remember that breathless flight
895. Across the moors, in the summer night!
896. How under our feet the long, white road
897. Backward like a river flowed,
898. Sweeping with it fences and hedges,
899. Whilst farther away, and overhead,
900. Paler than I, with fear and dread,
901. The moon fled with us, as we fled
902. Along the forest's jagged edges!

903. All this I can remember well;
904. But of what afterward befell
905. I nothing farther can recall
906. Than a blind, desperate, headlong fall;
907. The rest is a blank and darkness all.
908. When I awoke out of this swoon,
909. The sun was shining, not the moon,
910. Making a cross upon the wall
911. With the bars of my windows narrow and tall;
912. And I prayed to it, as I had been wont to pray,
913. From early childhood, day by day,
914. Each morning, as in bed I lay!
915. I was lying again in my own room!
916. And I thanked God, in my fever and pain,
917. That those shadows on the midnight plain
918. Were gone, and could not come again!
919. I struggled no longer with my doom!
920. This happened many years ago.
921. I left my father's home to come
922. Like Catherine to her martyrdom,
923. For blindly I esteemed it so.
924. And when I heard the convent door
925. Behind me close, to ope no more,
926. I felt it smite me like a blow,
927. Through all my limbs a shudder ran,
928. And on my bruised spirit fell
929. The dampness of my narrow cell
930. As night-air on a wounded man,
931. Giving intolerable pain.

932. But now a better life began,
933. I felt the agony decrease
934. By slow degrees, then wholly cease,
935. Ending in perfect rest and peace!
936. It was not apathy, nor dulness,
937. That weighed and pressed upon my brain,
938. But the same passion I had given
939. To earth before, now turned to heaven
940. With all its overflowing fulness.

941. Alas! the world is full of peril!
942. The path that runs through the fairest meads,
943. On the sunniest side of the valley, leads
944. Into a region bleak and sterile!
945. Alike in the high-born and the lowly,
946. The will is feeble, and passion strong.
947. We cannot sever right from wrong;
948. Some falsehood mingles with all truth;
949. Nor is it strange the heart of youth
950. Should waver and comprehend but slowly
951. The things that are holy and unholy!

952. But in this sacred and calm retreat,
953. We are all well and safely shielded
954. From winds that blow, and waves that beat,
955. From the cold, and rain, and blighting heat,
956. To which the strongest hearts have yielded.
957. Here we stand as the Virgins Seven,
958. For our celestial bridegroom yearning;
959. Our hearts are lamps forever burning,
960. With a steady and unwavering flame,
961. Pointing upward, forever the same,
962. Steadily upward toward the Heaven!

963. The moon is hidden behind a cloud;
964. A sudden darkness fills the room,
965. And thy deep eyes, amid the gloom,
966. Shine like jewels in a shroud.
967. On the leaves is a sound of falling rain;
968. A bird, awakened in its nest,
969. Gives a faint twitter of unrest,
970. Then smoothes its plumes and sleeps again.

971. No other sounds than these I hear;
972. The hour of midnight must be near.
973. Thou art o'erspent with the day's fatigue
974. Of riding many a dusty league;
975. Sink, then, gently to thy slumber;
976. Me so many cares encumber,
977. So many ghosts, and forms of fright,
978. Have started from their graves to-night,
979. They have driven sleep from mine eyes away:
980. I will go down to the chapel and pray.
