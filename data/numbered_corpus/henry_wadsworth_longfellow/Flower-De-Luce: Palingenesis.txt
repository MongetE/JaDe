1. I lay upon the headland-height, and listened
2. To the incessant sobbing of the sea
3. In caverns under me,
4. And watched the waves, that tossed and fled and glistened,
5. Until the rolling meadows of amethyst
6. Melted away in mist.

7. Then suddenly, as one from sleep, I started;
8. For round about me all the sunny capes
9. Seemed peopled with the shapes
10. Of those whom I had known in days departed,
11. Apparelled in the loveliness which gleams
12. On faces seen in dreams.

13. A moment only, and the light and glory
14. Faded away, and the disconsolate shore
15. Stood lonely as before;
16. And the wild-roses of the promontory
17. Around me shuddered in the wind, and shed
18. Their petals of pale red.

19. There was an old belief that in the embers
20. Of all things their primordial form exists,
21. And cunning alchemists
22. Could re-create the rose with all its members
23. From its own ashes, but without the bloom,
24. Without the lost perfume.

25. Ah me! what wonder-working, occult science
26. Can from the ashes in our hearts once more
27. The rose of youth restore?
28. What craft of alchemy can bid defiance
29. To time and change, and for a single hour
30. Renew this phantom-flower?

31. 'O, give me back,' I cried, 'the vanished splendors,
32. The breath of morn, and the exultant strife,
33. When the swift stream of life
34. Bounds o'er its rocky channel, and surrenders
35. The pond, with all its lilies, for the leap
36. Into the unknown deep!'

37. And the sea answered, with a lamentation,
38. Like some old prophet wailing, and it said,
39. 'Alas! thy youth is dead!
40. It breathes no more, its heart has no pulsation;
41. In the dark places with the dead of old
42. It lies forever cold!'

43. Then said I, 'From its consecrated cerements
44. I will not drag this sacred dust again,
45. Only to give me pain;
46. But, still remembering all the lost endearments,
47. Go on my way, like one who looks before,
48. And turns to weep no more.'

49. Into what land of harvests, what plantations
50. Bright with autumnal foliage and the glow
51. Of sunsets burning low;
52. Beneath what midnight skies, whose constellations
53. Light up the spacious avenues between
54. This world and the unseen!

55. Amid what friendly greetings and caresses,
56. What households, though not alien, yet not mine,
57. What bowers of rest divine;
58. To what temptations in lone wildernesses,
59. What famine of the heart, what pain and loss,
60. The bearing of what cross!

61. I do not know; nor will I vainly question
62. Those pages of the mystic book which hold
63. The story still untold,
64. But without rash conjecture or suggestion
65. Turn its last leaves in reverence and good heed,
66. Until 'The End' I read.
