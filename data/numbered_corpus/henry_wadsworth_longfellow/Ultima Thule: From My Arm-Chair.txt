1. Am I a king, that I should call my own
2. This splendid ebon throne?
3. Or by what reason, or what right divine,
4. Can I proclaim it mine?

5. Only, perhaps, by right divine of song
6. It may to me belong;
7. Only because the spreading chestnut tree
8. Of old was sung by me.

9. Well I remember it in all its prime,
10. When in the summer-time
11. The affluent foliage of its branches made
12. A cavern of cool shade.

13. There, by the blacksmith's forge, beside the street,
14. Its blossoms white and sweet
15. Enticed the bees, until it seemed alive,
16. And murmured like a hive.

17. And when the winds of autumn, with a shout,
18. Tossed its great arms about,
19. The shining chestnuts, bursting from the sheath,
20. Dropped to the ground beneath.

21. And now some fragments of its branches bare,
22. Shaped as a stately chair,
23. Have by my hearthstone found a home at last,
24. And whisper of the past.

25. The Danish king could not in all his pride
26. Repel the ocean tide,
27. But, seated in this chair, I can in rhyme
28. Roll back the tide of Time.

29. I see again, as one in vision sees,
30. The blossoms and the bees,
31. And hear the children's voices shout and call,
32. And the brown chestnuts fall.

33. I see the smithy with its fires aglow,
34. I hear the bellows blow,
35. And the shrill hammers on the anvil beat
36. The iron white with heat!

37. And thus, dear children, have ye made for me
38. This day a jubilee,
39. And to my more than three-score years and ten
40. Brought back my youth again.

41. The heart hath its own memory, like the mind,
42. And in it are enshrined
43. The precious keepsakes, into which is wrought
44. The giver's loving thought.

45. Only your love and your remembrance could
46. Give life to this dead wood,
47. And make these branches, leafless now so long,
48. Blossom again in song.
