1. Flow on, sweet river! like his verse
2. Who lies beneath this sculptured hearse;
3. Nor wait beside the churchyard wall
4. For him who cannot hear thy call.

5. Thy playmate once; I see him now
6. A boy with sunshine on his brow,
7. And hear in Stratford's quiet street
8. The patter of his little feet.

9. I see him by thy shallow edge
10. Wading knee-deep amid the sedge;
11. And lost in thought, as if thy stream
12. Were the swift river of a dream.

13. He wonders whitherward it flows;
14. And fain would follow where it goes,
15. To the wide world, that shall erelong
16. Be filled with his melodious song.

17. Flow on, fair stream! That dream is o'er;
18. He stands upon another shore;
19. A vaster river near him flows,
20. And still he follows where it goes.
