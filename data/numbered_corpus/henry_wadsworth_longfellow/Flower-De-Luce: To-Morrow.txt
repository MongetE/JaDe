1. 'Tis late at night, and in the realm of sleep
2. My little lambs are folded like the flocks;
3. From room to room I hear the wakeful clocks
4. Challenge the passing hour, like guards that keep
5. Their solitary watch on tower and steep;
6. Far off I hear the crowing of the cocks,
7. And through the opening door that time unlocks
8. Feel the fresh breathing of To-morrow creep.
9. To-morrow! the mysterious, unknown guest,
10. Who cries to me: 'Remember Barmecide,
11. And tremble to be happy with the rest.'
12. And I make answer: 'I am satisfied;
13. I dare not ask; I know not what is best;
14. God hath already said what shall betide.'
