1. Into the Silent Land!
2. Ah! who shall lead us thither?
3. Clouds in the evening sky more darkly gather,
4. And shattered wrecks lie thicker on the strand.
5. Who leads us with a gentle hand
6. Thither, O thither,
7. Into the Silent Land?

8. Into the Silent Land!To you, ye boundless regions
9. Of all perfection! Tender morning-visions
10. Of beauteous souls! The Future's pledge and band!
11. Who in Life's battle firm doth stand,
12. Shall bear Hope's tender blossoms
13. Into the Silent Land!
14. O Land! O Land!
15. For all the broken-hearted
16. The mildest herald by our faith allotted,
17. Beckons, and with inverted torch doth stand
18. To lead us with a gentle hand
19. Into the land of the great Departed,
20. Into the Silent Land!
