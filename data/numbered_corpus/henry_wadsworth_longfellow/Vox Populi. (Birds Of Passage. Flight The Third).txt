1. When Mazarvan the Magician
2. Journeyed westward through Cathay,
3. Nothing heard he but the praises
4. Of Badoura on his way.

5. But the lessening rumor ended
6. When he came to Khaledan,
7. There the folk were talking only
8. Of Prince Camaralzaman,

9. So it happens with the poets:
10. Every province hath its own;
11. Camaralzaman is famous
12. Where Badoura is unknown.
