1. 'Whither, thou turbid wave?
2. Whither, with so much haste,
3. As if a thief wert thou?'

4. 'I am the Wave of Life,
5. Stained with my margin's dust;
6. From the struggle and the strife
7. Of the narrow stream I fly
8. To the Sea's immensity,
9. To wash from me the slime
10. Of the muddy banks of Time.'
