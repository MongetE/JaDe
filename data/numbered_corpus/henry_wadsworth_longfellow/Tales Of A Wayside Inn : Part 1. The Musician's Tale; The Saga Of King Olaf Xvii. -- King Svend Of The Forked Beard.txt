1. Loudly the sailors cheered
2. Svend of the Forked Beard,
3. As with his fleet he steered
4. Southward to Vendland;
5. Where with their courses hauled
6. All were together called,
7. Under the Isle of Svald
8. Near to the mainland.

9. After Queen Gunhild's death,
10. So the old Saga saith,
11. Plighted King Svend his faith
12. To Sigrid the Haughty;
13. And to avenge his bride,
14. Soothing her wounded pride,
15. Over the waters wide
16. King Olaf sought he.

17. Still on her scornful face,
18. Blushing with deep disgrace,
19. Bore she the crimson trace
20. Of Olaf's gauntlet;
21. Like a malignant star,
22. Blazing in heaven afar,
23. Red shone the angry scar
24. Under her frontlet.

25. Oft to King Svend she spake,
26. 'For thine own honor's sake
27. Shalt thou swift vengeance take
28. On the vile coward!'
29. Until the King at last,
30. Gusty and overcast,
31. Like a tempestuous blast
32. Threatened and lowered.

33. Soon as the Spring appeared,
34. Svend of the Forked Beard
35. High his red standard reared,
36. Eager for battle;
37. While every warlike Dane,
38. Seizing his arms again,
39. Left all unsown the grain,
40. Unhoused the cattle.

41. Likewise the Swedish King
42. Summoned in haste a Thing,
43. Weapons and men to bring
44. In aid of Denmark;
45. Eric the Norseman, too,
46. As the war-tidings flew,
47. Sailed with a chosen crew
48. From Lapland and Finmark.

49. So upon Easter day
50. Sailed the three kings away,
51. Out of the sheltered bay,
52. In the bright season;
53. With them Earl Sigvald came,
54. Eager for spoil and fame;
55. Pity that such a name
56. Stooped to such treason!

57. Safe under Svald at last,
58. Now were their anchors cast,
59. Safe from the sea and blast,
60. Plotted the three kings;
61. While, with a base intent,
62. Southward Earl Sigvald went,
63. On a foul errand bent,
64. Unto the Sea-kings.

65. Thence to hold on his course,
66. Unto King Olaf's force,
67. Lying within the hoarse
68. Mouths of Stet-haven;
69. Him to ensnare and bring,
70. Unto the Danish king,
71. Who his dead corse would fling
72. Forth to the raven!
