1. Like two cathedral towers these stately pines
2. Uplift their fretted summits tipped with cones;
3. The arch beneath them is not built with stones,
4. Not Art but Nature traced these lovely lines,
5. And carved this graceful arabesque of vines;
6. No organ but the wind here sighs and moans,
7. No sepulchre conceals a martyr's bones.
8. No marble bishop on his tomb reclines.
9. Enter! the pavement, carpeted with leaves,
10. Gives back a softened echo to thy tread!
11. Listen! the choir is singing; all the birds,
12. In leafy galleries beneath the eaves,
13. Are singing! listen, ere the sound be fled,
14. And learn there may be worship with out words.
