1. It is autumn; not without
2. But within me is the cold.
3. Youth and spring are all about;
4. It is I that have grown old.

5. Birds are darting through the air,
6. Singing, building without rest;
7. Life is stirring everywhere,
8. Save within my lonely breast.

9. There is silence: the dead leaves
10. Fall and rustle and are still;
11. Beats no flail upon the sheaves,
12. Comes no murmur from the mill.
