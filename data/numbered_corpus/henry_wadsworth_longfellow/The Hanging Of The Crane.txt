1. The lights are out, and gone are all the guests
2. That thronging came with merriment and jests
3. To celebrate the Hanging of the Crane
4. In the new house,--into the night are gone;
5. But still the fire upon the hearth burns on,
6. And I alone remain.

7. O fortunate, O happy day,
8. When a new household finds its place
9. Among the myriad homes of earth,
10. Like a new star just sprung to birth,
11. And rolled on its harmonious way
12. Into the boundless realms of space!

13. So said the guests in speech and song,
14. As in the chimney, burning bright,
15. We hung the iron crane to-night,
16. And merry was the feast and long.

17. II.

18. And now I sit and muse on what may be,
19. And in my vision see, or seem to see,
20. Through floating vapors interfused with light,
21. Shapes indeterminate, that gleam and fade,
22. As shadows passing into deeper shade
23. Sink and elude the sight.

24. For two alone, there in the hall,
25. As spread the table round and small;
26. Upon the polished silver shine
27. The evening lamps, but, more divine,
28. The light of love shines over all;
29. Of love, that says not mine and thine,
30. But ours, for ours is thine and mine.

31. They want no guests, to come between
32. Their tender glances like a screen,
33. And tell them tales of land and sea,
34. And whatsoever may betide
35. The great, forgotten world outside;
36. They want no guests; they needs must be
37. Each other's own best company.

38. III.

39. The picture fades; as at a village fair
40. A showman's views, dissolving into air,
41. Again appear transfigured on the screen,
42. So in my fancy this; and now once more,
43. In part transfigured, through the open door
44. Appears the selfsame scene.

45. Seated, I see the two again,
46. But not alone; they entertain
47. A little angel unaware,
48. With face as round as is the moon;
49. A royal guest with flaxen hair,
50. Who, throned upon his lofty chair,
51. Drums on the table with his spoon,
52. Then drops it careless on the floor,
53. To grasp at things unseen before.


54. Are these celestial manners? these
55. The ways that win, the arts that please?
56. Ah yes; consider well the guest,
57. And whatsoe'er he does seems best;
58. He ruleth by the right divine
59. Of helplessness, so lately born
60. In purple chambers of the morn,
61. As sovereign over thee and thine.
62. He speaketh not; and yet there lies
63. A conversation in his eyes;
64. The golden silence of the Greek,
65. The gravest wisdom of the wise,
66. Not spoken in language, but in looks
67. More legible than printed books,
68. As if he could but would not speak.
69. And now, O monarch absolute,
70. Thy power is put to proof; for, lo!
71. Resistless, fathomless, and slow,
72. The nurse comes rustling like the sea,
73. And pushes back thy chair and thee,
74. And so good night to King Canute.

75. IV.

76. As one who walking in a forest sees
77. A lovely landscape through the parted frees,
78. Then sees it not, for boughs that intervene
79. Or as we see the moon sometimes revealed
80. Through drifting clouds, and then again concealed,
81. So I behold the scene.

82. There are two guests at table now;
83. The king, deposed and older grown,
84. No longer occupies the throne,--
85. The crown is on his sister's brow;
86. A Princess from the Fairy Isles,
87. The very pattern girl of girls.
88. All covered and embowered in curls,
89. Rose-tinted from the Isle of Flowers,
90. And sailing with soft, silken sails
91. From far-off Dreamland into ours.
92. Above their bowls with rims of blue
93. Four azure eyes of deeper hue
94. Are looking, dreamy with delight;
95. Limpid as planets that emerge
96. Above the ocean's rounded verge,
97. Soft-shining through the summer night.
98. Steadfast they gaze, yet nothing see
99. Beyond the horizon of their bowls;
100. Nor care they for the world that rolls
101. With all its freight of troubled souls
102. Into the days that are to be.

103. V.

104. Again the tossing boughs shut out the scene,
105. Again the drifting vapors intervene,
106. And the moon's pallid disk is hidden quite;
107. And now I see the table wider grown,
108. As round a pebble into water thrown
109. Dilates a ring of light.

110. I see the table wider grown,
111. I see it garlanded with guests,
112. As if fair Ariadne's Crown
113. Out of the sky had fallen down;
114. Maidens within whose tender breasts
115. A thousand restless hopes and fears,
116. Forth reaching to the coming years,
117. Flutter awhile, then quiet lie
118. Like timid birds that fain would fly,
119. But do not dare to leave their nests;--
120. And youths, who in their strength elate
121. Challenge the van and front of fate,
122. Eager as champions to be
123. In the divine knight-errantry
124. Of youth, that travels sea and land
125. Seeking adventures, or pursues,
126. Through cities, and through solitudes
127. Frequented by the lyric Muse,
128. The phantom with the beckoning hand,
129. That still allures and still eludes.
130. O sweet illusions of the brain!
131. O sudden thrills of fire and frost!
132. The world is bright while ye remain,
133. And dark and dead when ye are lost!

134. VI.

135. The meadow-brook, that seemeth to stand still,
136. Quickens its current as it nears the mill;
137. And so the stream of Time that lingereth
138. In level places, and so dull appears,
139. Runs with a swifter current as it nears
140. The gloomy mills of Death.

141. And now, like the magician's scroll,
142. That in the owner's keeping shrinks
143. With every wish he speaks or thinks,
144. Till the last wish consumes the whole,
145. The table dwindles, and again
146. I see the two alone remain.
147. The crown of stars is broken in parts;
148. Its jewels, brighter than the day,
149. Have one by one been stolen away
150. To shine in other homes and hearts.
151. One is a wanderer now afar
152. In Ceylon or in Zanzibar,
153. Or sunny regions of Cathay;
154. And one is in the boisterous camp
155. Mid clink of arms and horses' tramp,
156. And battle's terrible array.
157. I see the patient mother read,
158. With aching heart, of wrecks that float
159. Disabled on those seas remote,
160. Or of some great heroic deed
161. On battle-fie1ds where thousands bleed
162. To lift one hero into fame.
163. Anxious she bends her graceful head
164. Above these chronicles of pain,
165. And trembles with a secret dread
166. Lest there among the drowned or slain
167. She find the one beloved name.

168. VII.

169. After a day of cloud and wind and rain
170. Sometimes the setting sun breaks out again,
171. And touching all the darksome woods with light,
172. Smiles on the fields, until they laugh and sing,
173. Then like a ruby from the horizon's ring
174. Drops down into the night.

175. What see I now? The night is fair,
176. The storm of grief, the clouds of care,
177. The wind, the rain, have passed away;
178. The lamps are lit, the fires burn bright,
179. The house is full of life and light:
180. It is the Golden Wedding day.
181. The guests come thronging in once more,
182. Quick footsteps sound along the floor,
183. The trooping children crowd the stair,
184. And in and out and everywhere
185. Flashes along the corridor
186. The sunshine of their golden hair.
187. On the round table in the hall
188. Another Ariadne's Crown
189. Out of the sky hath fallen down;
190. More than one Monarch of the Moon
191. Is drumming with his silver spoon;
192. The light of love shines over all.

193. O fortunate, O happy day!
194. The people sing, the people say.
195. The ancient bridegroom and the bride,
196. Smiling contented and serene
197. Upon the blithe, bewildering scene,
198. Behold, well pleased, on every side
199. Their forms and features multiplied,
200. As the reflection of a light
201. Between two burnished mirrors gleams,
202. Or lamps upon a bridge at night
203. Stretch on and on before the sight,
204. Till the long vista endless seems.
