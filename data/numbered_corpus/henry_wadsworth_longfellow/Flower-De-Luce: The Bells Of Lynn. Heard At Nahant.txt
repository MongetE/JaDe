1. O curfew of the setting sun! O Bells of Lynn!
2. O requiem of the dying day! O Bells of Lynn!

3. From the dark belfries of yon cloud-cathedral wafted,
4. Your sounds aerial seem to float, O Bells of Lynn!

5. Borne on the evening wind across the crimson twilight,
6. O'er land and sea they rise and fall, O Bells of Lynn!

7. The fisherman in his boat, far out beyond the headland,
8. Listens, and leisurely rows ashore, O Bells of Lynn!

9. Over the shining sands the wandering cattle homeward
10. Follow each other at your call, O Bells of Lynn!

11. The distant lighthouse hears, and with his flaming signal
12. Answers you, passing the watchword on, O Bells of Lynn!

13. And down the darkening coast run the tumultuous surges,
14. And clap their hands, and shout to you, O Bells of Lynn!

15. Till from the shuddering sea, with your wild incantations,
16. Ye summon up the spectral moon, O Bells of Lynn!

17. And startled at the sight like the weird woman of Endor,
18. Ye cry aloud, and then are still, O Bells of Lynn!
