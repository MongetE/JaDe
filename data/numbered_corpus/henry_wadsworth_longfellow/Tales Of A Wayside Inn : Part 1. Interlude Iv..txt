1. And then the blue-eyed Norseman told
2. A Saga of the days of old.
3. 'There is,' said he, 'a wondrous book
4. Of Legends in the old Norse tongue,
5. Of the dead kings of Norroway,--
6. Legends that once were told or sung
7. In many a smoky fireside nook
8. Of Iceland, in the ancient day,
9. By wandering Saga-man or Scald;
10. Heimskringla is the volume called;
11. And he who looks may find therein
12. The story that I now begin.'

13. And in each pause the story made
14. Upon his violin he played,
15. As an appropriate interlude,
16. Fragments of old Norwegian tunes
17. That bound in one the separate runes,
18. And held the mind in perfect mood,
19. Entwining and encircling all
20. The strange and antiquated rhymes
21. with melodies of olden times;
22. As over some half-ruined wall,
23. Disjointed and about to fall,
24. Fresh woodbines climb and interlace,
25. And keep the loosened stones in place.
