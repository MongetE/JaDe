1. On the gray sea-sands
2. King Olaf stands,
3. Northward and seaward
4. He points with his hands.

5. With eddy and whirl
6. The sea-tides curl,
7. Washing the sandals
8. Of Sigvald the Earl.

9. The mariners shout,
10. The ships swing about,
11. The yards are all hoisted,
12. The sails flutter out.

13. The war-horns are played,
14. The anchors are weighed,
15. Like moths in the distance
16. The sails flit and fade.

17. The sea is like lead
18. The harbor lies dead,
19. As a corse on the sea-shore,
20. Whose spirit has fled!

21. On that fatal day,
22. The histories say,
23. Seventy vessels
24. Sailed out of the bay.

25. But soon scattered wide
26. O'er the billows they ride,
27. While Sigvald and Olaf
28. Sail side by side.

29. Cried the Earl: 'Follow me!
30. I your pilot will be,
31. For I know all the channels
32. Where flows the deep sea!'

33. So into the strait
34. Where his foes lie in wait,
35. Gallant King Olaf
36. Sails to his fate!

37. Then the sea-fog veils
38. The ships and their sails;
39. Queen Sigrid the Haughty,
40. Thy vengeance prevails!
