1. Nowhere such a devious stream,
2. Save in fancy or in dream,
3. Winding slow through bush and brake,
4. Links together lake and lake.

5. Walled with woods or sandy shelf,
6. Ever doubling on itself
7. Flows the stream, so still and slow
8. That it hardly seems to flow.

9. Never errant knight of old,
10. Lost in woodland or on wold,
11. Such a winding path pursued
12. Through the sylvan solitude.

13. Never school-boy, in his quest
14. After hazel-nut or nest,
15. Through the forest in and out
16. Wandered loitering thus about.

17. In the mirror of its tide
18. Tangled thickets on each side
19. Hang inverted, and between
20. Floating cloud or sky serene.

21. Swift or swallow on the wing
22. Seems the only living thing,
23. Or the loon, that laughs and flies
24. Down to those reflected skies.

25. Silent stream! thy Indian name
26. Unfamiliar is to fame;
27. For thou hidest here alone,
28. Well content to be unknown.

29. But thy tranquil waters teach
30. Wisdom deep as human speech,
31. Moving without haste or noise
32. In unbroken equipoise.

33. Though thou turnest no busy mill,
34. And art ever calm and still,
35. Even thy silence seems to say
36. To the traveller on his way:--

37. 'Traveller, hurrying from the heat
38. Of the city, stay thy feet!
39. Rest awhile, nor longer waste
40. Life with inconsiderate haste!

41. 'Be not like a stream that brawls
42. Loud with shallow waterfalls,
43. But in quiet self-control
44. Link together soul and soul.'
