1. Ah me! ah me! when thinking of the years,
2. The vanished years, alas, I do not find
3. Among them all one day that was my own!
4. Fallacious hope; desires of the unknown,
5. Lamenting, loving, burning, and in tears
6. (For human passions all have stirred my mind),
7. Have held me, now I feel and know, confined
8. Both from the true and good still far away.
9. I perish day by day;
10. The sunshine fails, the shadows grow more dreary,
11. And I am near to fail, infirm and weary.
