1. From this high portal, where upsprings
2. The rose to touch our hands in play,
3. We at a glance behold three things--
4. The Sea, the Town, and the Highway.

5. And the Sea says: My shipwrecks fear;
6. I drown my best friends in the deep;
7. And those who braved icy tempests, here
8. Among my sea-weeds lie asleep!

9. The Town says: I am filled and fraught
10. With tumult and with smoke and care;
11. My days with toil are overwrought,
12. And in my nights I gasp for air.

13. The Highway says: My wheel-tracks guide
14. To the pale climates of the North;
15. Where my last milestone stands abide
16. The people to their death gone forth.

17. Here, in the shade, this life of ours,
18. Full of delicious air, glides by
19. Amid a multitude of flowers
20. As countless as the stars on high;

21. These red-tiled roofs, this fruitful soil,
22. Bathed with an azure all divine,
23. Where springs the tree that gives us oil,
24. The grape that giveth us the wine;

25. Beneath these mountains stripped of trees,
26. Whose tops with flowers are covered o'er,
27. Where springtime of the Hesperides
28. Begins, but endeth nevermore;

29. Under these leafy vaults and walls,
30. That unto gentle sleep persuade;
31. This rainbow of the waterfalls,
32. Of mingled mist and sunshine made;

33. Upon these shores, where all invites,
34. We live our languid life apart;
35. This air is that of life's delights,
36. The festival of sense and heart;

37. This limpid space of time prolong,
38. Forget to-morrow in to-day,
39. And leave unto the passing throng
40. The Sea, the Town, and the Highway
