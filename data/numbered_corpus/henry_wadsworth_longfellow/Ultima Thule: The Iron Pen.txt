1. I thought this Pen would arise
2. From the casket where it lies--
3. Of itself would arise and write
4. My thanks and my surprise.

5. When you gave it me under the pines,
6. I dreamed these gems from the mines
7. Of Siberia, Ceylon, and Maine
8. Would glimmer as thoughts in the lines;

9. That this iron link from the chain
10. Of Bonnivard might retain
11. Some verse of the Poet who sang
12. Of the prisoner and his pain;

13. That this wood from the frigate's mast
14. Might write me a rhyme at last,
15. As it used to write on the sky
16. The song of the sea and the blast.

17. But motionless as I wait,
18. Like a Bishop lying in state
19. Lies the Pen, with its mitre of gold,
20. And its jewels inviolate.

21. Then must I speak, and say
22. That the light of that summer day
23. In the garden under the pines
24. Shall not fade and pass away.

25. I shall see you standing there,
26. Caressed by the fragrant air,
27. With the shadow on your face,
28. And the sunshine on your hair.

29. I shall hear the sweet low tone
30. Of a voice before unknown,
31. Saying, 'This is from me to you--
32. From me, and to you alone.'

33. And in words not idle and vain
34. I shall answer and thank you again
35. For the gift, and the grace of the gift,
36. O beautiful Helen of Maine!

37. And forever this gift will be
38. As a blessing from you to me,
39. As a drop of the dew of your youth
40. On the leaves of an aged tree.
