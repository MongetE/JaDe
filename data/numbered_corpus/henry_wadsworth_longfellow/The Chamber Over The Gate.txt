1. Is it so far from thee
2. Thou canst no longer see,
3. In the Chamber over the Gate,
4. That old man desolate,
5. Weeping and wailing sore
6. For his son, who is no more?
7. O Absalom, my son!

8. Is it so long ago
9. That cry of human woe
10. From the walled city came,
11. Calling on his dear name,
12. That it has died away
13. In the distance of to-day?
14. O Absalom, my son!

15. There is no far or near,
16. There is neither there nor here,
17. There is neither soon nor late,
18. In that Chamber over the Gate,
19. Nor any long ago
20. To that cry of human woe,
21. O Absalom, my son!

22. From the ages that are past
23. The voice sounds like a blast,
24. Over seas that wreck and drown,
25. Over tumult of traffic and town;
26. And from ages yet to be
27. Come the echoes back to me,
28. O Absalom, my son!

29. Somewhere at every hour
30. The watchman on the tower
31. Looks forth, and sees the fleet
32. Approach of the hurrying feet
33. Of messengers, that bear
34. The tidings of despair.
35. O Absalom, my son!

36. He goes forth from the door
37. Who shall return no more.
38. With him our joy departs;
39. The light goes out in our hearts;
40. In the Chamber over the Gate
41. We sit disconsolate.
42. O Absalom, my son!

43. That 't is a common grief
44. Bringeth but slight relief;
45. Ours is the bitterest loss,
46. Ours is the heaviest cross;
47. And forever the cry will be
48. 'Would God I had died for thee,
49. O Absalom, my son!'
