1. Should the shade of Plato
2. Visit us, anxious to know
3. how anthropos is, we could say to him: "Well,
4. we can read to ourselves, our use
5. of holy numbers would shock you, and a poet
6. may lament—'Where is Telford
7. whose bridged canals are still a Shropshire glory
8. where Muir who on a Douglas Spruce
9. rode out a storm and called an earthquake noble,
10. where Mr. Vynyian Board,
11. thanks to whose life-long fuss the hunted whale now suffers
12. a quicker death?'—without being
13. called an idiot, though none of them bore arms or
14. made a public splash," then "Look!"
15. we would point, for a dig at Athens, "Here
16. is the place where we cook."
17. Though built in Lower Austria
18. do-it-yourself America
19. prophetically blueprinted this
20. palace kitchen for kingdoms
21. where royalty would be incognito, for an age when
22. Courtesy might think: "From your voice
23. and the back of your neck I know we shall get on
24. but cannot tell from your thumbs
25. who is to give the orders." The right note is harder
26. to hear than in the Age of Poise
27. when She talked shamelessly to her maid and sang
28. noble lies with Him, but struck
29. it can be still in New Knossos where if I am
30. banned by a shrug it is my fault,
31. not Father's, as it is my taste whom
32. I put below the salt.
33. The prehistoric hearthstone,
34. round as a birthday-button
35. and sacred to Granny, is as old
36. stuff as the bowel-loosening
37. nasal war cry, but this all-electric room
38. where ghosts would feel uneasy,
39. a witch at a loss, is numinous and again
40. the centre of a dwelling
41. not, as lately it was, an abhorrent dungeon
42. where the warm unlaundered meiny
43. belched their comic prose and from a dream of which
44. chaste Milady awoke blushing.
45. House-proud, deploring labor, extolling work,
46. these engines politely insist
47. that banausics can be liberals,
48. a cook a pure artist
49. who moves Everyman
50. at a deeper level than
51. Mozart, for the subject of the verb
52. to-hunger is never a name:
53. dear Adam and Eve had different bottoms,
54. but the neotene who marches
55. upright and can subtract reveals a belly
56. like a serpent's with the same
57. vulnerable look. Jew, Gentile, or Pigmy,
58. he must get his calories
59. before he can consider her profile or
60. his own, attack you or play chess,
61. and take what there is however hard to get down:
62. then surely those in whose creed
63. God is edible may call a fine
64. omelet a Christian deed.
65. The sin of Gluttony
66. is ranked among the Deadly
67. Seven, but in murder mysteries
68. one can be sure the gourmet
69. didn't do it: children, brave warriors out of a job,
70. can weigh pounds more than they should
71. and one can dislike having to kiss them yet,
72. compared with the thin-lipped, they
73. are seldom detestable. Some waiter grieves
74. for the worst dead bore to be a good
75. trencherman, and no wonder chefs mature into
76. choleric types, doomed to observe
77. Beauty peck at a master-dish, their one reward
78. to behold the mutually hostile
79. mouth and eyes of a sinner married
80. at the first bite of a smile.
81. The houses of our City
82. are real enough but they lie
83. haphazardly scattered over the earth,
84. and Her vagabond forum
85. is any space where two of us happen to meet
86. who can spot a citizen
87. without papers. So, too, can her foes. Where the
88. power lies remains to be seen,
89. the force, though, is clearly with them: perhaps only
90. by falling can She become
91. Her own Vision, but we have sworn under four eyes
92. to keep Her up—all we ask for,
93. should the night come when comets blaze and meres break,
94. is a good dinner, that we
95. may march in high fettle, left foot first,
96. to hold her Thermopylae.
