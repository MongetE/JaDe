1. One day, along the electric wire
2. His manly word for Freedom sped;
3. We came next morn: that tongue of fire
4. Said only, 'He who spake is dead!'

5. Dead! while his voice was living yet,
6. In echoes round the pillared dome!
7. Dead! while his blotted page lay wet
8. With themes of state and loves of home!

9. Dead! in that crowning grace of time,
10. That triumph of life's zenith hour!
11. Dead! while we watched his manhood's prime
12. Break from the slow bud into flower!

13. Dead! he so great, and strong, and wise,
14. While the mean thousands yet drew breath;
15. How deepened, through that dread surprise,
16. The mystery and the awe of death!

17. From the high place whereon our votes
18. Had borne him, clear, calm, earnest, fell
19. His first words, like the prelude notes
20. Of some great anthem yet to swell.

21. We seemed to see our flag unfurled,
22. Our champion waiting in his place
23. For the last battle of the world,
24. The Armageddon of the race.

25. Through him we hoped to speak the word
26. Which wins the freedom of a land;
27. And lift, for human right, the sword
28. Which dropped from Hampden's dying hand.

29. For he had sat at Sidney's feet,
30. And walked with Pym and Vane apart;
31. And, through the centuries, felt the beat
32. Of Freedom's march in Cromwell's heart.

33. He knew the paths the worthies held,
34. Where England's best and wisest trod;
35. And, lingering, drank the springs that welled
36. Beneath the touch of Milton's rod.

37. No wild enthusiast of the right,
38. Self-poised and clear, he showed alway
39. The coolness of his northern night,
40. The ripe repose of autumn's day.

41. His steps were slow, yet forward still
42. He pressed where others paused or failed;
43. The calm star clomb with constant will,
44. The restless meteor flashed and paled.

45. Skilled in its subtlest wile, he knew
46. And owned the higher ends of Law;
47. Still rose majestic on his view
48. The awful Shape the schoolman saw.

49. Her home the heart of God; her voice
50. The choral harmonies whereby
51. The stars, through all their spheres, rejoice,
52. The rhythmic rule of earth and sky.

53. We saw his great powers misapplied
54. To poor ambitions; yet, through all,
55. We saw him take the weaker side,
56. And right the wronged, and free the thrall.

57. Now, looking o'er the frozen North,
58. For one like him in word and act,
59. To call her old, free spirit forth,
60. And give her faith the life of fact,--

61. To break her party bonds of shame,
62. And labor with the zeal of him
63. To make the Democratic name
64. Of Liberty the synonyme,--

65. We sweep the land from hill to strand,
66. We seek the strong, the wise, the brave,
67. And, sad of heart, return to stand
68. In silence by a new-made grave!

69. There, where his breezy hills of home
70. Look out upon his sail-white seas,
71. The sounds of winds and waters come,
72. And shape themselves to words like these.

73. 'Why, murmuring, mourn that he, whose power
74. Was lent to Party over-long,
75. Heard the still whisper at the hour
76. He set his foot on Party wrong?

77. 'The human life that closed so well
78. No lapse of folly now can stain
79. The lips whence Freedom's protest fell
80. No meaner thought can now profane.

81. 'Mightier than living voice his grave
82. That lofty protest utters o'er;
83. Through roaring wind and smiting wave
84. It speaks his hate of wrong once more.

85. 'Men of the North! your weak regret
86. Is wasted here; arise and pay
87. To freedom and to him your debt,
88. By following where he led the way!'
