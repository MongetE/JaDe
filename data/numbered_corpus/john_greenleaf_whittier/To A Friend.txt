1. ON HER RETURN FROM EUROPE.

2. How smiled the land of France
3. Under thy blue eye's glance,
4. Light-hearted rover
5. Old walls of chateaux gray,
6. Towers of an early day,
7. Which the Three Colors play
8. Flauntingly over.

9. Now midst the brilliant train
10. Thronging the banks of Seine
11. Now midst the splendor
12. Of the wild Alpine range,
13. Waking with change on change
14. Thoughts in thy young heart strange,
15. Lovely, and tender.

16. Vales, soft Elysian,
17. Like those in the vision
18. Of Mirza, when, dreaming,
19. He saw the long hollow dell,
20. Touched by the prophet's spell,
21. Into an ocean swell
22. With its isles teeming.

23. Cliffs wrapped in snows of years,
24. Splintering with icy spears
25. Autumn's blue heaven
26. Loose rock and frozen slide,
27. Hung on the mountain-side,
28. Waiting their hour to glide
29. Downward, storm-driven!

30. Rhine-stream, by castle old,
31. Baron's and robber's hold,
32. Peacefully flowing;
33. Sweeping through vineyards green,
34. Or where the cliffs are seen
35. O'er the broad wave between
36. Grim shadows throwing.

37. Or, where St. Peter's dome
38. Swells o'er eternal Rome,
39. Vast, dim, and solemn;
40. Hymns ever chanting low,
41. Censers swung to and fro,
42. Sable stoles sweeping slow
43. Cornice and column!

44. Oh, as from each and all
45. Will there not voices call
46. Evermore back again?
47. In the mind's gallery
48. Wilt thou not always see
49. Dim phantoms beckon thee
50. O'er that old track again?

51. New forms thy presence haunt,
52. New voices softly chant,
53. New faces greet thee!
54. Pilgrims from many a shrine
55. Hallowed by poet's line,
56. At memory's magic sign,
57. Rising to meet thee.

58. And when such visions come
59. Unto thy olden home,
60. Will they not waken
61. Deep thoughts of Him whose hand
62. Led thee o'er sea and land
63. Back to the household band
64. Whence thou wast taken?

65. While, at the sunset time,
66. Swells the cathedral's chime,
67. Yet, in thy dreaming,
68. While to thy spirit's eye
69. Yet the vast mountains lie
70. Piled in the Switzer's sky,
71. Icy and gleaming:

72. Prompter of silent prayer,
73. Be the wild picture there
74. In the mind's chamber,
75. And, through each coming day
76. Him who, as staff and stay,
77. Watched o'er thy wandering way,
78. Freshly remember.

79. So, when the call shall be
80. Soon or late unto thee,
81. As to all given,
82. Still may that picture live,
83. All its fair forms survive,
84. And to thy spirit give
85. Gladness in Heaven!
