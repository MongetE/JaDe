1. Make, for he loved thee well, our Merrimac,
2. From wave and shore a low and long lament
3. For him, whose last look sought thee, as he went
4. The unknown way from which no step comes back.
5. And ye, O ancient pine-trees, at whose feet
6. He watched in life the sunset's reddening glow,
7. Let the soft south wind through your needles blow
8. A fitting requiem tenderly and sweet!
9. No fonder lover of all lovely things
10. Shall walk where once he walked, no smile more glad
11. Greet friends than his who friends in all men had,
12. Whose pleasant memory, to that Island clings,
13. Where a dear mourner in the home he left
14. Of love's sweet solace cannot be bereft.
