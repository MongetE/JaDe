1. From Alton Bay to Sandwich Dome,
2. From Mad to Saco river,
3. For patriarchs of the primal wood
4. We sought with vain endeavor.

5. And then we said: 'The giants old
6. Are lost beyond retrieval;
7. This pygmy growth the axe has spared
8. Is not the wood primeval.

9. 'Look where we will o'er vale and hill,
10. How idle are our searches
11. For broad-girthed maples, wide-limbed oaks,
12. Centennial pines and birches.

13. 'Their tortured limbs the axe and saw
14. Have changed to beams and trestles;
15. They rest in walls, they float on seas,
16. They rot in sunken vessels.

17. 'This shorn and wasted mountain land
18. Of underbrush and boulder,--
19. Who thinks to see its full-grown tree
20. Must live a century older.'

21. At last to us a woodland path,
22. To open sunset leading,
23. Revealed the Anakim of pines
24. Our wildest wish exceeding.

25. Alone, the level sun before;
26. Below, the lake's green islands;
27. Beyond, in misty distance dim,
28. The rugged Northern Highlands.

29. Dark Titan on his Sunset Hill
30. Of time and change defiant
31. How dwarfed the common woodland seemed,
32. Before the old-time giant!

33. What marvel that, in simpler days
34. Of the world's early childhood,
35. Men crowned with garlands, gifts, and praise
36. Such monarchs of the wild-wood?

37. That Tyrian maids with flower and song
38. Danced through the hill grove's spaces,
39. And hoary-bearded Druids found
40. In woods their holy places?

41. With somewhat of that Pagan awe
42. With Christian reverence blending,
43. We saw our pine-tree's mighty arms
44. Above our heads extending.

45. We heard his needles' mystic rune,
46. Now rising, and now dying,
47. As erst Dodona's priestess heard
48. The oak leaves prophesying.

49. Was it the half-unconscious moan
50. Of one apart and mateless,
51. The weariness of unshared power,
52. The loneliness of greatness?

53. O dawns and sunsets, lend to him
54. Your beauty and your wonder!
55. Blithe sparrow, sing thy summer song
56. His solemn shadow under!

57. Play lightly on his slender keys,
58. O wind of summer, waking
59. For hills like these the sound of seas
60. On far-off beaches breaking,

61. And let the eagle and the crow
62. Find shelter in his branches,
63. When winds shake down his winter snow
64. In silver avalanches.

65. The brave are braver for their cheer,
66. The strongest need assurance,
67. The sigh of longing makes not less
68. The lesson of endurance.
