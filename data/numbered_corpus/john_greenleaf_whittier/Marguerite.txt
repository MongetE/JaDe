1. MASSACHUSETTS BAY, 1760.

2. THE robins sang in the orchard, the buds into
3. blossoms grew;
4. Little of human sorrow the buds and the robins
5. knew!
6. Sick, in an alien household, the poor French
7. neutral lay;
8. Into her lonesome garret fell the light of the April
9. day,
10. Through the dusty window, curtained by the spider's
11. warp and woof,
12. On the loose-laid floor of hemlock, on oaken ribs
13. of roof,
14. The bedquilt's faded patchwork, the teacups on the
15. stand,
16. The wheel with flaxen tangle, as it dropped from
17. her sick hand.

18. What to her was the song of the robin, or warm
19. morning light,
20. As she lay in the trance of the dying, heedless of
21. sound or sight?

22. Done was the work of her bands, she had eaten her
23. bitter bread;
24. The world of the alien people lay behind her dim
25. and dead.

26. But her soul went back to its child-time; she saw
27. the sun o'erflow
28. With gold the Basin of Minas, and set over
29. Gaspereau;

30. The low, bare flats at ebb-tide, the rush of the sea
31. at flood,
32. Through inlet and creek and river, from dike to
33. upland wood;

34. The gulls in the red of morning, the fish-hawk's
35. rise and fall,
36. The drift of the fog in moonshine, over the dark
37. coast-wall.

38. She saw the face of her mother, she heard the song
39. she sang;
40. And far off, faintly, slowly, the bell for vespers
41. rang.

42. By her bed the hard-faced mistress sat, smoothing
43. the wrinkled sheet,
44. Peering into the face, so helpless, and feeling the
45. ice-cold feet.

46. With a vague remorse atoning for her greed and
47. long abuse,
48. By care no longer heeded and pity too late for use.

49. Up the stairs of the garret softly the son of the
50. mistress stepped,
51. Leaned over the head-board, covering his face with
52. his hands, and wept.

53. Outspake the mother, who watched him sharply,
54. with brow a-frown
55. 'What! love you the Papist, the beggar, the
56. charge of the town?'

57. Be she Papist or beggar who lies here, I know
58. and God knows
59. I love her, and fain would go with her wherever
60. she goes!

61. 'O mother! that sweet face came pleading, for
62. love so athirst.
63. You saw but the town-charge; I knew her God's
64. angel at first.'

65. Shaking her gray head, the mistress hushed down
66. a bitter cry;
67. And awed by the silence and shadow of death
68. drawing nigh,

69. She murmured a psalm of the Bible; but closer
70. the young girl pressed,
71. With the last of her life in her fingers, the cross
72. to her breast.

73. 'My son, come away,' cried the mother, her voice
74. cruel grown.
75. 'She is joined to her idols, like Ephraim; let her
76. alone!'

77. But he knelt with his hand on her forehead, his
78. lips to her ear,
79. And he called back the soul that was passing
80. 'Marguerite, do you hear?'

81. She paused on the threshold of Heaven; love, pity,
82. surprise,
83. Wistful, tender, lit up for an instant the cloud of
84. her eyes.

85. With his heart on his lips he kissed her, but never
86. her cheek grew red,
87. And the words the living long for he spake in the
88. ear of the dead.

89. And the robins sang in the orchard, where buds to
90. blossoms grew;
91. Of the folded hands and the still face never the
92. robins knew!
