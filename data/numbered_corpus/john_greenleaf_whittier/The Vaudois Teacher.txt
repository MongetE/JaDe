1. 'O Lady fair, these silks of mine
2. are beautiful and rare,-
3. The richest web of the Indian loom, which beauty's
4. queen might wear;
5. And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck, with whose
6. radiant light they vie;
7. I have brought them with me a weary way,-will my
8. gentle lady buy?'

9. The lady smiled on the worn old man through the
10. dark and clustering curls
11. Which veiled her brow, as she bent to view his
12. silks and glittering pearls;
13. And she placed their price in the old man's hand
14. and lightly turned away,
15. But she paused at the wanderer's earnest call,-
16. 'My gentle lady, stay!

17. 'O lady fair, I have yet a gem which a purer
18. lustre flings,
19. Than the diamond flash of the jewelled crown on
20. the lofty brow of kings;
21. A wonderful pearl of exceeding price, whose virtue
22. shall not decay,
23. Whose light shall be as a spell to thee and a
24. blessing on thy way!'

25. The lady glanced at the mirroring steel where her
26. form of grace was seen,
27. Where her eye shone clear, and her dark locks
28. waved their clasping pearls between;
29. 'Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth, thou
30. traveller gray and old,
31. And name the price of thy precious gem, and my
32. page shall count thy gold.'

33. The cloud went off from the pilgrim's brow, as a
34. small and meagre book,
35. Unchased with gold or gem of cost, from his
36. folding robe he took!
37. 'Here, lady fair, is the pearl of price, may it prove
38. as such to thee
39. Nay, keep thy gold-I ask it not, for the word of
40. God is free!'

41. The hoary traveller went his way, but the gift he
42. left behind
43. Hath had its pure and perfect work on that high-
44. born maiden's mind,
45. And she hath turned from the pride of sin to the
46. lowliness of truth,
47. And given her human heart to God in its beautiful
48. hour of youth

49. And she hath left the gray old halls, where an evil
50. faith had power,
51. The courtly knights of her father's train, and the
52. maidens of her bower;
53. And she hath gone to the Vaudois vales by lordly
54. feet untrod,
55. Where the poor and needy of earth are rich in the
56. perfect love of God!
