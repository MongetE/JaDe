1. HE had bowed down to drunkenness,
2. An abject worshipper:
3. The pride of manhood's pulse had grown
4. Too faint and cold to stir;
5. And he had given his spirit up
6. To the unblessëd thrall,
7. And bowing to the poison cup,
8. He gloried in his fall!
9. There came a change —the cloud rolled off,
10. And light fell on his brain —
11. And like the passing of a dream
12. That cometh not again,
13. The shadow of the spirit fled.
14. He saw the gulf before,
15. He shuddered at the waste behind,
16. And was a man once more.
17. He shook the serpent folds away,
18. That gathered round his heart,
19. As shakes the swaying forest-oak
20. Its poison vine apart;
21. He stood erect; returning pride
22. Grew terrible within,
23. And conscience sat in judgment, on
24. His most familiar sin.
25. The light of Intellect again
26. Along his pathway shone;
27. And Reason like a monarch sat
28. Upon his olden throne.
29. The honored and the wise once more
30. Within his presence came;
31. And lingered oft on lovely lips
32. His once forbidden name.
33. There may be glory in the might,
34. That treadeth nations down;
35. Wreaths for the crimson conqueror,
36. Pride for the kingly crown;
37. But nobler is that triumph hour,
38. The disenthralled shall find,
39. When evil passion boweth down,
40. Unto the Godlike mind!
