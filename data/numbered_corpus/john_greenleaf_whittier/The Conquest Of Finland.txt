1. ACROSS the frozen marshes
2. The winds of autumn blow,
3. And the fen-lands of the Wetter
4. Are white with early snow.
5. But where the low, gray headlands
6. Look o'er the Baltic brine,
7. A bark is sailing in the track
8. Of England's battle-line.
9. No wares hath she to barter
10. For Bothnia's fish and grain;
11. She saileth not for pleasure,
12. She saileth not for gain.
13. But still by isle or mainland
14. She drops her, anchor down,
15. Where'er the British cannon
16. Rained fire on tower and town.
17. Outspake the ancient Amtman,
18. At the gate of Helsingfors:
19. 'Why comes this ship a-spying
20. In the track of England's wars?'
21. 'God bless her,' said the coast-guard, â€”
22. 'God bless the ship, I say.
23. The holy angels trim the sails
24. That speed her on her way!
25. 'Where'er she drops her anchor,
26. The peasant's heart is glad;
27. Where'er she spreads her parting sail,
28. The peasant's heart is sad.
29. 'Each wasted town and hamlet
30. She visits to restore;
31. To roof the shattered cabin,
32. And feed the starving poor.
33. ' The sunken boats of fishers,
34. The foraged beeves and grain,
35. The spoil of flake and storehouse,
36. The good ship brings again.
37. 'And so to Finland's sorrow
38. The sweet amend is made,
39. As if the healing hand of Christ
40. Upon her wounds were laid!'
41. Then said the gray old Amtman,
42. 'The will of God be done!
43. The battle lost by England's hate,
44. By England's love is won!
45. 'We braved the iron tempest
46. That thundered on our shore;
47. But when did kindness fail to find
48. The key to Finland's door?
49. 'No more from Aland's ramparts
50. Shall warning signal come,
51. Nor startled Sweaborg hear again
52. The roll of midnight drum.
53. 'Beside our fierce Black Eagle
54. The Dove of Peace shall rest;
55. And in the mouths of cannon
56. The sea-bird make her nest.
57. 'For Finland, looking seaward,
58. No coming foe shall scan;
59. And the holy bells of Abo
60. Shall ring, 'Good-will to man!'
61. 'Then row thy boat, O fisher!
62. In peace on lake and bay;
63. And thou, young maiden, dance again
64. Around the poles of May!
65. 'Sit down, old men, together,
66. Old wives, in quiet spin;
67. Henceforth the Anglo-Saxon
68. Is the brother of the Finn!'
