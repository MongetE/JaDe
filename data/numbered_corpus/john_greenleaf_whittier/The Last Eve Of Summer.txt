1. Summer's last sun nigh unto setting shines
2. Through yon columnar pines,
3. And on the deepening shadows of the lawn
4. Its golden lines are drawn.

5. Dreaming of long gone summer days like this,
6. Feeling the wind's soft kiss,
7. Grateful and glad that failing ear and sight
8. Have still their old delight,

9. I sit alone, and watch the warm, sweet day
10. Lapse tenderly away;
11. And, wistful, with a feeling of forecast,
12. I ask, 'Is this the last?

13. 'Will nevermore for me the seasons run
14. Their round, and will the sun
15. Of ardent summers yet to come forget
16. For me to rise and set?'

17. Thou shouldst be here, or I should be with thee
18. Wherever thou mayst be,
19. Lips mute, hands clasped, in silences of speech
20. Each answering unto each.

21. For this still hour, this sense of mystery far
22. Beyond the evening star,
23. No words outworn suffice on lip or scroll:
24. The soul would fain with soul

25. Wait, while these few swift-passing days fulfil
26. The wise-disposing Will,
27. And, in the evening as at morning, trust
28. The All-Merciful and Just.

29. The solemn joy that soul-communion feels
30. Immortal life reveals;
31. And human love, its prophecy and sign,
32. Interprets love divine.

33. Come then, in thought, if that alone may be,
34. O friend! and bring with thee
35. Thy calm assurance of transcendent Spheres
36. And the Eternal Years!
