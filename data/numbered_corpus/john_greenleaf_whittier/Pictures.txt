1. I.
2. Light, warmth, and sprouting greenness, and o'er all
3. Blue, stainless, steel-bright ether, raining down
4. Tranquillity upon the deep-hushed town,
5. The freshening meadows, and the hillsides brown;
6. Voice of the west-wind from the hills of pine,
7. And the brimmed river from its distant fall,
8. Low hum of bees, and joyous interlude
9. Of bird-songs in the streamlet-skirting wood,--
10. Heralds and prophecies of sound and sight,
11. Blessed forerunners of the warmth and light,
12. Attendant angels to the house of prayer,
13. With reverent footsteps keeping pace with mine,--
14. Once more, through God's great love, with you I share
15. A morn of resurrection sweet and fair
16. As that which saw, of old, in Palestine,
17. Immortal Love uprising in fresh bloom
18. From the dark night and winter of the tomb!


19. II.
20. White with its sun-bleached dust, the pathway winds
21. Before me; dust is on the shrunken grass,
22. And on the trees beneath whose boughs I pass;
23. Frail screen against the Hunter of the sky,
24. Who, glaring on me with his lidless eye,
25. While mounting with his dog-star high and higher
26. Ambushed in light intolerable, unbinds
27. The burnished quiver of his shafts of fire.
28. Between me and the hot fields of his South
29. A tremulous glow, as from a furnace-mouth,
30. Glimmers and swims before my dazzled sight,
31. As if the burning arrows of his ire
32. Broke as they fell, and shattered into light;
33. Yet on my cheek I feel the western wind,
34. And hear it telling to the orchard trees,
35. And to the faint and flower-forsaken bees,
36. Tales of fair meadows, green with constant streams,
37. And mountains rising blue and cool behind,
38. Where in moist dells the purple orchis gleams,
39. And starred with white the virgin's bower is twined.
40. So the o'erwearied pilgrim, as he fares
41. Along life's summer waste, at times is fanned,
42. Even at noontide, by the cool, sweet airs
43. Of a serener and a holier land,
44. Fresh as the morn, and as the dewfall bland.
45. Breath of the blessed Heaven for which we pray,
46. Blow from the eternal hills! make glad our earthly way!
