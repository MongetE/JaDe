1. AN EPISTLE NOT AFTER THE MANNER OF HORACE

2. Old friend, kind friend! lightly down
3. Drop time's snow-flakes on thy crown!
4. Never be thy shadow less,
5. Never fail thy cheerfulness;
6. Care, that kills the cat, may, plough
7. Wrinkles in the miser's brow,
8. Deepen envy's spiteful frown,
9. Draw the mouths of bigots down,
10. Plague ambition's dream, and sit
11. Heavy on the hypocrite,
12. Haunt the rich man's door, and ride
13. In the gilded coach of pride;--
14. Let the fiend pass!--what can he
15. Find to do with such as thee?
16. Seldom comes that evil guest
17. Where the conscience lies at rest,
18. And brown health and quiet wit
19. Smiling on the threshold sit.

20. I, the urchin unto whom,
21. In that smoked and dingy room,
22. Where the district gave thee rule
23. O'er its ragged winter school,
24. Thou didst teach the mysteries
25. Of those weary A B C's,--
26. Where, to fill the every pause
27. Of thy wise and learned saws,
28. Through the cracked and crazy wall
29. Came the cradle-rock and squall,
30. And the goodman's voice, at strife
31. With his shrill and tipsy wife,
32. Luring us by stories old,
33. With a comic unction told,
34. More than by the eloquence
35. Of terse birchen arguments
36. (Doubtful gain, I fear), to look
37. With complacence on a book!--
38. Where the genial pedagogue
39. Half forgot his rogues to flog,
40. Citing tale or apologue,
41. Wise and merry in its drift
42. As was Phaedrus' twofold gift,
43. Had the little rebels known it,
44. Risum et prudentiam monet!
45. I,--the man of middle years,
46. In whose sable locks appears
47. Many a warning fleck of gray,--
48. Looking back to that far day,
49. And thy primal lessons, feel
50. Grateful smiles my lips unseal,
51. As, remembering thee, I blend
52. Olden teacher, present friend,
53. Wise with antiquarian search,
54. In the scrolls of State and Church
55. Named on history's title-page,
56. Parish-clerk and justice sage;
57. For the ferule's wholesome awe
58. Wielding now the sword of law.

59. Threshing Time's neglected sheaves,
60. Gathering up the scattered leaves
61. Which the wrinkled sibyl cast
62. Careless from her as she passed,--
63. Twofold citizen art thou,
64. Freeman of the past and now.
65. He who bore thy name of old
66. Midway in the heavens did hold
67. Over Gibeon moon and sun;
68. Thou hast bidden them backward run;
69. Of to-day the present ray
70. Flinging over yesterday!

71. Let the busy ones deride
72. What I deem of right thy pride
73. Let the fools their treadmills grind,
74. Look not forward nor behind,
75. Shuffle in and wriggle out,
76. Veer with every breeze about,
77. Turning like a windmill sail,
78. Or a dog that seeks his tail;
79. Let them laugh to see thee fast
80. Tabernacled in the Past,
81. Working out with eye and lip,
82. Riddles of old penmanship,
83. Patient as Belzoni there
84. Sorting out, with loving care,
85. Mummies of dead questions stripped
86. From their sevenfold manuscript.

87. Dabbling, in their noisy way,
88. In the puddles of to-day,
89. Little know they of that vast
90. Solemn ocean of the past,
91. On whose margin, wreck-bespread,
92. Thou art walking with the dead,
93. Questioning the stranded years,
94. Waking smiles, by turns, and tears,
95. As thou callest up again
96. Shapes the dust has long o'erlain,--
97. Fair-haired woman, bearded man,
98. Cavalier and Puritan;
99. In an age whose eager view
100. Seeks but present things, and new,
101. Mad for party, sect and gold,
102. Teaching reverence for the old.

103. On that shore, with fowler's tact,
104. Coolly bagging fact on fact,
105. Naught amiss to thee can float,
106. Tale, or song, or anecdote;
107. Village gossip, centuries old,
108. Scandals by our grandams told,
109. What the pilgrim's table spread,
110. Where he lived, and whom he wed,
111. Long-drawn bill of wine and beer
112. For his ordination cheer,
113. Or the flip that wellnigh made
114. Glad his funeral cavalcade;
115. Weary prose, and poet's lines,
116. Flavored by their age, like wines,
117. Eulogistic of some quaint,
118. Doubtful, puritanic saint;
119. Lays that quickened husking jigs,
120. Jests that shook grave periwigs,
121. When the parson had his jokes
122. And his glass, like other folks;
123. Sermons that, for mortal hours,
124. Taxed our fathers' vital powers,
125. As the long nineteenthlies poured
126. Downward from the sounding-board,
127. And, for fire of Pentecost,
128. Touched their beards December's frost.

129. Time is hastening on, and we
130. What our fathers are shall be,--
131. Shadow-shapes of memory!
132. Joined to that vast multitude
133. Where the great are but the good,
134. And the mind of strength shall prove
135. Weaker than the heart of love;
136. Pride of graybeard wisdom less
137. Than the infant's guilelessness,
138. And his song of sorrow more
139. Than the crown the Psalmist wore
140. Who shall then, with pious zeal,
141. At our moss-grown thresholds kneel,
142. From a stained and stony page
143. Reading to a careless age,
144. With a patient eye like thine,
145. Prosing tale and limping line,
146. Names and words the hoary rime
147. Of the Past has made sublime?
148. Who shall work for us as well
149. The antiquarian's miracle?
150. Who to seeming life recall
151. Teacher grave and pupil small?
152. Who shall give to thee and me
153. Freeholds in futurity?

154. Well, whatever lot be mine,
155. Long and happy days be thine,
156. Ere thy full and honored age
157. Dates of time its latest page!
158. Squire for master, State for school,
159. Wisely lenient, live and rule;
160. Over grown-up knave and rogue
161. Play the watchful pedagogue;
162. Or, while pleasure smiles on duty,
163. At the call of youth and beauty,
164. Speak for them the spell of law
165. Which shall bar and bolt withdraw,
166. And the flaming sword remove
167. From the Paradise of Love.
168. Still, with undimmed eyesight, pore
169. Ancient tome and record o'er;
170. Still thy week-day lyrics croon,
171. Pitch in church the Sunday tune,
172. Showing something, in thy part,
173. Of the old Puritanic art,
174. Singer after Sternhold's heart
175. In thy pew, for many a year,
176. Homilies from Oldbug hear,
177. Who to wit like that of South,
178. And the Syrian's golden mouth,
179. Doth the homely pathos add
180. Which the pilgrim preachers had;
181. Breaking, like a child at play,
182. Gilded idols of the day,
183. Cant of knave and pomp of fool
184. Tossing with his ridicule,
185. Yet, in earnest or in jest,
186. Ever keeping truth abreast.
187. And, when thou art called, at last,
188. To thy townsmen of the past,
189. Not as stranger shalt thou come;
190. Thou shalt find thyself at home
191. With the little and the big,
192. Woollen cap and periwig,
193. Madam in her high-laced ruff,
194. Goody in her home-made stuff,--
195. Wise and simple, rich and poor,
196. Thou hast known them all before!
