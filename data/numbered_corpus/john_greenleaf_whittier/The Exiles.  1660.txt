1. The goodman sat beside his door
2. One sultry afternoon,
3. With his young wife singing at his side
4. An old and goodly tune.

5. A glimmer of heat was in the air,-
6. The dark green woods were still;
7. And the skirts of a heavy thunder-cloud
8. Hung over the western hill.

9. Black, thick, and vast arose that cloud
10. Above the wilderness,

11. As some dark world from upper air
12. Were stooping over this.

13. At times the solemn thunder pealed,
14. And all was still again,
15. Save a low murmur in the air
16. Of coming wind and rain.

17. Just as the first big rain-drop fell,
18. A weary stranger came,
19. And stood before the farmer's door,
20. With travel soiled and lame.

21. Sad seemed he, yet sustaining hope
22. Was in his quiet glance,
23. And peace, like autumn's moonlight, clothed
24. His tranquil countenance,-

25. A look, like that his Master wore
26. In Pilate's council-hall:
27. It told of wrongs, but of a love
28. Meekly forgiving all.

29. 'Friend! wilt thou give me shelter here?'
30. The stranger meekly said;
31. And, leaning on his oaken staff,
32. The goodman's features read.

33. 'My life is hunted,-evil men
34. Are following in my track;
35. The traces of the torturer's whip
36. Are on my aged back;

37. 'And much, I fear, 't will peril thee
38. Within thy doors to take
39. A hunted seeker of the Truth,
40. Oppressed for conscience' sake.'

41. Oh, kindly spoke the goodman's wife,
42. 'Come in, old man!' quoth she,
43. 'We will not leave thee to the storm,
44. Whoever thou mayst be.'

45. Then came the aged wanderer in,
46. And silent sat him down;
47. While all within grew dark as night
48. Beneath the storm-cloud's frown.

49. But while the sudden lightning's blaze
50. Filled every cottage nook,
51. And with the jarring thunder-roll
52. The loosened casements shook,

53. A heavy tramp of horses' feet
54. Came sounding up the lane,
55. And half a score of horse, or more,
56. Came plunging through the rain.

57. 'Now, Goodman Macy, ope thy door,-
58. We would not be house-breakers;
59. A rueful deed thou'st done this day,
60. In harboring banished Quakers.'

61. Out looked the cautious goodman then,
62. With much of fear and awe,
63. For there, with broad wig drenched with rain
64. The parish priest he saw.

65. Open thy door, thou wicked man,
66. And let thy pastor in,
67. And give God thanks, if forty stripes
68. Repay thy deadly sin.'

69. 'What seek ye?' quoth the goodman;
70. 'The stranger is my guest;
71. He is worn with toil and grievous wrong,-
72. Pray let the old man rest.'

73. 'Now, out upon thee, canting knave!'
74. And strong hands shook the door.
75. 'Believe me, Macy,' quoth the priest,
76. 'Thou 'lt rue thy conduct sore.'

77. Then kindled Macy's eye of fire
78. 'No priest who walks the earth,
79. Shall pluck away the stranger-guest
80. Made welcome to my hearth.'

81. Down from his cottage wall he caught
82. The matchlock, hotly tried
83. At Preston-pans and Marston-moor,
84. By fiery Ireton's side;

85. Where Puritan, and Cavalier,
86. With shout and psalm contended;
87. And Rupert's oath, and Cromwell's prayer,
88. With battle-thunder blended.

89. Up rose the ancient stranger then
90. 'My spirit is not free
91. To bring the wrath and violence
92. Of evil men on thee;

93. 'And for thyself, I pray forbear,
94. Bethink thee of thy Lord,
95. Who healed again the smitten ear,
96. And sheathed His follower's sword.

97. 'I go, as to the slaughter led.
98. Friends of the poor, farewell!'
99. Beneath his hand the oaken door
100. Back on its hinges fell.

101. 'Come forth, old graybeard, yea and nay,'
102. The reckless scoffers cried,
103. As to a horseman's saddle-bow
104. The old man's arms were tied.

105. And of his bondage hard and long
106. In Boston's crowded jail,
107. Where suffering woman's prayer was heard,
108. With sickening childhood's wail,

109. It suits not with our tale to tell;
110. Those scenes have passed away;
111. Let the dim shadows of the past
112. Brood o'er that evil day.

113. 'Ho, sheriff!' quoth the ardent priest,
114. 'Take Goodman Macy too;
115. The sin of this day's heresy
116. His back or purse shall rue.'

117. 'Now, goodwife, haste thee!' Macy cried.
118. She caught his manly arm;
119. Behind, the parson urged pursuit,
120. With outcry and alarm.

121. Ho! speed the Macys, neck or naught,-
122. The river-course was near;
123. The plashing on its pebbled shore
124. Was music to their ear.

125. A gray rock, tasselled o'er with birch,
126. Above the waters hung,
127. And at its base, with every wave,
128. A small light wherry swung.

129. A leap-they gain the boat-and there
130. The goodman wields his oar;
131. 'Ill luck betide them all,' he cried,
132. 'The laggards on the shore.'

133. Down through the crashing underwood,
134. The burly sheriff came:-
135. 'Stand, Goodman Macy, yield thyself;
136. Yield in the King's own name.'

137. 'Now out upon thy hangman's face!'
138. Bold Macy answered then,-
139. 'Whip women, on the village green,
140. But meddle not with men.'

141. The priest came panting to the shore,
142. His grave cocked hat was gone;
143. Behind him, like some owl's nest, hung
144. His wig upon a thorn.

145. 'Come back,-come back!' the parson cried,
146. 'The church's curse beware.'
147. 'Curse, an' thou wilt,' said Macy, 'but
148. Thy blessing prithee spare.'

149. 'Vile scoffer!' cried the baffled priest,
150. 'Thou 'lt yet the gallows see.'
151. 'Who's born to be hanged will not be drowned,'
152. Quoth Macy, merrily;

153. 'And so, sir sheriff and priest, good-by!'
154. He bent him to his oar,
155. And the small boat glided quietly
156. From the twain upon the shore.

157. Now in the west, the heavy clouds
158. Scattered and fell asunder,
159. While feebler came the rush of rain,
160. And fainter growled the thunder.

161. And through the broken clouds, the sun
162. Looked out serene and warm,
163. Painting its holy symbol-light
164. Upon the passing storm.

165. Oh, beautiful! that rainbow span,
166. O'er dim Crane-neck was bended;
167. One bright foot touched the eastern hills,
168. And one with ocean blended.

169. By green Pentucket's southern'slope
170. The small boat glided fast;
171. The watchers of the Block-house saw
172. The strangers as they passed.

173. That night a stalwart garrison
174. Sat shaking in their shoes,
175. To hear the dip of Indian oars,
176. The glide of birch canoes.

177. The fisher-wives of Salisbury-
178. The men were all away-
179. Looked out to see the stranger oar
180. Upon their waters play.

181. Deer-Island's rocks and fir-trees threw
182. Their sunset-shadows o'er them,
183. And Newbury's spire and weathercock
184. Peered o'er the pines before them.

185. Around the Black Rocks, on their left,
186. The marsh lay broad and green;
187. And on their right, with dwarf shrubs crowned,
188. Plum Island's hills were seen.

189. With skilful hand and wary eye
190. The harbor-bar was crossed;
191. A plaything of the restless wave,
192. The boat on ocean tossed.

193. The glory of the sunset heaven
194. On land and water lay;
195. On the steep hills of Agawam,
196. On cape, and bluff, and bay.

197. They passed the gray rocks of Cape Ann,
198. And Gloucester's harbor-bar;
199. The watch-fire of the garrison
200. Shone like a setting star.

201. How brightly broke the morning
202. On Massachusetts Bay!
203. Blue wave, and bright green island,
204. Rejoicing in the day.

205. On passed the bark in safety
206. Round isle and headland steep;
207. No tempest broke above them,
208. No fog-cloud veiled the deep.

209. Far round the bleak and stormy Cape
210. The venturous Macy passed,
211. And on Nantucket's naked isle
212. Drew up his boat at last.

213. And how, in log-built cabin,
214. They braved the rough sea-weather;
215. And there, in peace and quietness,
216. Went down life's vale together;

217. How others drew around them,
218. And how their fishing sped,
219. Until to every wind of heaven
220. Nantucket's sails were spread;

221. How pale Want alternated
222. With Plenty's golden smile;
223. Behold, is it not written
224. In the annals of the isle?

225. And yet that isle remaineth
226. A refuge of the free,
227. As when true-hearted Macy
228. Beheld it from the sea.

229. Free as the winds that winnow
230. Her shrubless hills of sand,
231. Free as the waves that batter
232. Along her yielding land.

233. Than hers, at duty's summons,
234. No loftier spirit stirs,
235. Nor falls o'er human suffering
236. A readier tear then hers.

237. God bless the sea-beat island!
238. And grant forevermore,
239. That charity and freedom dwell
240. As now upon her shore!
