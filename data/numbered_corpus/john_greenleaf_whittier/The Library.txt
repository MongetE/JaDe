1. 'Let there be light!' God spake of old,
2. And over chaos dark and cold,
3. And through the dead and formless frame
4. Of nature, life and order came.

5. Faint was the light at first that shone
6. On giant fern and mastodon,
7. On half-formed plant and beast of prey,
8. And man as rude and wild as they.

9. Age after age, like waves, o'erran
10. The earth, uplifting brute and man;
11. And mind, at length, in symbols dark
12. Its meanings traced on stone and bark.

13. On leaf of palm, on sedge-wrought roll,
14. On plastic clay and leathern scroll,
15. Man wrote his thoughts; the ages passed,
16. And to! the Press was found at last!

17. Then dead souls woke; the thoughts of men
18. Whose bones were dust revived again;
19. The cloister's silence found a tongue,
20. Old prophets spake, old poets sung.

21. And here, to-day, the dead look down,
22. The kings of mind again we crown;
23. We hear the voices lost so long,
24. The sage's word, the sibyl's song.

25. Here Greek and Roman find themselves
26. Alive along these crowded shelves;
27. And Shakespeare treads again his stage,
28. And Chaucer paints anew his age.

29. As if some Pantheon's marbles broke
30. Their stony trance, and lived and spoke,
31. Life thrills along the alcoved hall,
32. The lords of thought await our call!
