1. FROM gold to gray
2. Our mild sweet day
3. Of Indian Summer fades too soon;
4. But tenderly
5. Above the sea
6. Hangs, white and calm, the hunter's moon.
7. In its pale fire,
8. The village spire
9. Shows like the zodiac's spectral lance;
10. The painted walls
11. Whereon it falls
12. Transfigured stand in marble trance!
13. O'er fallen leaves
14. The west-wind grieves,
15. Yet comes a seed-time round again;
16. And morn shall see
17. The State sown free
18. With baleful tares or healthful grain.
19. Along the street
20. The shadows meet
21. Of Destiny, whose hands conceal
22. The moulds of fate
23. That shape the State,
24. And make or mar the common weal.
25. Around I see
26. The powers that be;
27. I stand by Empire's primal springs;
28. And princes meet,
29. In every street,
30. And hear the tread of uncrowned kings!
31. Hark! through the crowd
32. The laugh runs loud,
33. Beneath the sad, rebuking moon.
34. God save the land
35. A careless hand
36. May shake or swerve ere morrow's noon!
37. No jest is this;
38. One cast amiss
39. May blast the hope of Freedom's year.
40. Oh, take me where
41. Are hearts of prayer,
42. And foreheads bowed in reverent fear!
43. Not lightly fall
44. Beyond recall
45. The written scrolls a breath can float;
46. The crowning fact
47. The kingliest act
48. Of Freedom is the freeman's vote!
49. For pearls that gem
50. A diadem
51. The diver in the deep sea dies;
52. The regal right
53. We boast to-night
54. Is ours through costlier sacrifice;
55. The blood of Vane,
56. His prison pain
57. Who traced the path the Pilgrim trod,
58. And hers whose faith
59. Drew strength from death,
60. And prayed her Russell up to God!
61. Our hearts grow cold,
62. We lightly hold
63. A right which brave men died to gain;
64. The stake, the cord,
65. The axe, the sword,
66. Grim nurses at its birth of pain.
67. The shadow rend,
68. And o'er us bend,
69. O martyrs, with your crowns and palms;
70. Breathe through these throngs
71. Your battle songs,
72. Your scaffold prayers, and dungeon psalms!
73. Look from the sky,
74. Like God's great eye,
75. Thou solemn moon, with searching beam,
76. Till in the sight
77. Of thy pure light
78. Our mean self-seekings meaner seem.
79. Shame from our hearts
80. Unworthy arts,
81. The fraud designed, the purpose dark;
82. And smite away
83. The hands we lay
84. Profanely on the sacred ark.
85. To party claims
86. And private aims,
87. Reveal that august face of Truth,
88. Whereto are given
89. The age of heaven,
90. The beauty of immortal youth.
91. So shall our voice
92. Of sovereign choice
93. Swell the deep bass of duty done,
94. And strike the key
95. Of time to be,
96. When God and man shall speak as one!
