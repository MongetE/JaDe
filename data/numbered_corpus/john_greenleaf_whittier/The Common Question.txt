1. Behind us at our evening meal
2. The gray bird ate his fill,
3. Swung downward by a single claw,
4. And wiped his hooked bill.

5. He shook his wings and crimson tail,
6. And set his head aslant,
7. And, in his sharp, impatient way,
8. Asked, 'What does Charlie want?'

9. 'Fie, silly bird!' I answered, 'tuck
10. Your head beneath your wing,
11. And go to sleep;'--but o'er and o'er
12. He asked the self-same thing.

13. Then, smiling, to myself I said
14. How like are men and birds!
15. We all are saying what he says,
16. In action or in words.

17. The boy with whip and top and drum,
18. The girl with hoop and doll,
19. And men with lands and houses, ask
20. The question of Poor Poll.

21. However full, with something more
22. We fain the bag would cram;
23. We sigh above our crowded nets
24. For fish that never swam.

25. No bounty of indulgent Heaven
26. The vague desire can stay;
27. Self-love is still a Tartar mill
28. For grinding prayers alway.

29. The dear God hears and pities all;
30. He knoweth all our wants;
31. And what we blindly ask of Him
32. His love withholds or grants.

33. And so I sometimes think our prayers
34. Might well be merged in one;
35. And nest and perch and hearth and church
36. Repeat, 'Thy will be done.'
