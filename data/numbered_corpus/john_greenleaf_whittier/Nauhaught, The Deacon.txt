1. NAUHAUGHT, the Indian deacon, who of old
2. Dwelt, poor but blameless, where his narrowing Cape
3. Stretches its shrunk arm out to all the winds
4. And the relentless smiting of the waves,
5. Awoke one morning from a pleasant dream
6. Of a good angel dropping in his hand
7. A fair, broad gold-piece, in the name of God.

8. He rose and went forth with the early day
9. Far inland, where the voices of the waves
10. Mellowed and Mingled with the whispering leaves,
11. As, through the tangle of the low, thick woods,
12. He searched his traps. Therein nor beast nor bird
13. He found; though meanwhile in the reedy pools
14. The otter plashed, and underneath the pines
15. The partridge drummed: and as his thoughts went back
16. To the sick wife and little child at home,
17. What marvel that the poor man felt his faith
18. Too weak to bear its burden,--like a rope
19. That, strand by strand uncoiling, breaks above
20. The hand that grasps it. 'Even now, O Lord!
21. Send me,' he prayed, 'the angel of my dream!
22. Nauhaught is very poor; he cannot wait.'

23. Even as he spake he heard at his bare feet
24. A low, metallic clink, and, looking down,
25. He saw a dainty purse with disks of gold
26. Crowding its silken net. Awhile he held
27. The treasure up before his eyes, alone
28. With his great need, feeling the wondrous coins
29. Slide through his eager fingers, one by one.
30. So then the dream was true. The angel brought
31. One broad piece only; should he take all these?
32. Who would be wiser, in the blind, dumb woods?
33. The loser, doubtless rich, would scarcely miss
34. This dropped crumb from a table always full.
35. Still, while he mused, he seemed to hear the cry
36. Of a starved child; the sick face of his wife
37. Tempted him. Heart and flesh in fierce revolt
38. Urged the wild license of his savage youth
39. Against his later scruples. Bitter toil,
40. Prayer, fasting, dread of blame, and pitiless eyes
41. To watch his halting,--had he lost for these
42. The freedom of the woods;--the hunting-grounds
43. Of happy spirits for a walled-in heaven
44. Of everlasting psalms? One healed the sick
45. Very far off thousands of moons ago
46. Had he not prayed him night and day to come
47. And cure his bed-bound wife? Was there a hell?
48. Were all his fathers' people writhing there--
49. Like the poor shell-fish set to boil alive--
50. Forever, dying never? If he kept
51. This gold, so needed, would the dreadful God
52. Torment him like a Mohawk's captive stuck
53. With slow-consuming splinters? Would the saints
54. And the white angels dance and laugh to see him
55. Burn like a pitch-pine torch? His Christian garb
56. Seemed falling from him; with the fear and shame
57. Of Adam naked at the cool of day,
58. He gazed around. A black snake lay in coil
59. On the hot sand, a crow with sidelong eye
60. Watched from a dead bough. All his Indian lore
61. Of evil blending with a convert's faith
62. In the supernal terrors of the Book,
63. He saw the Tempter in the coiling snake
64. And ominous, black-winged bird; and all the while
65. The low rebuking of the distant waves
66. Stole in upon him like the voice of God
67. Among the trees of Eden. Girding up
68. His soul's loins with a resolute hand, he thrust
69. The base thought from him: 'Nauhaught, be a man
70. Starve, if need be; but, while you live, look out
71. From honest eyes on all men, unashamed.
72. God help me! I am deacon of the church,
73. A baptized, praying Indian! Should I do
74. This secret meanness, even the barken knots
75. Of the old trees would turn to eyes to see it,
76. The birds would tell of it, and all the leaves
77. Whisper above me: 'Nauhaught is a thief!'
78. The sun would know it, and the stars that hide
79. Behind his light would watch me, and at night
80. Follow me with their sharp, accusing eyes.
81. Yea, thou, God, seest me!' Then Nauhaught drew
82. Closer his belt of leather, dulling thus
83. The pain of hunger, and walked bravely back
84. To the brown fishing-hamlet by the sea;
85. And, pausing at the inn-door, cheerily asked
86. 'Who hath lost aught to-day?'
87. 'I,' said a voice;
88. 'Ten golden pieces, in a silken purse,
89. My daughter's handiwork.' He looked, and to
90. One stood before him in a coat of frieze,
91. And the glazed bat of a seafaring man,
92. Shrewd-faced, broad-shouldered, with no trace of wings.
93. Marvelling, he dropped within the stranger's hand
94. The silken web, and turned to go his way.
95. But the man said: 'A tithe at least is yours;
96. Take it in God's name as an honest man.'
97. And as the deacon's dusky fingers closed
98. Over the golden gift, 'Yea, in God's name
99. I take it, with a poor man's thanks,' he said.
100. So down the street that, like a river of sand,
101. Ran, white in sunshine, to the summer sea,
102. He sought his home singing and praising God;
103. And when his neighbors in their careless way
104. Spoke of the owner of the silken purse--
105. A Wellfleet skipper, known in every port
106. That the Cape opens in its sandy wall--
107. He answered, with a wise smile, to himself
108. 'I saw the angel where they see a man.'
