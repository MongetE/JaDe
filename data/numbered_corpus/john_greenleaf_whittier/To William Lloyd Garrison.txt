1. CHAMPION of those who groan beneath
2. Oppression's iron hand:
3. In view of penury, hate, and death,
4. I see thee fearless stand.
5. Still bearing up thy lofty brow,
6. In the steadfast strength of truth,
7. In manhood sealing well the vow
8. And promise of thy youth.
9. Go on, for thou hast chosen well;
10. On in the strength of God!
11. Long as one human heart shall swell
12. Beneath the tyrant's rod.
13. Speak in a slumbering nation's ear,
14. As thou hast ever spoken,
15. Until the dead in sin shall hear,
16. The fetter's link be broken!
17. I love thee with a brother's love,
18. I feel my pulses thrill,
19. To mark thy Spirit soar above
20. The cloud of human ill.
21. My heart hath leaped to answer thine,
22. And echo back thy words,
23. As leaps the warrior's at the shine
24. And flash of kindred swords!
25. They tell me thou art rash and vain,
26. A searcher after fame;
27. That thou art striving but to gain
28. A long-enduring name;
29. That thou hast nerved the Afric's hand
30. And steeled the Afric's heart,
31. To shake aloft his vengeful brand,
32. And rend his chain apart.
33. Have I not known thee well, and read
34. Thy mighty purpose long?
35. And watched the trials which have made
36. Thy human spirit strong?
37. And shall the slanderer's demon breath
38. Avail with one like me,
39. To dim the sunshine of my faith
40. And earnest trust in thee?
41. Go on, the dagger's point may glare
42. Amid thy pathway's gloom;
43. The fate which sternly threatens there
44. Is glorious martyrdom!
45. Then onward with a martyr's zeal;
46. And wait thy sure reward
47. When man to man no more shall kneel,
48. And God alone be Lord!
