1. WE give thy natal day to hope,
2. O Country of our love and prayer!
3. Thy way is down no fatal slope,
4. But up to freer sun and air.
5. Tried as by furnace-fires, and yet
6. By God's grace only stronger made,
7. In future tasks before thee set
8. Thou shalt not lack the old-time aid.
9. The fathers sleep, but men remain
10. As wise, as true, and brave as they;
11. Why count the loss and not the gain?
12. The best is that we have to-day.
13. Whate'er of folly, shame, or crime,
14. Withhin thy mighty bounds transpires,
15. With speed defying space and time
16. Comes to us on the accusing wires;
17. While of thy wealth of noble deeds,
18. Thy homes of peace, thy votes unsold,
19. The love that pleads for human needs,
20. The wrong redressed, but half is told!
21. We read each felon's chronicle,
22. His acts, his words, his gallows-mood;
23. We know the single sinner well
24. And not the nine and ninety good.
25. Yet if, on daily scandals fed,
26. We seem at times to doubt thy worth,
27. We know thee still, when all is said,
28. The best and dearest spot on earth.
29. From the warm Mexic Gulf, or where
30. Belted with flowers Los Angeles
31. Basks in the semi-tropic air,
32. To where Katahdin's cedar trees
33. Are dwarfed and bent by Northern winds,
34. Thy plenty's horn is yearly filled;
35. Alone, the rounding century finds
36. Thy liberal soil by free hands tilled.
37. A refuge for the wronged and poor,
38. Thy generous heart has borne the blame
39. That, with them, through thy open door,
40. The old world's evil outcasts came.
41. But, with thy just and equal rule,
42. And labor's need and breadth of lands,
43. Free press and rostrum, church and school,
44. Thy sure, if slow, transforming hands
45. Shall mould even them to thy design,
46. Making a blessing of the ban;
47. And Freedom's chemistry combine
48. The alien elements of man.
49. The power that broke their prison bar
50. And set the dusky millions free,
51. And welded in the flame of war
52. The Union fast to Liberty,
53. Shall if not deal with other ills,
54. Redress the red man's grievance, break
55. The Circean cup which shames and kills
56. And Labor full requital make?
57. Alone to such as fitly bear
58. Thy civic honors bid them fall?
59. And call thy daughters forth to share
60. The rights and duties pledged to all?
61. Give every child his right of school,
62. Merge private greed in public good,
63. And spare a treasury overfull
64. The tax upon a poor man's food?
65. No lack was in thy primal stock,
66. No weakling founders builded here;
67. Thine were the men of Plymouth Rock,
68. The Huguenot and Cavalier;
69. And they whose firm endurance gained
70. The freedom of the souls of men,
71. Whose hands, unstained with blood, maintained
72. The swordless commonwealth of Penn.
73. And thine shall be the power of all
74. To do the work which duty bids,
75. And make the people's council hall
76. As lasting as the Pyramids!
77. Well have thy later years made good
78. Thy brave-said word a century back,
79. The pledge of human brotherhood,
80. The equal claim of white and black.
81. That word still echoes round the world,
82. And all who hear it turn to thee,
83. And read upon thy flag unfurled
84. The prophecies of destiny.
85. Thy great world-lesson all shall learn,
86. The nations in thy school shall sit,
87. Earth's farthest mountain-tops shall burn
88. With watch-fires from thy own uplit.
89. Great without seeking to be great
90. By fraud or conquest, rich in gold,
91. But richer in the large estate
92. Of virtue which thy children hold,
93. With peace that comes of purity
94. And strength to simple justice due,
95. So runs our loyal dream of thee;
96. God of our fathers! make it true.
97. O Land of lands! to thee we give
98. Our prayers, our hopes, our service free;
99. For thee thy sons shall nobly live,
100. And at thy need shall die for thee!
