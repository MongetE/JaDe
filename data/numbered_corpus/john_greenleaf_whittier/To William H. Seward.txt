1. STATESMAN, I thank thee! and, if yet dissent
2. Mingles, reluctant, with my large content,
3. I cannot censure what was nobly meant.
4. But, while constrained to hold even Union less
5. Than Liberty and Truth and Righteousness,
6. I thank thee in the sweet and holy name
7. Of peace, for wise calm words that put to shame
8. Passion and party. Courage may be shown
9. Not in defiance of the wrong alone;
10. He may be bravest who, unweaponed, bears
11. The olive branch, and, strong in justice, spares
12. The rash wrong-doer, giving widest scope
13. To Christian charity and generous hope.
14. If, without damage to the sacred cause
15. Of Freedom and the safeguard of its laws â€”
16. If, without yielding that for which alone
17. We prize the Union, thou canst save it now
18. From a baptism of blood, upon thy brow
19. A wreath whose flowers no earthly soil have known,
20. Woven of the beatitudes, shall rest,
21. And the peacemaker be forever blest!
