1. Beside that milestone where the level sun,
2. Nigh unto setting, sheds his last, low rays
3. On word and work irrevocably done,
4. Life's blending threads of good and ill outspun,
5. I hear, O friends! your words of cheer and praise,
6. Half doubtful if myself or otherwise.
7. Like him who, in the old Arabian joke,
8. A beggar slept and crowned Caliph woke.
9. Thanks not the less. With not unglad surprise
10. I see my life-work through your partial eyes;
11. Assured, in giving to my home-taught songs
12. A higher value than of right belongs,
13. You do but read between the written lines
14. The finer grace of unfulfilled designs.
