1. TO A YOUNG PHYSICIAN, WITH DORE'S PICTURE OF CHRIST
2. HEALING THE SICK.

3. So stood of old the holy Christ
4. Amidst the suffering throng;
5. With whom His lightest touch sufficed
6. To make the weakest strong.

7. That healing gift He lends to them
8. Who use it in His name;
9. The power that filled His garment's hem
10. Is evermore the same.

11. For lo! in human hearts unseen
12. The Healer dwelleth still,
13. And they who make His temples clean
14. The best subserve His will.

15. The holiest task by Heaven decreed,
16. An errand all divine,
17. The burden of our common need
18. To render less is thine.

19. The paths of pain are thine. Go forth
20. With patience, trust, and hope;
21. The sufferings of a sin-sick earth
22. Shall give thee ample scope.

23. Beside the unveiled mysteries
24. Of life and death go stand,
25. With guarded lips and reverent eyes
26. And pure of heart and hand.

27. So shalt thou be with power endued
28. From Him who went about
29. The Syrian hillsides doing good,
30. And casting demons out.

31. That Good Physician liveth yet
32. Thy friend and guide to be;
33. The Healer by Gennesaret
34. Shall walk the rounds with thee.
