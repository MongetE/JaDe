1. INSCRIBED TO ROBERT C. WATERSTON, OF BOSTON.

2. Fold her, O Father, in Thine arms,
3. And let her henceforth be
4. A messenger of love between
5. Our human hearts and Thee.

6. I give thee joy!--I know to thee
7. The dearest spot on earth must be
8. Where sleeps thy loved one by the summer sea;

9. Where, near her sweetest poet's tomb,
10. The land of Virgil gave thee room
11. To lay thy flower with her perpetual bloom.

12. I know that when the sky shut down
13. Behind thee on the gleaming town,
14. On Baiae's baths and Posilippo's crown;

15. And, through thy tears, the mocking day
16. Burned Ischia's mountain lines away,
17. And Capri melted in its sunny bay;

18. Through thy great farewell sorrow shot
19. The sharp pang of a bitter thought
20. That slaves must tread around that holy spot.

21. Thou knewest not the land was blest
22. In giving thy beloved rest,
23. Holding the fond hope closer to her breast,

24. That every sweet and saintly grave
25. Was freedom's prophecy, and gave
26. The pledge of Heaven to sanctify and save.

27. That pledge is answered. To thy ear
28. The unchained city sends its cheer,
29. And, tuned to joy, the muffled bells of fear

30. Ring Victor in. The land sits free
31. And happy by the summer sea,
32. And Bourbon Naples now is Italy!

33. She smiles above her broken chain
34. The languid smile that follows pain,
35. Stretching her cramped limbs to the sun again.

36. Oh, joy for all, who hear her call
37. From gray Camaldoli's convent-wall
38. And Elmo's towers to freedom's carnival!

39. A new life breathes among her vines
40. And olives, like the breath of pines
41. Blown downward from the breezy Apennines.

42. Lean, O my friend, to meet that breath,
43. Rejoice as one who witnesseth
44. Beauty from ashes rise, and life from death!

45. Thy sorrow shall no more be pain,
46. Its tears shall fall in sunlit rain,
47. Writing the grave with flowers: 'Arisen again!'
