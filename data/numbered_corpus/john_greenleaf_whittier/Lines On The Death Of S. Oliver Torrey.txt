1. SECRETARY OF THE BOSTON YOUNG MEN'S ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.

2. Gone before us, O our brother,
3. To the spirit-land!
4. Vainly look we for another
5. In thy place to stand.
6. Who shall offer youth and beauty
7. On the wasting shrine
8. Of a stern and lofty duty,
9. With a faith like thine?

10. Oh, thy gentle smile of greeting
11. Who again shall see?
12. Who amidst the solemn meeting
13. Gaze again on thee?
14. Who when peril gathers o'er us,
15. Wear so calm a brow?
16. Who, with evil men before us,
17. So serene as thou?

18. Early hath the spoiler found thee,
19. Brother of our love!
20. Autumn's faded earth around thee,
21. And its storms above!
22. Evermore that turf lie lightly,
23. And, with future showers,
24. O'er thy slumbers fresh and brightly
25. Blow the summer flowers

26. In the locks thy forehead gracing,
27. Not a silvery streak;
28. Nor a line of sorrow's tracing
29. On thy fair young cheek;
30. Eyes of light and lips of roses,
31. Such as Hylas wore,--
32. Over all that curtain closes,
33. Which shall rise no more!

34. Will the vigil Love is keeping
35. Round that grave of thine,
36. Mournfully, like Jazer weeping
37. Over Sibmah's vine;
38. Will the pleasant memories, swelling
39. Gentle hearts, of thee,
40. In the spirit's distant dwelling
41. All unheeded be?

42. If the spirit ever gazes,
43. From its journeyings, back;
44. If the immortal ever traces
45. O'er its mortal track;
46. Wilt thou not, O brother, meet us
47. Sometimes on our way,
48. And, in hours of sadness, greet us
49. As a spirit may?

50. Peace be with thee, O our brother,
51. In the spirit-land
52. Vainly look we for another
53. In thy place to stand.
54. Unto Truth and Freedom giving
55. All thy early powers,
56. Be thy virtues with the living,
57. And thy spirit ours!
