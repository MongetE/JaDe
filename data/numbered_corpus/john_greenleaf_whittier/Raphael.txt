1. I shall not soon forget that sight
2. The glow of Autumn's westering day,
3. A hazy warmth, a dreamy light,
4. On Raphael's picture lay.

5. It was a simple print I saw,
6. The fair face of a musing boy;
7. Yet, while I gazed, a sense of awe
8. Seemed blending with my joy.

9. A simple print,--the graceful flow
10. Of boyhood's soft and wavy hair,
11. And fresh young lip and cheek, and brow
12. Unmarked and clear, were there.

13. Yet through its sweet and calm repose
14. I saw the inward spirit shine;
15. It was as if before me rose
16. The white veil of a shrine.

17. As if, as Gothland's sage has told,
18. The hidden life, the man within,
19. Dissevered from its frame and mould,
20. By mortal eye were seen.

21. Was it the lifting of that eye,
22. The waving of that pictured hand?
23. Loose as a cloud-wreath on the sky,
24. I saw the walls expand.

25. The narrow room had vanished,--space,
26. Broad, luminous, remained alone,
27. Through which all hues and shapes of grace
28. And beauty looked or shone.

29. Around the mighty master came
30. The marvels which his pencil wrought,
31. Those miracles of power whose fame
32. Is wide as human thought.

33. There drooped thy more than mortal face,
34. O Mother, beautiful and mild
35. Enfolding in one dear embrace
36. Thy Saviour and thy Child!

37. The rapt brow of the Desert John;
38. The awful glory of that day
39. When all the Father's brightness shone
40. Through manhood's veil of clay.

41. And, midst gray prophet forms, and wild
42. Dark visions of the days of old,
43. How sweetly woman's beauty smiled
44. Through locks of brown and gold!

45. There Fornarina's fair young face
46. Once more upon her lover shone,
47. Whose model of an angel's grace
48. He borrowed from her own.

49. Slow passed that vision from my view,
50. But not the lesson which it taught;
51. The soft, calm shadows which it threw
52. Still rested on my thought:

53. The truth, that painter, bard, and sage,
54. Even in Earth's cold and changeful clime,
55. Plant for their deathless heritage
56. The fruits and flowers of time.

57. We shape ourselves the joy or fear
58. Of which the coming life is made,
59. And fill our Future's atmosphere
60. With sunshine or with shade.

61. The tissue of the Life to be
62. We weave with colors all our own,
63. And in the field of Destiny
64. We reap as we have sown.

65. Still shall the soul around it call
66. The shadows which it gathered here,
67. And, painted on the eternal wall,
68. The Past shall reappear.

69. Think ye the notes of holy song
70. On Milton's tuneful ear have died?
71. Think ye that Raphael's angel throng
72. Has vanished from his side?

73. Oh no!--We live our life again;
74. Or warmly touched, or coldly dim,
75. The pictures of the Past remain,---
76. Man's works shall follow him!
