1. A PIOUS magistrate! sound his praise throughout
2. The wondering churches. Who shall henceforth doubt
3. That the long-wished millennium draweth nigh?
4. Sin in high places has become devout,
5. Tithes mint, goes painful-faced, and prays its lie
6. Straight up to Heaven, and calls it piety!
7. The pirate, watching from his bloody deck
8. The weltering galleon, heavy with the gold
9. Of Acapulco, holding death in check
10. While prayers are said, brows crossed, and beads are told;
11. The robber, kneeling where the wayside cross
12. On dark Abruzzo tells of life's dread loss
13. From his own carbine, glancing still abroad
14. For some new victim, offering thanks to God!
15. Rome, listening at her altars to the cry
16. Of midnight Murder, while her hounds of hell
17. Scour France, from baptized cannon and holy bell
18. And thousand-throated priesthood, loud and high,
19. Pealing Te Deums to the shuddering sky,
20. 'Thanks to the Lord, who giveth victory!'
21. What prove these, but that crime was ne'er so black
22. As ghostly cheer and pious thanks to lack?
23. Satan is modest. At Heaven's door he lays
24. His evil offspring, and, in Scriptural phrase
25. And saintly posture, gives to God the praise
26. And honor of the monstrous progeny.
27. What marvel, then, in our own time to see
28. His old devices, smoothly acted o'er, —
29. Official piety, locking fast the door
30. Of Hope against three million souls of men, —
31. Brothers, God's children, Christ's redeemed, — and then,
32. With uprolled eyeballs and on bended knee,
33. Whining a prayer for help to hide the key!
