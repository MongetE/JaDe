1. My thoughts are all in yonder town,
2. Where, wept by many tears,
3. To-day my mother's friend lays down
4. The burden of her years.

5. True as in life, no poor disguise
6. Of death with her is seen,
7. And on her simple casket lies
8. No wreath of bloom and green.

9. Oh, not for her the florist's art,
10. The mocking weeds of woe;
11. Dear memories in each mourner's heart
12. Like heaven's white lilies blow.

13. And all about the softening air
14. Of new-born sweetness tells,
15. And the ungathered May-flowers wear
16. The tints of ocean shells.

17. The old, assuring miracle
18. Is fresh as heretofore;
19. And earth takes up its parable
20. Of life from death once more.

21. Here organ-swell and church-bell toll
22. Methinks but discord were;
23. The prayerful silence of the soul
24. Is best befitting her.

25. No sound should break the quietude
26. Alike of earth and sky
27. O wandering wind in Seabrook wood,
28. Breathe but a half-heard sigh!

29. Sing softly, spring-bird, for her sake;
30. And thou not distant sea,
31. Lapse lightly as if Jesus spake,
32. And thou wert Galilee!

33. For all her quiet life flowed on
34. As meadow streamlets flow,
35. Where fresher green reveals alone
36. The noiseless ways they go.

37. From her loved place of prayer I see
38. The plain-robed mourners pass,
39. With slow feet treading reverently
40. The graveyard's springing grass.

41. Make room, O mourning ones, for me,
42. Where, like the friends of Paul,
43. That you no more her face shall see
44. You sorrow most of all.

45. Her path shall brighten more and more
46. Unto the perfect day;
47. She cannot fail of peace who bore
48. Such peace with her away.

49. O sweet, calm face that seemed to wear
50. The look of sins forgiven!
51. O voice of prayer that seemed to bear
52. Our own needs up to heaven!

53. How reverent in our midst she stood,
54. Or knelt in grateful praise!
55. What grace of Christian womanhood
56. Was in her household ways!

57. For still her holy living meant
58. No duty left undone;
59. The heavenly and the human blent
60. Their kindred loves in one.

61. And if her life small leisure found
62. For feasting ear and eye,
63. And Pleasure, on her daily round,
64. She passed unpausing by,

65. Yet with her went a secret sense
66. Of all things sweet and fair,
67. And Beauty's gracious providence
68. Refreshed her unaware.

69. She kept her line of rectitude
70. With love's unconscious ease;
71. Her kindly instincts understood
72. All gentle courtesies.

73. An inborn charm of graciousness
74. Made sweet her smile and tone,
75. And glorified her farm-wife dress
76. With beauty not its own.

77. The dear Lord's best interpreters
78. Are humble human souls;
79. The Gospel of a life like hers
80. Is more than books or scrolls.

81. From scheme and creed the light goes out,
82. The saintly fact survives;
83. The blessed Master none can doubt
84. Revealed in holy lives.
