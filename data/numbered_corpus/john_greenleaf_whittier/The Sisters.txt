1. The shade for me, but over thee
2. The lingering sunshine still;
3. As, smiling, to the silent stream
4. Comes down the singing rill.

5. So come to me, my little one,--
6. My years with thee I share,
7. And mingle with a sister's love
8. A mother's tender care.

9. But keep the smile upon thy lip,
10. The trust upon thy brow;
11. Since for the dear one God hath called
12. We have an angel now.

13. Our mother from the fields of heaven
14. Shall still her ear incline;
15. Nor need we fear her human love
16. Is less for love divine.

17. The songs are sweet they sing beneath
18. The trees of life so fair,
19. But sweetest of the songs of heaven
20. Shall be her children's prayer.

21. Then, darling, rest upon my breast,
22. And teach my heart to lean
23. With thy sweet trust upon the arm
24. Which folds us both unseen!
