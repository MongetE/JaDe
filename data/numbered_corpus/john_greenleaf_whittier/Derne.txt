1. NIGHT on the city of the Moor!
2. On mosque and tomb, and white-walled shore,
3. On sea-waves, to whose ceaseless knock
4. The narrow harbor gates unlock,
5. On corsair's galley, carack tall,
6. And plundered Christian caraval!
7. The sounds of Moslem life are still;
8. No mule-bell tinkles down the hill;
9. Stretched in the broad court of the khan,
10. The dusty Bornou caravan
11. Lies heaped in slumber, beast and man;
12. The Sheik is dreaming in his tent,
13. His noisy Arab tongue o'erspent;
14. The kiosk's glimmering lights are gone,
15. The merchant with his wares withdrawn;
16. Rough pillowed on some pirate breast,
17. The dancing-girl has sunk to rest;
18. And, save where measured footsteps fall
19. Along the Bashaw's guarded wall,
20. Or where, like some bad dream, the Jew
21. Creeps stealthily his quarter through,
22. Or counts with fear his golden heaps,
23. The City of the Corsair sleeps!
24. But where yon prison long and low
25. Stands black against the pale star-glow,
26. Chafed by the ceaseless wash of waves,
27. There watch and pine the Christian slaves;
28. Rough-bearded men, whose far-off wives
29. Wear out with grief their lonely lives;
30. And youth, still flashing from his eyes
31. The clear blue of New England skies,
32. A treasured lock of whose soft hair
33. Now wakes some sorrowing mother's prayer;
34. Or, worn upon some maiden breast,
35. Stirs with the loving heart's unrest!
36. A bitter cup each life must drain,
37. The groaning earth is cursed with pain,
38. And, like the scroll the angel bore
39. The shuddering Hebrew seer before,
40. O'erwrit alike, without, within,
41. With all the woes which follow sin;
42. But, bitterest of the ills beneath
43. Whose load man totters down to death,
44. Is that which plucks the regal crown
45. Of Freedom from his forehead down,
46. And snatches from his powerless hand
47. The sceptred sign of self-command,
48. Effacing with the chain and rod
49. The image and the seal of God;
50. Till from his nature, day by day,
51. The manly virtues fall away,
52. And leave him naked, blind and mute,
53. The godlike merging in the brute!
54. Why mourn the quiet ones who die
55. Beneath affection's tender eye,
56. Unto their household and their kin
57. Like ripened corn-sheaves gathered in?
58. O weeper, from that tranquil sod,
59. That holy harvest-home of God,
60. Turn to the quick and suffering, shed
61. Thy tears upon the living dead!
62. Thank God above thy dear ones' graves,
63. They sleep with Him, they are not slaves.
64. What dark mass, down the mountain-sides
65. Swift-pouring, like a stream divides?
66. A long, loose, straggling caravan,
67. Camel and horse and armëd man.
68. The moon's low crescent, glimmering o'er
69. Its grave of waters to the shore,
70. Lights up that mountain cavalcade,
71. And gleams from gun and spear and blade
72. Near and more near! now o'er them falls
73. The shadow of the city walls.
74. Hark to the sentry's challenge, drowned
75. In the fierce trumpet's charging sound!
76. The rush of men, the musket's peal,
77. The short, sharp clang of meeting steel!
78. Vain, Moslem, vain thy lifeblood poured
79. So freely on thy foeman's sword!
80. Not to the swift nor to the strong
81. The battles of the right belong;
82. For he who strikes for Freedom wears
83. The armor of the captive's prayers,
84. And Nature proffers to his cause
85. The strength of her eternal laws;
86. While he whose arm essays to bind
87. And herd with common brutes his kind
88. Strives evermore at fearful odds
89. With Nature and the jealous gods,
90. And dares the dread recoil which late
91. Or soon their right shall vindicate.
92. 'T is done, the hornëd crescent falls!
93. The star-flag flouts the broken walls!
94. Joy to the captive husband! joy
95. To thy sick heart, O brown-locked boy!
96. In sullen wrath the conquered Moor
97. Wide open flings your dungeon-door,
98. And leaves ye free from cell and chain,
99. The owners of yourselves again.
100. Dark as his allies desert-born,
101. Soiled with the battle's stain, and worn
102. With the long marches of his band
103. Through hottest wastes of rock and sand,
104. Scorched by the sun and furnace-breath
105. Of the red desert's wind of death,
106. With welcome words and grasping hands,
107. The victor and deliverer stands!
108. The tale is one of distant skies;
109. The dust of half a century lies
110. Upon it; yet its hero's name
111. Still lingers on the lips of Fame.
112. Men speak the praise of him who gave
113. Deliverance to the Moorman's slave,
114. Yet dare to brand with shame and crime
115. The heroes of our land and time, —
116. The self-forgetful ones, who stake
117. Home, name, and life for Freedom's sake.
118. God mend his heart who cannot feel
119. The impulse of a holy zeal,
120. And sees not, with his sordid eyes,
121. The beauty of self-sacrifice!
122. Though in the sacred place he stands,
123. Uplifting consecrated hands,
124. Unworthy are his lips to tell
125. Of Jesus' martyr-miracle,
126. Or name aright that dread embrace
127. Of suffering for a fallen race!
