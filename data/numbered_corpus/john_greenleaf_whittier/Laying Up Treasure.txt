1. From the Mahabharata.

2. Before the Ender comes, whose charioteer
3. Is swift or slow Disease, lay up each year
4. Thy harvests of well-doing, wealth that kings
5. Nor thieves can take away. When all the things
6. Thou tallest thine, goods, pleasures, honors fall,
7. Thou in thy virtue shalt survive them all.
