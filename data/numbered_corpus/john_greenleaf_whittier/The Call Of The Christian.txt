1. Not always as the whirlwind's rush
2. On Horeb's mount of fear,
3. Not always as the burning bush
4. To Midian's shepherd seer,
5. Nor as the awful voice which came
6. To Israel's prophet bards,
7. Nor as the tongues of cloven flame,
8. Nor gift of fearful words,--

9. Not always thus, with outward sign
10. Of fire or voice from Heaven,
11. The message of a truth divine,
12. The call of God is given!
13. Awaking in the human heart
14. Love for the true and right,--
15. Zeal for the Christian's better part,
16. Strength for the Christian's fight.

17. Nor unto manhood's heart alone
18. The holy influence steals
19. Warm with a rapture not its own,
20. The heart of woman feels!
21. As she who by Samaria's wall
22. The Saviour's errand sought,--
23. As those who with the fervent Paul
24. And meek Aquila wrought:

25. Or those meek ones whose martyrdom
26. Rome's gathered grandeur saw
27. Or those who in their Alpine home
28. Braved the Crusader's war,
29. When the green Vaudois, trembling, heard,
30. Through all its vales of death,
31. The martyr's song of triumph poured
32. From woman's failing breath.

33. And gently, by a thousand things
34. Which o'er our spirits pass,
35. Like breezes o'er the harp's fine strings,
36. Or vapors o'er a glass,
37. Leaving their token strange and new
38. Of music or of shade,
39. The summons to the right and true
40. And merciful is made.

41. Oh, then, if gleams of truth and light
42. Flash o'er thy waiting mind,
43. Unfolding to thy mental sight
44. The wants of human-kind;
45. If, brooding over human grief,
46. The earnest wish is known
47. To soothe and gladden with relief
48. An anguish not thine own;

49. Though heralded with naught of fear,
50. Or outward sign or show;
51. Though only to the inward ear
52. It whispers soft and low;
53. Though dropping, as the manna fell,
54. Unseen, yet from above,
55. Noiseless as dew-fall, heed it well,---
56. Thy Father's call of love!
