1. I spread a scanty board too late;
2. The old-time guests for whom I wait
3. Come few and slow, methinks, to-day.
4. Ah! who could hear my messages
5. Across the dim unsounded seas
6. On which so many have sailed away!

7. Come, then, old friends, who linger yet,
8. And let us meet, as we have met,
9. Once more beneath this low sunshine;
10. And grateful for the good we 've known,
11. The riddles solved, the ills outgrown,
12. Shake bands upon the border line.

13. The favor, asked too oft before,
14. From your indulgent ears, once more
15. I crave, and, if belated lays
16. To slower, feebler measures move,
17. The silent, sympathy of love
18. To me is dearer now than praise.

19. And ye, O younger friends, for whom
20. My hearth and heart keep open room,
21. Come smiling through the shadows long,
22. Be with me while the sun goes down,
23. And with your cheerful voices drown
24. The minor of my even-song.

25. For, equal through the day and night,
26. The wise Eternal oversight
27. And love and power and righteous will
28. Remain: the law of destiny
29. The best for each and all must be,
30. And life its promise shall fulfil.
