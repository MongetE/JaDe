1. O ARY SCHEFFER! when beneath thine eye,
2. Touched with the light that cometh from above,
3. Grew the sweet picture of the dear Lord's love,
4. No dream hadst thou that Christian hands would tear
5. Therefrom the token of His equal care,
6. And make thy symbol of His truth a lie!
7. The poor, dumb slave whose shackles fall away
8. In His compassionate gaze, grubbed smoothly out,
9. To mar no more the exercise devout
10. Of sleek oppression kneeling down to pray
11. Where the great oriel stains the Sabbath day!
12. Let whoso can before such praying-books
13. Kneel on his velvet cushion; I, for one,
14. Would sooner bow, a Parsee, to the sun,
15. Or tend a prayer-wheel in Thibetar brooks,
16. Or beat a drum on Yedo's temple-floor.
17. No falser idol man has bowed before,
18. In Indian groves or islands of the sea,
19. Than that which through the quaint-carved Gothic door
20. Looks forth, — a Church without humanity!
21. Patron of pride, and prejudice, and wrong, —
22. The rich man's charm and fetich of the strong,
23. The Eternal Fulness meted, clipped, and shorn,
24. The seamless robe of equal mercy torn,
25. The dear Christ hidden from His kindred flesh,
26. And, in His poor ones, crucified afresh!
27. Better the simple Lama scattering wide,
28. Where sweeps the storm Alechan's steppes along,
29. His paper horses for the lost to ride,
30. And wearying Buddha with his prayers to make
31. The figures living for the traveller's sake,
32. Than he who hopes with cheap praise to beguile
33. The ear of God, dishonoring man the while;
34. Who dreams the pearl gate's hinges, rusty grown,
35. Are moved by flattery's oil of tongue alone;
36. That in the scale Eternal Justice bears
37. The generous deed weighs less than selfish prayers,
38. And words intoned with graceful unction move
39. The Eternal Goodness more than lives of truth and love.
40. Alas, the Church! The reverend head of Jay,
41. Enhaloed with its saintly silvered hair,
42. Adorns no more the places of her prayer;
43. And brave young Tyng, too early called away,
44. Troubles the Haman of her courts no more
45. Like the just Hebrew at the Assyrian's door;
46. And her sweet ritual, beautiful but dead
47. As the dry husk from which the grain is shed,
48. And holy hymns from which the life devout
49. Of saints and martyrs has wellneigh gone out,
50. Like candles dying in exhausted air,
51. For Sabbath use in measured grists are ground;
52. And, ever while the spiritual mill goes round,
53. Between the upper and the nether stones,
54. Unseen, unheard, the wretched bondman groans,
55. And urges his vain plea, prayer-smothered, anthem-drowned!.
56. O heart of mine, keep patience!
57. As from the Mount of Vision, I behold,
58. Pure, just, and free, the Church of Christ on earth;
59. The martyr's dream, the golden age foretold!
60. And found, at last, the mystic Graal I see,
61. Brimmed with His blessing, pass from lip to lip
62. In sacred pledge of human fellowship;
63. And over all the songs of angels hear;
64. Songs of the love that casteth out all fear;
65. Songs of the Gospel of Humanity!
66. Lo! in the midst, with the same look He wore,
67. Healing and blessing on Genesaret's shore,
68. Folding together, with the all-tender might
69. Of His great love, the dark hands and the white,
70. Stands the Consoler, soothing every pain,
71. Making all burdens light, and breaking every chain.
