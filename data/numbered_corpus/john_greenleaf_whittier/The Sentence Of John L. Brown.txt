1. Ho! thou who seekest late and long
2. A License from the Holy Book
3. For brutal lust and fiendish wrong,
4. Man of the Pulpit, look!
5. Lift up those cold and atheist eyes,
6. This ripe fruit of thy teaching see;
7. And tell us how to heaven will rise
8. The incense of this sacrifice —
9. This blossom of the gallows tree!
10. Search out for slavery's hour of need
11. Some fitting text of sacred writ;
12. Give heaven the credit of deed
13. Which shames the nether pit.
14. Kneel, smooth blasphemer, unto Him
15. Whose truth is on thy lips a lie;
16. Ask that His bright winged cherubim
17. May bend around that scaffold grim
18. To guard and bless and sanctify.
19. O champion of the people's cause!
20. Suspend thy loud and vain rebuke
21. Of foreign wrong and Old World's laws,
22. Man of the Senate, look!
23. Was this the promise of the free,
24. The great hope of our early time,
25. That slavery's poison vine should be
26. Upborne by Freedom's prayer-nursed tree
27. O'erclustered with such fruits of crime?
28. Send out the summons East and West,
29. And South and North, let all be there
30. Where he who pitied the oppressed
31. Swings out in sun and air.
32. Let not a Democratic hand
33. The grisly hangman's task refuse;
34. There let each loyal patriot stand,
35. Awaiting slavery's command,
36. To twist the rope and draw the noose!
37. But vain is irony — unmeet
38. Its cold rebuke for deeds which start
39. In fiery and indignant beat
40. The pulses of the heart.
41. Leave studied wit and guarded phrase
42. For those who think but do not feel;
43. Let men speak out in words which raise
44. Where'er they fall, an answering blaze
45. Like flints which strike the fire from steel.
46. Still let a mousing priesthood ply
47. Their garbled text and gloss of sin,
48. And make the lettered scroll deny
49. Its living soul within:
50. Still let the place-fed, titled knave
51. Plead robbery's right with purchased lips,
52. And tell us that our fathers gave
53. For Freedom's pedestal, a slave,
54. The frieze and moulding, chains and whips!
55. But ye who own that Higher Law
56. Whose tablets in the heart are set,
57. Speak out in words of power and awe
58. That God is living yet!
59. Breathe forth once more those tones sublime
60. Which thrilled the burdened prophet's lyre,
61. And in a dark and evil time
62. Smote down on Israel's fast of crime
63. And gift of blood, a rain of fire!
64. Oh, not for us the graceful lay
65. To whose soft measures lightly move
66. The footsteps of the faun and fay,
67. O'er-locked by mirth and love!
68. But such a stern and startling strain
69. As Britain's hunted bards flung down
70. From Snowden to the conquered plain,
71. Where harshly clanked the Saxon chain,
72. On trampled field and smoking town.
73. By Liberty's dishonored name,
74. By man's lost hope and failing trust,
75. By words and deeds which bow with shame
76. Our foreheads to the dust,
77. By the exulting strangers' sneer,
78. Borne to us from the Old World's thrones,
79. And by their victims' grief who hear,
80. In sunless mines and dungeons drear,
81. How Freedom's land her faith disowns!
82. Speak out in acts. The time for words
83. Has passed, and deeds suffice alone;
84. In vain against the clang of swords
85. The wailing pipe is blown!
86. Act, act in God's name, while ye may!
87. Smite from the church her leprous limb!
88. Throw open to the light of day.
89. The bondman's cell, and break away
90. The chains the state has bound on him!
91. Ho! every true and living soul,
92. To Freedom's perilled altar bear
93. The Freeman's and the Christian's whole
94. Tongue, pen, and vote, and prayer!
95. One last, great battle for the right —
96. One short, sharp struggle to be free!
97. To do is to succeed — our fight
98. Is waged in Heaven's approving sight;
99. The smile of God is Victory.
