1. FROM the green Amesbury hill which bears the name
2. Of that half mythic ancestor of mine
3. Who trod its slopes two hundred years ago,
4. Down the long valley of the Merrimac,
5. Midway between me and the river's mouth,
6. I see thy home, set like an eagle's nest
7. Among Deer Island's immemorial pines,
8. Crowning the crag on which the sunset breaks
9. Its last red arrow. Many a tale and song,
10. Which thou bast told or sung, I call to mind,
11. Softening with silvery mist the woods and hills,
12. The out-thrust headlands and inreaching bays
13. Of our northeastern coast-line, trending where
14. The Gulf, midsummer, feels the chill blockade
15. Of icebergs stranded at its northern gate.

16. To thee the echoes of the Island Sound
17. Answer not vainly, nor in vain the moan
18. Of the South Breaker prophesying storm.
19. And thou hast listened, like myself, to men
20. Sea-periled oft where Anticosti lies
21. Like a fell spider in its web of fog,
22. Or where the Grand Bank shallows with the wrecks
23. Of sunken fishers, and to whom strange isles
24. And frost-rimmed bays and trading stations seem
25. Familiar as Great Neck and Kettle Cove,
26. Nubble and Boon, the common names of home.
27. So let me offer thee this lay of mine,
28. Simple and homely, lacking much thy play
29. Of color and of fancy. If its theme
30. And treatment seem to thee befitting youth
31. Rather than age, let this be my excuse
32. It has beguiled some heavy hours and called
33. Some pleasant memories up; and, better still,
34. Occasion lent me for a kindly word
35. To one who is my neighbor and my friend.

36. . . . . . . . . . .

37. The skipper sailed out of the harbor mouth,
38. Leaving the apple-bloom of the South
39. For the ice of the Eastern seas,
40. In his fishing schooner Breeze.

41. Handsome and brave and young was he,
42. And the maids of Newbury sighed to see
43. His lessening white sail fall
44. Under the sea's blue wall.

45. Through the Northern Gulf and the misty screen
46. Of the isles of Mingan and Madeleine,
47. St. Paul's and Blanc Sablon,
48. The little Breeze sailed on,

49. Backward and forward, along the shore
50. Of lorn and desolate Labrador,
51. And found at last her way
52. To the Seven Islands Bay.

53. The little hamlet, nestling below
54. Great hills white with lingering snow,
55. With its tin-roofed chapel stood
56. Half hid in the dwarf spruce wood;

57. Green-turfed, flower-sown, the last outpost
58. Of summer upon the dreary coast,
59. With its gardens small and spare,
60. Sad in the frosty air.

61. Hard by where the skipper's schooner lay,
62. A fisherman's cottage looked away
63. Over isle and bay, and. behind
64. On mountains dim-defined.

65. And there twin sisters, fair and young,
66. Laughed with their stranger guest, and sung
67. In their native tongue the lays
68. Of the old Provencal days.

69. Alike were they, save the faint outline
70. Of a scar on Suzette's forehead fine;
71. And both, it so befell,
72. Loved the heretic stranger well.

73. Both were pleasant to look upon,
74. But the heart of the skipper clave to one;
75. Though less by his eye than heart
76. He knew the twain apart.

77. Despite of alien race and creed,
78. Well did his wooing of Marguerite speed;
79. And the mother's wrath was vain
80. As the sister's jealous pain.

81. The shrill-tongued mistress her house forbade,
82. And solemn warning was sternly said
83. By the black-robed priest, whose word
84. As law the hamlet heard.

85. But half by voice and half by signs
86. The skipper said, 'A warm sun shines
87. On the green-banked Merrimac;
88. Wait, watch, till I come back.

89. 'And when you see, from my mast head,
90. The signal fly of a kerchief red,
91. My boat on the shore shall wait;
92. Come, when the night is late.'

93. Ah! weighed with childhood's haunts and friends,
94. And all that the home sky overbends,
95. Did ever young love fail
96. To turn the trembling scale?

97. Under the night, on the wet sea sands,
98. Slowly unclasped their plighted hands
99. One to the cottage hearth,
100. And one to his sailor's berth.

101. What was it the parting lovers heard?
102. Nor leaf, nor ripple, nor wing of bird,
103. But a listener's stealthy tread
104. On the rock-moss, crisp and dead.

105. He weighed his anchor, and fished once more
106. By the black coast-line of Labrador;
107. And by love and the north wind driven,
108. Sailed back to the Islands Seven.

109. In the sunset's glow the sisters twain
110. Saw the Breeze come sailing in again;
111. Said Suzette, 'Mother dear,
112. The heretic's sail is here.'

113. 'Go, Marguerite, to your room, and hide;
114. Your door shall be bolted!' the mother cried:
115. While Suzette, ill at ease,
116. Watched the red sign of the Breeze.

117. At midnight, down to the waiting skiff
118. She stole in the shadow of the cliff;
119. And out of the Bay's mouth ran
120. The schooner with maid and man.

121. And all night long, on a restless bed,
122. Her prayers to the Virgin Marguerite said
123. And thought of her lover's pain
124. Waiting for her in vain.

125. Did he pace the sands? Did he pause to hear
126. The sound of her light step drawing near?
127. And, as the slow hours passed,
128. Would he doubt her faith at last?

129. But when she saw through the misty pane,
130. The morning break on a sea of rain,
131. Could even her love avail
132. To follow his vanished sail?

133. Meantime the Breeze, with favoring wind,
134. Left the rugged Moisic hills behind,
135. And heard from an unseen shore
136. The falls of Manitou roar.

137. On the morrow's morn, in the thick, gray weather
138. They sat on the reeling deck together,
139. Lover and counterfeit,
140. Of hapless Marguerite.

141. With a lover's hand, from her forehead fair
142. He smoothed away her jet-black hair.
143. What was it his fond eyes met?
144. The scar of the false Suzette!

145. Fiercely he shouted: 'Bear away
146. East by north for Seven Isles Bay!'
147. The maiden wept and prayed,
148. But the ship her helm obeyed.

149. Once more the Bay of the Isles they found
150. They heard the bell of the chapel sound,
151. And the chant of the dying sung
152. In the harsh, wild Indian tongue.

153. A feeling of mystery, change, and awe
154. Was in all they heard and all they saw
155. Spell-bound the hamlet lay
156. In the hush of its lonely bay.

157. And when they came to the cottage door,
158. The mother rose up from her weeping sore,
159. And with angry gestures met
160. The scared look of Suzette.

161. 'Here is your daughter,' the skipper said;
162. 'Give me the one I love instead.'
163. But the woman sternly spake;
164. 'Go, see if the dead will wake!'

165. He looked. Her sweet face still and white
166. And strange in the noonday taper light,
167. She lay on her little bed,
168. With the cross at her feet and head.

169. In a passion of grief the strong man bent
170. Down to her face, and, kissing it, went
171. Back to the waiting Breeze,
172. Back to the mournful seas.

173. Never again to the Merrimac
174. And Newbury's homes that bark came back.
175. Whether her fate she met
176. On the shores of Carraquette,

177. Miscou, or Tracadie, who can say?
178. But even yet at Seven Isles Bay
179. Is told the ghostly tale
180. Of a weird, unspoken sail,

181. In the pale, sad light of the Northern day
182. Seen by the blanketed Montagnais,
183. Or squaw, in her small kyack,
184. Crossing the spectre's track.

185. On the deck a maiden wrings her hands;
186. Her likeness kneels on the gray coast sands;
187. One in her wild despair,
188. And one in the trance of prayer.

189. She flits before no earthly blast,
190. The red sign fluttering from her mast,
191. Over the solemn seas,
192. The ghost of the schooner Breeze!
