1. O dwellers in the stately towns,
2. What come ye out to see?
3. This common earth, this common sky,
4. This water flowing free?

5. As gayly as these kalmia flowers
6. Your door-yard blossoms spring;
7. As sweetly as these wild-wood birds
8. Your caged minstrels sing.

9. You find but common bloom and green,
10. The rippling river's rune,
11. The beauty which is everywhere
12. Beneath the skies of June;

13. The Hawkswood oaks, the storm-torn plumes
14. Of old pine-forest kings,
15. Beneath whose century-woven shade
16. Deer Island's mistress sings.

17. And here are pictured Artichoke,
18. And Curson's bowery mill;
19. And Pleasant Valley smiles between
20. The river and the hill.

21. You know full well these banks of bloom,
22. The upland's wavy line,
23. And how the sunshine tips with fire
24. The needles of the pine.

25. Yet, like some old remembered psalm,
26. Or sweet, familiar face,
27. Not less because of commonness
28. You love the day and place.

29. And not in vain in this soft air
30. Shall hard-strung nerves relax,
31. Not all in vain the o'erworn brain
32. Forego its daily tax.

33. The lust of power, the greed of gain
34. Have all the year their own;
35. The haunting demons well may let
36. Our one bright day alone.

37. Unheeded let the newsboy call,
38. Aside the ledger lay
39. The world will keep its treadmill step
40. Though we fall out to-day.

41. The truants of life's weary school,
42. Without excuse from thrift
43. We change for once the gains of toil
44. For God's unpurchased gift.

45. From ceiled rooms, from silent books,
46. From crowded car and town,
47. Dear Mother Earth, upon thy lap,
48. We lay our tired heads down.

49. Cool, summer wind, our heated brows;
50. Blue river, through the green
51. Of clustering pines, refresh the eyes
52. Which all too much have seen.

53. For us these pleasant woodland ways
54. Are thronged with memories old,
55. Have felt the grasp of friendly hands
56. And heard love's story told.

57. A sacred presence overbroods
58. The earth whereon we meet;
59. These winding forest-paths are trod
60. By more than mortal feet.

61. Old friends called from us by the voice
62. Which they alone could hear,
63. From mystery to mystery,
64. From life to life, draw near.

65. More closely for the sake of them
66. Each other's hands we press;
67. Our voices take from them a tone
68. Of deeper tenderness.

69. Our joy is theirs, their trust is ours,
70. Alike below, above,
71. Or here or there, about us fold
72. The arms of one great love!

73. We ask to-day no countersign,
74. No party names we own;
75. Unlabelled, individual,
76. We bring ourselves alone.

77. What cares the unconventioned wood
78. For pass-words of the town?
79. The sound of fashion's shibboleth
80. The laughing waters drown.

81. Here cant forgets his dreary tone,
82. And care his face forlorn;
83. The liberal air and sunshine laugh
84. The bigot's zeal to scorn.

85. From manhood's weary shoulder falls
86. His load of selfish cares;
87. And woman takes her rights as flowers
88. And brooks and birds take theirs.

89. The license of the happy woods,
90. The brook's release are ours;
91. The freedom of the unshamed wind
92. Among the glad-eyed flowers.

93. Yet here no evil thought finds place,
94. Nor foot profane comes in;
95. Our grove, like that of Samothrace,
96. Is set apart from sin.

97. We walk on holy ground; above
98. A sky more holy smiles;
99. The chant of the beatitudes
100. Swells down these leafy aisles.

101. Thanks to the gracious Providence
102. That brings us here once more;
103. For memories of the good behind
104. And hopes of good before.

105. And if, unknown to us, sweet days
106. Of June like this must come,
107. Unseen of us these laurels clothe
108. The river-banks with bloom;

109. And these green paths must soon be trod
110. By other feet than ours,
111. Full long may annual pilgrims come
112. To keep the Feast of Flowers;

113. The matron be a girl once more,
114. The bearded man a boy,
115. And we, in heaven's eternal June,
116. Be glad for earthly joy!
