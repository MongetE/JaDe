1. AMIDST thy sacred effigies
2. Of old renown give place,
3. O city, Freedom-loved! to his
4. Whose hand unchained a race.
5. Take the worn frame, that rested not
6. Save in a martyr's grave;
7. The care-lined face, that none forgot,
8. Bent to the kneeling slave.
9. Let man be free! The mighty word
10. He spake was not his own;
11. An impulse from the Highest stirred
12. These chiselled lips alone.
13. The cloudy sign, the fiery guide,
14. Along his pathway ran,
15. And Nature, through his voice, denied
16. The ownership of man.
17. We rest in peace where these sad eyes
18. Saw peril, strife, and pain;
19. His was the nation's sacrifice,
20. And ours the priceless gain.
21. O symbol of God's will on earth
22. As it is done above!
23. Bear witness to the cost and worth
24. Of justice and of love.
25. Stand in thy place and testify
26. To coming ages long,
27. That truth is stronger than a lie,
28. And righteousness than wrong.
