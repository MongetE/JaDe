1. One Sabbath day my friend and I
2. After the meeting, quietly
3. Passed from the crowded village lanes,
4. White with dry dust for lack of rains,
5. And climbed the neighboring slope, with feet
6. Slackened and heavy from the heat,
7. Although the day was wellnigh done,
8. And the low angle of the sun
9. Along the naked hillside cast
10. Our shadows as of giants vast.
11. We reached, at length, the topmost swell,
12. Whence, either way, the green turf fell
13. In terraces of nature down
14. To fruit-hung orchards, and the town
15. With white, pretenceless houses, tall
16. Church-steeples, and, o'ershadowing all,
17. Huge mills whose windows had the look
18. Of eager eyes that ill could brook
19. The Sabbath rest. We traced the track
20. Of the sea-seeking river back,
21. Glistening for miles above its mouth,
22. Through the long valley to the south,
23. And, looking eastward, cool to view,
24. Stretched the illimitable blue
25. Of ocean, from its curved coast-line;
26. Sombred and still, the warm sunshine
27. Filled with pale gold-dust all the reach
28. Of slumberous woods from hill to beach,-
29. Slanted on walls of thronged retreats
30. From city toil and dusty streets,
31. On grassy bluff, and dune of sand,
32. And rocky islands miles from land;
33. Touched the far-glancing sails, and showed
34. White lines of foam where long waves flowed
35. Dumb in the distance. In the north,
36. Dim through their misty hair, looked forth
37. The space-dwarfed mountains to the sea,
38. From mystery to mystery!

39. So, sitting on that green hill-slope,
40. We talked of human life, its hope
41. And fear, and unsolved doubts, and what
42. It might have been, and yet was not.
43. And, when at last the evening air
44. Grew sweeter for the bells of prayer
45. Ringing in steeples far below,
46. We watched the people churchward go,
47. Each to his place, as if thereon
48. The true shekinah only shone;
49. And my friend queried how it came
50. To pass that they who owned the same
51. Great Master still could not agree
52. To worship Him in company.
53. Then, broadening in his thought, he ran
54. Over the whole vast field of man,-
55. The varying forms of faith and creed
56. That somehow served the holders' need;
57. In which, unquestioned, undenied,
58. Uncounted millions lived and died;
59. The bibles of the ancient folk,
60. Through which the heart of nations spoke;
61. The old moralities which lent
62. To home its sweetness and content,
63. And rendered possible to bear
64. The life of peoples everywhere
65. And asked if we, who boast of light,
66. Claim not a too exclusive right
67. To truths which must for all be meant,
68. Like rain and sunshine freely sent.
69. In bondage to the letter still,
70. We give it power to cramp and kill,-
71. To tax God's fulness with a scheme
72. Narrower than Peter's house-top dream,
73. His wisdom and his love with plans
74. Poor and inadequate as man's.
75. It must be that He witnesses
76. Somehow to all men that He is
77. That something of His saving grace
78. Reaches the lowest of the race,
79. Who, through strange creed and rite, may draw
80. The hints of a diviner law.
81. We walk in clearer light;-but then,
82. Is He not God?-are they not men?
83. Are His responsibilities
84. For us alone and not for these?

85. And I made answer: 'Truth is one;
86. And, in all lands beneath the sun,
87. Whoso hath eyes to see may see
88. The tokens of its unity.
89. No scroll of creed its fulness wraps,
90. We trace it not by school-boy maps,
91. Free as the sun and air it is
92. Of latitudes and boundaries.
93. In Vedic verse, in dull Koran,
94. Are messages of good to man;
95. The angels to our Aryan sires
96. Talked by the earliest household fires;
97. The prophets of the elder day,
98. The slant-eyed sages of Cathay,
99. Read not the riddle all amiss
100. Of higher life evolved from this.

101. 'Nor doth it lessen what He taught,
102. Or make the gospel Jesus brought
103. Less precious, that His lips retold
104. Some portion of that truth of old;
105. Denying not the proven seers,
106. The tested wisdom of the years;
107. Confirming with his own impress
108. The common law of righteousness.
109. We search the world for truth; we cull
110. The good, the pure, the beautiful,
111. From graven stone and written scroll,
112. From all old flower-fields of the soul;
113. And, weary seekers of the best,
114. We come back laden from our quest,
115. To find that all the sages said
116. Is in the Book our mothers read,
117. And all our treasure of old thought
118. In His harmonious fulness wrought
119. Who gathers in one sheaf complete
120. The scattered blades of God's sown wheat,
121. The common growth that maketh good
122. His all-embracing Fatherhood.

123. 'Wherever through the ages rise
124. The altars of self-sacrifice,
125. Where love its arms has opened wide,
126. Or man for man has calmly died,
127. I see the same white wings outspread
128. That hovered o'er the Master's head!
129. Up from undated time they come,
130. The martyr souls of heathendom,
131. And to His cross and passion bring
132. Their fellowship of suffering.
133. I trace His presence in the blind
134. Pathetic gropings of my kind,-
135. In prayers from sin and sorrow wrung,
136. In cradle-hymns of life they sung,
137. Each, in its measure, but a part
138. Of the unmeasured Over-Heart;
139. And with a stronger faith confess
140. The greater that it owns the less.
141. Good cause it is for thankfulness
142. That the world-blessing of His life
143. With the long past is not at strife;
144. That the great marvel of His death
145. To the one order witnesseth,
146. No doubt of changeless goodness wakes,
147. No link of cause and sequence breaks,
148. But, one with nature, rooted is
149. In the eternal verities;
150. Whereby, while differing in degree
151. As finite from infinity,
152. The pain and loss for others borne,
153. Love's crown of suffering meekly worn,
154. The life man giveth for his friend
155. Become vicarious in the end;
156. Their healing place in nature take,
157. And make life sweeter for their sake.

158. 'So welcome I from every source
159. The tokens of that primal Force,
160. Older than heaven itself, yet new
161. As the young heart it reaches to,
162. Beneath whose steady impulse rolls
163. The tidal wave of human souls;
164. Guide, comforter, and inward word,
165. The eternal spirit of the Lord
166. Nor fear I aught that science brings
167. From searching through material things;
168. Content to let its glasses prove,
169. Not by the letter's oldness move,
170. The myriad worlds on worlds that course
171. The spaces of the universe;
172. Since everywhere the Spirit walks
173. The garden of the heart, and talks
174. With man, as under Eden's trees,
175. In all his varied languages.
176. Why mourn above some hopeless flaw
177. In the stone tables of the law,
178. When scripture every day afresh
179. Is traced on tablets of the flesh?
180. By inward sense, by outward signs,
181. God's presence still the heart divines;
182. Through deepest joy of Him we learn,
183. In sorest grief to Him we turn,
184. And reason stoops its pride to share
185. The child-like instinct of a prayer.'

186. And then, as is my wont, I told
187. A story of the days of old,
188. Not found in printed books,-in sooth,
189. A fancy, with slight hint of truth,
190. Showing how differing faiths agree
191. In one sweet law of charity.
192. Meanwhile the sky had golden grown,
193. Our faces in its glory shone;
194. But shadows down the valley swept,
195. And gray below the ocean slept,
196. As time and space I wandered o'er
197. To tread the Mogul's marble floor,
198. And see a fairer sunset fall
199. On Jumna's wave and Agra's wall.

200. The good Shah Akbar (peace be his alway!)
201. Came forth from the Divan at close of day
202. Bowed with the burden of his many cares,
203. Worn with the hearing of unnumbered prayers,-
204. Wild cries for justice, the importunate
205. Appeals of greed and jealousy and hate,
206. And all the strife of sect and creed and rite,
207. Santon and Gouroo waging holy fight
208. For the wise monarch, claiming not to be
209. Allah's avenger, left his people free,
210. With a faint hope, his Book scarce justified,
211. That all the paths of faith, though severed wide,
212. O'er which the feet of prayerful reverence passed,
213. Met at the gate of Paradise at last.

214. He sought an alcove of his cool hareem,
215. Where, far beneath, he heard the Jumna's stream
216. Lapse soft and low along his palace wall,
217. And all about the cool sound of the fall
218. Of fountains, and of water circling free
219. Through marble ducts along the balcony;
220. The voice of women in the distance sweet,
221. And, sweeter still, of one who, at his feet,
222. Soothed his tired ear with songs of a far land
223. Where Tagus shatters on the salt sea-sand
224. The mirror of its cork-grown hills of drouth
225. And vales of vine, at Lisbon's harbor-mouth.

226. The date-palms rustled not; the peepul laid
227. Its topmost boughs against the balustrade,
228. Motionless as the mimic leaves and vines
229. That, light and graceful as the shawl-designs
230. Of Delhi or Umritsir, twined in stone;
231. And the tired monarch, who aside had thrown
232. The day's hard burden, sat from care apart,
233. And let the quiet steal into his heart
234. From the still hour. Below him Agra slept,
235. By the long light of sunset overswept
236. The river flowing through a level land,
237. By mango-groves and banks of yellow sand,
238. Skirted with lime and orange, gay kiosks,
239. Fountains at play, tall minarets of mosques,
240. Fair pleasure-gardens, with their flowering trees
241. Relieved against the mournful cypresses;
242. And, air-poised lightly as the blown sea-foam,
243. The marble wonder of some holy dome
244. Hung a white moonrise over the still wood,
245. Glassing its beauty in a stiller flood.

246. Silent the monarch gazed, until the night
247. Swift-falling hid the city from his sight;
248. Then to the woman at his feet he said
249. 'Tell me, O Miriam, something thou hast read
250. In childhood of the Master of thy faith,
251. Whom Islam also owns. Our Prophet saith
252. 'He was a true apostle, yea, a Word
253. And Spirit sent before me from the Lord.'
254. Thus the Book witnesseth; and well I know
255. By what thou art, O dearest, it is so.
256. As the lute's tone the maker's hand betrays,
257. The sweet disciple speaks her Master's praise.'

258. Then Miriam, glad of heart, (for in some sort
259. She cherished in the Moslem's liberal court
260. The sweet traditions of a Christian child;
261. And, through her life of sense, the undefiled
262. And chaste ideal of the sinless One
263. Gazed on her with an eye she might not shun,-
264. The sad, reproachful look of pity, born
265. Of love that hath no part in wrath or scorn,)
266. Began, with low voice and moist eyes, to tell
267. Of the all-loving Christ, and what befell
268. When the fierce zealots, thirsting for her blood,
269. Dragged to his feet a shame of womanhood.
270. How, when his searching answer pierced within
271. Each heart, and touched the secret of its sin,
272. And her accusers fled his face before,
273. He bade the poor one go and sin no more.
274. And Akbar said, after a moment's thought,
275. 'Wise is the lesson by thy prophet taught;
276. Woe unto him who judges and forgets
277. What hidden evil his own heart besets!
278. Something of this large charity I find
279. In all the sects that sever human kind;
280. I would to Allah that their lives agreed
281. More nearly with the lesson of their creed!
282. Those yellow Lamas who at Meerut pray
283. By wind and water power, and love to say
284. 'He who forgiveth not shall, unforgiven,
285. Fail of the rest of Buddha,' and who even
286. Spare the black gnat that stings them, vex my ears
287. With the poor hates and jealousies and fears
288. Nursed in their human hives. That lean, fierce priest
289. Of thy own people, (be his heart increased
290. By Allah's love!) his black robes smelling yet
291. Of Goa's roasted Jews, have I not met
292. Meek-faced, barefooted, crying in the street
293. The saying of his prophet true and sweet,-
294. 'He who is merciful shall mercy meet!''

295. But, next day, so it chanced, as night began
296. To fall, a murmur through the hareem ran
297. That one, recalling in her dusky face
298. The full-lipped, mild-eyed beauty of a race
299. Known as the blameless Ethiops of Greek song,
300. Plotting to do her royal master wrong,
301. Watching, reproachful of the lingering light,
302. The evening shadows deepen for her flight,
303. Love-guided, to her home in a far land,
304. Now waited death at the great Shah's command.
305. Shapely as that dark princess for whose smile
306. A world was bartered, daughter of the Nile
307. Herself, and veiling in her large, soft eyes
308. The passion and the languor of her skies,
309. The Abyssinian knelt low at the feet
310. Of her stern lord: 'O king, if it be meet,
311. And for thy honor's sake,' she said, 'that I,
312. Who am the humblest of thy slaves, should die,
313. I will not tax thy mercy to forgive.
314. Easier it is to die than to outlive
315. All that life gave me,-him whose wrong of thee
316. Was but the outcome of his love for me,
317. Cherished from childhood, when, beneath the shade
318. Of templed Axum, side by side we played.
319. Stolen from his arms, my lover followed me
320. Through weary seasons over land and sea;
321. And two days since, sitting disconsolate
322. Within the shadow of the hareem gate,
323. Suddenly, as if dropping from the sky,
324. Down from the lattice of the balcony
325. Fell the sweet song by Tigre's cowherds sung
326. In the old music of his native tongue.
327. He knew my voice, for love is quick of ear,
328. Answering in song.

329. This night he waited near
330. To fly with me. The fault was mine alone
331. He knew thee not, he did but seek his own;
332. Who, in the very shadow of thy throne,
333. Sharing thy bounty, knowing all thou art,
334. Greatest and best of men, and in her heart
335. Grateful to tears for favor undeserved,
336. Turned ever homeward, nor one moment swerved
337. From her young love. He looked into my eyes,
338. He heard my voice, and could not otherwise
339. Than he hath done; yet, save one wild embrace
340. When first we stood together face to face,
341. And all that fate had done since last we met
342. Seemed but a dream that left us children yet,
343. He hath not wronged thee nor thy royal bed;
344. Spare him, O king! and slay me in his stead!'

345. But over Akbar's brows the frown hung black,
346. And, turning to the eunuch at his back,
347. 'Take them,' he said, 'and let the Jumna's waves
348. Hide both my shame and these accursed slaves!'
349. His loathly length the unsexed bondman bowed
350. 'On my head be it!'

351. Straightway from a cloud
352. Of dainty shawls and veils of woven mist
353. The Christian Miriam rose, and, stooping, kissed
354. The monarch's hand. Loose down her shoulders bare
355. Swept all the rippled darkness of her hair,
356. Veiling the bosom that, with high, quick swell
357. Of fear and pity, through it rose and fell.

358. 'Alas!' she cried, 'hast thou forgotten quite
359. The words of Him we spake of yesternight?
360. Or thy own prophet's, 'Whoso doth endure
361. And pardon, of eternal life is sure'?
362. O great and good! be thy revenge alone
363. Felt in thy mercy to the erring shown;
364. Let thwarted love and youth their pardon plead,
365. Who sinned but in intent, and not in deed!'

366. One moment the strong frame of Akbar shook
367. With the great storm of passion. Then his look
368. Softened to her uplifted face, that still
369. Pleaded more strongly than all words, until
370. Its pride and anger seemed like overblown,
371. Spent clouds of thunder left to tell alone
372. Of strife and overcoming. With bowed head,
373. And smiting on his bosom: 'God,' he said,
374. 'Alone is great, and let His holy name
375. Be honored, even to His servant's shame!
376. Well spake thy prophet, Miriam,-he alone
377. Who hath not sinned is meet to cast a stone
378. At such as these, who here their doom await,
379. Held like myself in the strong grasp of fate.
380. They sinned through love, as I through love forgive;
381. Take them beyond my realm, but let them live!'

382. And, like a chorus to the words of grace,
383. The ancient Fakir, sitting in his place,
384. Motionless as an idol and as grim,
385. In the pavilion Akbar built for him
386. Under the court-yard trees, (for he was wise,
387. Knew Menu's laws, and through his close-shut eyes
388. Saw things far off, and as an open book
389. Into the thoughts of other men could look,)
390. Began, half chant, half howling, to rehearse
391. The fragment of a holy Vedic verse;
392. And thus it ran: 'He who all things forgives
393. Conquers himself and all things else, and lives
394. Above the reach of wrong or hate or fear,
395. Calm as the gods, to whom he is most dear.'

396. Two leagues from Agra still the traveller sees
397. The tomb of Akbar through its cypress-trees;
398. And, near at hand, the marble walls that hide
399. The Christian Begum sleeping at his side.
400. And o'er her vault of burial (who shall tell
401. If it be chance alone or miracle?)
402. The Mission press with tireless hand unrolls
403. The words of Jesus on its lettered scrolls,-
404. Tells, in all tongues, the tale of mercy o'er,
405. And bids the guilty, 'Go and sin no more!'

406. **

407. It now was dew-fall; very still
408. The night lay on the lonely hill,
409. Down which our homeward steps we bent,
410. And, silent, through great silence went,
411. Save that the tireless crickets played
412. Their long, monotonous serenade.
413. A young moon, at its narrowest,
414. Curved sharp against the darkening west;
415. And, momently, the beacon's star,
416. Slow wheeling o'er its rock afar,
417. From out the level darkness shot
418. One instant and again was not.
419. And then my friend spake quietly
420. The thought of both: 'Yon crescent see!
421. Like Islam's symbol-moon it gives
422. Hints of the light whereby it lives
423. Somewhat of goodness, something true
424. From sun and spirit shining through
425. All faiths, all worlds, as through the dark
426. Of ocean shines the lighthouse spark,
427. Attests the presence everywhere
428. Of love and providential care.
429. The faith the old Norse heart confessed
430. In one dear name,-the hopefulest
431. And tenderest heard from mortal lips
432. In pangs of birth or death, from ships
433. Ice-bitten in the winter sea,
434. Or lisped beside a mother's knee,-
435. The wiser world hath not outgrown,
436. And the All-Father is our own!'
