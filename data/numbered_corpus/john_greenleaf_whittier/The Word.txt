1. Voice of the Holy Spirit, making known
2. Man to himself, a witness swift and sure,
3. Warning, approving, true and wise and pure,
4. Counsel and guidance that misleadeth none!
5. By thee the mystery of life is read;
6. The picture-writing of the world's gray seers,
7. The myths and parables of the primal years,
8. Whose letter kills, by thee interpreted
9. Take healthful meanings fitted to our needs,
10. And in the soul's vernacular express
11. The common law of simple righteousness.
12. Hatred of cant and doubt of human creeds
13. May well be felt: the unpardonable sin
14. Is to deny the Word of God within!
