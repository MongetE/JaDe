1. You flung your taunt across the wave;
2. We bore it as became us,
3. Well knowing that the fettered slave
4. Left friendly lips no option save
5. To pity or to blame us.
6. You scoffed our plea. 'Mere lack of will,
7. Not lack of power,' you told us:
8. We showed our free-state records; still
9. You mocked, confounding good and ill,
10. Slave-haters and slaveholders.
11. We struck at Slavery; to the verge
12. Of power and means we checked it;
13. Lo! — presto, change! its claims you urge,
14. Send greetings to it o'er the surge,
15. And comfort and protect it.
16. But yesterday you scarce could shake,
17. In slave-abhorring rigor,
18. Our Northern palms for conscience' sake:
19. To-day you clasp the hands that ache
20. With 'walloping the nigger!'
21. O Englishmen! — in hope and creed,
22. In blood and tongue our brothers!
23. We too are heirs of Runnymede;
24. And Shakespeare's fame and Cromwell's deed
25. Are not alone our mother's.
26. 'Thicker than water,' in one rill
27. Through centuries of story
28. Our Saxon blood has flowed, and still
29. We share with you its good and ill,
30. The shadow and the glory.
31. Joint heirs and kinfolk, leagues of wave
32. Nor length of years can part us:
33. Your right is ours to shrine and grave,
34. The common freehold of the brave,
35. The gift of saints and martyrs.
36. Our very sins and follies teach
37. Our kindred frail and human:
38. We carp at faults with bitter speech,
39. The while, for one unshared by each,
40. We have a score in common.
41. We bowed the heart, if not the knee,
42. To England's Queen, God bless her!
43. We praised you when your slaves went free:
44. We seek to unchain ours. Will ye
45. Join hands with the oppressor?
46. And is it Christian England cheers
47. The bruiser, not the bruisëd?
48. And must she run, despite the tears
49. And prayers of eighteen hundred years,
50. Amuck in Slavery's crusade?
51. Oh, black disgrace! Oh, shame and loss
52. Too deep for tongue to phrase on!
53. Tear from your flag its holy cross,
54. And in your van of battle toss
55. The pirate's skull-bone blazon!
