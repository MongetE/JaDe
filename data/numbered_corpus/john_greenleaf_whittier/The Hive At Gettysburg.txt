1. IN the old Hebrew myth the lion's frame,
2. So terrible alive,
3. Bleached by the desert's sun and wind, became
4. The wandering wild bees' hive;
5. And he who, lone and naked-handed, tore
6. Those jaws of death apart,
7. In after time drew forth their honeyed store
8. To strengthen his strong heart.
9. Dead seemed the legend: but it only slept
10. To wake beneath our sky;
11. Just on the spot whence ravening Treason crept
12. Back to its lair to die,
13. Bleeding and torn from Freedom's mountain bounds,
14. A stained and shattered drum
15. Is now the hive where, on their flowery rounds,
16. The wild bees go and come.
17. Unchallenged by a ghostly sentinel,
18. They wander wide and far,
19. Along green hillsides, sown with shot and shell,
20. Through vales once choked with war.
21. The low reveille of their battle-drum
22. Disturbs no morning prayer;
23. With deeper peace in summer noons their hum
24. Fills all the drowsy air.
25. And Samson's riddle is our own to-day,
26. Of sweetness from the strong,
27. Of union, peace, and freedom plucked away
28. From the rent jaws of wrong.
29. From Treason's death we draw a purer life,
30. As, from the beast he slew,
31. A sweetness sweeter for his bitter strife
32. The old-time athlete drew!
