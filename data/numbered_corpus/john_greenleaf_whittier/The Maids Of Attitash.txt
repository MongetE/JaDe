1. In sky and wave the white clouds swam,
2. And the blue hills of Nottingham
3. Through gaps of leafy green
4. Across the lake were seen,

5. When, in the shadow of the ash
6. That dreams its dream in Attitash,
7. In the warm summer weather,
8. Two maidens sat together.

9. They sat and watched in idle mood
10. The gleam and shade of lake and wood;
11. The beach the keen light smote,
12. The white sail of a boat;

13. Swan flocks of lilies shoreward lying,
14. In sweetness, not in music, dying;
15. Hardback, and virgin's-bower,
16. And white-spiked clethra-flower.

17. With careless ears they heard the plash
18. And breezy wash of Attitash,
19. The wood-bird's plaintive cry,
20. The locust's sharp reply.

21. And teased the while, with playful band,
22. The shaggy dog of Newfoundland,
23. Whose uncouth frolic spilled
24. Their baskets berry-filled.

25. Then one, the beauty of whose eyes
26. Was evermore a great surprise,
27. Tossed back her queenly head,
28. And, lightly laughing, said:

29. 'No bridegroom's hand be mine to hold
30. That is not lined with yellow gold;
31. I tread no cottage-floor;
32. I own no lover poor.

33. 'My love must come on silken wings,
34. With bridal lights of diamond rings,
35. Not foul with kitchen smirch,
36. With tallow-dip for torch.'

37. The other, on whose modest head
38. Was lesser dower of beauty shed,
39. With look for home-hearths meet,
40. And voice exceeding sweet,

41. Answered, 'We will not rivals be;
42. Take thou the gold, leave love to me;
43. Mine be the cottage small,
44. And thine the rich man's hall.

45. 'I know, indeed, that wealth is good;
46. But lowly roof and simple food,
47. With love that hath no doubt,
48. Are more than gold without.'

49. Hard by a farmer hale and young
50. His cradle in the rye-field swung,
51. Tracking the yellow plain
52. With windrows of ripe grain.

53. And still, whene'er he paused to whet
54. His scythe, the sidelong glance he met
55. Of large dark eyes, where strove
56. False pride and secret love.

57. Be strong, young mower of the-grain;
58. That love shall overmatch disdain,
59. Its instincts soon or late
60. The heart shall vindicate.

61. In blouse of gray, with fishing-rod,
62. Half screened by leaves, a stranger trod
63. The margin of the pond,
64. Watching the group beyond.

65. The supreme hours unnoted come;
66. Unfelt the turning tides of doom;
67. And so the maids laughed on,
68. Nor dreamed what Fate had done,--

69. Nor knew the step was Destiny's
70. That rustled in the birchen trees,
71. As, with their lives forecast,
72. Fisher and mower passed.

73. Erelong by lake and rivulet side
74. The summer roses paled and died,
75. And Autumn's fingers shed
76. The maple's leaves of red.

77. Through the long gold-hazed afternoon,
78. Alone, but for the diving loon,
79. The partridge in the brake,
80. The black duck on the lake,

81. Beneath the shadow of the ash
82. Sat man and maid by Attitash;
83. And earth and air made room
84. For human hearts to bloom.

85. Soft spread the carpets of the sod,
86. And scarlet-oak and golden-rod
87. With blushes and with smiles
88. Lit up the forest aisles.

89. The mellow light the lake aslant,
90. The pebbled margin's ripple-chant
91. Attempered and low-toned,
92. The tender mystery owned.

93. And through the dream the lovers dreamed
94. Sweet sounds stole in and soft lights streamed;
95. The sunshine seemed to bless,
96. The air was a caress.

97. Not she who lightly laughed is there,
98. With scornful toss of midnight hair,
99. Her dark, disdainful eyes,
100. And proud lip worldly-wise.

101. Her haughty vow is still unsaid,
102. But all she dreamed and coveted
103. Wears, half to her surprise,
104. The youthful farmer's guise!

105. With more than all her old-time pride
106. She walks the rye-field at his side,
107. Careless of cot or hall,
108. Since love transfigures all.

109. Rich beyond dreams, the vantage-ground
110. Of life is gained; her hands have found
111. The talisman of old
112. That changes all to gold.

113. While she who could for love dispense
114. With all its glittering accidents,
115. And trust her heart alone,
116. Finds love and gold her own.

117. What wealth can buy or art can build
118. Awaits her; but her cup is filled
119. Even now unto the brim;
120. Her world is love and him!


121. . . . . .

122. The while he heard, the Book-man drew
123. A length of make-believing face,
124. With smothered mischief laughing through
125. 'Why, you shall sit in Ramsay's place,
126. And, with his Gentle Shepherd, keep
127. On Yankee hills immortal sheep,
128. While love-lorn swains and maids the seas beyond
129. Hold dreamy tryst around your huckleberry-pond.'

130. The Traveller laughed: 'Sir Galahad
131. Singing of love the Trouvere's lay!
132. How should he know the blindfold lad
133. From one of Vulcan's forge-boys?'--'Nay,
134. He better sees who stands outside
135. Than they who in procession ride,'
136. The Reader answered: 'selectmen and squire
137. Miss, while they make, the show that wayside folks admire.

138. 'Here is a wild tale of the North,
139. Our travelled friend will own as one
140. Fit for a Norland Christmas hearth
141. And lips of Christian Andersen.
142. They tell it in the valleys green
143. Of the fair island he has seen,
144. Low lying off the pleasant Swedish shore,
145. Washed by the Baltic Sea, and watched by Elsinore.'
