1. The Benedictine Echard
2. Sat by the wayside well,
3. Where Marsberg sees the bridal
4. Of the Sarre and the Moselle.

5. Fair with its sloping vineyards
6. And tawny chestnut bloom,
7. The happy vale Ausonius sunk
8. For holy Treves made room.

9. On the shrine Helena builded
10. To keep the Christ coat well,
11. On minster tower and kloster cross,
12. The westering sunshine fell.

13. There, where the rock-hewn circles
14. O'erlooked the Roman's game,
15. The veil of sleep fell on him,
16. And his thought a dream became.

17. He felt the heart of silence
18. Throb with a soundless word,
19. And by the inward ear alone
20. A spirit's voice he heard.

21. And the spoken word seemed written
22. On air and wave and sod,
23. And the bending walls of sapphire
24. Blazed with the thought of God.

25. 'What lack I, O my children?
26. All things are in my band;
27. The vast earth and the awful stars
28. I hold as grains of sand.

29. 'Need I your alms? The silver
30. And gold are mine alone;
31. The gifts ye bring before me
32. Were evermore my own.

33. 'Heed I the noise of viols,
34. Your pomp of masque and show?
35. Have I not dawns and sunsets
36. Have I not winds that blow?

37. 'Do I smell your gums of incense?
38. Is my ear with chantings fed?
39. Taste I your wine of worship,
40. Or eat your holy bread?

41. 'Of rank and name and honors
42. Am I vain as ye are vain?
43. What can Eternal Fulness
44. From your lip-service gain?

45. 'Ye make me not your debtor
46. Who serve yourselves alone;
47. Ye boast to me of homage
48. Whose gain is all your own.

49. 'For you I gave the prophets,
50. For you the Psalmist's lay
51. For you the law's stone tables,
52. And holy book and day.

53. 'Ye change to weary burdens
54. The helps that should uplift;
55. Ye lose in form the spirit,
56. The Giver in the gift.

57. 'Who called ye to self-torment,
58. To fast and penance vain?
59. Dream ye Eternal Goodness
60. Has joy in mortal pain?

61. 'For the death in life of Nitria,
62. For your Chartreuse ever dumb,
63. What better is the neighbor,
64. Or happier the home?

65. 'Who counts his brother's welfare
66. As sacred as his own,
67. And loves, forgives, and pities,
68. He serveth me alone.

69. 'I note each gracious purpose,
70. Each kindly word and deed;
71. Are ye not all my children?
72. Shall not the Father heed?

73. 'No prayer for light and guidance
74. Is lost upon mine ear
75. The child's cry in the darkness
76. Shall not the Father hear?

77. 'I loathe your wrangling councils,
78. I tread upon your creeds;
79. Who made ye mine avengers,
80. Or told ye of my needs;

81. 'I bless men and ye curse them,
82. I love them and ye hate;
83. Ye bite and tear each other,
84. I suffer long and wait.

85. 'Ye bow to ghastly symbols,
86. To cross and scourge and thorn;
87. Ye seek his Syrian manger
88. Who in the heart is born.

89. 'For the dead Christ, not the living,
90. Ye watch His empty grave,
91. Whose life alone within you
92. Has power to bless and save.

93. 'O blind ones, outward groping,
94. The idle quest forego;
95. Who listens to His inward voice
96. Alone of Him shall know.

97. 'His love all love exceeding
98. The heart must needs recall,
99. Its self-surrendering freedom,
100. Its loss that gaineth all.

101. 'Climb not the holy mountains,
102. Their eagles know not me;
103. Seek not the Blessed Islands,
104. I dwell not in the sea.

105. 'Gone is the mount of Meru,
106. The triple gods are gone,
107. And, deaf to all the lama's prayers,
108. The Buddha slumbers on.

109. 'No more from rocky Horeb
110. The smitten waters gush;
111. Fallen is Bethel's ladder,
112. Quenched is the burning bush.

113. 'The jewels of the Urim
114. And Thurnmim all are dim;
115. The fire has left the altar,
116. The sign the teraphim.

117. 'No more in ark or hill grove
118. The Holiest abides;
119. Not in the scroll's dead letter
120. The eternal secret hides.

121. 'The eye shall fail that searches
122. For me the hollow sky;
123. The far is even as the near,
124. The low is as the high.

125. 'What if the earth is hiding
126. Her old faiths, long outworn?
127. What is it to the changeless truth
128. That yours shall fail in turn?

129. 'What if the o'erturned altar
130. Lays bare the ancient lie?
131. What if the dreams and legends
132. Of the world's childhood die?

133. 'Have ye not still my witness
134. Within yourselves alway,
135. My hand that on the keys of life
136. For bliss or bale I lay?

137. 'Still, in perpetual judgment,
138. I hold assize within,
139. With sure reward of holiness,
140. And dread rebuke of sin.

141. 'A light, a guide, a warning,
142. A presence ever near,
143. Through the deep silence of the flesh
144. I reach the inward ear.

145. 'My Gerizim and Ebal
146. Are in each human soul,
147. The still, small voice of blessing,
148. And Sinai's thunder-roll.

149. 'The stern behest of duty,
150. The doom-book open thrown,
151. The heaven ye seek, the hell ye fear,
152. Are with yourselves alone.'

153. . . . . .

154. A gold and purple sunset
155. Flowed down the broad Moselle;
156. On hills of vine and meadow lands
157. The peace of twilight fell.

158. A slow, cool wind of evening
159. Blew over leaf and bloom;
160. And, faint and far, the Angelus
161. Rang from Saint Matthew's tomb.

162. Then up rose Master Echard,
163. And marvelled: 'Can it be
164. That here, in dream and vision,
165. The Lord hath talked with me?'

166. He went his way; behind him
167. The shrines of saintly dead,
168. The holy coat and nail of cross,
169. He left unvisited.

170. He sought the vale of Eltzbach
171. His burdened soul to free,
172. Where the foot-hills of the Eifel
173. Are glassed in Laachersee.

174. And, in his Order's kloster,
175. He sat, in night-long parle,
176. With Tauler of the Friends of God,
177. And Nicolas of Basle.

178. And lo! the twain made answer
179. 'Yea, brother, even thus
180. The Voice above all voices
181. Hath spoken unto us.

182. 'The world will have its idols,
183. And flesh and sense their sign
184. But the blinded eyes shall open,
185. And the gross ear be fine.

186. 'What if the vision tarry?
187. God's time is always best;
188. The true Light shall be witnessed,
189. The Christ within confessed.

190. 'In mercy or in judgment
191. He shall turn and overturn,
192. Till the heart shall be His temple
193. Where all of Him shall learn.'
