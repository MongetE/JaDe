1. THE years are but half a score,
2. And the war-whoop sounds no more
3. With the blast of bugles, where
4. Straight into a slaughter pen,
5. With his doomed three hundred men,
6. Rode the chief with the yellow hair.
7. O Hampton, down by the sea!
8. What voice is beseeching thee
9. For the scholar's lowliest place?
10. Can. this be the voice of him
11. Who fought on the Big Horn's rim?
12. Can this be Rain-in-the-Face?
13. His war-paint is washed away,
14. Hls hands have forgotten to slay;
15. He seeks for himself and his race
16. The arts of peace and the lore
17. That give to the skilled hand more
18. Than the spoils of war and chase.
19. O chief of the Christ-like school!
20. Can the zeal of thy heart grow cool
21. When the victor scarred with fight
22. Like a child for thy guidance craves,
23. And the faces of hunters and braves
24. Are turning to thee for light?
25. The hatchet lies overgrown
26. With grass by the Yellowstone,
27. Wind River and Paw of Bear;
28. And, in sign that foes are friends,
29. Each lodge like a peace-pipe sends
30. Its smoke in the quiet air.
31. The hands that have done the wrong
32. To right the wronged are strong,
33. And the voice of a nation saith:
34. 'Enough of the war of swords,
35. Enough of the lying words
36. And shame of a broken faith!'
37. The hills that have watched afar
38. The valleys ablaze with war
39. Shall look on the tasselled corn;
40. And the dust of the grinded grain,
41. Instead of the blood of the slain,
42. Shall sprinkle thy banks, Big Horn!
43. The Ute and the wandering Crow
44. Shall know as the white men know,
45. And fare as the white men fare;
46. The pale and the red shall be brothers,
47. One's rights shall be as another's,
48. Home, School, and House of Prayer!
49. O mountains that climb to snow,
50. O river winding below,
51. Through meadows by war once trod,
52. O wild, waste lands that await
53. The harvest exceeding great,
54. Break forth into praise of God!
