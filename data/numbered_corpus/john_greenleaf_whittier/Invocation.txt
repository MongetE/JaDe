1. Through Thy clear spaces, Lord, of old,
2. Formless and void the dead earth rolled;
3. Deaf to Thy heaven's sweet music, blind
4. To the great lights which o'er it shined;
5. No sound, no ray, no warmth, no breath,--
6. A dumb despair, a wandering death.

7. To that dark, weltering horror came
8. Thy spirit, like a subtle flame,--
9. A breath of life electrical,
10. Awakening and transforming all,
11. Till beat and thrilled in every part
12. The pulses of a living heart.

13. Then knew their bounds the land and sea;
14. Then smiled the bloom of mead and tree;
15. From flower to moth, from beast to man,
16. The quick creative impulse ran;
17. And earth, with life from thee renewed,
18. Was in thy holy eyesight good.

19. As lost and void, as dark and cold
20. And formless as that earth of old;
21. A wandering waste of storm and night,
22. Midst spheres of song and realms of light;
23. A blot upon thy holy sky,
24. Untouched, unwarned of thee, am I.

25. O Thou who movest on the deep
26. Of spirits, wake my own from sleep
27. Its darkness melt, its coldness warm,
28. The lost restore, the ill transform,
29. That flower and fruit henceforth may be
30. Its grateful offering, worthy Thee.
