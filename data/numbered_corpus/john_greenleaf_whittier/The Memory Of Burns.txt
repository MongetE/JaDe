1. How sweetly come the holy psalms
2. From saints and martyrs down,
3. The waving of triumphal palms
4. Above the thorny crown
5. The choral praise, the chanted prayers
6. From harps by angels strung,
7. The hunted Cameron's mountain airs,
8. The hymns that Luther sung!

9. Yet, jarring not the heavenly notes,
10. The sounds of earth are heard,
11. As through the open minster floats
12. The song of breeze and bird
13. Not less the wonder of the sky
14. That daisies bloom below;
15. The brook sings on, though loud and high
16. The cloudy organs blow!

17. And, if the tender ear be jarred
18. That, haply, hears by turns
19. The saintly harp of Olney's bard,
20. The pastoral pipe of Burns,
21. No discord mars His perfect plan
22. Who gave them both a tongue;
23. For he who sings the love of man
24. The love of God hath sung!

25. To-day be every fault forgiven
26. Of him in whom we joy
27. We take, with thanks, the gold of Heaven
28. And leave the earth's alloy.
29. Be ours his music as of spring,
30. His sweetness as of flowers,
31. The songs the bard himself might sing
32. In holier ears than ours.

33. Sweet airs of love and home, the hum
34. Of household melodies,
35. Come singing, as the robins come
36. To sing in door-yard trees.
37. And, heart to heart, two nations lean,
38. No rival wreaths to twine,
39. But blending in eternal green
40. The holly and the pine!
