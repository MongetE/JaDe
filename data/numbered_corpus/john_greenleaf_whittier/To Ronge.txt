1. Strike home, strong-hearted man! Down to the root
2. Of old oppression sink the Saxon steel.
3. Thy work is to hew down. In God's name then
4. Put nerve into thy task. Let other men
5. Plant, as they may, that better tree whose fruit
6. The wounded bosom of the Church shall heal.
7. Be thou the image-breaker. Let thy blows
8. Fall heavy as the Suabian's iron hand,
9. On crown or crosier, which shall interpose
10. Between thee and the weal of Fatherland.
11. Leave creeds to closet idlers. First of all,
12. Shake thou all German dream-land with the fall
13. Of that accursed tree, whose evil trunk
14. Was spared of old by Erfurt's stalwart monk.
15. Fight not with ghosts and shadows. Let us hear
16. The snap of chain-links. Let our gladdened ear
17. Catch the pale prisoner's welcome, as the light
18. Follows thy axe-stroke, through his cell of night.
19. Be faithful to both worlds; nor think to feed
20. Earth's starving millions with the husks of creed.
21. Servant of Him whose mission high and holy
22. Was to the wronged, the sorrowing, and the lowly,
23. Thrust not his Eden promise from our sphere,
24. Distant and dim beyond the blue sky's span;
25. Like him of Patmos, see it, now and here,
26. The New Jerusalem comes down to man
27. Be warned by Luther's error. Nor like him,
28. When the roused Teuton dashes from his limb
29. The rusted chain of ages, help to bind
30. His hands for whom thou claim'st the freedom of
31. the mind
