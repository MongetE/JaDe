1. THE winding way the serpent takes
2. The mystic water took,
3. From where, to count its beaded lakes,
4. The forest sped its brook.

5. A narrow space 'twixt shore and shore,
6. For sun or stars to fall,
7. While evermore, behind, before,
8. Closed in the forest wall.

9. The dim wood hiding underneath
10. Wan flowers without a name;
11. Life tangled with decay and death,
12. League after league the same.

13. Unbroken over swamp and hill
14. The rounding shadow lay,
15. Save where the river cut at will
16. A pathway to the day.

17. Beside that track of air and light,
18. Weak as a child unweaned,
19. At shut of day a Christian knight
20. Upon his henchman leaned.

21. The embers of the sunset's fires
22. Along the clouds burned down;
23. 'I see,' he said, 'the domes and spires
24. Of Norembega town.'

25. 'Alack! the domes, O master mine,
26. Are golden clouds on high;
27. Yon spire is but the branchless pine
28. That cuts the evening sky.'

29. 'Oh, hush and hark! What sounds are these
30. But chants and holy hymns?'
31. 'Thou hear'st the breeze that stirs the trees
32. Though all their leafy limbs.'

33. 'Is it a chapel bell that fills
34. The air with its low tone?'
35. 'Thou hear'st the tinkle of the rills,
36. The insect's vesper drone.'

37. 'The Christ be praised!--He sets for me
38. A blessed cross in sight!'
39. 'Now, nay, 't is but yon blasted tree
40. With two gaunt arms outright!'

41. 'Be it wind so sad or tree so stark,
42. It mattereth not, my knave;
43. Methinks to funeral hymns I hark,
44. The cross is for my grave!

45. 'My life is sped; I shall not see
46. My home-set sails again;
47. The sweetest eyes of Normandie
48. Shall watch for me in vain.

49. 'Yet onward still to ear and eye
50. The baffling marvel calls;
51. I fain would look before I die
52. On Norembega's walls.

53. 'So, haply, it shall be thy part
54. At Christian feet to lay
55. The mystery of the desert's heart
56. My dead hand plucked away.

57. 'Leave me an hour of rest; go thou
58. And look from yonder heights;
59. Perchance the valley even now
60. Is starred with city lights.'

61. The henchman climbed the nearest hill,
62. He saw nor tower nor town,
63. But, through the drear woods, lone and still,
64. The river rolling down.

65. He heard the stealthy feet of things
66. Whose shapes he could not see,
67. A flutter as of evil wings,
68. The fall of a dead tree.

69. The pines stood black against the moon,
70. A sword of fire beyond;
71. He heard the wolf howl, and the loon
72. Laugh from his reedy pond.

73. He turned him back: 'O master dear,
74. We are but men misled;
75. And thou hast sought a city here
76. To find a grave instead.'

77. 'As God shall will! what matters where
78. A true man's cross may stand,
79. So Heaven be o'er it here as there
80. In pleasant Norman land?

81. 'These woods, perchance, no secret hide
82. Of lordly tower and hall;
83. Yon river in its wanderings wide
84. Has washed no city wall;

85. 'Yet mirrored in the sullen stream
86. The holy stars are given
87. Is Norembega, then, a dream
88. Whose waking is in Heaven?

89. 'No builded wonder of these lands
90. My weary eyes shall see;
91. A city never made with hands
92. Alone awaiteth me--

93. ''_Urbs Syon mystica_;' I see
94. Its mansions passing fair,
95. '/Condita caelo/;' let me be,
96. Dear Lord, a dweller there!'

97. Above the dying exile hung
98. The vision of the bard,
99. As faltered on his failing tongue
100. The song of good Bernard.

101. The henchman dug at dawn a grave
102. Beneath the hemlocks brown,
103. And to the desert's keeping gave
104. The lord of fief and town.

105. Years after, when the Sieur Champlain
106. Sailed up the unknown stream,
107. And Norembega proved again
108. A shadow and a dream,

109. He found the Norman's nameless grave
110. Within the hemlock's shade,
111. And, stretching wide its arms to save,
112. The sign that God had made,

113. The cross-boughed tree that marked the spot
114. And made it holy ground
115. He needs the earthly city not
116. Who hath the heavenly found.
