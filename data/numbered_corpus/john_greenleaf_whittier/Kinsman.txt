1. Where ceaseless Spring her garland twines,
2. As sweetly shall the loved one rest,
3. As if beneath the whispering pines
4. And maple shadows of the West.

5. Ye mourn, O hearts of home! for him,
6. But, haply, mourn ye not alone;
7. For him shall far-off eyes be dim,
8. And pity speak in tongues unknown.

9. There needs no graven line to give
10. The story of his blameless youth;
11. All hearts shall throb intuitive,
12. And nature guess the simple truth.

13. The very meaning of his name
14. Shall many a tender tribute win;
15. The stranger own his sacred claim,
16. And all the world shall be his kin.

17. And there, as here, on main and isle,
18. The dews of holy peace shall fall,
19. The same sweet heavens above him smile,
20. And God's dear love be over all
