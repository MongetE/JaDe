1. WHEN first I saw our banner wave
2. Above the nation's council-hall,
3. I heard beneath its marble wall
4. The clanking fetters of the slave!

5. In the foul market-place I stood,
6. And saw the Christian mother sold,
7. And childhood with its locks of gold,
8. Blue-eyed and fair with Saxon blood.

9. I shut my eyes, I held my breath,
10. And, smothering down the wrath and shame
11. That set my Northern blood aflame,
12. Stood silent,--where to speak was death.

13. Beside me gloomed the prison-cell
14. Where wasted one in slow decline
15. For uttering simple words of mine,
16. And loving freedom all too well.

17. The flag that floated from the dome
18. Flapped menace in the morning air;
19. I stood a perilled stranger where
20. The human broker made his home.

21. For crime was virtue: Gown and Sword
22. And Law their threefold sanction gave,
23. And to the quarry of the slave
24. Went hawking with our symbol-bird.

25. On the oppressor's side was power;
26. And yet I knew that every wrong,
27. However old, however strong,
28. But waited God's avenging hour.

29. I knew that truth would crush the lie,
30. Somehow, some time, the end would be;
31. Yet scarcely dared I hope to see
32. The triumph with my mortal eye.

33. But now I see it! In the sun
34. A free flag floats from yonder dome,
35. And at the nation's hearth and home
36. The justice long delayed is done.

37. Not as we hoped, in calm of prayer,
38. The message of deliverance comes,
39. But heralded by roll of drums
40. On waves of battle-troubled air!

41. Midst sounds that madden and appall,
42. The song that Bethlehem's shepherds knew!
43. The harp of David melting through
44. The demon-agonies of Saul!

45. Not as we hoped; but what are we?
46. Above our broken dreams and plans
47. God lays, with wiser hand than man's,
48. The corner-stones of liberty.

49. I cavil not with Him: the voice
50. That freedom's blessed gospel tells
51. Is sweet to me as silver bells,
52. Rejoicing! yea, I will rejoice!

53. Dear friends still toiling in the sun;
54. Ye dearer ones who, gone before,
55. Are watching from the eternal shore
56. The slow work by your hands begun,

57. Rejoice with me! The chastening rod
58. Blossoms with love; the furnace heat
59. Grows cool beneath His blessed feet
60. Whose form is as the Son of God!

61. Rejoice! Our Marah's bitter springs
62. Are sweetened; on our ground of grief
63. Rise day by day in strong relief
64. The prophecies of better things.

65. Rejoice in hope! The day and night
66. Are one with God, and one with them
67. Who see by faith the cloudy hem
68. Of Judgement fringed with Mercy's light
