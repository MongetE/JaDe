1. Luck to the craft that bears this name of mine,
2. Good fortune follow with her golden spoon
3. The glazed hat and tarry pantaloon;
4. And wheresoe'er her keel shall cut the brine,
5. Cod, hake and haddock quarrel for her line.
6. Shipped with her crew, whatever wind may blow,
7. Or tides delay, my wish with her shall go,
8. Fishing by proxy. Would that it might show
9. At need her course, in lack of sun and star,
10. Where icebergs threaten, and the sharp reefs are;
11. Lift the blind fog on Anticosti's lee
12. And Avalon's rock; make populous the sea
13. Round Grand Manan with eager finny swarms,
14. Break the long calms, and charm away the storms.
