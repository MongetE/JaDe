1. Where the Great Lake's sunny smiles
2. Dimple round its hundred isles,
3. And the mountain's granite ledge
4. Cleaves the water like a wedge,
5. Ringed about with smooth, gray stones,
6. Rest the giant's mighty bones.

7. Close beside, in shade and gleam,
8. Laughs and ripples Melvin stream;
9. Melvin water, mountain-born,
10. All fair flowers its banks adorn;
11. All the woodland's voices meet,
12. Mingling with its murmurs sweet.

13. Over lowlands forest-grown,
14. Over waters island-strown,
15. Over silver-sanded beach,
16. Leaf-locked bay and misty reach,
17. Melvin stream and burial-heap,
18. Watch and ward the mountains keep.

19. Who that Titan cromlech fills?
20. Forest-kaiser, lord o' the hills?
21. Knight who on the birchen tree
22. Carved his savage heraldry?
23. Priest o' the pine-wood temples dim,
24. Prophet, sage, or wizard grim?

25. Rugged type of primal man,
26. Grim utilitarian,
27. Loving woods for hunt and prowl,
28. Lake and hill for fish and fowl,
29. As the brown bear blind and dull
30. To the grand and beautiful:

31. Not for him the lesson drawn
32. From the mountains smit with dawn,
33. Star-rise, moon-rise, flowers of May,
34. Sunset's purple bloom of day,--
35. Took his life no hue from thence,
36. Poor amid such affluence?

37. Haply unto hill and tree
38. All too near akin was he
39. Unto him who stands afar
40. Nature's marvels greatest are;
41. Who the mountain purple seeks
42. Must not climb the higher peaks.

43. Yet who knows in winter tramp,
44. Or the midnight of the camp,
45. What revealings faint and far,
46. Stealing down from moon and star,
47. Kindled in that human clod
48. Thought of destiny and God?

49. Stateliest forest patriarch,
50. Grand in robes of skin and bark,
51. What sepulchral mysteries,
52. What weird funeral-rites, were his?
53. What sharp wail, what drear lament,
54. Back scared wolf and eagle sent?

55. Now, whate'er he may have been,
56. Low he lies as other men;
57. On his mound the partridge drums,
58. There the noisy blue-jay comes;
59. Rank nor name nor pomp has he
60. In the grave's democracy.

61. Part thy blue lips, Northern lake!
62. Moss-grown rocks, your silence break!
63. Tell the tale, thou ancient tree!
64. Thou, too, slide-worn Ossipee!
65. Speak, and tell us how and when
66. Lived and died this king of men!

67. Wordless moans the ancient pine;
68. Lake and mountain give no sign;
69. Vain to trace this ring of stones;
70. Vain the search of crumbling bones
71. Deepest of all mysteries,
72. And the saddest, silence is.

73. Nameless, noteless, clay with clay
74. Mingles slowly day by day;
75. But somewhere, for good or ill,
76. That dark soul is living still;
77. Somewhere yet that atom's force
78. Moves the light-poised universe.

79. Strange that on his burial-sod
80. Harebells bloom, and golden-rod,
81. While the soul's dark horoscope
82. Holds no starry sign of hope!
83. Is the Unseen with sight at odds?
84. Nature's pity more than God's?

85. Thus I mused by Melvin's side,
86. While the summer eventide
87. Made the woods and inland sea
88. And the mountains mystery;
89. And the hush of earth and air
90. Seemed the pause before a prayer,--

91. Prayer for him, for all who rest,
92. Mother Earth, upon thy breast,--
93. Lapped on Christian turf, or hid
94. In rock-cave or pyramid
95. All who sleep, as all who live,
96. Well may need the prayer, 'Forgive!'

97. Desert-smothered caravan,
98. Knee-deep dust that once was man,
99. Battle-trenches ghastly piled,
100. Ocean-floors with white bones tiled,
101. Crowded tomb and mounded sod,
102. Dumbly crave that prayer to God.

103. Oh, the generations old
104. Over whom no church-bells tolled,
105. Christless, lifting up blind eyes
106. To the silence of the skies!
107. For the innumerable dead
108. Is my soul disquieted.

109. Where be now these silent hosts?
110. Where the camping-ground of ghosts?
111. Where the spectral conscripts led
112. To the white tents of the dead?
113. What strange shore or chartless sea
114. Holds the awful mystery?

115. Then the warm sky stooped to make
116. Double sunset in the lake;
117. While above I saw with it,
118. Range on range, the mountains lit;
119. And the calm and splendor stole
120. Like an answer to my soul.

121. Hear'st thou, O of little faith,
122. What to thee the mountain saith,
123. What is whispered by the trees?
124. Cast on God thy care for these;
125. Trust Him, if thy sight be dim
126. Doubt for them is doubt of Him.

127. 'Blind must be their close-shut eyes
128. Where like night the sunshine lies,
129. Fiery-linked the self-forged chain
130. Binding ever sin to pain,
131. Strong their prison-house of will,
132. But without He waiteth still.

133. 'Not with hatred's undertow
134. Doth the Love Eternal flow;
135. Every chain that spirits wear
136. Crumbles in the breath of prayer;
137. And the penitent's desire
138. Opens every gate of fire.

139. 'Still Thy love, O Christ arisen,
140. Yearns to reach these souls in prison!
141. Through all depths of sin and loss
142. Drops the plummet of Thy cross!
143. Never yet abyss was found
144. Deeper than that cross could sound!'

145. Therefore well may Nature keep
146. Equal faith with all who sleep,
147. Set her watch of hills around
148. Christian grave and heathen mound,
149. And to cairn and kirkyard send
150. Summer's flowery dividend.

151. Keep, O pleasant Melvin stream,
152. Thy sweet laugh in shade and gleam
153. On the Indian's grassy tomb
154. Swing, O flowers, your bells of bloom!
155. Deep below, as high above,
156. Sweeps the circle of God's love.


157. . . . . .

158. He paused and questioned with his eye
159. The hearers' verdict on his song.
160. A low voice asked: Is 't well to pry
161. Into the secrets which belong
162. Only to God?--The life to be
163. Is still the unguessed mystery
164. Unsealed, unpierced the cloudy walls remain,
165. We beat with dream and wish the soundless doors in vain.

166. 'But faith beyond our sight may go.'
167. He said: 'The gracious Fatherhood
168. Can only know above, below,
169. Eternal purposes of good.
170. From our free heritage of will,
171. The bitter springs of pain and ill
172. Flow only in all worlds. The perfect day
173. Of God is shadowless, and love is love alway.'

174. 'I know,' she said, 'the letter kills;
175. That on our arid fields of strife
176. And heat of clashing texts distils
177. The clew of spirit and of life.
178. But, searching still the written Word,
179. I fain would find, Thus saith the Lord,
180. A voucher for the hope I also feel
181. That sin can give no wound beyond love's power to heal.'

182. 'Pray,' said the Man of Books, 'give o'er
183. A theme too vast for time and place.
184. Go on, Sir Poet, ride once more
185. Your hobby at his old free pace.
186. But let him keep, with step discreet,
187. The solid earth beneath his feet.
188. In the great mystery which around us lies,
189. The wisest is a fool, the fool Heaven-helped is wise.'

190. The Traveller said: 'If songs have creeds,
191. Their choice of them let singers make;
192. But Art no other sanction needs
193. Than beauty for its own fair sake.
194. It grinds not in the mill of use,
195. Nor asks for leave, nor begs excuse;
196. It makes the flexile laws it deigns to own,
197. And gives its atmosphere its color and its tone.

198. 'Confess, old friend, your austere school
199. Has left your fancy little chance;
200. You square to reason's rigid rule
201. The flowing outlines of romance.
202. With conscience keen from exercise,
203. And chronic fear of compromise,
204. You check the free play of your rhymes, to clap
205. A moral underneath, and spring it like a trap.'

206. The sweet voice answered: 'Better so
207. Than bolder flights that know no check;
208. Better to use the bit, than throw
209. The reins all loose on fancy's neck.
210. The liberal range of Art should be
211. The breadth of Christian liberty,
212. Restrained alone by challenge and alarm
213. Where its charmed footsteps tread the border land of harm.

214. 'Beyond the poet's sweet dream lives
215. The eternal epic of the man.
216. He wisest is who only gives,
217. True to himself, the best he can;
218. Who, drifting in the winds of praise,
219. The inward monitor obeys;
220. And, with the boldness that confesses fear,
221. Takes in the crowded sail, and lets his conscience steer.

222. 'Thanks for the fitting word he speaks,
223. Nor less for doubtful word unspoken;
224. For the false model that he breaks,
225. As for the moulded grace unbroken;
226. For what is missed and what remains,
227. For losses which are truest gains,
228. For reverence conscious of the Eternal eye,
229. And truth too fair to need the garnish of a lie.'

230. Laughing, the Critic bowed. 'I yield
231. The point without another word;
232. Who ever yet a case appealed
233. Where beauty's judgment had been heard?
234. And you, my good friend, owe to me
235. Your warmest thanks for such a plea,
236. As true withal as sweet. For my offence
237. Of cavil, let her words be ample recompense.'

238. Across the sea one lighthouse star,
239. With crimson ray that came and went,
240. Revolving on its tower afar,
241. Looked through the doorway of the tent.
242. While outward, over sand-slopes wet,
243. The lamp flashed down its yellow jet
244. On the long wash of waves, with red and green
245. Tangles of weltering weed through the white foam-wreaths seen.

246. 'Sing while we may,--another day
247. May bring enough of sorrow;'--thus
248. Our Traveller in his own sweet lay,
249. His Crimean camp-song, hints to us,'
250. The lady said. 'So let it be;
251. Sing us a song,' exclaimed all three.
252. She smiled: 'I can but marvel at your choice
253. To hear our poet's words through my poor borrowed voice.'

254. . . . . .

255. Her window opens to the bay,
256. On glistening light or misty gray,
257. And there at dawn and set of day
258. In prayer she kneels.

259. 'Dear Lord!' she saith, 'to many a borne
260. From wind and wave the wanderers come;
261. I only see the tossing foam
262. Of stranger keels.

263. 'Blown out and in by summer gales,
264. The stately ships, with crowded sails,
265. And sailors leaning o'er their rails,
266. Before me glide;
267. They come, they go, but nevermore,
268. Spice-laden from the Indian shore,
269. I see his swift-winged Isidore
270. The waves divide.

271. 'O Thou! with whom the night is day
272. And one the near and far away,
273. Look out on yon gray waste, and say
274. Where lingers he.
275. Alive, perchance, on some lone beach
276. Or thirsty isle beyond the reach
277. Of man, he hears the mocking speech
278. Of wind and sea.

279. 'O dread and cruel deep, reveal
280. The secret which thy waves conceal,
281. And, ye wild sea-birds, hither wheel
282. And tell your tale.
283. Let winds that tossed his raven hair
284. A message from my lost one bear,--
285. Some thought of me, a last fond prayer
286. Or dying wail!

287. 'Come, with your dreariest truth shut out
288. The fears that haunt me round about;
289. O God! I cannot bear this doubt
290. That stifles breath.
291. The worst is better than the dread;
292. Give me but leave to mourn my dead
293. Asleep in trust and hope, instead
294. Of life in death!'

295. It might have been the evening breeze
296. That whispered in the garden trees,
297. It might have been the sound of seas
298. That rose and fell;
299. But, with her heart, if not her ear,
300. The old loved voice she seemed to hear
301. 'I wait to meet thee: be of cheer,
302. For all is well!'


303. . . . . .

304. The sweet voice into silence went,
305. A silence which was almost pain
306. As through it rolled the long lament,
307. The cadence of the mournful main.
308. Glancing his written pages o'er,
309. The Reader tried his part once more;
310. Leaving the land of hackmatack and pine
311. For Tuscan valleys glad with olive and with vine.
