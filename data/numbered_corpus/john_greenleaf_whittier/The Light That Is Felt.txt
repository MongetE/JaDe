1. A tender child of summers three,
2. Seeking her little bed at night,
3. Paused on the dark stair timidly.
4. 'Oh, mother! Take my hand,' said she,
5. 'And then the dark will all be light.'

6. We older children grope our way
7. From dark behind to dark before;
8. And only when our hands we lay,
9. Dear Lord, in Thine, the night is day,
10. And there is darkness nevermore.

11. Reach downward to the sunless days
12. Wherein our guides are blind as we,
13. And faith is small and hope delays;
14. Take Thou the hands of prayer we raise,
15. And let us feel the light of Thee!
