1. THE proudest now is but my peer,
2. The highest not more high;
3. To-day, of all the weary year,
4. A king of men am I.
5. To-day, alike are great and small,
6. The nameless and the known;
7. My palace is the people's hall,
8. The ballot-box my throne!
9. Who serves to-day upon the list
10. Beside the served shall stand;
11. Alike the brown and wrinkled fist,
12. The gloved and dainty hand!
13. The rich is level with the poor,
14. The weak is strong to-day;
15. And sleekest broadcloth counts no more
16. Than homespun frock of gray.
17. To-day let pomp and vain pretence
18. My stubborn right abide;
19. I set a plain man's common sense
20. Against the pedant's pride.
21. To-day shall simple manhood try
22. The strength of gold and land;
23. The wide world has not wealth to buy
24. The power in my right hand!
25. While there's a grief to seek redress,
26. Or balance to adjust,
27. Where weighs our living manhood less
28. Than Mammon's vilest dust, â€”
29. While there's a right to need my vote,
30. A wrong to sweep away,
31. Up! clouted knee and ragged coat!
32. A man's a man to-day!
