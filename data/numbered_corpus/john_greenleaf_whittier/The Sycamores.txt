1. In the outskirts of the village
2. On the river's winding shores
3. Stand the Occidental plane-trees,
4. Stand the ancient sycamores.

5. One long century hath been numbered,
6. And another half-way told
7. Since the rustic Irish gleeman
8. Broke for them the virgin mould.

9. Deftly set to Celtic music
10. At his violin's sound they grew,
11. Through the moonlit eves of summer,
12. Making Amphion's fable true.

13. Rise again, thou poor Hugh Tallant!
14. Pass in erkin green along
15. With thy eyes brim full of laughter,
16. And thy mouth as full of song.

17. Pioneer of Erin's outcasts
18. With his fiddle and his pack-
19. Little dreamed the village Saxons
20. Of the myriads at his back.

21. How he wrought with spade and fiddle,
22. Delved by day and sang by night,
23. With a hand that never wearied
24. And a heart forever light,---

25. Still the gay tradition mingles
26. With a record grave and drear
27. Like the rollic air of Cluny
28. With the solemn march of Mear.

29. When the box-tree, white with blossoms,
30. Made the sweet May woodlands glad,
31. And the Aronia by the river
32. Lighted up the swarming shad,

33. And the bulging nets swept shoreward
34. With their silver-sided haul,
35. Midst the shouts of dripping fishers,
36. He was merriest of them all.

37. When, among the jovial huskers
38. Love stole in at Labor's side
39. With the lusty airs of England
40. Soft his Celtic measures vied.

41. Songs of love and wailing lyke-wake
42. And the merry fair's carouse;
43. Of the wild Red Fox of Erin
44. And the Woman of Three Cows,

45. By the blazing hearths of winter
46. Pleasant seemed his simple tales,
47. Midst the grimmer Yorkshire legends
48. And the mountain myths of Wales.

49. How the souls in Purgatory
50. Scrambled up from fate forlorn
51. On St. Keven's sackcloth ladder
52. Slyly hitched to Satan's horn.

53. Of the fiddler who at Tara
54. Played all night to ghosts of kings;
55. Of the brown dwarfs, and the fairies
56. Dancing in their moorland rings!

57. Jolliest of our birds of singing
58. Best he loved the Bob-o-link.
59. "Hush!" he'd say, "the tipsy fairies!
60. Hear the little folks in drink!"

61. Merry-faced, with spade and fiddle,
62. Singing through the ancient town,
63. Only this, of poor Hugh Tallant
64. Hath Tradtion handed down.

65. Not a stone his grave discloses;
66. But if yet his spirit walks
67. Tis beneath the trees he planted
68. And when Bob-o-Lincoln talks.

69. Green memorials of the gleeman!
70. Linking still the river-shores,
71. With their shadows cast by sunset
72. Stand Hugh Tallant's sycamores!

73. When the Father of his Country
74. Through the north-land riding came
75. And the roofs were starred with banners,
76. And the steeples rang acclaim,---

77. When each war-scarred Continental
78. Leaving smithy, mill,.and farm,
79. Waved his rusted sword in welcome,
80. And shot off his old king's-arm,---

81. Slowly passed that august Presence
82. Down the thronged and shouting street;
83. Village girls as white as angels
84. Scattering flowers around his feet.

85. Midway, where the plane-tree's shadow
86. Deepest fell, his rein he drew:
87. On his stately head, uncovered,
88. Cool and soft the west-wind blew.

89. And he stood up in his stirrups,
90. Looking up and looking down
91. On the hills of Gold and Silver
92. Rimming round the little town,---

93. On the river, full of sunshine,
94. To the lap of greenest vales
95. Winding down from wooded headlands,
96. Willow-skirted, white with sails.

97. And he said, the landscape sweeping
98. Slowly with his ungloved hand
99. "I have seen no prospect fairer
100. In this goodly Eastern land."

101. Then the bugles of his escort
102. Stirred to life the cavalcade:
103. And that head, so bare and stately
104. Vanished down the depths of shade.

105. Ever since, in town and farm-house,
106. Life has had its ebb and flow;
107. Thrice hath passed the human harvest
108. To its garner green and low.

109. But the trees the gleeman planted,
110. Through the changes, changeless stand;
111. As the marble calm of Tadmor
112. Mocks the deserts shifting sand.

113. Still the level moon at rising
114. Silvers o'er each stately shaft;
115. Still beneath them, half in shadow,
116. Singing, glides the pleasure craft;

117. Still beneath them, arm-enfolded,
118. Love and Youth together stray;
119. While, as heart to heart beats faster,
120. More and more their feet delay.

121. Where the ancient cobbler, Keezar,
122. On the open hillside justice wrought,
123. Singing, as he drew his stitches,
124. Songs his German masters taught.

125. Singing, with his gray hair floating
126. Round a rosy ample face,---
127. Now a thousand Saxon craftsmen
128. Stitch and hammer in his place.

129. All the pastoral lanes so grassy
130. Now are Traffic's dusty streets;
131. From the village, grown a city,
132. Fast the rural grace retreats.

133. But, still green and tall and stately,
134. On the river's winding shores,
135. Stand the occidental plane-trees,
136. Stand Hugh Tallant's sycamores.
