1. THE Rabbi Ishmael, with the woe and sin
2. Of the world heavy upon him, entering in
3. The Holy of Holies, saw an awful Face
4. With terrible splendor filling all the place.
5. 'O Ishmael Ben Elisha!' said a voice,
6. 'What seekest thou? What blessing is thy choice?'
7. And, knowing that he stood before the Lord,
8. Within the shadow of the cherubim,
9. Wide-winged between the blinding light and him,
10. He bowed himself, and uttered not a word,
11. But in the silence of his soul was prayer
12. 'O Thou Eternal! I am one of all,
13. And nothing ask that others may not share.
14. Thou art almighty; we are weak and small,
15. And yet Thy children: let Thy mercy spare!'
16. Trembling, he raised his eyes, and in the place
17. Of the insufferable glory, lo! a face
18. Of more than mortal tenderness, that bent
19. Graciously down in token of assent,
20. And, smiling, vanished! With strange joy elate,
21. The wondering Rabbi sought the temple's gate.
22. Radiant as Moses from the Mount, he stood
23. And cried aloud unto the multitude
24. 'O Israel, hear! The Lord our God is good!
25. Mine eyes have seen his glory and his grace;
26. Beyond his judgments shall his love endure;
27. The mercy of the All Merciful is sure!'
