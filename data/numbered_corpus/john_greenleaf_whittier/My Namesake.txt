1. Addressed to Francis Greenleaf Allison of Burlington, New Jersey.

2. You scarcely need my tardy thanks,
3. Who, self-rewarded, nurse and tend--
4. A green leaf on your own Green Banks--
5. The memory of your friend.

6. For me, no wreath, bloom-woven, hides
7. The sobered brow and lessening hair
8. For aught I know, the myrtled sides
9. Of Helicon are bare.

10. Their scallop-shells so many bring
11. The fabled founts of song to try,
12. They've drained, for aught I know, the spring
13. Of Aganippe dry.

14. Ah well!--The wreath the Muses braid
15. Proves often Folly's cap and bell;
16. Methinks, my ample beaver's shade
17. May serve my turn as well.

18. Let Love's and Friendship's tender debt
19. Be paid by those I love in life.
20. Why should the unborn critic whet
21. For me his scalping-knife?

22. Why should the stranger peer and pry
23. One's vacant house of life about,
24. And drag for curious ear and eye
25. His faults and follies out?--

26. Why stuff, for fools to gaze upon,
27. With chaff of words, the garb he wore,
28. As corn-husks when the ear is gone
29. Are rustled all the more?

30. Let kindly Silence close again,
31. The picture vanish from the eye,
32. And on the dim and misty main
33. Let the small ripple die.

34. Yet not the less I own your claim
35. To grateful thanks, dear friends of mine.
36. Hang, if it please you so, my name
37. Upon your household line.

38. Let Fame from brazen lips blow wide
39. Her chosen names, I envy none
40. A mother's love, a father's pride,
41. Shall keep alive my own!

42. Still shall that name as now recall
43. The young leaf wet with morning dew,
44. The glory where the sunbeams fall
45. The breezy woodlands through.

46. That name shall be a household word,
47. A spell to waken smile or sigh;
48. In many an evening prayer be heard
49. And cradle lullaby.

50. And thou, dear child, in riper days
51. When asked the reason of thy name,
52. Shalt answer: One 't were vain to praise
53. Or censure bore the same.

54. 'Some blamed him, some believed him good,
55. The truth lay doubtless 'twixt the two;
56. He reconciled as best he could
57. Old faith and fancies new.

58. 'In him the grave and playful mixed,
59. And wisdom held with folly truce,
60. And Nature compromised betwixt
61. Good fellow and recluse.

62. 'He loved his friends, forgave his foes;
63. And, if his words were harsh at times,
64. He spared his fellow-men,--his blows
65. Fell only on their crimes.

66. 'He loved the good and wise, but found
67. His human heart to all akin
68. Who met him on the common ground
69. Of suffering and of sin.

70. 'Whate'er his neighbors might endure
71. Of pain or grief his own became;
72. For all the ills he could not cure
73. He held himself to blame.

74. 'His good was mainly an intent,
75. His evil not of forethought done;
76. The work he wrought was rarely meant
77. Or finished as begun.

78. 'Ill served his tides of feeling strong
79. To turn the common mills of use;
80. And, over restless wings of song,
81. His birthright garb hung loose!

82. 'His eye was beauty's powerless slave,
83. And his the ear which discord pains;
84. Few guessed beneath his aspect grave
85. What passions strove in chains.

86. 'He had his share of care and pain,
87. No holiday was life to him;
88. Still in the heirloom cup we drain
89. The bitter drop will swim.

90. 'Yet Heaven was kind, and here a bird
91. And there a flower beguiled his way;
92. And, cool, in summer noons, he heard
93. The fountains plash and play.

94. 'On all his sad or restless moods
95. The patient peace of Nature stole;
96. The quiet of the fields and woods
97. Sank deep into his soul.

98. 'He worshipped as his fathers did,
99. And kept the faith of childish days,
100. And, howsoe'er he strayed or slid,
101. He loved the good old ways.

102. 'The simple tastes, the kindly traits,
103. The tranquil air, and gentle speech,
104. The silence of the soul that waits
105. For more than man to teach.

106. 'The cant of party, school, and sect,
107. Provoked at times his honest scorn,
108. And Folly, in its gray respect,
109. He tossed on satire's horn.

110. 'But still his heart was full of awe
111. And reverence for all sacred things;
112. And, brooding over form and law,'
113. He saw the Spirit's wings!

114. 'Life's mystery wrapt him like a cloud;
115. He heard far voices mock his own,
116. The sweep of wings unseen, the loud,
117. Long roll of waves unknown.

118. 'The arrows of his straining sight
119. Fell quenched in darkness; priest and sage,
120. Like lost guides calling left and right,
121. Perplexed his doubtful age.

122. 'Like childhood, listening for the sound
123. Of its dropped pebbles in the well,
124. All vainly down the dark profound
125. His brief-lined plummet fell.

126. 'So, scattering flowers with pious pains
127. On old beliefs, of later creeds,
128. Which claimed a place in Truth's domains,
129. He asked the title-deeds.

130. 'He saw the old-time's groves and shrines
131. In the long distance fair and dim;
132. And heard, like sound of far-off pines,
133. The century-mellowed hymn!

134. 'He dared not mock the Dervish whirl,
135. The Brahmin's rite, the Lama's spell;
136. God knew the heart; Devotion's pearl
137. Might sanctify the shell.

138. 'While others trod the altar stairs
139. He faltered like the publican;
140. And, while they praised as saints, his prayers
141. Were those of sinful man.

142. 'For, awed by Sinai's Mount of Law,
143. The trembling faith alone sufficed,
144. That, through its cloud and flame, he saw
145. The sweet, sad face of Christ!

146. 'And listening, with his forehead bowed,
147. Heard the Divine compassion fill
148. The pauses of the trump and cloud
149. With whispers small and still.

150. 'The words he spake, the thoughts he penned,
151. Are mortal as his hand and brain,
152. But, if they served the Master's end,
153. He has not lived in vain!'

154. Heaven make thee better than thy name,
155. Child of my friends!--For thee I crave
156. What riches never bought, nor fame
157. To mortal longing gave.

158. I pray the prayer of Plato old:
159. God make thee beautiful within,
160. And let thine eyes the good behold
161. In everything save sin!

162. Imagination held in check
163. To serve, not rule, thy poised mind;
164. Thy Reason, at the frown or beck
165. Of Conscience, loose or bind.

166. No dreamer thou, but real all,--
167. Strong manhood crowning vigorous youth;
168. Life made by duty epical
169. And rhythmic with the truth.

170. So shall that life the fruitage yield
171. Which trees of healing only give,
172. And green-leafed in the Eternal field
173. Of God, forever live!
