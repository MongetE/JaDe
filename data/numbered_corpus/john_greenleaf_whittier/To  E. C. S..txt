1. Poet and friend of poets, if thy glass
2. Detects no flower in winter's tuft of grass,
3. Let this slight token of the debt I owe
4. Outlive for thee December's frozen day,
5. And, like the arbutus budding under snow,
6. Take bloom and fragrance from some morn of May
7. When he who gives it shall have gone the way
8. Where faith shall see and reverent trust shall know.
