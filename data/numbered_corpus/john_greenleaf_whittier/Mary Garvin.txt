1. FROM the heart of Waumbek Methna, from the
2. lake that never fails,
3. Falls the Saco in the green lap of Conway's
4. intervales;
5. There, in wild and virgin freshness, its waters
6. foam and flow,
7. As when Darby Field first saw them, two hundred
8. years ago.

9. But, vexed in all its seaward course with bridges,
10. dams, and mills,
11. How changed is Saco's stream, how lost its freedom
12. of the hills,
13. Since travelled Jocelyn, factor Vines, and stately
14. Champernoon
15. Heard on its banks the gray wolf's howl, the trumpet
16. of the loon!

17. With smoking axle hot with speed, with steeds of
18. fire and steam,
19. Wide-waked To-day leaves Yesterday behind him
20. like a dream.
21. Still, from the hurrying train of Life, fly backward
22. far and fast
23. The milestones of the fathers, the landmarks of
24. the past.

25. But human hearts remain unchanged: the sorrow
26. and the sin,
27. The loves and hopes and fears of old, are to our
28. own akin;

29. And if, in tales our fathers told, the songs our
30. mothers sung,
31. Tradition wears a snowy beard, Romance is always
32. young.

33. O sharp-lined man of traffic, on Saco's banks today!
34. O mill-girl watching late and long the shuttle's
35. restless play!
36. Let, for the once, a listening ear the working hand
37. beguile,
38. And lend my old Provincial tale, as suits, a tear or
39. smile!

40. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

41. The evening gun had sounded from gray Fort
42. Mary's walls;
43. Through the forest, like a wild beast, roared and
44. plunged the Saco's' falls.

45. And westward on the sea-wind, that damp and
46. gusty grew,
47. Over cedars darkening inland the smokes of Spurwink
48. blew.

49. On the hearth of Farmer Garvin, blazed the crackling
50. walnut log;
51. Right and left sat dame and goodman, and between
52. them lay the dog,

53. Head on paws, and tail slow wagging, and beside
54. him on her mat,
55. Sitting drowsy in the firelight, winked and purred
56. the mottled cat.

57. 'Twenty years!' said Goodman Garvin, speaking
58. sadly, under breath,
59. And his gray head slowly shaking, as one who
60. speaks of death.

61. The goodwife dropped her needles: 'It is twenty
62. years to-day,
63. Since the Indians fell on Saco, and stole our child
64. away.'

65. Then they sank into the silence, for each knew
66. the other's thought,
67. Of a great and common sorrow, and words were,
68. needed not.

69. 'Who knocks?' cried Goodman Garvin. The
70. door was open thrown;
71. On two strangers, man and maiden, cloaked and
72. furred, the fire-light shone.

73. One with courteous gesture lifted the bear-skin
74. from his head;
75. 'Lives here Elkanah Garvin?' 'I am he,' the
76. goodman said.

77. 'Sit ye down, and dry and warm ye, for the night
78. is chill with rain.'
79. And the goodwife drew the settle, and stirred the
80. fire amain.

81. The maid unclasped her cloak-hood, the firelight
82. glistened fair
83. In her large, moist eyes, and over soft folds of
84. dark brown hair.

85. Dame Garvin looked upon her: 'It is Mary's self
86. I see!'
87. 'Dear heart!' she cried, 'now tell me, has my
88. child come back to me?'

89. 'My name indeed is Mary,' said the stranger sobbing
90. wild;
91. 'Will you be to me a mother? I am Mary Garvin's child!'

92. 'She sleeps by wooded Simcoe, but on her dying
93. day
94. She bade my father take me to her kinsfolk far
95. away.

96. 'And when the priest besought her to do me no
97. such wrong,
98. She said, 'May God forgive me! I have closed
99. my heart too long.'

100. ''When I hid me from my father, and shut out
101. my mother's call,
102. I sinned against those dear ones, and the Father
103. of us all.

104. ''Christ's love rebukes no home-love, breaks no
105. tie of kin apart;
106. Better heresy in doctrine, than heresy of heart.

107. ''Tell me not the Church must censure: she who
108. wept the Cross beside
109. Never made her own flesh strangers, nor the claims
110. of blood denied;

111. ''And if she who wronged her parents, with her
112. child atones to them,
113. Earthly daughter, Heavenly Mother! thou at least
114. wilt not condemn!'

115. 'So, upon her death-bed lying, my blessed mother
116. spake;
117. As we come to do her bidding, So receive us for her
118. sake.'

119. 'God be praised!' said Goodwife Garvin, 'He taketh,
120. and He gives;
121. He woundeth, but He healeth; in her child our
122. daughter lives!'

123. 'Amen!' the old man answered, as he brushed a
124. tear away,
125. And, kneeling by his hearthstone, said, with reverence,
126. 'Let us pray.'

127. All its Oriental symbols, and its Hebrew pararphrase,
128. Warm with earnest life and feeling, rose his prayer
129. of love and praise.

130. But he started at beholding, as he rose from off
131. his knee,
132. The stranger cross his forehead with the sign of
133. Papistrie.

134. 'What is this?' cried Farmer Garvin. 'Is an English
135. Christian's home
136. A chapel or a mass-house, that you make the sign
137. of Rome?'

138. Then the young girl knelt beside him, kissed his
139. trembling hand, and cried:
140. Oh, forbear to chide my father; in that faith my
141. mother died!

142. 'On her wooden cross at Simcoe the dews and
143. sunshine fall,
144. As they fall on Spurwink's graveyard; and the
145. dear God watches all!'

146. The old man stroked the fair head that rested on
147. his knee;
148. 'Your words, dear child,' he answered, 'are God's
149. rebuke to me.

150. 'Creed and rite perchance may differ, yet our
151. faith and hope be one.
152. Let me be your father's father, let him be to me
153. a son.'

154. When the horn, on Sabbath morning, through the
155. still and frosty air,
156. From Spurwink, Pool, and Black Point, called to
157. sermon and to prayer,

158. To the goodly house of worship, where, in order
159. due and fit,
160. As by public vote directed, classed and ranked the
161. people sit;

162. Mistress first and goodwife after, clerkly squire
163. before the clown,
164. 'From the brave coat, lace-embroidered, to the gray
165. frock, shading down;'

166. From the pulpit read the preacher, 'Goodman
167. Garvin and his wife
168. Fain would thank the Lord, whose kindness has
169. followed them through life,

170. 'For the great and crowning mercy, that their
171. daughter, from the wild,
172. Where she rests (they hope in God's peace), has
173. sent to them her child;

174. 'And the prayers of all God's people they ask,
175. that they may prove
176. Not unworthy, through their weakness, of such
177. special proof of love.'

178. As the preacher prayed, uprising, the aged couple
179. stood,
180. And the fair Canadian also, in her modest maiden-
181. hood.

182. Thought the elders, grave and doubting, 'She is
183. Papist born and bred;'
184. Thought the young men, ''T is an angel in Mary
185. Garvin's stead!'
