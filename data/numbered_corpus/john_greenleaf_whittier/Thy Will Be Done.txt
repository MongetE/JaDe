1. WE see not, know not; all our way
2. Is night, â€” with Thee alone is day:
3. From out the torrent's troubled drift,
4. Above the storm our prayers we lift,
5. Thy will be done!The flesh may fail, the heart may faint,
6. But who are we to make complaint,
7. Or dare to plead, in times like these,
8. The weakness of our love of ease?
9. Thy will be done!We take with solemn thankfulness
10. Our burden up, nor ask it less,
11. And count it joy that even we
12. May suffer, serve, or wait for Thee,
13. Whose will be done!
14. Though dim as yet in tint and line,
15. We trace Thy picture's wise design,
16. And thank Thee that our age supplies
17. Its dark relief of sacrifice.
18. Thy will be done!And if, in our unworthiness,
19. Thy sacrificial wine we press;
20. If from Thy ordeal's heated bars
21. Our feet are seamed with crimson scars,
22. Thy will be done!If, for the age to come, this hour
23. Of trial hath vicarious power,
24. And, blest by Thee, our present pain,
25. Be Liberty's eternal gain,
26. Thy will be done!Strike, Thou the Master, we Thy keys,
27. The anthem of the destinies!
28. The minor of Thy loftier strain,
29. Our hearts shall breathe the old refrain,
30. Thy will be done!
