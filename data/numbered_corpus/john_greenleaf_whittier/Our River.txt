1. FOR A SUMMER FESTIVAL AT 'THE LAURELS' ON THE MERRIMAC.

2. Once more on yonder laurelled height
3. The summer flowers have budded;
4. Once more with summer's golden light
5. The vales of home are flooded;
6. And once more, by the grace of Him
7. Of every good the Giver,
8. We sing upon its wooded rim
9. The praises of our river,

10. Its pines above, its waves below,
11. The west-wind down it blowing,
12. As fair as when the young Brissot
13. Beheld it seaward flowing,--
14. And bore its memory o'er the deep,
15. To soothe a martyr's sadness,
16. And fresco, hi his troubled sleep,
17. His prison-walls with gladness.

18. We know the world is rich with streams
19. Renowned in song and story,
20. Whose music murmurs through our dreams
21. Of human love and glory
22. We know that Arno's banks are fair,
23. And Rhine has castled shadows,
24. And, poet-tuned, the Doon and Ayr
25. Go singing down their meadows.

26. But while, unpictured and unsung
27. By painter or by poet,
28. Our river waits the tuneful tongue
29. And cunning hand to show it,--
30. We only know the fond skies lean
31. Above it, warm with blessing,
32. And the sweet soul of our Undine
33. Awakes to our caressing.

34. No fickle sun-god holds the flocks
35. That graze its shores in keeping;
36. No icy kiss of Dian mocks
37. The youth beside it sleeping
38. Our Christian river loveth most
39. The beautiful and human;
40. The heathen streams of Naiads boast,
41. But ours of man and woman.

42. The miner in his cabin hears
43. The ripple we are hearing;
44. It whispers soft to homesick ears
45. Around the settler's clearing
46. In Sacramento's vales of corn,
47. Or Santee's bloom of cotton,
48. Our river by its valley-born
49. Was never yet forgotten.

50. The drum rolls loud, the bugle fills
51. The summer air with clangor;
52. The war-storm shakes the solid hills
53. Beneath its tread of anger;
54. Young eyes that last year smiled in ours
55. Now point the rifle's barrel,
56. And hands then stained with fruits and flowers
57. Bear redder stains of quarrel.

58. But blue skies smile, and flowers bloom on,
59. And rivers still keep flowing,
60. The dear God still his rain and sun
61. On good and ill bestowing.
62. His pine-trees whisper, 'Trust and wait!'
63. His flowers are prophesying
64. That all we dread of change or fate
65. His live is underlying.

66. And thou, O Mountain-born!--no more
67. We ask the wise Allotter
68. Than for the firmness of thy shore,
69. The calmness of thy water,
70. The cheerful lights that overlay,
71. Thy rugged slopes with beauty,
72. To match our spirits to our day
73. And make a joy of duty.
