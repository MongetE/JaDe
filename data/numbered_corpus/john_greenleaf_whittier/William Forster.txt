1. The years are many since his hand
2. Was laid upon my head,
3. Too weak and young to understand
4. The serious words he said.

5. Yet often now the good man's look
6. Before me seems to swim,
7. As if some inward feeling took
8. The outward guise of him.

9. As if, in passion's heated war,
10. Or near temptation's charm,
11. Through him the low-voiced monitor
12. Forewarned me of the harm.

13. Stranger and pilgrim! from that day
14. Of meeting, first and last,
15. Wherever Duty's pathway lay,
16. His reverent steps have passed.

17. The poor to feed, the lost to seek,
18. To proffer life to death,
19. Hope to the erring,--to the weak
20. The strength of his own faith.

21. To plead the captive's right; remove
22. The sting of hate from Law;
23. And soften in the fire of love
24. The hardened steel of War.

25. He walked the dark world, in the mild,
26. Still guidance of the Light;
27. In tearful tenderness a child,
28. A strong man in the right.

29. From what great perils, on his way,
30. He found, in prayer, release;
31. Through what abysmal shadows lay
32. His pathway unto peace,

33. God knoweth : we could only see
34. The tranquil strength he gained;
35. The bondage lost in liberty,
36. The fear in love unfeigned.

37. And I,--my youthful fancies grown
38. The habit of the man,
39. Whose field of life by angels sown
40. The wilding vines o'erran,--

41. Low bowed in silent gratitude,
42. My manhood's heart enjoys
43. That reverence for the pure and good
44. Which blessed the dreaming boy's.

45. Still shines the light of holy lives
46. Like star-beams over doubt;
47. Each sainted memory, Christlike, drives
48. Some dark possession out.

49. O friend! O brother I not in vain
50. Thy life so calm and true,
51. The silver dropping of the rain,
52. The fall of summer dew!

53. How many burdened hearts have prayed
54. Their lives like thine might be
55. But more shall pray henceforth for aid
56. To lay them down like thee.

57. With weary hand, yet steadfast will,
58. In old age as in youth,
59. Thy Master found thee sowing still
60. The good seed of His truth.

61. As on thy task-field closed the day
62. In golden-skied decline,
63. His angel met thee on the way,
64. And lent his arm to thine.

65. Thy latest care for man,--thy last
66. Of earthly thought a prayer,--
67. Oh, who thy mantle, backward cast,
68. Is worthy now to wear?

69. Methinks the mound which marks thy bed
70. Might bless our land and save,
71. As rose, of old, to life the dead
72. Who touched the prophet's grave
