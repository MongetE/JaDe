1. 'To the winds give our banner!
2. Bear homeward again!'
3. Cried the Lord of Acadia,
4. Cried Charles of Estienne;
5. From the prow of his shallop
6. He gazed, as the sun,
7. From its bed in the ocean,
8. Streamed up the St. John.

9. O'er the blue western waters
10. That shallop had passed,
11. Where the mists of Penobscot
12. Clung damp on her mast.
13. St. Saviour had looked
14. On the heretic sail,
15. As the songs of the Huguenot
16. Rose on the gale.

17. The pale, ghostly fathers
18. Remembered her well,
19. And had cursed her while passing,
20. With taper and bell;
21. But the men of Monhegan,
22. Of Papists abhorred,
23. Had welcomed and feasted
24. The heretic Lord.

25. They had loaded his shallop
26. With dun-fish and ball,
27. With stores for his larder,
28. And steel for his wall.
29. Pemaquid, from her bastions
30. And turrets of stone,
31. Had welcomed his coming
32. With banner and gun.

33. And the prayers of the elders
34. Had followed his way,
35. As homeward he glided,
36. Down Pentecost Bay.
37. Oh, well sped La Tour
38. For, in peril and pain,
39. His lady kept watch,
40. For his coming again.

41. O'er the Isle of the Pheasant
42. The morning sun shone,
43. On the plane-trees which shaded
44. The shores of St. John.
45. 'Now, why from yon battlements
46. Speaks not my love!
47. Why waves there no banner
48. My fortress above?'

49. Dark and wild, from his deck
50. St. Estienne gazed about,
51. On fire-wasted dwellings,
52. And silent redoubt;
53. From the low, shattered walls
54. Which the flame had o'errun,
55. There floated no banner,
56. There thundered no gun!

57. But beneath the low arch
58. Of its doorway there stood
59. A pale priest of Rome,
60. In his cloak and his hood.
61. With the bound of a lion,
62. La Tour sprang to land,
63. On the throat of the Papist
64. He fastened his hand.

65. 'Speak, son of the Woman
66. Of scarlet and sin!
67. What wolf has been prowling
68. My castle within?'
69. From the grasp of the soldier
70. The Jesuit broke,
71. Half in scorn, half in sorrow,
72. He smiled as he spoke:

73. 'No wolf, Lord of Estienne,
74. Has ravaged thy hall,
75. But thy red-handed rival,
76. With fire, steel, and ball!
77. On an errand of mercy
78. I hitherward came,
79. While the walls of thy castle
80. Yet spouted with flame.

81. 'Pentagoet's dark vessels
82. Were moored in the bay,
83. Grim sea-lions, roaring
84. Aloud for their prey.'
85. 'But what of my lady?'
86. Cried Charles of Estienne.
87. 'On the shot-crumbled turret
88. Thy lady was seen:

89. 'Half-veiled in the smoke-cloud,
90. Her hand grasped thy pennon,
91. While her dark tresses swayed
92. In the hot breath of cannon!
93. But woe to the heretic,
94. Evermore woe!
95. When the son of the church
96. And the cross is his foe!

97. 'In the track of the shell,
98. In the path of the ball,
99. Pentagoet swept over
100. The breach of the wall!
101. Steel to steel, gun to gun,
102. One moment,-and then
103. Alone stood the victor,
104. Alone with his men!

105. 'Of its sturdy defenders,
106. Thy lady alone
107. Saw the cross-blazoned banner
108. Float over St. John.'
109. 'Let the dastard look to it!'
110. Cried fiery Estienne,
111. 'Were D'Aulnay King Louis,
112. I'd free her again!'

113. 'Alas for thy lady!
114. No service from thee
115. Is needed by her
116. Whom the Lord hath set free;
117. Nine days, in stern silence,
118. Her thraldom she bore,
119. But the tenth morning came,
120. And Death opened her door!'

121. As if suddenly smitten
122. La Tour staggered back;
123. His hand grasped his sword-hilt,
124. His forehead grew black.
125. He sprang on the deck
126. Of his shallop again.
127. 'We cruise now for vengeance!
128. Give way!' cried Estienne.

129. 'Massachusetts shall hear
130. Of the Huguenot's wrong,
131. And from island and creekside
132. Her fishers shall throng!
133. Pentagoet shall rue
134. What his Papists have done,
135. When his palisades echo
136. The Puritan's gun!'

137. Oh, the loveliest of heavens
138. Hung tenderly o'er him,
139. There were waves in the sunshine,
140. And green isles before him:
141. But a pale hand was beckoning
142. The Huguenot on;
143. And in blackness and ashes
144. Behind was St. John!
