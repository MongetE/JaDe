1. THE Rabbi Nathan two-score years and ten
2. Walked blameless through the evil world, and then,
3. Just as the almond blossomed in his hair,
4. Met a temptation all too strong to bear,
5. And miserably sinned. So, adding not
6. Falsehood to guilt, he left his seat, and taught
7. No more among the elders, but went out
8. From the great congregation girt about
9. With sackcloth, and with ashes on his head,
10. Making his gray locks grayer. Long he prayed,
11. Smiting his breast; then, as the Book he laid
12. Open before him for the Bath-Col's choice,
13. Pausing to hear that Daughter of a Voice,
14. Behold the royal preacher's words: 'A friend
15. Loveth at all times, yea, unto the end;
16. And for the evil day thy brother lives.'
17. Marvelling, he said: 'It is the Lord who gives
18. Counsel in need. At Ecbatana dwells
19. Rabbi Ben Isaac, who all men excels
20. In righteousness and wisdom, as the trees
21. Of Lebanon the small weeds that the bees
22. Bow with their weight. I will arise, and lay
23. My sins before him.'

24. And he went his way
25. Barefooted, fasting long, with many prayers;
26. But even as one who, followed unawares,
27. Suddenly in the darkness feels a hand
28. Thrill with its touch his own, and his cheek fanned
29. By odors subtly sweet, and whispers near
30. Of words he loathes, yet cannot choose but hear,
31. So, while the Rabbi journeyed, chanting low
32. The wail of David's penitential woe,
33. Before him still the old temptation came,
34. And mocked him with the motion and the shame
35. Of such desires that, shuddering, he abhorred
36. Himself; and, crying mightily to the Lord
37. To free his soul and cast the demon out,
38. Smote with his staff the blankness round about.

39. At length, in the low light of a spent day,
40. The towers of Ecbatana far away
41. Rose on the desert's rim; and Nathan, faint
42. And footsore, pausing where for some dead saint
43. The faith of Islam reared a domed tomb,
44. Saw some one kneeling in the shadow, whom
45. He greeted kindly: 'May the Holy One
46. Answer thy prayers, O stranger!' Whereupon
47. The shape stood up with a loud cry, and then,
48. Clasped in each other's arms, the two gray men
49. Wept, praising Him whose gracious providence
50. Made their paths one. But straightway, as the sense
51. Of his transgression smote him, Nathan tore
52. Himself away: 'O friend beloved, no more
53. Worthy am I to touch thee, for I came,
54. Foul from my sins, to tell thee all my shame.
55. Haply thy prayers, since naught availeth mine,
56. May purge my soul, and make it white like thine.
57. Pity me, O Ben Isaac, I have sinned!'

58. Awestruck Ben Isaac stood. The desert wind
59. Blew his long mantle backward, laying bare
60. The mournful secret of his shirt of hair.
61. 'I too, O friend, if not in act,' he said,
62. 'In thought have verily sinned. Hast thou not read,
63. 'Better the eye should see than that desire
64. Should wander?' Burning with a hidden fire
65. That tears and prayers quench not, I come to thee
66. For pity and for help, as thou to me.
67. Pray for me, O my friend!' But Nathan cried,
68. 'Pray thou for me, Ben Isaac!'

69. Side by side
70. In the low sunshine by the turban stone
71. They knelt; each made his brother's woe his own,
72. Forgetting, in the agony and stress
73. Of pitying love, his claim of selfishness;
74. Peace, for his friend besought, his own became;
75. His prayers were answered in another's name;
76. And, when at last they rose up to embrace,
77. Each saw God's pardon in his brother's face!

78. Long after, when his headstone gathered moss,
79. Traced on the targum-marge of Onkelos
80. In Rabbi Nathan's hand these words were read:
81. '/Hope not the cure of sin till Self is dead;
82. Forget it in love's service, and the debt
83. Thou, canst not pay the angels shall forget;
84. Heaven's gate is shut to him who comes alone;
85. Save thou a soul, and it shall save thy own!/'
