1. LONGFELLOW.

2. WITH a glory of winter sunshine
3. Over his locks of gray,
4. In the old historic mansion
5. He sat on his last birthday;

6. With his books and his pleasant pictures,
7. And his household and his kin,
8. While a sound as of myriads singing
9. From far and near stole in.

10. It came from his own fair city,
11. From the prairie's boundless plain,
12. From the Golden Gate of sunset,
13. And the cedarn woods of Maine.

14. And his heart grew warm within him,
15. And his moistening eyes grew dim,
16. For he knew that his country's children
17. Were singing the songs of him,

18. The lays of his life's glad morning,
19. The psalms of his evening time,
20. Whose echoes shall float forever
21. On the winds of every clime.

22. All their beautiful consolations,
23. Sent forth like birds of cheer,
24. Came flocking back to his windows,
25. And sang in the Poet's ear.

26. Grateful, but solemn and tender,
27. The music rose and fell
28. With a joy akin to sadness
29. And a greeting like farewell.

30. With a sense of awe he listened
31. To the voices sweet and young;
32. The last of earth and the first of heaven
33. Seemed in the songs they sung.

34. And waiting a little longer
35. For the wonderful change to come,
36. He heard the Summoning Angel,
37. Who calls God's children home!

38. And to him in a holier welcome
39. Was the mystical meaning given
40. Of the words of the blessed Master
41. 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven!'
