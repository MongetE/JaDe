1. No aimless wanderers, by the fiend Unrest
2. Goaded from shore to shore;
3. No schoolmen, turning, in their classic quest,
4. The leaves of empire o'er.
5. Simple of faith, and bearing in their hearts
6. The love of man and God,
7. Isles of old song, the Moslem's ancient marts,
8. And Scythia's steppes, they trod.
9. Where the long shadows of the fir and pine
10. In the night sun are cast,
11. And the deep heart of many a Norland mine
12. Quakes at each riving blast;
13. Where, in barbaric grandeur, Moskwa stands,
14. A baptized Scythian queen,
15. With Europe's arts and Asia's jewelled hands,
16. The North and East between!
17. Where still, through vales of Grecian fable, stray
18. The classic forms of yore,
19. And beauty smiles, new risen from the spray,
20. And Dian weeps once more;
21. Where every tongue in Smyrna's mart resounds;
22. And Stamboul from the sea
23. Lifts her tall minarets over burial-grounds
24. Black with the cypress-tree!
25. From Malta's temples to the gates of Rome,
26. Following the track of Paul,
27. And where the Alps gird round the Switzer's home
28. Their vast, eternal wall;
29. They paused not by the ruins of old time,
30. They scanned no pictures rare,
31. Nor lingered where the snow-locked mountains climb
32. The cold abyss of air!
33. But unto prisons, where men lay in chains,
34. To haunts where Hunger pined,
35. To kings and courts forgetful of the pains
36. And wants of human-kind,
37. Scattering sweet words, and quiet deeds of good,
38. Along their way, like flowers,
39. Or pleading, as Christ's freemen only could,
40. With princes and with powers;
41. Their single aim the purpose to fulfil
42. Of Truth, from day to day,
43. Simply obedient to its guiding will,
44. They held their pilgrim way.
45. Yet dream not, hence, the beautiful and old
46. Were wasted on their sight,
47. Who in the school of Christ had learned to hold
48. All outward things aright.
49. Not less to them the breath of vineyards blown
50. From off the Cyprian shore,
51. Not less for them the Alps in sunset shone,
52. That man they valued more.
53. A life of beauty lends to all it sees
54. The beauty of its thought;
55. And fairest forms and sweetest harmonies
56. Make glad its way, unsought.
57. In sweet accordancy of praise and love,
58. The singing waters run;
59. And sunset mountains wear in light above
60. The smile of duty done;
61. Sure stands the promise, â€” ever to the meek
62. A heritage is given;
63. Nor lose they Earth who, single-hearted, seek
64. The righteousness of Heaven!
