1. OLOR ISCANUS queries: 'Why should we
2. Vex at the land's ridiculous miserie?'
3. So on his Usk banks, in the blood-red dawn
4. Of England's civil strife, did careless Vaughan
5. Bemock his times. O friends of many years!
6. Though faith and trust are stronger than our fears,
7. And the signs promise peace with liberty,
8. Not thus we trifle with our country's tears
9. And sweat of agony. The future's gain
10. Is certain as God's truth; but, meanwhile, pain
11. Is bitter and tears are salt: our voices take
12. A sober tone; our very household songs
13. Are heavy with a nation's griefs and wrongs;
14. And innocent mirth is chastened for the sake
15. Of the brave hearts that nevermore shall beat,
16. The eyes that smile no more, the unreturning feet!
