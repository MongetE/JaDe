1. ALL grim and soiled and brown with tan,
2. I saw a Strong One, in his wrath,
3. Smiting the godless shrines of man
4. Along his path.
5. The Church, beneath her trembling dome,
6. Essayed in vain her ghostly charm:
7. Wealth shook within his gilded home
8. With strange alarm.
9. Fraud from his secret chambers fled
10. Before the sunlight bursting in:
11. Sloth drew her pillow o'er her head
12. To drown the din.
13. 'Spare,' Art implored, 'yon holy pile;
14. That grand, old, time-worn turret spare;'
15. Meek Reverence, kneeling in the aisle,
16. Cried out, 'Forbear!'
17. Gray-bearded Use, who, deaf and blind,
18. Groped for his old accustomed stone,
19. Leaned on his staff, and wept to find
20. His seat o'erthrown.
21. Young Romance raised his dreamy eyes,
22. O'erhung with paly locks of gold, —
23. 'Why smite,' he asked in sad surprise,
24. 'The fair, the old?'
25. Yet louder rang the Strong One's stroke,
26. Yet nearer flashed his axe's gleam;
27. Shuddering and sick of heart I woke,
28. As from a dream.
29. I looked: aside the dust-cloud rolled,
30. The Waster seemed the Builder too;
31. Upspringing from the ruined Old
32. I saw the New.
33. 'T was but the ruin of the bad, —
34. The wasting of the wrong and ill;
35. Whate'er of good the old time had
36. Was living still.
37. Calm grew the brows of him I feared;
38. The frown which awed me passed away,
39. And left behind a smile which cheered
40. Like breaking day.
41. The grain grew green on battle-plains,
42. O'er swarded war-mounds grazed the cow;
43. The slave stood forging from his chains
44. The spade and plough.
45. Where frowned the fort, pavilions gay
46. And cottage windows, flower-entwined,
47. Looked out upon the peaceful bay
48. And hills behind.
49. Through vine-wreathed cups with wine once red,
50. The lights on brimming crystal fell,
51. Drawn, sparkling, from the rivulet head
52. And mossy well.
53. Through prison walls, like Heaven-sent hope,
54. Fresh breezes blew, and sunbeams strayed,
55. And with the idle gallows-rope
56. The young child played.
57. Where the doomed victim in his cell
58. Had counted o'er the weary hours,
59. Glad school-girls, answering to the bell,
60. Came crowed with flowers.
61. Grown wiser for the lesson given,
62. I fear no longer, for I know
63. That, where the share is deepest driven,
64. The best fruits grow.
65. The outworn rite, the old abuse,
66. The pious fraud transparent grown,
67. The good held captive in the use
68. Of wrong alone, —
69. These wait their doom, from that great law
70. Which makes the past time serve to-day;
71. And fresher life the world shall draw
72. From their decay.
73. Oh, backward-looking son of time!
74. The new is old, the old is new,
75. The cycle of a change sublime
76. Still sweeping through.
77. So wisely taught the Indian seer;
78. Destroying Seva, forming Brahm,
79. Who wake by turns Earth's love and fear,
80. Are one, the same.
81. Idly as thou, in that old day
82. Thou mournest, did thy sire repine;
83. So, in his time, thy child grown gray
84. Shall sigh for thine.
85. But life shall on and upward go;
86. Th' eternal step of Progress beats
87. To that great anthem, calm and slow,
88. Which God repeats.
89. Take heart! the Waster builds again, —
90. A charmëd life old Goodness hath;
91. The tares may perish, but the grain
92. Is not for death.
93. God works in all things; all obey
94. His first propulsion from the night:
95. Wake thou and watch! the world is gray
96. With morning light!
