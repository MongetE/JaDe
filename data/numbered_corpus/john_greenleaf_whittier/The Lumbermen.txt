1. WILDLY round our woodland quarters
2. Sad-voiced Autumn grieves;
3. Thickly down these swelling waters
4. Float his fallen leaves.
5. Through the tall and naked timber,
6. Column-like and old,
7. Gleam the sunsets of November,
8. From their skies of gold.
9. O'er us, to the southland heading,
10. Screams the gray wild-goose;
11. On the night-frost sounds the treading
12. Of the brindled moose.
13. Noiseless creeping, while we're sleeping,
14. Frost his task-work plies;
15. Soon, his icy bridges heaping,
16. Shall our log-piles rise.
17. When, with sounds of smothered thunder,
18. On some night of rain,
19. Lake and river break asunder
20. Winter's weakened chain,
21. Down the wild March flood shall bear them
22. To the saw-mill's wheel,
23. Or where Steam, the slave, shall tear them
24. With his teeth of steel.
25. Be it starlight, be it moonlight,
26. In these vales below,
27. When the earliest beams of sunlight
28. Streak the mountain's snow,
29. Crisps the hoar-frost, keen and early,
30. To our hurrying feet,
31. And the forest echoes clearly
32. All our blows repeat.
33. Where the crystal Ambijejis
34. Stretches broad and clear,
35. And Millnoket's pine-black ridges
36. Hide the browsing deer:
37. Where, through lakes and wide morasses,
38. Or through rocky walls,
39. Swift and strong, Penobscot passes
40. White with foamy falls;
41. Where, through clouds, are glimpses given
42. Of Katahdin's sides, â€”
43. Rock and forest piled to heaven,
44. Torn and ploughed by slides!
45. Far below, the Indian trapping,
46. In the sunshine warm;
47. Far above, the snow-cloud wrapping
48. Half the peak in storm!
49. Where are mossy carpets better
50. Than the Persian weaves,
51. And than Eastern perfumes sweeter
52. Seem the fading leaves;
53. And a music wild and solemn,
54. From the pine-tree's height,
55. Rolls its vast and sea-like volume
56. On the wind of night;
57. Make we here our camp of winter;
58. And, through sleet and snow,
59. Pitchy knot and beechen splinter
60. On our hearth shall glow.
61. Here, with mirth to lighten duty,
62. We shall lack alone
63. Woman's smile and girlhood's beauty,
64. Childhood's lisping tone.
65. But their hearth is brighter burning
66. For our toil to-day;
67. And the welcome of returning
68. Shall our loss repay,
69. When, like seamen from the waters,
70. From the woods we come,
71. Greeting sisters, wives, and daughters,
72. Angels of our home!
73. Not for us the measured ringing
74. From the village spire,
75. Not for us the Sabbath singing
76. Of the sweet-voiced choir.
77. Ours the old, majestic temple,
78. Where God's brightness shines
79. Down the dome so grand and ample,
80. Propped by lofty pines!
81. Through each branch-enwoven skylight,
82. Speaks He in the breeze,
83. As of old beneath the twilight
84. Of lost Eden's trees!
85. For His ear, the inward feeling
86. Needs no outward tongue;
87. He can see the spirit kneeling
88. While the axe is swung.
89. Heeding truth alone, and turning
90. From the false and dim,
91. Lamp of toil or altar burning
92. Are alike to Him.
93. Strike, then, comrades! Trade is waiting
94. On our rugged toil;
95. Far ships waiting for the freighting
96. Of our woodland spoil!
97. Ships, whose traffic links these highlands,
98. Bleak and cold, of ours,
99. With the citron-planted islands
100. Of a clime of flowers;
101. To our frosts the tribute bringing
102. Of eternal heats;
103. In our lap of winter flinging
104. Tropic fruits and sweets.
105. Cheerly, on the axe of labor,
106. Let the sunbeams dance,
107. Better than the flash of sabre
108. Or the gleam of lance!
109. Strike! With every blow is given
110. Freer sun and sky,
111. And the long-hid earth to heaven
112. Looks, with wondering eye!
113. Loud behind us grow the murmurs
114. Of the age to come;
115. Clang of smiths, and tread of farmers,
116. Bearing harvest home!
117. Here her virgin lap with treasures
118. Shall the green earth fill;
119. Waving wheat and golden maize-ears
120. Crown each beechen hill.
121. Keep who will the city's alleys,
122. Take the smooth-shorn plain;
123. Give to us the cedarn valleys,
124. Rocks and hills of Maine!
125. In our North-land, wild and woody,
126. Let us still have part:
127. Rugged nurse and mother sturdy,
128. Hold us to thy heart!
129. Oh, our free hearts beat the warmer
130. For thy breath of snow;
131. And our tread is all the firmer
132. For thy rocks below.
133. Freedom, hand in hand with labor,
134. Walketh strong and brave;
135. On the forehead of his neighbor
136. No man writeth Slave!
137. Lo, the day breaks! old Katahdin's
138. Pine-trees show its fires,
139. While from these dim forest gardens
140. Rise their blackened spires.
141. Up, my comrades! up and doing!
142. Manhood's rugged play
143. Still renewing, bravely hewing
144. Through the world our way!
