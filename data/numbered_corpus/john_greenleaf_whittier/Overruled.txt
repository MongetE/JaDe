1. The threads our hands in blindness spin
2. No self-determined plan weaves in;
3. The shuttle of the unseen powers
4. Works out a pattern not as ours.

5. Ah! small the choice of him who sings
6. What sound shall leave the smitten strings;
7. Fate holds and guides the hand of art;
8. The singer's is the servant's part.

9. The wind-harp chooses not the tone
10. That through its trembling threads is blown;
11. The patient organ cannot guess
12. What hand its passive keys shall press.

13. Through wish, resolve, and act, our will
14. Is moved by undreamed forces still;
15. And no man measures in advance
16. His strength with untried circumstance.

17. As streams take hue from shade and sun,
18. As runs the life the song must run;
19. But, glad or sad, to His good end
20. God grant the varying notes may tend!
