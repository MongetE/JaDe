1. O storied vale of Merrimac
2. Rejoice through all thy shade and shine,
3. And from his century's sleep call back
4. A brave and honored son of thine.

5. Unveil his effigy between
6. The living and the dead to-day;
7. The fathers of the Old Thirteen
8. Shall witness bear as spirits may.

9. Unseen, unheard, his gray compeers
10. The shades of Lee and Jefferson,
11. Wise Franklin reverend with his years
12. And Carroll, lord of Carrollton!

13. Be thine henceforth a pride of place
14. Beyond thy namesake's over-sea,
15. Where scarce a stone is left to trace
16. The Holy House of Amesbury.

17. A prouder memory lingers round
18. The birthplace of thy true man here
19. Than that which haunts the refuge found
20. By Arthur's mythic Guinevere.

21. The plain deal table where he sat
22. And signed a nation's title-deed
23. Is dearer now to fame than that
24. Which bore the scroll of Runnymede.

25. Long as, on Freedom's natal morn,
26. Shall ring the Independence bells,
27. Give to thy dwellers yet unborn
28. The lesson which his image tells.

29. For in that hour of Destiny,
30. Which tried the men of bravest stock,
31. He knew the end alone must be
32. A free land or a traitor's block.

33. Among those picked and chosen men
34. Than his, who here first drew his breath,
35. No firmer fingers held the pen
36. Which wrote for liberty or death.

37. Not for their hearths and homes alone,
38. But for the world their work was done;
39. On all the winds their thought has flown
40. Through all the circuit of the sun.

41. We trace its flight by broken chains,
42. By songs of grateful Labor still;
43. To-day, in all her holy fanes,
44. It rings the bells of freed Brazil.

45. O hills that watched his boyhood's home,
46. O earth and air that nursed him, give,
47. In this memorial semblance, room
48. To him who shall its bronze outlive!

49. And thou, O Land he loved, rejoice
50. That in the countless years to come,
51. Whenever Freedom needs a voice,
52. These sculptured lips shall not be dumb!
