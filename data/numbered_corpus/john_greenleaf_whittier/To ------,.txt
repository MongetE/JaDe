1. WITH A COPY OF WOOLMAN'S JOURNAL.


2. Maiden! with the fair brown tresses
3. Shading o'er thy dreamy eye,
4. Floating on thy thoughtful forehead
5. Cloud wreaths of its sky.

6. Youthful years and maiden beauty,
7. Joy with them should still abide,--
8. Instinct take the place of Duty,
9. Love, not Reason, guide.

10. Ever in the New rejoicing,
11. Kindly beckoning back the Old,
12. Turning, with the gift of Midas,
13. All things into gold.

14. And the passing shades of sadness
15. Wearing even a welcome guise,
16. As, when some bright lake lies open
17. To the sunny skies,

18. Every wing of bird above it,
19. Every light cloud floating on,
20. Glitters like that flashing mirror
21. In the self-same sun.

22. But upon thy youthful forehead
23. Something like a shadow lies;
24. And a serious soul is looking
25. From thy earnest eyes.

26. With an early introversion,
27. Through the forms of outward things,
28. Seeking for the subtle essence,
29. And the bidden springs.

30. Deeper than the gilded surface
31. Hath thy wakeful vision seen,
32. Farther than the narrow present
33. Have thy journeyings been.

34. Thou hast midst Life's empty noises
35. Heard the solemn steps of Time,
36. And the low mysterious voices
37. Of another clime.

38. All the mystery of Being
39. Hath upon thy spirit pressed,--
40. Thoughts which, like the Deluge wanderer,
41. Find no place of rest:

42. That which mystic Plato pondered,
43. That which Zeno heard with awe,
44. And the star-rapt Zoroaster
45. In his night-watch saw.

46. From the doubt and darkness springing
47. Of the dim, uncertain Past,
48. Moving to the dark still shadows
49. O'er the Future cast,

50. Early hath Life's mighty question
51. Thrilled within thy heart of youth,
52. With a deep and strong beseeching
53. What and where is Truth?

54. Hollow creed and ceremonial,
55. Whence the ancient life hath fled,
56. Idle faith unknown to action,
57. Dull and cold and dead.

58. Oracles, whose wire-worked meanings
59. Only wake a quiet scorn,--
60. Not from these thy seeking spirit
61. Hath its answer drawn.

62. But, like some tired child at even,
63. On thy mother Nature's breast,
64. Thou, methinks, art vainly seeking
65. Truth, and peace, and rest.

66. O'er that mother's rugged features
67. Thou art throwing Fancy's veil,
68. Light and soft as woven moonbeams,
69. Beautiful and frail

70. O'er the rough chart of Existence,
71. Rocks of sin and wastes of woe,
72. Soft airs breathe, and green leaves tremble,
73. And cool fountains flow.

74. And to thee an answer cometh
75. From the earth and from the sky,
76. And to thee the hills and waters
77. And the stars reply.

78. But a soul-sufficing answer
79. Hath no outward origin;
80. More than Nature's many voices
81. May be heard within.

82. Even as the great Augustine
83. Questioned earth and sea and sky,
84. And the dusty tomes of learning
85. And old poesy.

86. But his earnest spirit needed
87. More than outward Nature taught;
88. More than blest the poet's vision
89. Or the sage's thought.

90. Only in the gathered silence
91. Of a calm and waiting frame,
92. Light and wisdom as from Heaven
93. To the seeker came.

94. Not to ease and aimless quiet
95. Doth that inward answer tend,
96. But to works of love and duty
97. As our being's end;

98. Not to idle dreams and trances,
99. Length of face, and solemn tone,
100. But to Faith, in daily striving
101. And performance shown.

102. Earnest toil and strong endeavor
103. Of a spirit which within
104. Wrestles with familiar evil
105. And besetting sin;

106. And without, with tireless vigor,
107. Steady heart, and weapon strong,
108. In the power of truth assailing
109. Every form of wrong.

110. Guided thus, how passing lovely
111. Is the track of Woolman's feet!
112. And his brief and simple record
113. How serenely sweet!

114. O'er life's humblest duties throwing
115. Light the earthling never knew,
116. Freshening all its dark waste places
117. As with Hermon's dew.

118. All which glows in Pascal's pages,
119. All which sainted Guion sought,
120. Or the blue-eyed German Rahel
121. Half-unconscious taught

122. Beauty, such as Goethe pictured,
123. Such as Shelley dreamed of, shed
124. Living warmth and starry brightness
125. Round that poor man's head.

126. Not a vain and cold ideal,
127. Not a poet's dream alone,
128. But a presence warm and real,
129. Seen and felt and known.

130. When the red right-hand of slaughter
131. Moulders with the steel it swung,
132. When the name of seer and poet
133. Dies on Memory's tongue,

134. All bright thoughts and pure shall gather
135. Round that meek and suffering one,--
136. Glorious, like the seer-seen angel
137. Standing in the sun!

138. Take the good man's book and ponder
139. What its pages say to thee;
140. Blessed as the hand of healing
141. May its lesson be.

142. If it only serves to strengthen
143. Yearnings for a higher good,
144. For the fount of living waters
145. And diviner food;

146. If the pride of human reason
147. Feels its meek and still rebuke,
148. Quailing like the eye of Peter
149. From the Just One's look!

150. If with readier ear thou heedest
151. What the Inward Teacher saith,
152. Listening with a willing spirit
153. And a childlike faith,--

154. Thou mayst live to bless the giver,
155. Who, himself but frail and weak,
156. Would at least the highest welfare
157. Of another seek;

158. And his gift, though poor and lowly
159. It may seem to other eyes,
160. Yet may prove an angel holy
161. In a pilgrim's guise.
