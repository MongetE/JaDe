1. Yes, pile the marble o'er him! It is well
2. That ye who mocked him in his long stern strife,
3. And planted in the pathway of his life
4. The ploughshares of your hatred hot from hell,
5. Who clamored down the bold reformer when
6. He pleaded for his captive fellow-men,
7. Who spurned him in the market-place, and sought
8. Within thy walls, St. Tammany, to bind
9. In party chains the free and honest thought,
10. The angel utterance of an upright mind,
11. Well is it now that o'er his grave ye raise
12. The stony tribute of your tardy praise,
13. For not alone that pile shall tell to Fame
14. Of the brave heart beneath, but of the builders' shame!
