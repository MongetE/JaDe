1. Still, as of old, in Beavor's Vale,
2. O man of God! our hope and faith
3. The Elements and Stars assail,
4. And the awed spirit holds its breath,
5. Blown over by a wind of death.

6. Takes Nature thought for such as we,
7. What place her human atom fills,
8. The weed-drift of her careless sea,
9. The mist on her unheeding hills?
10. What reeks she of our helpless wills?

11. Strange god of Force, with fear, not love,
12. Its trembling worshipper! Can prayer
13. Reach the shut ear of Fate, or move
14. Unpitying Energy to spare?
15. What doth the cosmic Vastness care?

16. In vain to this dread Unconcern
17. For the All-Father's love we look;
18. In vain, in quest of it, we turn
19. The storied leaves of Nature's book,
20. The prints her rocky tablets took.

21. I pray for faith, I long to trust;
22. I listen with my heart, and hear
23. A Voice without a sound: 'Be just,
24. Be true, be merciful, revere
25. The Word within thee: God is near!

26. 'A light to sky and earth unknown
27. Pales all their lights: a mightier force
28. Than theirs the powers of Nature own,
29. And, to its goal as at its source,
30. His Spirit moves the Universe.

31. 'Believe and trust. Through stars and suns,
32. Through life and death, through soul and sense,
33. His wise, paternal purpose runs;
34. The darkness of His providence
35. Is star-lit with benign intents.'

36. O joy supreme! I know the Voice,
37. Like none beside on earth or sea;
38. Yea, more, O soul of mine, rejoice,
39. By all that He requires of me,
40. I know what God himself must be.

41. No picture to my aid I call,
42. I shape no image in my prayer;
43. I only know in Him is all
44. Of life, light, beauty, everywhere,
45. Eternal Goodness here and there!

46. I know He is, and what He is,
47. Whose one great purpose is the good
48. Of all. I rest my soul on His
49. Immortal Love and Fatherhood;
50. And trust Him, as His children should.

51. I fear no more. The clouded face
52. Of Nature smiles; through all her things
53. Of time and space and sense I trace
54. The moving of the Spirit's wings,
55. And hear the song of hope she sings.
