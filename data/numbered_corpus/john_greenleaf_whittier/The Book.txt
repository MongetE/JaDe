1. Gallery of sacred pictures manifold,
2. A minster rich in holy effigies,
3. And bearing on entablature and frieze
4. The hieroglyphic oracles of old.
5. Along its transept aureoled martyrs sit;
6. And the low chancel side-lights half acquaint
7. The eye with shrines of prophet, bard, and saint,
8. Their age-dimmed tablets traced in doubtful writ!
9. But only when on form and word obscure
10. Falls from above the white supernal light
11. We read the mystic characters aright,
12. And life informs the silent portraiture,
13. Until we pause at last, awe-held, before
14. The One ineffable Face, love, wonder, and adore.
