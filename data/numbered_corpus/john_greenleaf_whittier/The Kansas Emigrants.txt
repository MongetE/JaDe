1. THE KANSAS EMIGRANTS.
2. WE cross the prairie as of old
3. The pilgrims crossed the sea,
4. To make the West, as they the East,
5. The homestead of the free!We go to rear a wall of men
6. On Freedom's southern line,
7. And plant beside the cotton-tree
8. The rugged Northern pine!
9. We're flowing from our native hills
10. As our free rivers flow;
11. The blessing of our Mother-land
12. Is on us as we go.
13. We go to plant her common schools,
14. On distant prairie swells,
15. And give the Sabbaths of the wild
16. The music of her bells.
17. Upbearing, like the Ark of old,
18. The Bible in our van,
19. We go to test the truth of God
20. Against the fraud of man.
21. No pause, nor rest, save where the streams
22. That feed the Kansas run,
23. Save where our Pilgrim gonfalon
24. Shall flout the setting sun!
25. We'll tread the prairie as of old
26. Our fathers sailed the sea,
27. And make the West, as they the East,
28. The homestead of the free!
