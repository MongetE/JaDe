1. THE day's sharp strife is ended now,
2. Our work is done, God knoweth how!
3. As on the thronged, unrestful town
4. The patience of the moon looks down,
5. I wait to hear, beside the wire,
6. The voices of its tongues of fire.
7. Slow, doubtful, faint,they seem at first:
8. Be strong, my heart, to know the worst!
9. Hark! there the Alleghanies spoke;
10. That sound from lake and prairie broke,
11. That sunset-gun of triumph rent
12. The silence of a continent!
13. That signal from Nebraska sprung,
14. This, from Nevada's mountain tongue!
15. Is that thy answer, strong and free,
16. O loyal heart of Tennessee?
17. What strange, glad voice is that which calls
18. From Wagner's grave and Sumter's walls?
19. From Mississippi's fountain-head
20. A sound as of the hisoh's tread!
21. There rustled freedom's Charter Oak!
22. In that wild burst the Ozarks spoke!
23. Cheer answers cheer from rise to set
24. Of sun. We have a country yet!
25. The praise, O God, be thine alone!
26. Thou givest not for bread a stone;
27. Thou hast not led us through the night
28. To blind us with returning light;
29. Not through the furnace have we passed,
30. To perish at its mouth at last.
31. O night of peace, thy flight restrain!
32. November's moon, be slow to wane!
33. Shine on the freedman's cabin floor,
34. On brows of prayer a blessing pour;
35. And give, with full assurance blest,
36. The weary heart of Freedom rest!
