1. THE moon has set: while yet the dawn
2. Breaks cold and gray,
3. Between the midnight and the morn
4. Bear off your prey!
5. On, swift and still! the conscious street
6. Is panged and stirred;
7. Tread light! that fall of serried feet
8. The dead have heard!
9. The first drawn blood of Freedom's veins
10. Gushed where ye tread;
11. Lo! through the dusk the martyr-stains
12. Blush darkly red!
13. Beneath the slowly waning stars
14. And whitening day,
15. What stern and awful presence bars
16. That sacred way?
17. What faces frown upon ye, dark
18. With shame and pain?
19. Come these from Plymouth's Pilgrim bark?
20. Is that young Vane?
21. Who, dimly beckoning, speed ye on
22. With mocking cheer?
23. Lo! spectral Andros, Hutchinson,
24. And Gage are here!
25. For ready mart or favoring blast
26. Through Moloch's fire,
27. Flesh of his flesh, unsparing, passed
28. The Tyrian sire.
29. Ye make that ancient sacrifice
30. Of Man to Gain,
31. Your traffic thrives, where freedom dies,
32. Beneath the chain.
33. Ye sow to-day; your harvest, scorn
34. And hate, is near;
35. How think ye freemen, mountain-born,
36. The tale will hear?
37. Thank God! our mother State can yet
38. Her fame retrieve;
39. To you and to your children let
40. The scandal cleave.
41. Chain Hall and Pulpit, Court and Press,
42. Make gods of gold;
43. Let honor, truth, and manliness
44. Like wares be sold.
45. Your hoards are great, your walls are strong,
46. But God is just;
47. The gilded chambers built by wrong
48. Invite the rust.
49. What! know ye not the gains of Crime
50. Are dust and dross;
51. Its ventures on the waves of time
52. Foredoomed to loss!
53. And still the Pilgrim State remains
54. What she hath been;
55. Her inland hills, her seaward plains,
56. Still nurture men!
57. Nor wholly lost the fallen mart;
58. Her olden blood
59. Through many a free and generous heart
60. Still pours its flood.
61. That brave old blood, quick-flowing yet,
62. Shall know no check,
63. Till a free people's foot is set
64. On Slavery's neck.
65. Even now, the peal of bell and gun,
66. And hills aflame,
67. Tell of the first great triumph won
68. In Freedom's name.
69. The long night dies: the welcome gray
70. Of dawn we see;
71. Speed up the heavens thy perfect day,
72. God of the free!
