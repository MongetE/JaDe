1. AT THE UNVEILING OF HIS STATUE.

2. Among their graven shapes to whom
3. Thy civic wreaths belong,
4. O city of his love, make room
5. For one whose gift was song.

6. Not his the soldier's sword to wield,
7. Nor his the helm of state,
8. Nor glory of the stricken field,
9. Nor triumph of debate.

10. In common ways, with common men,
11. He served his race and time
12. As well as if his clerkly pen
13. Had never danced to rhyme.

14. If, in the thronged and noisy mart,
15. The Muses found their son,
16. Could any say his tuneful art
17. A duty left undone?

18. He toiled and sang; and year by year
19. Men found their homes more sweet,
20. And through a tenderer atmosphere
21. Looked down the brick-walled street.

22. The Greek's wild onset gall Street knew;
23. The Red King walked Broadway;
24. And Alnwick Castle's roses blew
25. From Palisades to Bay.

26. Fair City by the Sea! upraise
27. His veil with reverent hands;
28. And mingle with thy own the praise
29. And pride of other lands.

30. Let Greece his fiery lyric breathe
31. Above her hero-urns;
32. And Scotland, with her holly, wreathe
33. The flower he culled for Burns.

34. Oh, stately stand thy palace walls,
35. Thy tall ships ride the seas;
36. To-day thy poet's name recalls
37. A prouder thought than these.

38. Not less thy pulse of trade shall beat,
39. Nor less thy tall fleets swim,
40. That shaded square and dusty street
41. Are classic ground through him.

42. Alive, he loved, like all who sing,
43. The echoes of his song;
44. Too late the tardy meed we bring,
45. The praise delayed so long.

46. Too late, alas! Of all who knew
47. The living man, to-day
48. Before his unveiled face, how few
49. Make bare their locks of gray!

50. Our lips of praise must soon be dumb,
51. Our grateful eyes be dim;
52. O brothers of the days to come,
53. Take tender charge of him!

54. New hands the wires of song may sweep,
55. New voices challenge fame;
56. But let no moss of years o'ercreep
57. The lines of Halleck's name.
