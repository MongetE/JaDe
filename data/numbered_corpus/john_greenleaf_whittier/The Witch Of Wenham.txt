1. I.
2. Along Crane River's sunny slopes
3. Blew warm the winds of May,
4. And over Naumkeag's ancient oaks
5. The green outgrew the gray.

6. The grass was green on Rial-side,
7. The early birds at will
8. Waked up the violet in its dell,
9. The wind-flower on its hill.

10. 'Where go you, in your Sunday coat,
11. Son Andrew, tell me, pray.'
12. For striped perch in Wenham Lake
13. I go to fish to-day.'

14. 'Unharmed of thee in Wenham Lake
15. The mottled perch shall be
16. A blue-eyed witch sits on the bank
17. And weaves her net for thee.

18. 'She weaves her golden hair; she sings
19. Her spell-song low and faint;
20. The wickedest witch in Salem jail
21. Is to that girl a saint.'

22. 'Nay, mother, hold thy cruel tongue;
23. God knows,' the young man cried,
24. 'He never made a whiter soul
25. Than hers by Wenham side.

26. 'She tends her mother sick and blind,
27. And every want supplies;
28. To her above the blessed Book
29. She lends her soft blue eyes.

30. 'Her voice is glad with holy songs,
31. Her lips are sweet with prayer;
32. Go where you will, in ten miles round
33. Is none more good and fair.'

34. 'Son Andrew, for the love of God
35. And of thy mother, stay!'
36. She clasped her hands, she wept aloud,
37. But Andrew rode away.

38. 'O reverend sir, my Andrew's soul
39. The Wenham witch has caught;
40. She holds him with the curled gold
41. Whereof her snare is wrought.

42. 'She charms him with her great blue eyes,
43. She binds him with her hair;
44. Oh, break the spell with holy words,
45. Unbind him with a prayer!'

46. 'Take heart,' the painful preacher said,
47. 'This mischief shall not be;
48. The witch shall perish in her sins
49. And Andrew shall go free.

50. 'Our poor Ann Putnam testifies
51. She saw her weave a spell,
52. Bare-armed, loose-haired, at full of moon,
53. Around a dried-up well.

54. ''Spring up, O well!' she softly sang
55. The Hebrew's old refrain
56. (For Satan uses Bible words),
57. Till water flowed a-main.

58. 'And many a goodwife heard her speak
59. By Wenham water words
60. That made the buttercups take wings
61. And turn to yellow birds.

62. 'They say that swarming wild bees seek
63. The hive at her command;
64. And fishes swim to take their food
65. From out her dainty hand.

66. 'Meek as she sits in meeting-time,
67. The godly minister
68. Notes well the spell that doth compel
69. The young men's eyes to her.

70. 'The mole upon her dimpled chin
71. Is Satan's seal and sign;
72. Her lips are red with evil bread
73. And stain of unblest wine.

74. 'For Tituba, my Indian, saith
75. At Quasycung she took
76. The Black Man's godless sacrament
77. And signed his dreadful book.

78. 'Last night my sore-afflicted child
79. Against the young witch cried.
80. To take her Marshal Herrick rides
81. Even now to Wenham side.'

82. The marshal in his saddle sat,
83. His daughter at his knee;
84. 'I go to fetch that arrant witch,
85. Thy fair playmate,' quoth he.

86. 'Her spectre walks the parsonage,
87. And haunts both hall and stair;
88. They know her by the great blue eyes
89. And floating gold of hair.'

90. 'They lie, they lie, my father dear!
91. No foul old witch is she,
92. But sweet and good and crystal-pure
93. As Wenham waters be.'

94. 'I tell thee, child, the Lord hath set
95. Before us good and ill,
96. And woe to all whose carnal loves
97. Oppose His righteous will.

98. 'Between Him and the powers of hell
99. Choose thou, my child, to-day
100. No sparing hand, no pitying eye,
101. When God commands to slay!'

102. He went his way; the old wives shook
103. With fear as he drew nigh;
104. The children in the dooryards held
105. Their breath as he passed by.

106. Too well they knew the gaunt gray horse
107. The grim witch-hunter rode
108. The pale Apocalyptic beast
109. By grisly Death bestrode.

110. II.
111. Oh, fair the face of Wenham Lake
112. Upon the young girl's shone,
113. Her tender mouth, her dreaming eyes,
114. Her yellow hair outblown.

115. By happy youth and love attuned
116. To natural harmonies,
117. The singing birds, the whispering wind,
118. She sat beneath the trees.

119. Sat shaping for her bridal dress
120. Her mother's wedding gown,
121. When lo! the marshal, writ in hand,
122. From Alford hill rode down.

123. His face was hard with cruel fear,
124. He grasped the maiden's hands
125. 'Come with me unto Salem town,
126. For so the law commands!'

127. 'Oh, let me to my mother say
128. Farewell before I go!'
129. He closer tied her little hands
130. Unto his saddle bow.

131. 'Unhand me,' cried she piteously,
132. 'For thy sweet daughter's sake.'
133. 'I'll keep my daughter safe,' he said,
134. 'From the witch of Wenham Lake.'

135. 'Oh, leave me for my mother's sake,
136. She needs my eyes to see.'
137. 'Those eyes, young witch, the crows shall peck
138. From off the gallows-tree.'

139. He bore her to a farm-house old,
140. And up its stairway long,
141. And closed on her the garret-door
142. With iron bolted strong.

143. The day died out, the night came down
144. Her evening prayer she said,
145. While, through the dark, strange faces seemed
146. To mock her as she prayed.

147. The present horror deepened all
148. The fears her childhood knew;
149. The awe wherewith the air was filled
150. With every breath she drew.

151. And could it be, she trembling asked,
152. Some secret thought or sin
153. Had shut good angels from her heart
154. And let the bad ones in?

155. Had she in some forgotten dream
156. Let go her hold on Heaven,
157. And sold herself unwittingly
158. To spirits unforgiven?

159. Oh, weird and still the dark hours passed;
160. No human sound she heard,
161. But up and down the chimney stack
162. The swallows moaned and stirred.

163. And o'er her, with a dread surmise
164. Of evil sight and sound,
165. The blind bats on their leathern wings
166. Went wheeling round and round.

167. Low hanging in the midnight sky
168. Looked in a half-faced moon.
169. Was it a dream, or did she hear
170. Her lover's whistled tune?

171. She forced the oaken scuttle back;
172. A whisper reached her ear
173. 'Slide down the roof to me,' it said,
174. 'So softly none may hear.'

175. She slid along the sloping roof
176. Till from its eaves she hung,
177. And felt the loosened shingles yield
178. To which her fingers clung.

179. Below, her lover stretched his hands
180. And touched her feet so small;
181. 'Drop down to me, dear heart,' he said,
182. 'My arms shall break the fall.'

183. He set her on his pillion soft,
184. Her arms about him twined;
185. And, noiseless as if velvet-shod,
186. They left the house behind.

187. But when they reached the open way,
188. Full free the rein he cast;
189. Oh, never through the mirk midnight
190. Rode man and maid more fast.

191. Along the wild wood-paths they sped,
192. The bridgeless streams they swam;
193. At set of moon they passed the Bass,
194. At sunrise Agawam.

195. At high noon on the Merrimac
196. The ancient ferryman
197. Forgot, at times, his idle oars,
198. So fair a freight to scan.

199. And when from off his grounded boat
200. He saw them mount and ride,
201. 'God keep her from the evil eye,
202. And harm of witch!' he cried.

203. The maiden laughed, as youth will laugh
204. At all its fears gone by;
205. 'He does not know,' she whispered low,
206. 'A little witch am I.'

207. All day he urged his weary horse,
208. And, in the red sundown,
209. Drew rein before a friendly door
210. In distant Berwick town.

211. A fellow-feeling for the wronged
212. The Quaker people felt;
213. And safe beside their kindly hearths
214. The hunted maiden dwelt,

215. Until from off its breast the land
216. The haunting horror threw,
217. And hatred, born of ghastly dreams,
218. To shame and pity grew.

219. Sad were the year's spring morns, and sad
220. Its golden summer day,
221. But blithe and glad its withered fields,
222. And skies of ashen gray;

223. For spell and charm had power no more,
224. The spectres ceased to roam,
225. And scattered households knelt again
226. Around the hearths of home.

227. And when once more by Beaver Dam
228. The meadow-lark outsang,
229. And once again on all the hills
230. The early violets sprang,

231. And all the windy pasture slopes
232. Lay green within the arms
233. Of creeks that bore the salted sea
234. To pleasant inland farms,

235. The smith filed off the chains he forged,
236. The jail-bolts backward fell;
237. And youth and hoary age came forth
238. Like souls escaped from hell.
