1. 'O for a knight like Bayard,
2. Without reproach or fear;
3. My light glove on his casque of steel,
4. My love-knot on his spear!

5. 'O for the white plume floating
6. Sad Zutphen's field above,
7. The lion heart in battle,
8. The woman's heart in love!

9. 'O that man once more were manly,
10. Woman's pride, and not her scorn
11. That once more the pale young mother
12. Dared to boast `a man is born'!

13. 'But, now life's slumberous current
14. No sun-bowed cascade wakes;
15. No tall, heroic manhood
16. The level dulness breaks.

17. 'O for a knight like Bayard,
18. Without reproach or fear!
19. My light glove on his casque of steel
20. My love-knot on his spear!'

21. Then I said, my own heart throbbing
22. To the time her proud pulse beat,
23. 'Life hath its regal natures yet,-
24. True, tender, brave, and sweet!

25. 'Smile not, fair unbeliever!
26. One man, at least, I know,
27. Who might wear the crest of Bayard
28. Or Sydney's plume of snow.

29. 'Once, when over purple mountains
30. Died away the Grecian sun,
31. And the far Cyllenian ranges
32. Paled and darkened, one by one,-

33. 'Fell the Turk, a bolt of thunder,
34. Cleaving all the quiet sky,
35. And against his sharp steel lightnings
36. Stood the Suliote but to die.

37. 'Woe for the weak and halting!
38. The crescent blazed behind
39. A curving line of sabres
40. Like fire before the wind!

41. 'Last to fly, and first to rally,
42. Rode he of whom I speak,
43. When, groaning in his bridle path,
44. Sank down like a wounded Greek.

45. 'With the rich Albanian costume
46. Wet with many a ghastly stain,
47. Gazing on earth and sky as one
48. Who might not gaze again!

49. 'He looked forward to the mountains,
50. Back on foes that never spare,
51. Then flung him from his saddle,
52. And place the stranger there.

53. ''Allah! hu!' Through flashing sabres,
54. Through a stormy hail of lead,
55. The good Thessalian charger
56. Up the slopes of olives sped.

57. 'Hot spurred the turbaned riders;
58. He almost felt their breath,
59. Where a mountain stream rolled darkly down
60. Between the hills and death.

61. 'One brave and manful struggle,-
62. He gained the solid land,
63. And the cover of the mountains,
64. And the carbines of his band!'

65. 'It was very great and noble,'
66. Said the moist-eyed listener then,
67. 'But one brave deed makes no hero;
68. Tell me what he since hath been!'

69. 'Still a brave and generous manhood,
70. Still and honor without stain,
71. In the prison of the Kaiser,
72. By the barricades of Seine.

73. 'But dream not helm and harness
74. The sign of valor true;
75. Peace bath higher tests of manhood
76. Than battle ever knew.

77. 'Wouldst know him now? Behold him,
78. The Cadmus of the blind,
79. Giving the dumb lip language,
80. The idiot clay a mind.

81. 'Walking his round of duty
82. Serenely day by day,
83. With the strong man's hand of labor
84. And childhood's heart of play.

85. 'True as the knights of story,
86. Sir Lancelot and his peers,
87. Brave in his calm endurance
88. As they in tilt of spears.

89. 'As waves in stillest waters,
90. As stars in noonday skies,
91. All that wakes to noble action
92. In his noon of calmness lies.

93. 'Wherever outraged Nature
94. Asks word or action brave,
95. Wherever struggles labor,
96. Wherever groans a slave,-

97. 'Wherever rise the peoples,
98. Wherever sinks a throne,
99. The throbbing heart of Freedom finds
100. An answer in his own.

101. 'Knight of a better era,
102. Without reproach or fear!
103. Said I not well that Bayards
104. And Sidneys still are here?
