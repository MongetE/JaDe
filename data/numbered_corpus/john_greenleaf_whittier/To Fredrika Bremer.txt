1. Seeress of the misty Norland,
2. Daughter of the Vikings bold,
3. Welcome to the sunny Vineland,
4. Which thy fathers sought of old!

5. Soft as flow of Siija's waters,
6. When the moon of summer shines,
7. Strong as Winter from his mountains
8. Roaring through the sleeted pines.

9. Heart and ear, we long have listened
10. To thy saga, rune, and song;
11. As a household joy and presence
12. We have known and loved thee long.

13. By the mansion's marble mantel,
14. Round the log-walled cabin's hearth,
15. Thy sweet thoughts and northern fancies
16. Meet and mingle with our mirth.

17. And o'er weary spirits keeping
18. Sorrow's night-watch, long and chill,
19. Shine they like thy sun of summer
20. Over midnight vale and hill.

21. We alone to thee are strangers,
22. Thou our friend and teacher art;
23. Come, and know us as we know thee;
24. Let us meet thee heart to heart!

25. To our homes and household altars
26. We, in turn, thy steps would lead,
27. As thy loving hand has led us
28. O'er the threshold of the Swede.
