1. A CHRISTIAN! going, gone!
2. Who bids for God's own image? for his grace,
3. Which that poor victim of the market-place
4. Hath in her suffering won?
5. My God! can such things be?
6. Hast Thou not said that whatsoe'er is done
7. Unto Thy weakest and Thy humblest one
8. Is even done to Thee?
9. In that sad victim, then,
10. Child of Thy pitying love, I see Thee stand;
11. Once more the jest-word of a mocking band,
12. Bound, sold, and scourged again!
13. A Christian up for sale!
14. Wet with her blood your whips, o'ertask her frame,
15. Make her life loathsome with your wrong and shame, Her patience shall not fail!
16. A heathen hand might deal
17. Back on your heads the gathered wrong of years:
18. But her low, broken prayer and nightly tears,
19. Ye neither heed nor feel.
20. Con well thy lesson o'er,
21. Thou prudent teacher, tell the toiling slave
22. No dangerous tale of Him who came to save
23. The outcast and the poor.
24. But wisely shut the ray
25. Of God's free Gospel from her simple heart,
26. And to her darkened mind alone impart
27. One stern command, Obey!3
28. So shalt thou deftly raise
29. The market price of human flesh; and while
30. On thee, their pampered guest, the planters smile,
31. Thy church shall praise.
32. Grave, reverend men shall tell
33. From Northern pulpits how thy work was blest,
34. While in that vile South Sodom first and best,
35. Thy poor disciples. sell.
36. Oh, shame! the Moslem thrall,
37. Who, with his master, to the Prophet kneels,
38. While turning to the sacred Kebla feels
39. His fetters break and fall.
40. Cheers for the turbaned Bey
41. Of robber-peopled Tunis! he hath torn
42. The dark slave-dungeons open, and hath borne
43. Their inmates into day:
44. But our poor slave in vain.
45. Turns to the Christian shrine his aching eyes;
46. Its rites will only swell his market price,
47. And rivet on his chain.
48. God of all right! how long
49. Shall priestly robbers at Thine altar stand,
50. Lifting in prayer to Thee, the bloody hand
51. And haughty brow of wrong?
52. Oh, from the fields of cane,
53. From the low rice-swamp, from the trader's cell;
54. From the black slave-ship's foul and loathsome hell,
55. And coffle's weary chain;
56. Hoarse, horrible, and strong,
57. Rises to Heaven that agonizing cry,
58. Filling the arches of the hollow sky,
59. How long, O God, how long?
