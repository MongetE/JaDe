1. If I have seemed more prompt to censure wrong
2. Than praise the right; if seldom to thine ear
3. My voice hath mingled with the exultant cheer
4. Borne upon all our Northern winds along;
5. If I have failed to join the fickle throng
6. In wide-eyed wonder, that thou standest strong
7. In victory, surprised in thee to find
8. Brougham's scathing power with Canning's grace combined;
9. That he, for whom the ninefold Muses sang,
10. From their twined arms a giant athlete sprang,
11. Barbing the arrows of his native tongue
12. With the spent shafts Latona's archer flung,
13. To smite the Python of our land and time,
14. Fell as the monster born of Crissa's slime,
15. Like the blind bard who in Castalian springs
16. Tempered the steel that clove the crest of kings,
17. And on the shrine of England's freedom laid
18. The gifts of Cumve and of Delphi's' shade,--
19. Small need hast thou of words of praise from me.
20. Thou knowest my heart, dear friend, and well canst guess
21. That, even though silent, I have not the less
22. Rejoiced to see thy actual life agree
23. With the large future which I shaped for thee,
24. When, years ago, beside the summer sea,
25. White in the moon, we saw the long waves fall
26. Baffled and broken from the rocky wall,
27. That, to the menace of the brawling flood,
28. Opposed alone its massive quietude,
29. Calm as a fate; with not a leaf nor vine
30. Nor birch-spray trembling in the still moonshine,
31. Crowning it like God's peace. I sometimes think
32. That night-scene by the sea prophetical,
33. (For Nature speaks in symbols and in signs,
34. And through her pictures human fate divines),
35. That rock, wherefrom we saw the billows sink
36. In murmuring rout, uprising clear and tall
37. In the white light of heaven, the type of one
38. Who, momently by Error's host assailed,
39. Stands strong as Truth, in greaves of granite mailed;
40. And, tranquil-fronted, listening over all
41. The tumult, hears the angels say, Well done!
