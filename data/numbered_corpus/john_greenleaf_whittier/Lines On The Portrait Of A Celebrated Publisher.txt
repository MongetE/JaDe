1. A MOONY breadth of virgin face,
2. By thought unviolated;
3. A patient mouth, to take from scorn
4. The hook with bank-notes baited!
5. Its self-complacent sleekness shows
6. How thrift goes with the fawner;
7. An unctuous unconcern of all
8. Which nice folks call dishonor!
9. A pleasant print to peddle out
10. In lands of rice and cotton;
11. The model of that face in dough
12. Would make the artist's fortune.
13. For Fame to thee has come unsought,
14. While others vainly woo her,
15. In proof how mean a thing can make
16. A great man of its doer.
17. To whom shall men thyself compare,
18. Since common models fail 'em,
19. Save classic goose of ancient Rome,
20. Or sacred ass of Balaam?
21. The gabble of that wakeful goose
22. Saved Rome from sack of Brennus;
23. The braying of the prophet's ass
24. Betrayed the angel's menace!
25. So when Guy Fawkes, in petticoats,
26. And azure-tinted hose on,
27. Was twisting from thy love-lorn sheets
28. The slow-match of explosion —
29. An earthquake blast that would have tossed
30. The Union as a feather,
31. Thy instinct saved a perilled land
32. And perilled purse together.
33. Just think of Carolina's sage
34. Sent whirling like a Dervis,
35. Of Quattlebum in middle air
36. Performing strange drill-service!
37. Doomed like Assyria's lord of old,
38. Who fell before the Jewess,
39. Or sad Abimelech, to sigh,
40. 'Alas! a woman slew us!'
41. Thou saw'st beneath a fair disguise
42. The danger darkly lurking,
43. And maiden bodice dreaded more
44. Than warrior's steel-wrought jerkin.
45. How keen to scent the hidden plot!
46. How prompt wert thou to balk it,
47. With patriot zeal and pedler thrift,
48. For country and for pocket!
49. Thy likeness here is doubtless well,
50. But higher honor's due it;
51. On auction-block and negro-jail
52. Admiring eyes should view it.
53. Or, hung aloft, it well might grace
54. The nation's senate-chamber —
55. A greedy Northern bottle-fly
56. Preserved in Slavery's amber!
