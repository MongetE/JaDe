1. The elder folks shook hands at last,
2. Down seat by seat the signal passed.
3. To simple ways like ours unused,
4. Half solemnized and half amused,
5. With long-drawn breath and shrug, my guest
6. His sense of glad relief expressed.
7. Outside, the hills lay warm in sun;
8. The cattle in the meadow-run
9. Stood half-leg deep; a single bird
10. The green repose above us stirred.
11. 'What part or lot have you,' he said,
12. 'In these dull rites of drowsy-head?
13. Is silence worship? Seek it where
14. It soothes with dreams the summer air,
15. Not in this close and rude-benched hall,
16. But where soft lights and shadows fall,
17. And all the slow, sleep-walking hours
18. Glide soundless over grass and flowers!
19. From time and place and form apart,
20. Its holy ground the human heart,
21. Nor ritual-bound nor templeward
22. Walks the free spirit of the Lord!
23. Our common Master did not pen
24. His followers up from other men;
25. His service liberty indeed,
26. He built no church, He framed no creed;
27. But while the saintly Pharisee
28. Made broader his phylactery,
29. As from the synagogue was seen
30. The dusty-sandalled Nazarene
31. Through ripening cornfields lead the way
32. Upon the awful Sabbath day,
33. His sermons were the healthful talk
34. That shorter made the mountain-walk,
35. His wayside texts were flowers and birds,
36. Where mingled with His gracious words
37. The rustle of the tamarisk-tree
38. And ripple-wash of Galilee.'

39. 'Thy words are well, O friend,' I said;
40. 'Unmeasured and unlimited,
41. With noiseless slide of stone to stone,
42. The mystic Church of God has grown.
43. Invisible and silent stands
44. The temple never made with hands,
45. Unheard the voices still and small
46. Of its unseen confessional.
47. He needs no special place of prayer
48. Whose hearing ear is everywhere;
49. He brings not back the childish days
50. That ringed the earth with stones of praise,
51. Roofed Karnak's hall of gods, and laid
52. The plinths of Phil e's colonnade.
53. Still less He owns the selfish good
54. And sickly growth of solitude,--
55. The worthless grace that, out of sight,
56. Flowers in the desert anchorite;
57. Dissevered from the suffering whole,
58. Love hath no power to save a soul.
59. Not out of Self, the origin
60. And native air and soil of sin,
61. The living waters spring and flow,
62. The trees with leaves of healing grow.

63. 'Dream not, O friend, because I seek
64. This quiet shelter twice a week,
65. I better deem its pine-laid floor
66. Than breezy hill or sea-sung shore;
67. But nature is not solitude
68. She crowds us with her thronging wood;
69. Her many hands reach out to us,
70. Her many tongues are garrulous;
71. Perpetual riddles of surprise
72. She offers to our ears and eyes;
73. She will not leave our senses still,
74. But drags them captive at her will
75. And, making earth too great for heaven,
76. She hides the Giver in the given.

77. 'And so, I find it well to come
78. For deeper rest to this still room,
79. For here the habit of the soul
80. Feels less the outer world's control;
81. The strength of mutual purpose pleads
82. More earnestly our common needs;
83. And from the silence multiplied
84. By these still forms on either side,
85. The world that time and sense have known
86. Falls off and leaves us God alone.

87. 'Yet rarely through the charmed repose
88. Unmixed the stream of motive flows,
89. A flavor of its many springs,
90. The tints of earth and sky it brings;
91. In the still waters needs must be
92. Some shade of human sympathy;
93. And here, in its accustomed place,
94. I look on memory's dearest face;
95. The blind by-sitter guesseth not
96. What shadow haunts that vacant spot;
97. No eyes save mine alone can see
98. The love wherewith it welcomes me!
99. And still, with those alone my kin,
100. In doubt and weakness, want and sin,
101. I bow my head, my heart I bare
102. As when that face was living there,
103. And strive (too oft, alas! in vain)
104. The peace of simple trust to gain,
105. Fold fancy's restless wings, and lay
106. The idols of my heart away.

107. 'Welcome the silence all unbroken,
108. Nor less the words of fitness spoken,--
109. Such golden words as hers for whom
110. Our autumn flowers have just made room;
111. Whose hopeful utterance through and through
112. The freshness of the morning blew;
113. Who loved not less the earth that light
114. Fell on it from the heavens in sight,
115. But saw in all fair forms more fair
116. The Eternal beauty mirrored there.
117. Whose eighty years but added grace
118. And saintlier meaning to her face,--
119. The look of one who bore away
120. Glad tidings from the hills of day,
121. While all our hearts went forth to meet
122. The coming of her beautiful feet!
123. Or haply hers, whose pilgrim tread
124. Is in the paths where Jesus led;
125. Who dreams her childhood's Sabbath dream
126. By Jordan's willow-shaded stream,
127. And, of the hymns of hope and faith,
128. Sung by the monks of Nazareth,
129. Hears pious echoes, in the call
130. To prayer, from Moslem minarets fall,
131. Repeating where His works were wrought
132. The lesson that her Master taught,
133. Of whom an elder Sibyl gave,
134. The prophecies of Cuma 's cave.

135. 'I ask no organ's soulless breath
136. To drone the themes of life and death,
137. No altar candle-lit by day,
138. No ornate wordsman's rhetoric-play,
139. No cool philosophy to teach
140. Its bland audacities of speech
141. To double-tasked idolaters
142. Themselves their gods and worshippers,
143. No pulpit hammered by the fist
144. Of loud-asserting dogmatist,
145. Who borrows for the Hand of love
146. The smoking thunderbolts of Jove.
147. I know how well the fathers taught,
148. What work the later schoolmen wrought;
149. I reverence old-time faith and men,
150. But God is near us now as then;
151. His force of love is still unspent,
152. His hate of sin as imminent;
153. And still the measure of our needs
154. Outgrows the cramping bounds of creeds;
155. The manna gathered yesterday
156. Already savors of decay;
157. Doubts to the world's child-heart unknown
158. Question us now from star and stone;
159. Too little or too much we know,
160. And sight is swift and faith is slow;
161. The power is lost to self-deceive
162. With shallow forms of make-believe.
163. W e walk at high noon, and the bells
164. Call to a thousand oracles,
165. But the sound deafens, and the light
166. Is stronger than our dazzled sight;
167. The letters of the sacred Book
168. Glimmer and swim beneath our look;
169. Still struggles in the Age's breast
170. With deepening agony of quest
171. The old entreaty: 'Art thou He,
172. Or look we for the Christ to be?'

173. 'God should be most where man is least
174. So, where is neither church nor priest,
175. And never rag of form or creed
176. To clothe the nakedness of need,--
177. Where farmer-folk in silence meet,--
178. I turn my bell-unsummoned feet;'
179. I lay the critic's glass aside,
180. I tread upon my lettered pride,
181. And, lowest-seated, testify
182. To the oneness of humanity;
183. Confess the universal want,
184. And share whatever Heaven may grant.
185. He findeth not who seeks his own,
186. The soul is lost that's saved alone.
187. Not on one favored forehead fell
188. Of old the fire-tongued miracle,
189. But flamed o'er all the thronging host
190. The baptism of the Holy Ghost;
191. Heart answers heart: in one desire
192. The blending lines of prayer aspire;
193. 'Where, in my name, meet two or three,'
194. Our Lord hath said, 'I there will be!'

195. 'So sometimes comes to soul and sense
196. The feeling which is evidence
197. That very near about us lies
198. The realm of spiritual mysteries.
199. The sphere of the supernal powers
200. Impinges on this world of ours.
201. The low and dark horizon lifts,
202. To light the scenic terror shifts;
203. The breath of a diviner air
204. Blows down the answer of a prayer
205. That all our sorrow, pain, and doubt
206. A great compassion clasps about,
207. And law and goodness, love and force,
208. Are wedded fast beyond divorce.
209. Then duty leaves to love its task,
210. The beggar Self forgets to ask;
211. With smile of trust and folded hands,
212. The passive soul in waiting stands
213. To feel, as flowers the sun and dew,
214. The One true Life its own renew.

215. 'So, to the calmly gathered thought
216. The innermost of truth is taught,
217. The mystery dimly understood,
218. That love of God is love of good,
219. And, chiefly, its divinest trace
220. In Him of Nazareth's holy face;
221. That to be saved is only this,--
222. Salvation from our selfishness,
223. From more than elemental fire,
224. The soul's unsanetified desire,
225. From sin itself, and not the pain
226. That warns us of its chafing chain;
227. That worship's deeper meaning lies
228. In mercy, and not sacrifice,
229. Not proud humilities of sense
230. And posturing of penitence,
231. But love's unforced obedience;
232. That Book and Church and Day are given
233. For man, not God,--for earth, not heaven,--
234. The blessed means to holiest ends,
235. Not masters, but benignant friends;
236. That the dear Christ dwells not afar,
237. The king of some remoter star,
238. Listening, at times, with flattered ear
239. To homage wrung from selfish fear,
240. But here, amidst the poor and blind,
241. The bound and suffering of our kind,
242. In works we do, in prayers we pray,
243. Life of our life, He lives to-day.'
