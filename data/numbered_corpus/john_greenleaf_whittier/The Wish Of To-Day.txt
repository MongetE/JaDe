1. I ask not now for gold to gild
2. With mocking shine a weary frame;
3. The yearning of the mind is stilled,
4. I ask not now for Fame.

5. A rose-cloud, dimly seen above,
6. Melting in heaven's blue depths away;
7. Oh, sweet, fond dream of human Love
8. For thee I may not pray.

9. But, bowed in lowliness of mind,
10. I make my humble wishes known;
11. I only ask a will resigned,
12. O Father, to Thine own!

13. To-day, beneath Thy chastening eye
14. I crave alone for peace and rest,
15. Submissive in Thy hand to lie,
16. And feel that it is best.

17. A marvel seems the Universe,
18. A miracle our Life and Death;
19. A mystery which I cannot pierce,
20. Around, above, beneath.

21. In vain I task my aching brain,
22. In vain the sage's thought I scan,
23. I only feel how weak and vain,
24. How poor and blind, is man.

25. And now my spirit sighs for home,
26. And longs for light whereby to see,
27. And, like a weary child, would come,
28. O Father, unto Thee!

29. Though oft, like letters traced on sand,
30. My weak resolves have passed away,
31. In mercy lend Thy helping hand
32. Unto my prayer to-day!
