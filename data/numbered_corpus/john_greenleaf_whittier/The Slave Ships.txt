1. 'ALL ready?' cried the captain;
2. 'Ay, ay!' the seamen said;
3. 'Heave up the worthless lubbers, —
4. The dying and the dead.'
5. Up from the slave-ship's prison
6. Fierce, bearded heads were thrust
7. 'Now let the sharks look to it,—
8. Toss up the dead ones first!'
9. Corpse after corpse came.up, —
10. Death had been busy there;
11. Where every blow is mercy,
12. Why should the spoiler spare?
13. Corpse after corpse they cast
14. Sullenly from the ship,
15. Yet bloody with the traces
16. Of fetter-link and whip.
17. Gloomily stood the captain,
18. With his arms upon his breast,
19. With his cold brow sternly knotted,
20. And his iron lip compressed.
21. 'Are all the dead dogs over?'
22. Growled through that matted lip;
23. 'The blind ones are no better,
24. Let's lighten the good ship.'
25. Hark! from the ship's dark bosom,
26. The very sounds of hell!
27. The ringing clank of iron,
28. The maniac's short, sharp yell!
29. The hoarse, low curse, throat-stified;
30. The starving infant's moan,
31. The horror of a breaking heart
32. Poured through a mother's groan.
33. Up from that loathsome prison
34. The stricken blind ones came:
35. Below, had all been darkness,
36. Above, was still the same.
37. Yet the holy breath of heaven
38. Was sweetly breathing there,
39. And the heated brow of fever
40. Cooled in the soft sea air.
41. 'Overboard with them, shipmates!'
42. Cutlass and dirk were plied;
43. Fettered and blind, one after one,
44. Plunged down the vessel's side.
45. The sabre smote above,.
46. Beneath, the lean shark lay,
47. Waiting with wide and bloody jaw
48. His quick and human prey.
49. God of the earth! what cries
50. Rang upward unto thee?
51. Voices of agony and blood,
52. From ship-deck and from sea.
53. The last dull plunge was heard,
54. The last wave caught its stain,
55. And the unsated shark looked up
56. For human hearts in vain.
57. . . . . . . . .
58. Red glowed the western waters,
59. The setting sun was there,
60. Scattering alike on wave and cloud
61. His fiery mesh of hair.
62. Amidst a group in blindness,
63. A solitary eye
64. Gazed, from the burdened slaver's deck,
65. Into that burning sky.
66. ' A storm,' spoke out the gazer,
67. 'Is gathering and at hand;
68. Curse on't, I'd give my other eye
69. For one firm rood of land.'
70. And then he laughed, but only
71. His echoed laugh replied,
72. For the blinded and the suffering
73. Alone were at his side.
74. Night settled on the waters,
75. And on a stormy heaven,
76. While fiercely on that lone ship's track
77. The thunder-gust was driven.
78. 'A sail! — thank God, a sail!'
79. And as the helmsman spoke,
80. Up through the stormy murmur
81. A shout of gladness broke.
82. Down came the stranger vessel,
83. Unheeding on her way,
84. So near that on the slaver's deck
85. Fell off her driven spray.
86. ' Ho! for the love of mercy,
87. We're perishing and blind!'
88. A wail of utter agony
89. Came back upon the wind:
90. ' Help us! for we are stricken
91. With blindness every one;
92. Ten days we've floated fearfully,
93. Unnoting star or sun.
94. Our ship's the slaver Leon, —
95. We're but a score on board;
96. Our slaves are all gone over, —
97. Help, for the love of God!'
98. On livid brows of agony
99. The broad red lightning shone;
100. But the roar of wind and thunder
101. Stifled the answering groan;
102. Wailed from the broken waters
103. A last despairing cry,
104. As, kindling in the stormy light,
105. The stranger ship went by.
106. . . . . . . . .
107. In the sunny Guadaloupe
108. A dark-hulled vessel lay,
109. With a crew who noted never
110. The nightfall or the day.
111. The blossom of the orange
112. Was white by every stream,
113. And tropic leaf, and flower, and bird
114. Were in the warm sunbeam.
115. And the sky was bright as ever,
116. And the moonlight slept as well,
117. On the palm-trees by the hillside,
118. And the streamlet of the dell:
119. And the glances of the Creole
120. Were still as archly deep,
121. And her smiles as full as ever
122. Of passion and of sleep.
123. But vain were bird and blossom,
124. The green earth and the sky,
125. And the smile of human faces,
126. To the slaver's darkened eye;
127. At the breaking of the morning,
128. At the star-lit evening time,
129. O'er a world of light and beauty
130. Fell the blackness of his crime.
