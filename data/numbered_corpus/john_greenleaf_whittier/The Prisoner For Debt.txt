1. LOOK on him! through his dungeon grate,
2. Feebly and cold, the morning light
3. Comes stealing round him, dim and late,
4. As if it loathed the sight.
5. Reclining on his strawy bed,
6. His hand upholds his drooping head;
7. His bloodless cheek is seamed and hard,
8. Unshorn his gray, neglected beard;
9. And o'er his bony fingers flow
10. His long, dishevelled locks of snow.
11. No grateful fire before him glows,
12. And yet the winter's breath is chill;
13. And o'er his half-clad person goes
14. The frequent ague thrill!
15. Silent, save ever and anon,
16. A sound, half murmur and half groan,
17. Forces apart the painful grip
18. Of the old sufferer's bearded lip;
19. Oh, sad and crushing is the fate
20. Of old age chained and desolate!
21. Just God! why lies that old man there?
22. A murderer shares his prison bed,
23. Whose eyeballs, through his horrid hair,
24. Gleam on him, fierce and red;
25. And the rude oath and heartless jeer
26. Fall ever on his loathing ear,
27. And, or in wakefulness or sleep,
28. Nerve, flesh, and pulses thrill and creep
29. Whene'er that ruffian's tossing limb,
30. Crimson with murder, touches him!
31. What has the gray-haired prisoner done?
32. Has murder stained his hands with gore?
33. Not so; his crime's a fouler one;
34. God made the old man poor!
35. For this he shares a felon's cell,
36. The fittest earthly type of hell!
37. For this, the boon for which he poured
38. His young blood on the invader's sword,
39. And counted light the fearful cost;
40. His blood-gained liberty is lost!
41. And so, for such a place of rest,
42. Old prisoner, dropped thy blood as rain
43. On Concord's field, and Bunker's crest,
44. And Saratoga's plain?
45. Look forth, thou man of many scars,
46. Through thy dim dungeon's iron bars;
47. It must be joy, in sooth, to see
48. Yon monument upreared to thee;
49. Piled granite and a prison cell, â€”
50. The land repays thy service well!
51. Go, ring the bells and fire the guns,
52. And fling the starry banner out;
53. Shout 'Freedom!' till your lisping ones
54. Give back their cradle-shout;
55. Let boastful eloquence declaim
56. Of honor, liberty, and fame;
57. Still let the poet's strain be heard,
58. With glory for each second word,
59. And everything with breath agree
60. To praise 'our glorious liberty!'
61. But when the patron cannon jars
62. That prison's cold and gloomy wall,
63. And through its grates the stripes and stars
64. Rise on the wind, and fall,
65. Think ye that prisoner's aged ear
66. Rejoices in the general cheer?
67. Think ye his dim and failing eye
68. Is kindled at your pageantry?
69. Sorrowing of soul, and chained of llmb,
70. What is your carnival to him?
71. Down with the law that binds him thus!
72. Unworthy freemen, let it find
73. No refuge from the withering curse
74. Of God and human-kind!
75. Open the prison's living tomb,
76. And usher from its brooding gloom
77. The victims of your savage code
78. To the free sun and air of God;
79. No longer dare as crime to brand
80. The chastening of the Almighty's hand.
