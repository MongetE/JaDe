1. How bland and sweet the greeting of this breeze
2. To him who flies
3. From crowded street and red wall's weary gleam,
4. Till far behind him like a hideous dream
5. The close dark city lies
6. Here, while the market murmurs, while men throng
7. The marble floor
8. Of Mammon's altar, from the crush and din
9. Of the world's madness let me gather in
10. My better thoughts once more.

11. Oh, once again revive, while on my ear
12. The cry of Gain
13. And low hoarse hum of Traffic die away,
14. Ye blessed memories of my early day
15. Like sere grass wet with rain!

16. Once more let God's green earth and sunset air
17. Old feelings waken;
18. Through weary years of toil and strife and ill,
19. Oh, let me feel that my good angel still
20. Hath not his trust forsaken.

21. And well do time and place befit my mood
22. Beneath the arms
23. Of this embracing wood, a good man made
24. His home, like Abraham resting in the shade
25. Of Mamre's lonely palms.

26. Here, rich with autumn gifts of countless years,
27. The virgin soil
28. Turned from the share he guided, and in rain
29. And summer sunshine throve the fruits and grain
30. Which blessed his honest toil.

31. Here, from his voyages on the stormy seas,
32. Weary and worn,
33. He came to meet his children and to bless
34. The Giver of all good in thankfulness
35. And praise for his return.

36. And here his neighbors gathered in to greet
37. Their friend again,
38. Safe from the wave and the destroying gales,
39. Which reap untimely green Bermuda's vales,
40. And vex the Carib main.

41. To hear the good man tell of simple truth,
42. Sown in an hour
43. Of weakness in some far-off Indian isle,
44. From the parched bosom of a barren soil,
45. Raised up in life and power.

46. How at those gatherings in Barbadian vales,
47. A tendering love
48. Came o'er him, like the gentle rain from heaven,
49. And words of fitness to his lips were given,
50. And strength as from above.

51. How the sad captive listened to the Word,
52. Until his chain
53. Grew lighter, and his wounded spirit felt
54. The healing balm of consolation melt
55. Upon its life-long pain

56. How the armed warrior sat him down to hear
57. Of Peace and Truth,
58. And the proud ruler and his Creole dame,
59. Jewelled and gorgeous in her beauty came,
60. And fair and bright-eyed youth.

61. Oh, far away beneath New England's sky,
62. Even when a boy,
63. Following my plough by Merrimac's green shore,
64. His simple record I have pondered o'er
65. With deep and quiet joy.

66. And hence this scene, in sunset glory warm,--
67. Its woods around,
68. Its still stream winding on in light and shade,
69. Its soft, green meadows and its upland glade,--
70. To me is holy ground.

71. And dearer far than haunts where Genius keeps
72. His vigils still;
73. Than that where Avon's son of song is laid,
74. Or Vaucluse hallowed by its Petrarch's shade,
75. Or Virgil's laurelled hill.

76. To the gray walls of fallen Paraclete,
77. To Juliet's urn,
78. Fair Arno and Sorrento's orange-grove,
79. Where Tasso sang, let young Romance and Love
80. Like brother pilgrims turn.

81. But here a deeper and serener charm
82. To all is given;
83. And blessed memories of the faithful dead
84. O'er wood and vale and meadow-stream have shed
85. The holy hues of Heaven!
