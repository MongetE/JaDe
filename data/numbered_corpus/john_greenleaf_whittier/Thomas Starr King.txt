1. The great work laid upon his twoscore years
2. Is done, and well done. If we drop our tears,
3. Who loved him as few men were ever loved,
4. We mourn no blighted hope nor broken plan
5. With him whose life stands rounded and approved
6. In the full growth and stature of a man.
7. Mingle, O bells, along the Western slope,
8. With your deep toll a sound of faith and hope!
9. Wave cheerily still, O banner, half-way down,
10. From thousand-masted bay and steepled town!
11. Let the strong organ with its loftiest swell
12. Lift the proud sorrow of the land, and tell
13. That the brave sower saw his ripened grain.
14. O East and West! O morn and sunset twain
15. No more forever!--has he lived in vain
16. Who, priest of Freedom, made ye one, and told
17. Your bridal service from his lips of gold?
