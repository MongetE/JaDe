1. A DREAR and desolate shore!
2. Where no tree unfolds its leaves,
3. And never the spring wind weaves
4. Green grass for the hunter's tread;
5. A land forsaken and dead,
6. Where the ghostly icebergs go
7. And come with the ebb and flow
8. Of the waters of Bradore!

9. A wanderer, from a land
10. By summer breezes fanned,
11. Looked round him, awed, subdued,
12. By the dreadful solitude,
13. Hearing alone the cry
14. Of sea-birds clanging by,
15. The crash and grind of the floe,
16. Wail of wind and wash of tide.
17. 'O wretched land!' he cried,
18. 'Land of all lands the worst,
19. God forsaken and curst!
20. Thy gates of rock should show
21. The words the Tuscan seer
22. Read in the Realm of Woe
23. Hope entereth not here!'

24. Lo! at his feet there stood
25. A block of smooth larch wood,
26. Waif of some wandering wave,
27. Beside a rock-closed cave
28. By Nature fashioned for a grave;
29. Safe from the ravening bear
30. And fierce fowl of the air,
31. Wherein to rest was laid
32. A twenty summers' maid,
33. Whose blood had equal share
34. Of the lands of vine and snow,
35. Half French, half Eskimo.
36. In letters uneffaced,
37. Upon the block were traced
38. The grief and hope of man,
39. And thus the legend ran
40. 'We loved her!
41. Words cannot tell how well!
42. We loved her!
43. God loved her!
44. And called her home to peace and rest.
45. We love her.'

46. The stranger paused and read.
47. 'O winter land!' he said,
48. 'Thy right to be I own;
49. God leaves thee not alone.
50. And if thy fierce winds blow
51. Over drear wastes of rock and snow,
52. And at thy iron gates
53. The ghostly iceberg waits,
54. Thy homes and hearts are dear.
55. Thy sorrow o'er thy sacred dust
56. Is sanctified by hope and trust;
57. God's love and man's are here.
58. And love where'er it goes
59. Makes its own atmosphere;
60. Its flowers of Paradise
61. Take root in the eternal ice,
62. And bloom through Polar snows!'
