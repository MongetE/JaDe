1. FOR the fairest maid in Hampton
2. They needed not to search,
3. Who saw young Anna favor
4. Come walking into church,--

5. Or bringing from the meadows,
6. At set of harvest-day,
7. The frolic of the blackbirds,
8. The sweetness of the hay.

9. Now the weariest of all mothers,
10. The saddest two years' bride,
11. She scowls in the face of her husband,
12. And spurns her child aside.

13. "Rake out the red coals, goodman,--
14. For there the child shall lie,
15. Till the black witch comes to fetch her
16. And both up chimney fly.

17. "It's never my own little daughter,
18. It's never my own," she said;
19. "The witches have stolen my Anna,
20. And left me an imp instead.

21. "Oh, fair and sweet was my baby,
22. Blue eyes, and hair of gold;
23. But this is ugly and wrinkled,
24. Cross, and cunning, and old.

25. "I hate the touch of her fingers,
26. I hate the feel of her skin;
27. It's not the milk from my bosom,
28. But my blood, that she sucks in.

29. "My face grows sharp with the torment;
30. Look! my arms are skin and bone!
31. Rake open the red coals, goodman,
32. And the witch shall have her own.

33. "She'll come when she hears it crying,
34. In the shape of an owl or bat,
35. And she'll bring us our darling Anna
36. In place of her screeching brat."

37. Then the goodman, Ezra Dalton,
38. Laid his hand upon her head:
39. Thy sorrow is great, O woman!
40. I sorrow with thee," he said.

41. "The paths to trouble are many
42. And never but one sure way
43. Leads out to the light beyond it:
44. My poor wife, let us pray."

45. Then he said to the great All-Father,
46. "Thy daughter is weak and blind;
47. Let her sight come back, and clothe her
48. Once more in her right mind.

49. "Lead her out of this evil shadow,
50. Out of these fancies wild;
51. Let the holy love of the mother
52. Turn again to her child.

53. "Make her lips like the lips of Mary
54. Kissing her blessed Son;
55. Let her hands, like the hands of Jesus,
56. Rest on her little one.

57. "Comfort the soul of thy handmaid,
58. Open her prison-door,
59. And thine shall be all the glory
60. And praise forevermore."

61. Then into the face of its mother
62. The baby looked up and smiled;
63. And the cloud of her soul was lifted,
64. And she knew her little child.

65. A beam of the slant west sunshine
66. Made the wan face almost fair,
67. Lit the blue eyes' patient wonder
68. And the rings of pale gold hair.

69. She kissed it on lip and forehead,
70. She kissed it on cheek and chink
71. And she bared her snow-white bosom
72. To the lips so pale and thin.

73. Oh, fair on her bridal morning
74. Was the maid who blushed and smiled,
75. But fairer to Ezra Dalton
76. Looked the mother of his child.

77. With more than a lover's fondness
78. He stooped to her worn young face,
79. And the nursing child and the mother
80. He folded in one embrace.

81. "Blessed be God!" he murmured.
82. "Blessed be God!" she said;
83. "For I see, who once was blinded,--
84. I live, who once was dead.

85. "Now mount and ride, my goodman,
86. As thou lovest thy own soul!
87. Woe's me, if my wicked fancies
88. Be the death of Goody Cole!"

89. His horse he saddled and bridled,
90. And into the night rode he,
91. Now through the great black woodland,
92. Now by the white-beached sea.

93. He rode through the silent clearings,
94. He came to the ferry wide,
95. And thrice he called to the boatman
96. Asleep on the other side.

97. He set his horse to the river,
98. He swam to Newbury town,
99. And he called up Justice Sewall
100. In his nightcap and his gown.

101. And the grave and worshipful justice
102. (Upon whose soul be peace!)
103. Set his name to the jailer's warrant
104. For Goodwife Cole's release.

105. Then through the night the hoof-beats
106. Went sounding like a flail;
107. And Goody Cole at cockcrow
108. Came forth from Ipswich jail.
