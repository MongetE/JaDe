1. ON RECEIVING A BASKET OF SEA-MOSSES.

2. Thanks for thy gift
3. Of ocean flowers,
4. Born where the golden drift
5. Of the slant sunshine falls
6. Down the green, tremulous walls
7. Of water, to the cool, still coral bowers,
8. Where, under rainbows of perpetual showers,
9. God's gardens of the deep
10. His patient angels keep;
11. Gladdening the dim, strange solitude
12. With fairest forms and hues, and thus
13. Forever teaching us
14. The lesson which the many-colored skies,
15. The flowers, and leaves, and painted butterflies,
16. The deer's branched antlers, the gay bird that flings
17. The tropic sunshine from its golden wings,
18. The brightness of the human countenance,
19. Its play of smiles, the magic of a glance,
20. Forevermore repeat,
21. In varied tones and sweet,
22. That beauty, in and of itself, is good.

23. O kind and generous friend, o'er whom
24. The sunset hues of Time are cast,
25. Painting, upon the overpast
26. And scattered clouds of noonday sorrow
27. The promise of a fairer morrow,
28. An earnest of the better life to come;
29. The binding of the spirit broken,
30. The warning to the erring spoken,
31. The comfort of the sad,
32. The eye to see, the hand to cull
33. Of common things the beautiful,
34. The absent heart made glad
35. By simple gift or graceful token
36. Of love it needs as daily food,
37. All own one Source, and all are good
38. Hence, tracking sunny cove and reach,
39. Where spent waves glimmer up the beach,
40. And toss their gifts of weed and shell
41. From foamy curve and combing swell,
42. No unbefitting task was thine
43. To weave these flowers so soft and fair
44. In unison with His design
45. Who loveth beauty everywhere;
46. And makes in every zone and clime,
47. In ocean and in upper air,
48. All things beautiful in their time.

49. For not alone in tones of awe and power
50. He speaks to Inan;
51. The cloudy horror of the thunder-shower
52. His rainbows span;
53. And where the caravan
54. Winds o'er the desert, leaving, as in air
55. The crane-flock leaves, no trace of passage there,
56. He gives the weary eye
57. The palm-leaf shadow for the hot noon hours,
58. And on its branches dry
59. Calls out the acacia's flowers;
60. And where the dark shaft pierces down
61. Beneath the mountain roots,
62. Seen by the miner's lamp alone,
63. The star-like crystal shoots;
64. So, where, the winds and waves below,
65. The coral-branched gardens grow,
66. His climbing weeds and mosses show,
67. Like foliage, on each stony bough,
68. Of varied hues more strangely gay
69. Than forest leaves in autumn's day;--
70. Thus evermore,
71. On sky, and wave, and shore,
72. An all-pervading beauty seems to say
73. God's love and power are one; and they,
74. Who, like the thunder of a sultry day,
75. Smite to restore,
76. And they, who, like the gentle wind, uplift
77. The petals of the dew-wet flowers, and drift
78. Their perfume on the air,
79. Alike may serve Him, each, with their own gift,
80. Making their lives a prayer!
