2. Dear Sister! while the wise and sage
3. Turn coldly from my playful page,
4. And count it strange that ripened age
5. Should stoop to boyhood's folly;
6. I know that thou wilt judge aright
7. Of all which makes the heart more light,
8. Or lends one star-gleam to the night
9. Of clouded Melancholy.

10. Away with weary cares and themes!
11. Swing wide the moonlit gate of dreams!
12. Leave free once more the land which teems
13. With wonders and romances
14. Where thou, with clear discerning eyes,
15. Shalt rightly read the truth which lies
16. Beneath the quaintly masking guise
17. Of wild and wizard fancies.

18. Lo! once again our feet we set
19. On still green wood-paths, twilight wet,
20. By lonely brooks, whose waters fret
21. The roots of spectral beeches;
22. Again the hearth-fire glimmers o'er
23. Home's whitewashed wall and painted floor,
24. And young eyes widening to the lore
25. Of faery-folks and witches.

26. Dear heart! the legend is not vain
27. Which lights that holy hearth again,
28. And calling back from care and pain,
29. And death's funereal sadness,
30. Draws round its old familiar blaze
31. The clustering groups of happier days,
32. And lends to sober manhood's gaze
33. A glimpse of childish gladness.

34. And, knowing how my life hath been
35. A weary work of tongue and pen,
36. A long, harsh strife with strong-willed men,
37. Thou wilt not chide my turning
38. To con, at times, an idle rhyme,
39. To pluck a flower from childhood's clime,
40. Or listen, at Life's noonday chime,
41. For the sweet bells of Morning!
