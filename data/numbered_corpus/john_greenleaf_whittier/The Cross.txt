1. 'The cross, if rightly borne, shall be
2. No burden, but support to thee;'
3. So, moved of old time for our sake,
4. The holy monk of Kempen spake.

5. Thou brave and true one! upon whom
6. Was laid the cross of martyrdom,
7. How didst thou, in thy generous youth,
8. Bear witness to this blessed truth!

9. Thy cross of suffering and of shame
10. A staff within thy hands became,
11. In paths where faith alone could see
12. The Master's steps supporting thee.

13. Thine was the seed-time; God alone
14. Beholds the end of what is sown;
15. Beyond our vision, weak and dim,
16. The harvest-time is hid with Him.

17. Yet, unforgotten where it lies,
18. That seed of generous sacrifice,
19. Though seeming on the desert cast,
20. Shall rise with bloom and fruit at last.
