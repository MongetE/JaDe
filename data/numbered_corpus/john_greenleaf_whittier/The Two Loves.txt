1. Smoothing soft the nestling head
2. Of a maiden fancy-led,
3. Thus a grave-eyed woman said:

4. 'Richest gifts are those we make,
5. Dearer than the love we take
6. That we give for love's own sake.

7. 'Well I know the heart's unrest;
8. Mine has been the common quest,
9. To be loved and therefore blest.

10. 'Favors undeserved were mine;
11. At my feet as on a shrine
12. Love has laid its gifts divine.

13. 'Sweet the offerings seemed, and yet
14. With their sweetness came regret,
15. And a sense of unpaid debt.

16. 'Heart of mine unsatisfied,
17. Was it vanity or pride
18. That a deeper joy denied?

19. 'Hands that ope but to receive
20. Empty close; they only live
21. Richly who can richly give.

22. 'Still,' she sighed, with moistening eyes,
23. 'Love is sweet in any guise;
24. But its best is sacrifice!

25. 'He who, giving, does not crave
26. Likest is to Him who gave
27. Life itself the loved to save.

28. 'Love, that self-forgetful gives,
29. Sows surprise of ripened sheaves,
30. Late or soon its own receives.'
