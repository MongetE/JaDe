1. THE storm and peril overpast,
2. The hounding hatred shamed and still,
3. Go, soul of freedom! take at last
4. The place which thou alone canst fill.
5. Confirm the lesson taught of old â€”
6. Life saved for self is lost, while they
7. Who lose it in His service hold
8. The lease of God's eternal day.
9. Not for thyself, but for the slave
10. Thy words of thunder shook the world;
11. No selfish griefs or hatred gave
12. The strength wherewith thy bolts were hurled.
13. From lips that Sinai's trumpet blew
14. We heard a tender under song;
15. Thy very wrath from pity grew,
16. From love of man thy hate of wrong.
17. Now past and present are as one;
18. The life below is life above;
19. Thy mortal years have but begun
20. Thy immortality of love.
21. With somewhat of thy lofty faith
22. We lay thy outworn garment by,
23. Give death but what belongs to death,
24. And life the life that cannot die!
25. Not for a soul like thine the calm
26. Of selfish ease and joys of sense;
27. But duty, more than crown or palm,
28. Its own exceeding recompense.
29. Go up and on! thy day well done,
30. Its morning promise well fulfilled,
31. Arise to triumphs yet unwon,
32. To holier tasks that God has willed.
33. Go, leave behind thee all that mars
34. The work below of man for man;
35. With the white legions of the stars
36. Do service such as angels can.
37. Wherever wrong shall right deny
38. Or suffering spirits urge their plea,
39. Be thine a voice to smite the lie,
40. A hand to set the captive free!
