1. THROUGH heat and cold, and shower and sun,
2. Still onward cheerly driving!
3. There's life alone in duty done,
4. And rest alone in striving.But see! the day is closing cool,
5. The woods are dim before us;
6. The white fog of the wayside pool
7. Is creeping slowly o'er us.
8. The night is falling, comrades mine,
9. Our footsore beasts are weary,
10. And through yon elms the tavern sign
11. Looks out upon us cheery.
12. The landlord beckons from his door,
13. His beechen fire is glowing;
14. These ample barns, with feed in store,
15. Are filled to overflowing.
16. From many a valley frowned across
17. By brows of rugged mountains;
18. From hillsides where, through spongy moss,
19. Gush out the river fountains;
20. From quiet farm-fields, green and low,
21. And bright with blooming clover;
22. From vales of corn the wandering crow
23. No richer hovers over;
24. Day after day our way has been
25. O'er many a hill and hollow;
26. By lake and stream, by wood and glen,
27. Our stately drove we follow.
28. Through dust-clouds rising thick and dun,
29. As smoke of battle o'er us,
30. Their white horns glisten in the sun,
31. Like plumes and crests before us.
32. We see them slowly climb the hill,
33. As slow behind it sinking;
34. Or, thronging close, from roadside rill,
35. Or sunny lakelet, drinking.
36. Now crowding in the narrow road,
37. In thick and struggling masses,
38. They glare upon the teamster's load,
39. Or rattling coach that passes.
40. Anon, with toss of horn and tail,
41. And paw of hoof, and bellow,
42. They leap some farmer's broken pale,
43. O'er meadow-close or fallow.
44. Forth comes the startled goodman; forth
45. Wife, children, house-dog, sally,
46. Till once more on their dusty path
47. The baffled truants rally.
48. We drive no starvelings, scraggy grown,
49. Loose-legged, and ribbed and bony,
50. Like those who grind their noses down
51. On pastures bare and stony, â€”
52. Lank oxen, rough as Indian dogs,
53. And cows too lean for shadows,
54. Disputing feebly with the frogs
55. The crop of saw-grass meadows!
56. In our good drove, so sleek and fair,
57. No bones of leanness rattle;
58. No tottering hide-bound ghosts are there,
59. Or Pharaoh's evil cattle.
60. Each stately beeve bespeaks the hand
61. That fed him unrepining;
62. The fatness of a goodly land
63. In each dun hide is shining.
64. We've sought them where, in warmest nooks,
65. The freshest feed is growing,
66. By sweetest springs and clearest brooks
67. Through honeysuckle flowing;
68. Wherever hillsides, sloping south,
69. Are bright with early grasses,
70. Or, tracking green the lowland's drouth,
71. The mountain streamlet passes.
72. But now the day is closing cool,
73. The woods are dim before us,
74. The white fog of the wayside pool
75. Is creeping slowly o'er us.
76. The cricket to the frog's bassoon
77. His shrillest time is keeping;
78. The sickle of yon setting moon
79. The meadow-mist is reaping.
80. The night is falling, comrades mine,
81. Our footsore beasts are weary,
82. And through yon elms the tavern sign
83. Looks out upon us cheery.
84. To-morrow, eastward with our charge
85. We'll go to meet the dawning,
86. Ere yet the pines of Kearsarge
87. Have seen the sun of morning.
88. When snow-flakes o'er the frozen earth,
89. Instead of birds, are flitting;
90. When children throng the glowing hearth,
91. And quiet wives are knitting;
92. While in the fire-light strong and clear
93. Young eyes of pleasure glisten,
94. To tales of all we see and hear
95. The ears of home shall listen.
96. By many a Northern lake and hill,
97. From many a mountain pasture,
98. Shall Fancy play the Drover still,
99. And speed the long night faster.
100. Then let us on, through shower and sun,
101. And heat and cold, be driving;
102. There's life alone in duty done,
103. And rest alone in striving.
