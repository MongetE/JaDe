1. I.
2. NOT without envy Wealth at times must look
3. On their brown strength who wield the reaping-hook.'
4. And scythe, or at the forge-fire shape the plough
5. Or the steel harness of the steeds of steam;
6. All who, by skill and patience, anyhow
7. Make service noble, and the earth redeem
8. From savageness. By kingly accolade
9. Than theirs was never worthier knighthood made.
10. Well for them, if, while demagogues their vain
11. And evil counsels proffer, they maintain
12. Their honest manhood unseduced, and wage
13. No war with Labor's right to Labor's gain
14. Of sweet home-comfort, rest of hand and brain,
15. And softer pillow for the head of Age.
16. II.
17. And well for Gain if it ungrudging yields
18. Labor its just demand; and well for Ease
19. If in the uses of its own, it sees
20. No wrong to him who tills its pleasant fields
21. And spreads the table of its luxuries.
22. The interests of the rich man and the poor
23. Are one and same, inseparable evermore;
24. And, when scant wage or labor fail to give
25. Food, shelter, raiment, wherewithal to live,
26. Need has its rights, necessity its claim.
27. Yea, even self-wrought misery and shame
28. Test well the charity suffering long and kind.
29. The home-pressed question of the age can find
30. No answer in the catch-words of the blind
31. Leaders of blind. Solution there is none
32. Save in the Golden Rule of Christ alone.
