1. In trance and dream of old, God's prophet saw
2. The casting down of thrones. Thou, watching lone
3. The hot Sardinian coast-line, hazy-hilled,
4. Where, fringing round Caprera's rocky zone
5. With foam, the slow waves gather and withdraw,
6. Behold'st the vision of the seer fulfilled,
7. And hear'st the sea-winds burdened with a sound
8. Of falling chains, as, one by one, unbound,
9. The nations lift their right hands up and swear
10. Their oath of freedom. From the chalk-white wall
11. Of England, from the black Carpathian range,
12. Along the Danube and the Theiss, through all
13. The passes of the Spanish Pyrenees,
14. And from the Seine's thronged banks, a murmur strange
15. And glad floats to thee o'er thy summer seas
16. On the salt wind that stirs thy whitening hair,--
17. The song of freedom's bloodless victories!
18. Rejoice, O Garibaldi! Though thy sword
19. Failed at Rome's gates, and blood seemed vainly poured
20. Where, in Christ's name, the crowned infidel
21. Of France wrought murder with the arms of hell
22. On that sad mountain slope whose ghostly dead,
23. Unmindful of the gray exorcist's ban,
24. Walk, unappeased, the chambered Vatican,
25. And draw the curtains of Napoleon's bed!
26. God's providence is not blind, but, full of eyes,
27. It searches all the refuges of lies;
28. And in His time and way, the accursed things
29. Before whose evil feet thy battle-gage
30. Has clashed defiance from hot youth to age
31. Shall perish. All men shall be priests and kings,
32. One royal brotherhood, one church made free
33. By love, which is the law of liberty
