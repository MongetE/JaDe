1. 'Jove means to settle
2. Astraea in her seat again,
3. And let down his golden chain
4. An age of better metal.'

5. Ben Johnson 1

6. O POET rare and old!
7. Thy words are prophecies;
8. Forward the age of gold,
9. The new Saturnian lies.

10. The universal prayer
11. And hope are not in vain;
12. Rise, brothers! and prepare
13. The way for Saturn's reign.

14. Perish shall all which takes
15. From labor's board and can;
16. Perish shall all which makes
17. A spaniel of the man!

18. Free from its bonds the mind,
19. The body from the rod;
20. Broken all chains that bind
21. The image of our God.

22. Just men no longer pine
23. Behind their prison-bars;
24. Through the rent dungeon shine
25. The free sun and the stars.

26. Earth own, at last, untrod
27. By sect, or caste, or clan,
28. The fatherhood of God,
29. The brotherhood of man!

30. Fraud fail, craft perish, forth
31. The money-changers driven,
32. And God's will done on earth,
33. As now in heaven;
