1. All things are Thine: no gift have we,
2. Lord of all gifts, to offer Thee;
3. And hence with grateful hearts to-day,
4. Thy own before Thy feet we lay.

5. Thy will was in the builders' thought;
6. Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought;
7. Through mortal motive, scheme and plan,
8. Thy wise eternal purpose ran.

9. No lack Thy perfect fulness knew;
10. For human needs and longings grew
11. This house of prayer, this home of rest,
12. In the fair garden of the West.

13. In weakness and in want we call
14. On Thee for whom the heavens are small;
15. Thy glory is Thy children's good,
16. Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood.

17. O Father! deign these walls to bless,
18. Fill with Thy love their emptiness,
19. And let their door a gateway be
20. To lead us from ourselves to Thee!
