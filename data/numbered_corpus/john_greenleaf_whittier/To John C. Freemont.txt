1. THY error, Fr√©mont, simply was to act
2. A brave man's part, without the statesman's tact,
3. And, taking counsel but of common sense,
4. To strike at cause as well as consequence.
5. Oh, never yet since Roland wound his horn
6. At Roncesvalles, has a blast been blown
7. Far-heard, wide-echoed, startling as thine own,
8. Heard from the van of freedom's hope forlorn!
9. It had been safer, doubtless, for the time,
10. To flatter treason, and avoid offence
11. To that Dark Power whose underlying crime
12. Heaves upward its perpetual turbulence.
13. But if thine be the fate of all who break
14. The ground for truth's seed, or forerun their years
15. Till lost in distance, or with stout hearts make
16. A lane for freedom through the level spears,
17. Still take thou courage! God has spoken through thee,
18. Irrevocable, the mighty words, Be free!
19. The land shakes with them, and the slave's dull ear
20. Turns from the rice-swamp stealthily to hear.
21. Who would recall them now must first arrest
22. The winds that blow down from the free Northwest,
23. Ruffling the Gulf; or like a scroll roll back
24. The Mississippi to its upper springs.
25. Such words fulfil their prophecy, and lack
26. But the full time to harden into things.
