1. A BLUSH as of roses
2. Where rose never grew!
3. Great drops on the bunch-grass,
4. But not of the dew!
5. A taint in the sweet air
6. For wild bees to shun!
7. A stain that shall never
8. Bleach out in the sun!
9. Back, steed of the prairies!
10. Sweet song-bird, fly back!
11. Wheel hither, bald vulture!
12. Gray wolf, call thy pack!
13. The foul human vultures
14. Have feasted and fled;
15. The wolves of the Border
16. Have crept from the dead.
17. From the hearths of their cabins,
18. The fields of their corn,
19. Unwarned and unweaponed,
20. The victims were torn, —
21. By the whirlwind of murder
22. Swooped up and swept on
23. To the low, reedy fen-lands,
24. The Marsh of the Swan.
25. With a vain plea for mercy
26. No stout knee was crooked;
27. In the mouths of the rifles
28. Right manly they looked.
29. How paled the May sunshine,
30. O Marais du Cygne!
31. On death for the strong life,
32. On red grass for green!
33. In the homes of their rearing,
34. Yet warm with their lives,
35. Ye wait the dead only,
36. Poor children and wives!
37. Put out the red forge-fire,
38. The smith shall not come;
39. Unyoke the brown oxen,
40. The ploughman lies dumb.
41. Wind slow from the Swan's Marsh,
42. O dreary death-train,
43. With pressed lips as bloodless
44. As lips of the slain!
45. Kiss down the young eyelids,
46. Smooth down the gray hairs;
47. Let tears quench the curses
48. That burn through your prayers.
49. Strong man of the prairies,
50. Mourn bitter and wild!
51. Wail, desolate woman!
52. Weep, fatherless child!
53. But the grain of God springs up
54. From ashes beneath,
55. And the crown of his harvest
56. Is life out of death.
57. Not in vain on the dial
58. The shade moves along,
59. To point the great contrasts
60. Of right and of wrong:
61. Free homes and free altars,
62. Free prairie and flood, —
63. The reeds of the Swan's Marsh,
64. Whose bloom is of blood!
65. On the lintels of Kansas
66. That blood shall not dry;
67. Henceforth the Bad Angel
68. Shall harmless go by;
69. Henceforth to the sunset,
70. Unchecked on her way,
71. Shall Liberty follow
72. The march of the day.
