1. On the wide lawn the snow lay deep,
2. Ridged o’er with many a drifted heap;
3. The wind that through the pine-trees sung
4. The naked elm-boughs tossed and swung;
5. While, through the window, frosty-starred,
6. Against the sunset purple barred,
7. We saw the sombre crow flap by,
8. The hawk’s gray fleck along the sky,

9. The crested blue-jay flitting swift,
10. The squirrel poising on the drift,
11. Erect, alert, his broad gray tail
12. Set to the north wind like a sail.
13. It came to pass, our little lass,
14. With flattened face against the glass,
15. And eyes in which the tender dew
16. Of pity shone, stood gazing through
17. The narrow space her rosy lips
18. Had melted from the frost’s eclipse:
19. “Oh, see,” she cried, “the poor blue-jays!
20. What is it that the black crow says?
21. The squirrel lifts his little legs
22. Because he has no hands, and begs;
23. He’s asking for my nuts, I know;
24. May I not feed them on the snow?”

25. Half lost within her boots, her head
26. Warm-sheltered in her hood of red,
27. Her plaid skirt close about her drawn,
28. She floundered down the wintry lawn;
29. Now struggling through the misty veil
30. Blown round her by the shrieking gale;
31. Now sinking in a drift so low
32. Her scarlet hood could scarcely show
33. Its dash of color on the snow.

34. She dropped for bird and beast forlorn
35. Her little store of nuts and corn,
36. And thus her timid guests bespoke:
37. “Come, squirrel, from your hollow oak,—
38. Come, black old crow,—come, poor blue-jay,
39. Before your supper’s blown away!
40. Don’t be afraid, we all are good;
41. And I’m mamma’s Red Riding-Hood!”

42. O Thou whose care is over all,
43. Who heedest even the sparrow’s fall,
44. Keep in the little maiden’s breast
45. The pity which is now its guest!
46. Let not her cultured years make less
47. The childhood charm of tenderness,
48. But let her feel as well as know,
49. Nor harder with her polish grow!
50. Unmoved by sentimental grief
51. That wails along some printed leaf,
52. But prompt with kindly word and deed
53. To own the claims of all who need,
54. Let the grown woman’s self make good
55. The promise of Red Riding-Hood!
