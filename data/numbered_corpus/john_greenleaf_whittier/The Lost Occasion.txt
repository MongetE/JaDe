1. Some die too late and some too soon,
2. At early morning, heat of noon,
3. Or the chill evening twilight. Thou,
4. Whom the rich heavens did so endow
5. With eyes of power and Jove's own brow,
6. With all the massive strength that fills
7. Thy home-horizon's granite hills,
8. With rarest gifts of heart and head
9. From manliest stock inherited,
10. New England's stateliest type of man,
11. In port and speech Olympian;

12. Whom no one met, at first, but took
13. A second awed and wondering look
14. (As turned, perchance, the eyes of Greece
15. On Phidias' unveiled masterpiece);
16. Whose words in simplest homespun clad,
17. The Saxon strength of Caedmon's had,
18. With power reserved at need to reach
19. The Roman forum's loftiest speech,
20. Sweet with persuasion, eloquent
21. In passion, cool in argument,
22. Or, ponderous, falling on thy foes
23. As fell the Norse god's hammer blows,
24. Crushing as if with Talus' flail
25. Through Error's logic-woven mail,
26. And failing only when they tried
27. The adamant of the righteous side,--
28. Thou, foiled in aim and hope, bereaved
29. Of old friends, by the new deceived,
30. Too soon for us, too soon for thee,
31. Beside thy lonely Northern sea,
32. Where long and low the marsh-lands spread,
33. Laid wearily down thy August head.

34. Thou shouldst have lived to feel below
35. Thy feet Disunion's fierce upthrow;
36. The late-sprung mine that underlaid
37. Thy sad concessions vainly made.
38. Thou shouldst have seen from Sumter's wall
39. The star-flag of the Union fall,
40. And armed rebellion pressing on
41. The broken lines of Washington!
42. No stronger voice than thine had then
43. Called out the utmost might of men,
44. To make the Union's charter free
45. And strengthen law by liberty.
46. How had that stern arbitrament
47. To thy gray age youth's vigor lent,
48. Shaming ambition's paltry prize
49. Before thy disillusioned eyes;
50. Breaking the spell about thee wound
51. Like the green withes that Samson bound;
52. Redeeming in one effort grand,
53. Thyself and thy imperilled land!
54. Ah, cruel fate, that closed to thee,
55. O sleeper by the Northern sea,
56. The gates of opportunity!
57. God fills the gaps of human need,
58. Each crisis brings its word and deed.
59. Wise men and strong we did not lack;
60. But still, with memory turning back,
61. In the dark hours we thought of thee,
62. And thy lone grave beside the sea.

63. Above that grave the east winds blow,
64. And from the marsh-lands drifting slow
65. The sea-fog comes, with evermore
66. The wave-wash of a lonely shore,
67. And sea-bird's melancholy cry,
68. As Nature fain would typify
69. The sadness of a closing scene,
70. The loss of that which should have been.
71. But, where thy native mountains bare
72. Their foreheads to diviner air,
73. Fit emblem of enduring fame,
74. One lofty summit keeps thy name.
75. For thee the cosmic forces did
76. The rearing of that pyramid,
77. The prescient ages shaping with
78. Fire, flood, and frost thy monolith.
79. Sunrise and sunset lay thereon
80. With hands of light their benison,
81. The stars of midnight pause to set
82. Their jewels in its coronet.
83. And evermore that mountain mass
84. Seems climbing from the shadowy pass
85. To light, as if to manifest
86. Thy nobler self, thy life at best!
