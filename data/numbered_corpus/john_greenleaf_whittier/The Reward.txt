1. Who, looking backward from his manhood's prime,
2. Sees not the spectre of his misspent time?
3. And, through the shade
4. Of funeral cypress planted thick behind,
5. Hears no reproachful whisper on the wind
6. From his loved dead?

7. Who bears no trace of passion's evil force?
8. Who shuns thy sting, O terrible Remorse?
9. Who does not cast
10. On the thronged pages of his memory's book,
11. At times, a sad and half-reluctant look,
12. Regretful of the past?

13. Alas! the evil which we fain would shun
14. We do, and leave the wished-for good undone
15. Our strength to-day
16. Is but to-morrow's weakness, prone to fall;
17. Poor, blind, unprofitable servants all
18. Are we alway.

19. Yet who, thus looking backward o'er his years,
20. Feels not his eyelids wet with grateful tears,
21. If he hath been
22. Permitted, weak and sinful as he was,
23. To cheer and aid, in some ennobling cause,
24. His fellow-men?

25. If he hath hidden the outcast, or let in
26. A ray of sunshine to the cell of sin;
27. If he hath lent
28. Strength to the weak, and, in an hour of need,
29. Over the suffering, mindless of his creed
30. Or home, hath bent;

31. He has not lived in vain, and while he gives
32. The praise to Him, in whom he moves and lives,
33. With thankful heart;
34. He gazes backward, and with hope before,
35. Knowing that from his works he nevermore
36. Can henceforth part.
