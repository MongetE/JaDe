1. How has New England's romance fled,
2. Even as a vision of the morning!
3. Its rites foredone, its guardians dead,
4. Its priestesses, bereft of dread,
5. Waking the veriest urchin's scorning!
6. Gone like the Indian wizard's yell
7. And fire-dance round the magic rock,
8. Forgotten like the Druid's spell
9. At moonrise by his holy oak!
10. No more along the shadowy glen
11. Glide the dim ghosts of murdered men;
12. No more the unquiet churchyard dead
13. Glimpse upward from their turfy bed,
14. Startling the traveller, late and lone;
15. As, on some night of starless weather,
16. They silently commune together,
17. Each sitting on his own head-stone
18. The roofless house, decayed, deserted,
19. Its living tenants all departed,
20. No longer rings with midnight revel
21. Of witch, or ghost, or goblin evil;
22. No pale blue flame sends out its flashes
23. Through creviced roof and shattered sashes!
24. The witch-grass round the hazel spring
25. May sharply to the night-air sing,
26. But there no more shall withered hags
27. Refresh at ease their broomstick nags,
28. Or taste those hazel-shadowed waters
29. As beverage meet for Satan's daughters;
30. No more their mimic tones be heard,
31. The mew of cat, the chirp of bird,
32. Shrill blending with the hoarser laughter
33. Of the fell demon following after!
34. The cautious goodman nails no more
35. A horseshoe on his outer door,
36. Lest some unseemly hag should fit
37. To his own mouth her bridle-bit;
38. The goodwife's churn no more refuses
39. Its wonted culinary uses
40. Until, with heated needle burned,
41. The witch has to her place returned!
42. Our witches are no longer old
43. And wrinkled beldames, Satan-sold,
44. But young and gay and laughing creatures,
45. With the heart's sunshine on their features;
46. Their sorcery--the light which dances
47. Where the raised lid unveils its glances;
48. Or that low-breathed and gentle tone,
49. The music of Love's twilight hours,
50. Soft, dream-like, as a fairy's moan
51. Above her nightly closing flowers,
52. Sweeter than that which sighed of yore
53. Along the charmed Ausonian shore!
54. Even she, our own weird heroine,
55. Sole Pythoness of ancient Lynn,'
56. Sleeps calmly where the living laid her;
57. And the wide realm of sorcery,
58. Left by its latest mistress free,
59. Hath found no gray and skilled invader.
60. So--perished Albion's 'glammarye,'
61. With him in Melrose Abbey sleeping,
62. His charmed torch beside his knee,
63. That even the dead himself might see
64. The magic scroll within his keeping.
65. And now our modern Yankee sees
66. Nor omens, spells, nor mysteries;
67. And naught above, below, around,
68. Of life or death, of sight or sound,
69. Whate'er its nature, form, or look,
70. Excites his terror or surprise,
71. All seeming to his knowing eyes
72. Familiar as his 'catechise,'
73. Or 'Webster's Spelling-Book.'
