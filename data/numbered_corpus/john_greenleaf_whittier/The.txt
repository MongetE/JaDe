1. Weary of jangling noises never stilled,
2. The skeptic's sneer, the bigot's hate, the din
3. Of clashing texts, the webs of creed men spin
4. Round simple truth, the children grown who build
5. With gilded cards their new Jerusalem,
6. Busy, with sacerdotal tailorings
7. And tinsel gauds, bedizening holy things,
8. I turn, with glad and grateful heart, from them
9. To the sweet story of the Florentine
10. Immortal in her blameless maidenhood,
11. Beautiful as God's angels and as good;
12. Feeling that life, even now, may be divine
13. With love no wrong can ever change to hate,
14. No sin make less than all-compassionate!
