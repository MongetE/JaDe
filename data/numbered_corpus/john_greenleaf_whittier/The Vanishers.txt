1. Sweetest of all childlike dreams
2. In the simple Indian lore
3. Still to me the legend seems
4. Of the shapes who flit before.

5. Flitting, passing, seen and gone,
6. Never reached nor found at rest,
7. Baffling search, but beckoning on
8. To the Sunset of the Blest.

9. From the clefts of mountain rocks,
10. Through the dark of lowland firs,
11. Flash the eyes and flow the locks
12. Of the mystic Vanishers!

13. And the fisher in his skiff,
14. And the hunter on the moss,
15. Hear their call from cape and cliff,
16. See their hands the birch-leaves toss.

17. Wistful, longing, through the green
18. Twilight of the clustered pines,
19. In their faces rarely seen
20. Beauty more than mortal shines.

21. Fringed with gold their mantles flow
22. On the slopes of westering knolls;
23. In the wind they whisper low
24. Of the Sunset Land of Souls.

25. Doubt who may, O friend of mine!
26. Thou and I have seen them too;
27. On before with beck and sign
28. Still they glide, and we pursue.

29. More than clouds of purple trail
30. In the gold of setting day;
31. More than gleams of wing or sail
32. Beckon from the sea-mist gray.

33. Glimpses of immortal youth,
34. Gleams and glories seen and flown,
35. Far-heard voices sweet with truth,
36. Airs from viewless Eden blown;

37. Beauty that eludes our grasp,
38. Sweetness that transcends our taste,
39. Loving hands we may not clasp,
40. Shining feet that mock our haste;

41. Gentle eyes we closed below,
42. Tender voices heard once more,
43. Smile and call us, as they go
44. On and onward, still before.

45. Guided thus, O friend of mine
46. Let us walk our little way,
47. Knowing by each beckoning sign
48. That we are not quite astray.

49. Chase we still, with baffled feet,
50. Smiling eye and waving hand,
51. Sought and seeker soon shall meet,
52. Lost and found, in Sunset Land
