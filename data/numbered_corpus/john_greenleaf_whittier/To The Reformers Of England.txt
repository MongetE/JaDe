1. GOD bless ye, brothers! in the fight
2. Ye 're waging now, ye cannot fail,
3. For better is your sense of right
4. Than king-craft's triple mail.
5. Than tyrant's law, or bigot's ban,
6. More mighty is your simplest word;
7. The free heart of an honest man
8. Than crosier or the sword.
9. Go, let your blinded Church rehearse
10. The lesson it has learned so well;
11. It moves not with its prayer or curse
12. The gates of heaven or hell.
13. Let the State scaffold rise again;
14. Did Freedom die when Russell died?
15. Forget ye how the blood of Vane
16. From earth's green bosom cried?
17. The great hearts of your olden time
18. Are beating with you, full and strong;
19. All holy memories and sublime
20. And glorious round ye throng.
21. The bluff, bold men of Runnymede
22. Are with ye still in times like these;
23. The shades of England's mighty dead,
24. Your cloud of witnesses!
25. The truths ye urge are borne abroad
26. By every wind and every tide;
27. The voice of Nature and of God
28. Speaks out upon your side.
29. The weapons which your hands have found
30. Are those which Heaven itself has wrought,
31. Light, Truth, and Love; your battle-ground
32. The free, broad field of Thought.
33. No partial, selfish purpose breaks
34. The simple beauty of your plan,
35. Nor lie from throne or altar shakes
36. Your steady faith in man.
37. The languid pulse of England starts
38. And bounds beneath your words of power,
39. The beating of her million hearts
40. Is with you at this hour!
41. O ye who, with undoubting eyes,
42. Through present cloud and gathering storm,
43. Behold the span of Freedom's skies,
44. And sunshine soft and warm;
45. Press bravely onward! not in vain
46. Your generous trust in human-kind;
47. The good which bloodshed could not gain
48. Your peaceful zeal shall find.
49. Press on! the triumph shall be won
50. Of common rights and equal laws,
51. The glorious dream of Harrington,
52. And Sidney's good old cause.
53. Blessing the cotter and the crown,
54. Sweetening worn Labor's bitter cup;
55. And, plucking not the highest down,
56. Lifting the lowest up.
57. Press on! and we who may not share
58. The toil or glory of your fight
59. May ask, at least, in earnest prayer,
60. God's blessing on the right!
