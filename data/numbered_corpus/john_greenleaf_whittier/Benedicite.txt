1. God's love and peace be with thee, where
2. Soe'er this soft autumnal air
3. Lifts the dark tresses of thy hair.

4. Whether through city casements comes
5. Its kiss to thee, in crowded rooms,
6. Or, out among the woodland blooms,

7. It freshens o'er thy thoughtful face,
8. Imparting, in its glad embrace,
9. Beauty to beauty, grace to grace!

10. Fair Nature's book together read,
11. The old wood-paths that knew our tread,
12. The maple shadows overhead,--

13. The hills we climbed, the river seen
14. By gleams along its deep ravine,--
15. All keep thy memory fresh and green.

16. Where'er I look, where'er I stray,
17. Thy thought goes with me on my way,
18. And hence the prayer I breathe to-day;

19. O'er lapse of time and change of scene,
20. The weary waste which lies between
21. Thyself and me, my heart I lean.

22. Thou lack'st not Friendship's spell-word, nor
23. The half-unconscious power to draw
24. All hearts to thine by Love's sweet law.

25. With these good gifts of God is cast
26. Thy lot, and many a charm thou hast
27. To hold the blessed angels fast.

28. If, then, a fervent wish for thee
29. The gracious heavens will heed from me,
30. What should, dear heart, its burden be?

31. The sighing of a shaken reed,--
32. What can I more than meekly plead
33. The greatness of our common need?

34. God's love,--unchanging, pure, and true,--
35. The Paraclete white-shining through
36. His peace,--the fall of Hermon's dew!

37. With such a prayer, on this sweet day,
38. As thou mayst hear and I may say,
39. I greet thee, dearest, far away!
