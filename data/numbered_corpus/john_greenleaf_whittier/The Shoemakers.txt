1. Ho! workers of the old time styled
2. The Gentle Craft of Leather!
3. Young brothers of the ancient guild,
4. Stand forth once more together!
5. Call out again your long array,
6. In the olden merry manner!
7. Once more, on gay St. Crispin's day,
8. Fling out your blazoned banner!
9. Rap, rap! upon the well-worn stone
10. How falls the polished hammer!
11. Rap, rap! the measured sound has grown
12. A quick and merry clamor.
13. Now shape the sole! now deftly curl
14. The glossy vamp around it,
15. And bless the while the bright-eyed girl
16. Whose gentle fingers bound it!
17. For you, along the Spanish main
18. A hundred keels are ploughing;
19. For you, the Indian on the plain
20. His lasso-coil is throwing;
21. For you, deep glens with hemlock dark
22. The woodman's fire is lighting;
23. For you, upon the oak's gray bark,
24. The woodman's axe is smiting.
25. For you, from Carolina's pine
26. The rosin-gum is stealing;
27. For you, the dark-eyed Florentine
28. Her silken skein is reeling;
29. For you, the dizzy goatherd roams
30. His rugged Alpine ledges;
31. For you, round all her shepherd homes,
32. Bloom England's thorny hedges.
33. The foremost still, by day or night,
34. On moated mound or heather,
35. Whete'er the need of trampled right
36. Brought toiling men together;
37. Where the free burghers from the wall
38. Defied the mail-clad master,
39. Than yours, at Freedom's trumpet-call,
40. No craftsmen rallied faster.
41. Let foplings sneer, let fools deride,
42. Ye heed no idle scorner;
43. Free hands and hearts are still your pride,
44. And duty done, your honor.
45. Ye dare to trust, for honest fame,
46. The jury Time empanels,
47. And leave to truth each noble name
48. Which glorifies your annals.
49. Thy songs, Han Sachs, are living yet,
50. In strong and hearty German;
51. And Bloomfield's lay, and Gifford's wit,
52. And patriot fame of Sherman;
53. Still from his book, a mystic seer,
54. The soul of Behmen teaches,
55. And England's priestcraft shakes to hear
56. Of Fox's leathern breeches.
57. The foot is yours; where'er it falls,
58. It treads your well-wrought leather,
59. On earthen floor, in marble halls,
60. On carpet, or on heather.
61. Still there the sweetest charm is found
62. Of matron grace or vestal's,
63. As Hebe's foot bore nectar round
64. Among the old celestials!
65. Rap, rap! â€” your stout and bluff brogan,
66. With footsteps slow and weary,
67. May wander where the sky's blue span
68. Shuts down upon the prairie.
69. On Beauty's foot your slippers glance,
70. By Saratoga's fountains,
71. Or twinkle down the summer dance
72. Beneath the Crystal Mountains!
73. The red brick to the mason's hand,
74. The brown earth to the tiller's,
75. The shoe in yours shall wealth command,
76. Like fairy Cinderella's!
77. As they who shunned the household maid
78. Beheld the crown upon her,
79. So all shall see your toil repaid
80. With hearth and home and honor.
81. Then let the toast be freely quaffed,
82. In water cool and brimming,
83. 'All honor to the good old Craft,
84. Its merry men and women!'
85. Call out again your long array,
86. In the old time's pleasant manner:
87. Once more, on gay St. Crispin's day,
88. Fling out his blazoned banner!
