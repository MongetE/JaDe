1. WRITTEN ON A BLANK LEAF OF HIS MEMOIRS.

2. Dear friends, who read the world aright,
3. And in its common forms discern
4. A beauty and a harmony
5. The many never learn!

6. Kindred in soul of him who found
7. In simple flower and leaf and stone
8. The impulse of the sweetest lays
9. Our Saxon tongue has known,--

10. Accept this record of a life
11. As sweet and pure, as calm and good,
12. As a long day of blandest June
13. In green field and in wood.

14. How welcome to our ears, long pained
15. By strife of sect and party noise,
16. The brook-like murmur of his song
17. Of nature's simple joys!

18. The violet' by its mossy stone,
19. The primrose by the river's brim,
20. And chance-sown daffodil, have found
21. Immortal life through him.

22. The sunrise on his breezy lake,
23. The rosy tints his sunset brought,
24. World-seen, are gladdening all the vales
25. And mountain-peaks of thought.

26. Art builds on sand; the works of pride
27. And human passion change and fall;
28. But that which shares the life of God
29. With Him surviveth all.
