1. Dead Petra in her hill-tomb sleeps,
2. Her stones of emptiness remain;
3. Around her sculptured mystery sweeps
4. The lonely waste of Edom's plain.

5. From the doomed dwellers in the cleft
6. The bow of vengeance turns not back;
7. Of all her myriads none are left
8. Along the Wady Mousa's track.

9. Clear in the hot Arabian day
10. Her arches spring, her statues climb;
11. Unchanged, the graven wonders pay
12. No tribute to the spoiler, Time!

13. Unchanged the awful lithograph
14. Of power and glory undertrod;
15. Of nations scattered like the chaff
16. Blown from the threshing-floor of God.

17. Yet shall the thoughtful stranger turn
18. From Petra's gates with deeper awe,
19. To mark afar the burial urn
20. Of Aaron on the cliffs of Hor;

21. And where upon its ancient guard
22. Thy Rock, El Ghor, is standing yet,--
23. Looks from its turrets desertward,
24. And keeps the watch that God has set.

25. The same as when in thunders loud
26. It heard the voice of God to man,
27. As when it saw in fire and cloud
28. The angels walk in Israel's van,

29. Or when from Ezion-Geber's way
30. It saw the long procession file,
31. And heard the Hebrew timbrels play
32. The music of the lordly Nile;

33. Or saw the tabernacle pause,
34. Cloud-bound, by Kadesh Barnea's wells,
35. While Moses graved the sacred laws,
36. And Aaron swung his golden bells.

37. Rock of the desert, prophet-sung!
38. How grew its shadowing pile at length,
39. A symbol, in the Hebrew tongue,
40. Of God's eternal love and strength.

41. On lip of bard and scroll of seer,
42. From age to age went down the name,
43. Until the Shiloh's promised year,
44. And Christ, the Rock of Ages, came!

45. The path of life we walk to-day
46. Is strange as that the Hebrews trod;
47. We need the shadowing rock, as they,--
48. We need, like them, the guides of God.

49. God send His angels, Cloud and Fire,
50. To lead us o'er the desert sand!
51. God give our hearts their long desire,
52. His shadow in a weary land!
