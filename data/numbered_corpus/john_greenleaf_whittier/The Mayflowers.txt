1. Sad Mayflower! watched by winter stars,
2. And nursed by winter gales,
3. With petals of the sleeted spars,
4. And leaves of frozen sails!

5. What had she in those dreary hours,
6. Within her ice-rimmed bay,
7. In common with the wild-wood flowers,
8. The first sweet smiles of May?

9. Yet, 'God be praised!' the Pilgrim said,
10. Who saw the blossoms peer
11. Above the brown leaves, dry and dead,
12. 'Behold our Mayflower here!'

13. 'God wills it: here our rest shall be,
14. Our years of wandering o'er;
15. For us the Mayflower of the sea
16. Shall spread her sails no more.'

17. O sacred flowers of faith and hope,
18. As sweetly now as then
19. Ye bloom on many a birchen slope,
20. In many a pine-dark glen.

21. Behind the sea-wall's rugged length,
22. Unchanged, your leaves unfold,
23. Like love behind the manly strength
24. Of the brave hearts of old.

25. So live the fathers in their sons,
26. Their sturdy faith be ours,
27. And ours the love that overruns
28. Its rocky strength with flowers!

29. The Pilgrim's wild and wintry day
30. Its shadow round us draws;
31. The Mayflower of his stormy bay,
32. Our Freedom's struggling cause.

33. But warmer suns erelong shall bring
34. To life the frozen sod;
35. And through dead leaves of hope shall spring
36. Afresh the flowers of God!
