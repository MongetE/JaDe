1. Traveller! on thy journey toiling
2. By the swift Powow,
3. With the summer sunshine falling
4. On thy heated brow,
5. Listen, while all else is still,
6. To the brooklet from the hill.

7. Wild and sweet the flowers are blowing
8. By that streamlet's side,
9. And a greener verdure showing
10. Where its waters glide,
11. Down the hill-slope murmuring on,
12. Over root and mossy stone.

13. Where yon oak his broad arms flingeth
14. O'er the sloping hill,
15. Beautiful and freshly springeth
16. That soft-flowing rill,
17. Through its dark roots wreathed and bare,
18. Gushing up to sun and air.

19. Brighter waters sparkled never
20. In that magic well,
21. Of whose gift of life forever
22. Ancient legends tell,
23. In the lonely desert wasted,
24. And by mortal lip untasted.

25. Waters which the proud Castilian
26. Sought with longing eyes,
27. Underneath the bright pavilion
28. Of the Indian skies,
29. Where his forest pathway lay
30. Through the blooms of Florida.

31. Years ago a lonely stranger,
32. With the dusky brow
33. Of the outcast forest-ranger,
34. Crossed the swift Powow,
35. And betook him to the rill
36. And the oak upon the hill.

37. O'er his face of moody sadness
38. For an instant shone
39. Something like a gleam of gladness,
40. As he stooped him down
41. To the fountain's grassy side,
42. And his eager thirst supplied.

43. With the oak its shadow throwing
44. O'er his mossy seat,
45. And the cool, sweet waters flowing
46. Softly at his feet,
47. Closely by the fountain's rim
48. That lone Indian seated him.

49. Autumn's earliest frost had given
50. To the woods below
51. Hues of beauty, such as heaven
52. Lendeth to its bow;
53. And the soft breeze from the west
54. Scarcely broke their dreamy rest.

55. Far behind was Ocean striving
56. With his chains of sand;
57. Southward, sunny glimpses giving,
58. 'Twixt the swells of land,
59. Of its calm and silvery track,
60. Rolled the tranquil Merrimac.

61. Over village, wood, and meadow
62. Gazed that stranger man,
63. Sadly, till the twilight shadow
64. Over all things ran,
65. Save where spire and westward pane
66. Flashed the sunset back again.

67. Gazing thus upon the dwelling
68. Of his warrior sires,
69. Where no lingering trace was telling
70. Of their wigwam fires,
71. Who the gloomy thoughts might know
72. Of that wandering child of woe?

73. Naked lay, in sunshine glowing,
74. Hills that once had stood
75. Down their sides the shadows throwing
76. Of a mighty wood,
77. Where the deer his covert kept,
78. And the eagle's pinion swept!

79. Where the birch canoe had glided
80. Down the swift Powow,
81. Dark and gloomy bridges strided
82. Those clear waters now;
83. And where once the beaver swam,
84. Jarred the wheel and frowned the dam.

85. For the wood-bird's merry singing,
86. And the hunter's cheer,
87. Iron clang and hammer's ringing
88. Smote upon his ear;
89. And the thick and sullen smoke
90. From the blackened forges broke.

91. Could it be his fathers ever
92. Loved to linger here?
93. These bare hills, this conquered river,-
94. Could they hold them dear,
95. With their native loveliness
96. Tamed and tortured into this?

97. Sadly, as the shades of even
98. Gathered o'er the hill,
99. While the western half of heaven
100. Blushed with sunset still,
101. From the fountain's mossy seat
102. Turned the Indian's weary feet.

103. Year on year hath flown forever,
104. But he came no more
105. To the hillside on the river
106. Where he came before.
107. But the villager can tell
108. Of that strange man's visit well.

109. And the merry children, laden
110. With their fruits or flowers,
111. Roving boy and laughing maiden,
112. In their school-day hours,
113. Love the simple tale to tell
114. Of the Indian and his well.
