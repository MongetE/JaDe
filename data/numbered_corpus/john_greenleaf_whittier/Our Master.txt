1. Immortal Love, forever full,
2. Forever flowing free,
3. Forever shared, forever whole,
4. A never-ebbing sea!

5. Our outward lips confess the name
6. All other names above;
7. Love only knoweth whence it came
8. And comprehendeth love.

9. Blow, winds of God, awake and blow
10. The mists of earth away!
11. Shine out, O Light Divine, and show
12. How wide and far we stray!

13. Hush every lip, close every book,
14. The strife of tongues forbear;
15. Why forward reach, or backward look,
16. For love that clasps like air?

17. We may not climb the heavenly steeps
18. To bring the Lord Christ down
19. In vain we search the lowest deeps,
20. For Him no depths can drown.

21. Nor holy bread, nor blood of grape,
22. The lineaments restore
23. Of Him we know in outward shape
24. And in the flesh no more.

25. He cometh not a king to reign;
26. The world's long hope is dim;
27. The weary centuries watch in vain
28. The clouds of heaven for Him.

29. Death comes, life goes; the asking eye
30. And ear are answerless;
31. The grave is dumb, the hollow sky
32. Is sad with silentness.

33. The letter fails, and systems fall,
34. And every symbol wanes;
35. The Spirit over-brooding all
36. Eternal Love remains.

37. And not for signs in heaven above
38. Or earth below they look,
39. Who know with John His smile of love,
40. With Peter His rebuke.

41. In joy of inward peace, or sense
42. Of sorrow over sin,
43. He is His own best evidence,
44. His witness is within.

45. No fable old, nor mythic lore,
46. Nor dream of bards and seers,
47. No dead fact stranded on the shore
48. Of the oblivious years;--

49. But warm, sweet, tender, even yet
50. A present help is He;
51. And faith has still its Olivet,
52. And love its Galilee.

53. The healing of His seamless dress
54. Is by our beds of pain;
55. We touch Him in life's throng and press,
56. And we are whole again.

57. Through Him the first fond prayers are said
58. Our lips of childhood frame,
59. The last low whispers of our dead
60. Are burdened with His name.

61. Our Lord and Master of us all!
62. Whate'er our name or sign,
63. We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,
64. We test our lives by Thine.

65. Thou judgest us; Thy purity
66. Doth all our lusts condemn;
67. The love that draws us nearer Thee
68. Is hot with wrath to them.

69. Our thoughts lie open to Thy sight;
70. And, naked to Thy glance,
71. Our secret sins are in the light
72. Of Thy pure countenance.

73. Thy healing pains, a keen distress
74. Thy tender light shines in;
75. Thy sweetness is the bitterness,
76. Thy grace the pang of sin.

77. Yet, weak and blinded though we be,
78. Thou dost our service own;
79. We bring our varying gifts to Thee,
80. And Thou rejectest none.

81. To Thee our full humanity,
82. Its joys and pains, belong;
83. The wrong of man to man on Thee
84. Inflicts a deeper wrong.

85. Who hates, hates Thee, who loves becomes
86. Therein to Thee allied;
87. All sweet accords of hearts and homes
88. In Thee are multiplied.

89. Deep strike Thy roots, O heavenly Vine,
90. Within our earthly sod,
91. Most human and yet most divine,
92. The flower of man and God!

93. O Love! O Life! Our faith and sight
94. Thy presence maketh one
95. As through transfigured clouds of white
96. We trace the noon-day sun.

97. So, to our mortal eyes subdued,
98. Flesh-veiled, but not concealed,
99. We know in Thee the fatherhood
100. And heart of God revealed.

101. We faintly hear, we dimly see,
102. In differing phrase we pray;
103. But, dim or clear, we own in Thee
104. The Light, the Truth, the Way!

105. The homage that we render Thee
106. Is still our Father's own;
107. No jealous claim or rivalry
108. Divides the Cross and Throne.

109. To do Thy will is more than praise,
110. As words are less than deeds,
111. And simple trust can find Thy ways
112. We miss with chart of creeds.

113. No pride of self Thy service hath,
114. No place for me and mine;
115. Our human strength is weakness, death
116. Our life, apart from Thine.

117. Apart from Thee all gain is loss,
118. All labor vainly done;
119. The solemn shadow of Thy Cross
120. Is better than the sun.

121. Alone, O Love ineffable!
122. Thy saving name is given;
123. To turn aside from Thee is hell,
124. To walk with Thee is heaven!

125. How vain, secure in all Thou art,
126. Our noisy championship
127. The sighing of the contrite heart
128. Is more than flattering lip.

129. Not Thine the bigot's partial plea,
130. Nor Thine the zealot's ban;
131. Thou well canst spare a love of Thee
132. Which ends in hate of man.

133. Our Friend, our Brother, and our Lord,
134. What may Thy service be?--
135. Nor name, nor form, nor ritual word,
136. But simply following Thee.

137. We bring no ghastly holocaust,
138. We pile no graven stone;
139. He serves thee best who loveth most
140. His brothers and Thy own.

141. Thy litanies, sweet offices
142. Of love and gratitude;
143. Thy sacramental liturgies,
144. The joy of doing good.

145. In vain shall waves of incense drift
146. The vaulted nave around,
147. In vain the minster turret lift
148. Its brazen weights of sound.

149. The heart must ring Thy Christmas bells,
150. Thy inward altars raise;
151. Its faith and hope Thy canticles,
152. And its obedience praise!
