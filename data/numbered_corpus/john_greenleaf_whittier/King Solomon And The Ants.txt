1. Out from Jerusalem
2. The king rode with his great
3. War chiefs and lords of state,
4. And Sheba's queen with them;

5. Comely, but black withal,
6. To whom, perchance, belongs
7. That wondrous Song of songs,
8. Sensuous and mystical,

9. Whereto devout souls turn
10. In fond, ecstatic dream,
11. And through its earth-born theme
12. The Love of loves discern.

13. Proud in the Syrian sun,
14. In gold and purple sheen,
15. The dusky Ethiop queen
16. Smiled on King Solomon.

17. Wisest of men, he knew
18. The languages of all
19. The creatures great or small
20. That trod the earth or flew.

21. Across an ant-hill led
22. The king's path, and he heard
23. Its small folk, and their word
24. He thus interpreted:

25. 'Here comes the king men greet
26. As wise and good and just,
27. To crush us in the dust
28. Under his heedless feet.'

29. The great king bowed his head,
30. And saw the wide surprise
31. Of the Queen of Sheba's eyes
32. As he told her what they said.

33. 'O king!' she whispered sweet,
34. 'Too happy fate have they
35. Who perish in thy way
36. Beneath thy gracious feet!

37. 'Thou of the God-lent crown,
38. Shall these vile creatures dare
39. Murmur against thee where
40. The knees of kings kneel down?'

41. 'Nay,' Solomon replied,
42. 'The wise and strong should seek
43. The welfare of the weak,'
44. And turned his horse aside.

45. His train, with quick alarm,
46. Curved with their leader round
47. The ant-hill's peopled mound,
48. And left it free from harm.

49. The jewelled head bent low;
50. 'O king!' she said, 'henceforth
51. The secret of thy worth
52. And wisdom well I know.

53. 'Happy must be the State
54. Whose ruler heedeth more
55. The murmurs of the poor
56. Than flatteries of the great.'
