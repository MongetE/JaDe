1. I.
2. The mercy, O Eternal One!
3. By man unmeasured yet,
4. In joy or grief, in shade or sun,
5. I never will forget.
6. I give the whole, and not a part,
7. Of all Thou gayest me;
8. My goods, my life, my soul and heart,
9. I yield them all to Thee!

10. II.
11. We fast and plead, we weep and pray,
12. From morning until even;
13. We feel to find the holy way,
14. We knock at the gate of heaven
15. And when in silent awe we wait,
16. And word and sign forbear,
17. The hinges of the golden gate
18. Move, soundless, to our prayer!
19. Who hears the eternal harmonies
20. Can heed no outward word;
21. Blind to all else is he who sees
22. The vision of the Lord!

23. III.
24. O soul, be patient, restrain thy tears,
25. Have hope, and not despair;
26. As a tender mother heareth her child
27. God hears the penitent prayer.
28. And not forever shall grief be thine;
29. On the Heavenly Mother's breast,
30. Washed clean and white in the waters of joy
31. Shall His seeking child find rest.
32. Console thyself with His word of grace,
33. And cease thy wail of woe,
34. For His mercy never an equal hath,
35. And His love no bounds can know.
36. Lean close unto Him in faith and hope;
37. How many like thee have found
38. In Him a shelter and home of peace,
39. By His mercy compassed round!
40. There, safe from sin and the sorrow it brings,
41. They sing their grateful psalms,
42. And rest, at noon, by the wells of God,
43. In the shade of His holy palms!
