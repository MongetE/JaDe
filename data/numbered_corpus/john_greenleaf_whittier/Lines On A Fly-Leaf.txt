1. I need not ask thee, for my sake,
2. To read a book which well may make
3. Its way by native force of wit
4. Without my manual sign to it.
5. Its piquant writer needs from me
6. No gravely masculine guaranty,
7. And well might laugh her merriest laugh
8. At broken spears in her behalf;
9. Yet, spite of all the critics tell,
10. I frankly own I like her well.
11. It may be that she wields a pen
12. Too sharply nibbed for thin-skinned men,
13. That her keen arrows search and try
14. The armor joints of dignity,
15. And, though alone for error meant,
16. Sing through the air irreverent.
17. I blame her not, the young athlete
18. Who plants her woman's tiny feet,
19. And dares the chances of debate
20. Where bearded men might hesitate,
21. Who, deeply earnest, seeing well
22. The ludicrous and laughable,
23. Mingling in eloquent excess
24. Her anger and her tenderness,
25. And, chiding with a half-caress,
26. Strives, less for her own sex than ours,
27. With principalities and powers,
28. And points us upward to the clear
29. Sunned heights of her new atmosphere.

30. Heaven mend her faults!--I will not pause
31. To weigh and doubt and peck at flaws,
32. Or waste my pity when some fool
33. Provokes her measureless ridicule.
34. Strong-minded is she? Better so
35. Than dulness set for sale or show,
36. A household folly, capped and belled
37. In fashion's dance of puppets held,
38. Or poor pretence of womanhood,
39. Whose formal, flavorless platitude
40. Is warranted from all offence
41. Of robust meaning's violence.
42. Give me the wine of thought whose head
43. Sparkles along the page I read,--
44. Electric words in which I find
45. The tonic of the northwest wind;
46. The wisdom which itself allies
47. To sweet and pure humanities,
48. Where scorn of meanness, hate of wrong,
49. Are underlaid by love as strong;
50. The genial play of mirth that lights
51. Grave themes of thought, as when, on nights
52. Of summer-time, the harmless blaze
53. Of thunderless heat-lightning plays,
54. And tree and hill-top resting dim
55. And doubtful on the sky's vague rim,
56. Touched by that soft and lambent gleam,
57. Start sharply outlined from their dream.

58. Talk not to me of woman's sphere,
59. Nor point with Scripture texts a sneer,
60. Nor wrong the manliest saint of all
61. By doubt, if he were here, that Paul
62. Would own the heroines who have lent
63. Grace to truth's stern arbitrament,
64. Foregone the praise to woman sweet,
65. And cast their crowns at Duty's feet;
66. Like her, who by her strong Appeal
67. Made Fashion weep and Mammon feel,
68. Who, earliest summoned to withstand
69. The color-madness of the land,
70. Counted her life-long losses gain,
71. And made her own her sisters' pain;
72. Or her who, in her greenwood shade,
73. Heard the sharp call that Freedom made,
74. And, answering, struck from Sappho's lyre
75. Of love the Tyrtman carmen's fire
76. Or that young girl,--Domremy's maid
77. Revived a nobler cause to aid,--
78. Shaking from warning finger-tips
79. The doom of her apocalypse;
80. Or her, who world-wide entrance gave
81. To the log-cabin of the slave,
82. Made all his want and sorrow known,
83. And all earth's languages his own.
