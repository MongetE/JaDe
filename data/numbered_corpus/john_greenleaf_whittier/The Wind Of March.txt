1. Up from the sea, the wild north wind is blowing
2. Under the sky's gray arch;
3. Smiling, I watch the shaken elm-boughs, knowing
4. It is the wind of March.

5. Between the passing and the coming season,
6. This stormy interlude
7. Gives to our winter-wearied hearts a reason
8. For trustful gratitude.

9. Welcome to waiting ears its harsh forewarning
10. Of light and warmth to come,
11. The longed-for joy of Nature's Easter morning,
12. The earth arisen in bloom.

13. In the loud tumult winter's strength is breaking;
14. I listen to the sound,
15. As to a voice of resurrection, waking
16. To life the dead, cold ground.

17. Between these gusts, to the soft lapse I hearken
18. Of rivulets on their way;
19. I see these tossed and naked tree-tops darken
20. With the fresh leaves of May.

21. This roar of storm, this sky so gray and lowering
22. Invite the airs of Spring,
23. A warmer sunshine over fields of flowering,
24. The bluebird's song and wing.

25. Closely behind, the Gulf's warm breezes follow
26. This northern hurricane,
27. And, borne thereon, the bobolink and swallow
28. Shall visit us again.

29. And, in green wood-paths, in the kine-fed pasture
30. And by the whispering rills,
31. Shall flowers repeat the lesson of the Master,
32. Taught on his Syrian hills.

33. Blow, then, wild wind! thy roar shall end in singing,
34. Thy chill in blossoming;
35. Come, like Bethesda's troubling angel, bringing
36. The healing of the Spring.
