1. WHAT though around thee blazes
2. No fiery rallying sign?
3. From all thy own high places,
4. Give heaven the light of thine!
5. What though unthrilled, unmoving,
6. The statesman stand apart,
7. And comes no warm approving
8. From Mammon's crowded mart?
9. Still, let the land be shaken
10. By a summons of thine own!
11. By all save truth forsaken,
12. Stand fast with that alone!
13. Shrink not from strife unequal!
14. With the best is always hope;
15. And ever in the sequel
16. God holds the right side up!
17. But when, with thine uniting,
18. Come voices long and loud,
19. And far-off hills are writing
20. Thy fire-words on the cloud;
21. When from Penobscot's fountains
22. A deep response is heard,
23. And across the Western mountains
24. Rolls back thy rallying word;
25. Shall thy line of battle falter,
26. With its allies just in view?
27. Oh, by hearth and holy altar,
28. My fatherland, be true!
29. Fling abroad thy scrolls of freedom!
30. Speed them onward far and fast!
31. Over hill and valley speed them,
32. Like the sibyl's on the blast!
33. Lo! The Empire State is shaking
34. The shackles from her hand;
35. With the rugged North is waking
36. The level sunset land!
37. On they come, the free battalions!
38. East and West and North they come,
39. And the heart-beat of the millions
40. Is the beat of Freedom's drum.
41. 'To the tyrant's plot no favor!
42. No heed to place-fed knaves!
43. Bar and bolt the door forever
44. Against the land of slaves!'
45. Hear it, mother Earth, and hear it,
46. The heavens above us spread!
47. The land is roused, â€” its spirit
48. Was sleeping, but not dead!
