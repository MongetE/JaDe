1. LAST week — the Lord be praised for all His mercies
2. To His unworthy servant! — I arrived
3. Safe at the Mission, via Westport; where
4. I tarried over night, to aid in forming
5. A Vigilance Committee, to send back,
6. In shirts of tar, and feather-doublets quilted
7. With forty stripes save one, all Yankee comers,
8. Uncircumcised and Gentile, aliens from
9. The Commonwealth of Israel, who despise
10. The prize of the high calling of the saints,
11. Who plant amidst this heathen wilderness
12. Pure gospel institutions, sanctified
13. By patriarchal use. The meeting opened
14. With prayer, as was most fitting. Half an hour,
15. Or thereaway, I groaned, and strove, and wrestled,
16. As Jacob did at Penuel, till the power
17. Fell on the people, and they cried 'Amen!'
18. 'Glory to God!' and stamped and clapped their hands;
19. And the rough river boatmen wiped their eyes;
20. 'Go it, old hoss!' they cried, and cursed the niggers —
21. Fulfilling thus the word of prophecy,
22. 'Cursed be Cannan.' After prayer, the meeting
23. Chose a committee — good and pious men —
24. A Presbyterian Elder, Baptist deacon,
25. A local preacher, three or four class-leaders,
26. Anxious inquirers, and renewed backsliders,
27. A score in all — to watch the river ferry,
28. (As they of old did watch the fords of Jordan,)
29. And cut off all whose Yankee tongues refuse
30. The Shibboleth of the Nebraska bill.
31. And then, in answer to repeated calls,
32. I gave a brief account of what I saw
33. In Washington; and truly many hearts
34. Rejoiced to know the President, and you
35. And all the Cabinet regularly hear
36. The gospel message of a Sunday morning,
37. Drinking with thirsty souls of the sincere
38. Milk of the Word. Glory! Amen, and Selah!
39. Here, at the Mission, all things have gone well:
40. The brother who, throughout my absence, acted
41. As overseer, assures me that the crops
42. Never were better. I have lost one negro,
43. A first-rate hand, but obstinate and sullen.
44. He ran away some time last spring, and hid
45. In the river timber. There my Indian converts
46. Found him, and treed and shot him. For the rest,
47. The heathens round about begin to feel
48. The influence of our pious ministrations
49. And works of love; and some of them already
50. Have purchased negroes, and are settling down
51. As sober Christians! Bless the Lord for this!
52. I know it will rejoice you. You, I hear,
53. Are on the eve of visiting Chicago,
54. To fight with the wild beasts of Ephesus,
55. Long John, and Dutch Free-Soilers. May your arm
56. Be clothed with strength, and on your tongue be found
57. The sweet oil of persuasion. So desires
58. Your brother and co-laborer. Amen!
59. P.S. All's lost. Even while I write these lines,
60. The Yankee abolitionists are coming
61. Upon us like a flood — grim, stalwart men,
62. Each face set like a flint of Plymouth Rock
63. Against our institutions — staking out
64. Their farm lots on the wooded Wakarusa,
65. Or squatting by the mellow-bottomed Kansas;
66. The pioneers of mightier multitudes,
67. The small rain-patter, ere the thunder shower
68. Drowns the dry prairies. Hope from man is not.
69. Oh, for a quiet berth at Washington,
70. Snug naval chaplaincy, or clerkship, where
71. These rumors of free labor and free soil
72. Might never meet me more. Better to be
73. Door-keeper in the White House, than to dwell
74. Amidst these Yankee tents, that, whitening, show
75. On the green prairie like a fleet becalmed.
76. Methinks I hear a voice come up the river
77. From those far bayous, where the alligators
78. Mount guard around the camping filibusters:
79. 'Shake off the dust of Kansas. Turn to Cuba —
80. (That golden orange just about to fall,
81. O'er-ripe, into the Democratic lap
82. Keep pace with Providence, or, as we say,
83. Manifest destiny. Go forth and follow
84. The message of our gospel, thither borne
85. Upon the point of Quitman's bowie-knife,
86. And the persuasive lips of Colt's revolvers.
87. There may'st thou, underneath thy vine and fig-tree,
88. Watch thy increase of sugar cane and negroes,
89. Calm as a patriarch in his eastern tent!'
90. Amen: So mote it be. So prays your friend.
