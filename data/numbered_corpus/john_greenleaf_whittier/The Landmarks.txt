1. I.
2. THROUGH the streets of Marblehead
3. Fast the red-winged terror sped;

4. Blasting, withering, on it came,
5. With its hundred tongues of flame,

6. Where St. Michael's on its way
7. Stood like chained Andromeda,

8. Waiting on the rock, like her,
9. Swift doom or deliverer!

10. Church that, after sea-moss grew
11. Over walls no longer new,

12. Counted generations five,
13. Four entombed and one alive;

14. Heard the martial thousand tread
15. Battleward from Marblehead;

16. Saw within the rock-walled bay
17. Treville's liked pennons play,

18. And the fisher's dory met
19. By the barge of Lafayette,

20. Telling good news in advance
21. Of the coming fleet of France!

22. Church to reverend memories, dear,
23. Quaint in desk and chandelier;

24. Bell, whose century-rusted tongue
25. Burials tolled and bridals rung;

26. Loft, whose tiny organ kept
27. Keys that Snetzler's hand had swept;

28. Altar, o'er whose tablet old
29. Sinai's law its thunders rolled!

30. Suddenly the sharp cry came
31. 'Look! St. Michael's is aflame!'

32. Round the low tower wall the fire
33. Snake-like wound its coil of ire.

34. Sacred in its gray respect
35. From the jealousies of sect,

36. 'Save it,' seemed the thought of all,
37. 'Save it, though our roof-trees fall!'

38. Up the tower the young men sprung;
39. One, the bravest, outward swung

40. By the rope, whose kindling strands
41. Smoked beneath the holder's hands,

42. Smiting down with strokes of power
43. Burning fragments from the tower.

44. Then the gazing crowd beneath
45. Broke the painful pause of breath;

46. Brave men cheered from street to street,
47. With home's ashes at their feet;

48. Houseless women kerchiefs waved:
49. 'Thank the Lord! St. Michael's saved!'

50. II.
51. In the heart of Boston town
52. Stands the church of old renown,

53. From whose walls the impulse went
54. Which set free a continent;

55. From whose pulpit's oracle
56. Prophecies of freedom fell;

57. And whose steeple-rocking din
58. Rang the nation's birth-day in!

59. Standing at this very hour
60. Perilled like St. Michael's tower,

61. Held not in the clasp of flame,
62. But by mammon's grasping claim.

63. Shall it be of Boston said
64. She is shamed by Marblehead?

65. City of our pride! as there,
66. Hast thou none to do and dare?

67. Life was risked for Michael's shrine;
68. Shall not wealth be staked for thine?

69. Woe to thee, when men shall search
70. Vainly for the Old South Church;

71. When from Neck to Boston Stone,
72. All thy pride of place is gone;

73. When from Bay and railroad car,
74. Stretched before them wide and far,

75. Men shall only see a great
76. Wilderness of brick and slate,

77. Every holy spot o'erlaid
78. By the commonplace of trade!

79. City of our love': to thee
80. Duty is but destiny.

81. True to all thy record saith,
82. Keep with thy traditions faith;

83. Ere occasion's overpast,
84. Hold its flowing forelock fast;

85. Honor still the precedents
86. Of a grand munificence;

87. In thy old historic way
88. Give, as thou didst yesterday

89. At the South-land's call, or on
90. Need's demand from fired St. John.

91. Set thy Church's muffled bell
92. Free the generous deed to tell.

93. Let thy loyal hearts rejoice
94. In the glad, sonorous voice,

95. Ringing from the brazen mouth
96. Of the bell of the Old South,--

97. Ringing clearly, with a will,
98. 'What she was is Boston still!'
