1. The lowliest born of all the land,
2. He wrung from Fate's reluctant hand
3. The gifts which happier boyhood claims;
4. And, tasting on a thankless soil
5. The bitter bread of unpaid toil,
6. He fed his soul with noble aims.

7. And Nature, kindly provident,
8. To him the future's promise lent;
9. The powers that shape man's destinies,
10. Patience and faith and toil, he knew,
11. The close horizon round him grew,
12. Broad with great possibilities.

13. By the low hearth-fire's fitful blaze
14. He read of old heroic days,
15. The sage's thought, the patriot's speech;
16. Unhelped, alone, himself he taught,
17. His school the craft at which he wrought,
18. His lore the book within his, reach.

19. He felt his country's need; he knew
20. The work her children had to do;
21. And when, at last, he heard the call
22. In her behalf to serve and dare,
23. Beside his senatorial chair
24. He stood the unquestioned peer of all.

25. Beyond the accident of birth
26. He proved his simple manhood's worth;
27. Ancestral pride and classic grace
28. Confessed the large-brained artisan,
29. So clear of sight, so wise in plan
30. And counsel, equal to his place.

31. With glance intuitive he saw
32. Through all disguise of form and law,
33. And read men like an open book;
34. Fearless and firm, he never quailed
35. Nor turned aside for threats, nor failed
36. To do the thing he undertook.

37. How wise, how brave, he was, how well
38. He bore himself, let history tell
39. While waves our flag o'er land and sea,
40. No black thread in its warp or weft;
41. He found dissevered States, he left
42. A grateful Nation, strong and free!
