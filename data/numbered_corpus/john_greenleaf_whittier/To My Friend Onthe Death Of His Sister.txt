1. Thine is a grief, the depth of which another
2. May never know;
3. Yet, o'er the waters, O my stricken brother!
4. To thee I go.

5. I lean my heart unto thee, sadly folding
6. Thy hand in mine;
7. With even the weakness of my soul upholding
8. The strength of thine.

9. I never knew, like thee, the dear departed;
10. I stood not by
11. When, in calm trust, the pure and tranquil-hearted
12. Lay down to die.

13. And on thy ears my words of weak condoling
14. Must vainly fall
15. The funeral bell which in thy heart is tolling,
16. Sounds over all!

17. I will not mock thee with the poor world's common
18. And heartless phrase,
19. Nor wrong the memory of a sainted woman
20. With idle praise.

21. With silence only as their benediction,
22. God's angels come
23. Where, in the shadow of a great affliction,
24. The soul sits dumb!

25. Yet, would I say what thy own heart approveth
26. Our Father's will,
27. Calling to Him the dear one whom He loveth,
28. Is mercy still.

29. Not upon thee or thine the solemn angel
30. Hath evil wrought
31. Her funeral anthem is a glad evangel,--
32. The good die not!

33. God calls our loved ones, but we lose not wholly
34. What He hath given;
35. They live on earth, in thought and deed, as truly
36. As in His heaven.

37. And she is with thee; in thy path of trial
38. She walketh yet;
39. Still with the baptism of thy self-denial
40. Her locks are wet.

41. Up, then, my brother! Lo, the fields of harvest
42. Lie white in view
43. She lives and loves thee, and the God thou servest
44. To both is true.

45. Thrust in thy sickle! England's toilworn peasants
46. Thy call abide;
47. And she thou mourn'st, a pure and holy presence,
48. Shall glean beside!
