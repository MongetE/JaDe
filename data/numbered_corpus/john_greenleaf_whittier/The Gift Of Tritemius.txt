1. Tritemius of Herbipolis, one day,
2. While kneeling at the altar's foot to pray,
3. Alone with God, as was his pious choice,
4. Heard from without a miserable voice,
5. A sound which seemed of all sad things to tell,
6. As of a lost soul crying out of hell.

7. Thereat the Abbot paused; the chain whereby
8. His thoughts went upward broken by that cry;
9. And, looking from the casement, saw below
10. A wretched woman, with gray hair a-flow,
11. And withered hands held up to him, who cried
12. For alms as one who might not be denied.

13. She cried, 'For the dear love of Him who gave
14. His life for ours, my child from bondage save,-
15. My beautiful, brave first-born, chained with slaves
16. In the Moor's galley, where the sun-smit waves
17. Lap the white walls of Tunis!'-'What I can
18. I give,' Tritemius said, 'my prayers.'-'O man
19. Of God!' she cried, for grief had made her bold,
20. 'Mock me not thus; I ask not prayers, but gold.
21. Words will not serve me, alms alone suffice;
22. Even while I speak perchance my first-born dies.'

23. 'Woman!' Tritemius answered, 'from our door
24. None go unfed, hence are we always poor;
25. A single soldo is our only store.
26. Thou hast our prayers;-what can we give thee
27. more?'

28. 'Give me,' she said, 'the silver candlesticks
29. On either side of the great crucifix.
30. God well may spare them on His errands sped,
31. Or He can give you golden ones instead.'

32. Then spake Tritemius, 'Even as thy word,
33. Woman, so be it! (Our most gracious Lord,
34. Who loveth mercy more than sacrifice,
35. Pardon me if a human soul I prize
36. Above the gifts upon his altar piled!
37. Take what thou askest, and redeem thy child.'

38. But his hand trembled as the holy alms
39. He placed within the beggar's eager palms;
40. And as she vanished down the linden shade,
41. He bowed his head and for forgiveness prayed.
42. So the day passed, and when the twilight came
43. He woke to find the chapel all aflame,
44. And, dumb with grateful wonder, to behold
45. Upon the altar candlesticks of gold!
