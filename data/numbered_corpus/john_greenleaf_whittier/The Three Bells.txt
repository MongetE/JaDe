1. BENEATH the low-hung night cloud
2. That raked her splintering mast
3. The good ship settled slowly,
4. The cruel leak gained fast.

5. Over the awful ocean
6. Her signal guns pealed out.
7. Dear God! was that Thy answer
8. From the horror round about?

9. A voice came down the wild wind,
10. 'Ho! ship ahoy!' its cry
11. 'Our stout Three Bells of Glasgow
12. Shall lay till daylight by!'

13. Hour after hour crept slowly,
14. Yet on the heaving swells
15. Tossed up and down the ship-lights,
16. The lights of the Three Bells!

17. And ship to ship made signals,
18. Man answered back to man,
19. While oft, to cheer and hearten,
20. The Three Bells nearer ran;

21. And the captain from her taffrail
22. Sent down his hopeful cry
23. 'Take heart! Hold on!' he shouted;
24. 'The Three Bells shall lay by!'

25. All night across the waters
26. The tossing lights shone clear;
27. All night from reeling taffrail
28. The Three Bells sent her cheer.

29. And when the dreary watches
30. Of storm and darkness passed,
31. Just as the wreck lurched under,
32. All souls were saved at last.

33. Sail on, Three Bells, forever,
34. In grateful memory sail!
35. Ring on, Three Bells of rescue,
36. Above the wave and gale!

37. Type of the Love eternal,
38. Repeat the Master's cry,
39. As tossing through our darkness
40. The lights of God draw nigh!
