1. Father! to Thy suffering poor
2. Strength and grace and faith impart,
3. And with Thy own love restore
4. Comfort to the broken heart!
5. Oh, the failing ones confirm
6. With a holier strength of zeal!
7. Give Thou not the feeble worm
8. Helpless to the spoiler's heel!

9. Father! for Thy holy sake
10. We are spoiled and hunted thus;
11. Joyful, for Thy truth we take
12. Bonds and burthens unto us
13. Poor, and weak, and robbed of all,
14. Weary with our daily task,
15. That Thy truth may never fall
16. Through our weakness, Lord, we ask.

17. Round our fired and wasted homes
18. Flits the forest-bird unscared,
19. And at noon the wild beast comes
20. Where our frugal meal was shared;
21. For the song of praises there
22. Shrieks the crow the livelong day;
23. For the sound of evening prayer
24. Howls the evil beast of prey!

25. Sweet the songs we loved to sing
26. Underneath Thy holy sky;
27. Words and tones that used to bring
28. Tears of joy in every eye;
29. Dear the wrestling hours of prayer,
30. When we gathered knee to knee,
31. Blameless youth and hoary hair,
32. Bowed, O God, alone to Thee.

33. As Thine early children, Lord,
34. Shared their wealth and daily bread,
35. Even so, with one accord,
36. We, in love, each other fed.
37. Not with us the miser's hoard,
38. Not with us his grasping hand;
39. Equal round a common board,
40. Drew our meek and brother band!

41. Safe our quiet Eden lay
42. When the war-whoop stirred the land
43. And the Indian turned away
44. From our home his bloody hand.
45. Well that forest-ranger saw,
46. That the burthen and the curse
47. Of the white man's cruel law
48. Rested also upon us.

49. Torn apart, and driven forth
50. To our toiling hard and long,
51. Father! from the dust of earth
52. Lift we still our grateful song!
53. Grateful, that in bonds we share
54. In Thy love which maketh free;
55. Joyful, that the wrongs we bear,
56. Draw us nearer, Lord, to Thee!

57. Grateful! that where'er we toil,-
58. By Wachuset's wooded side,
59. On Nantucket's sea-worn isle,
60. Or by wild Neponset's tide,-
61. Still, in spirit, we are near,
62. And our evening hymns, which rise
63. Separate and discordant here,
64. Meet and mingle in the skies!

65. Let the scoffer scorn and mock,
66. Let the proud and evil priest
67. Rob the needy of his flock,
68. For his wine-cup and his feast,-
69. Redden not Thy bolts in store
70. Through the blackness of Thy skies?
71. For the sighing of the poor
72. Wilt Thou not, at length, arise?

73. Worn and wasted, oh! how long
74. Shall thy trodden poor complain?
75. In Thy name they bear the wrong,
76. In Thy cause the bonds of pain!
77. Melt oppression's heart of steel,
78. Let the haughty priesthood see,
79. And their blinded followers feel,
80. That in us they mock at Thee!

81. In Thy time, O Lord of hosts,
82. Stretch abroad that hand to save
83. Which of old, on Egypt's coasts,
84. Smote apart the Red Sea's wave
85. Lead us from this evil land,
86. From the spoiler set us free,
87. And once more our gathered band,
88. Heart to heart, shall worship Thee!
