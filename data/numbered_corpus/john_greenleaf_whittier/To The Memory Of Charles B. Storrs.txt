1. Thou hast fallen in thine armor,
2. Thou martyr of the Lord
3. With thy last breath crying 'Onward!'
4. And thy hand upon the sword.
5. The haughty heart derideth,
6. And the sinful lip reviles,
7. But the blessing of the perishing
8. Around thy pillow smiles!

9. When to our cup of trembling
10. The added drop is given,
11. And the long-suspended thunder
12. Falls terribly from Heaven,--
13. When a new and fearful freedom
14. Is proffered of the Lord
15. To the slow-consuming Famine,
16. The Pestilence and Sword!

17. When the refuges of Falsehood
18. Shall be swept away in wrath,
19. And the temple shall be shaken,
20. With its idol, to the earth,
21. Shall not thy words of warning
22. Be all remembered then?
23. And thy now unheeded message
24. Burn in the hearts of men?

25. Oppression's hand may scatter
26. Its nettles on thy tomb,
27. And even Christian bosoms
28. Deny thy memory room;
29. For lying lips shall torture
30. Thy mercy into crime,
31. And the slanderer shall flourish
32. As the bay-tree for a time.

33. But where the south-wind lingers
34. On Carolina's pines,
35. Or falls the careless sunbeam
36. Down Georgia's golden mines;
37. Where now beneath his burthen
38. The toiling slave is driven;
39. Where now a tyrant's mockery
40. Is offered unto Heaven;

41. Where Mammon hath its altars
42. Wet o'er with human blood,
43. And pride and lust debases
44. The workmanship of God,--
45. There shall thy praise be spoken,
46. Redeemed from Falsehood's ban,
47. When the fetters shall be broken,
48. And the slave shall be a man!

49. Joy to thy spirit, brother!
50. A thousand hearts are warm,
51. A thousand kindred bosoms
52. Are baring to the storm.
53. What though red-handed Violence
54. With secret Fraud combine?
55. The wall of fire is round us,
56. Our Present Help was thine.

57. Lo, the waking up of nations,
58. From Slavery's fatal sleep;
59. The murmur of a Universe,
60. Deep calling unto Deep!
61. Joy to thy spirit, brother!
62. On every wind of heaven
63. The onward cheer and summons
64. Of Freedom's voice is given!

65. Glory to God forever!
66. Beyond the despot's will
67. The soul of Freedom liveth
68. Imperishable still.
69. The words which thou hast uttered
70. Are of that soul a part,
71. And the good seed thou hast scattered
72. Is springing from the heart.

73. In the evil days before us,
74. And the trials yet to come,
75. In the shadow of the prison,
76. Or the cruel martyrdom,--
77. We will think of thee, O brother!
78. And thy sainted name shall be
79. In the blessing of the captive,
80. And the anthem of the free.
