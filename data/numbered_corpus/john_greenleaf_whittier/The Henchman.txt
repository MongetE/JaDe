1. My lady walks her morning round,
2. My lady's page her fleet greyhound,
3. My lady's hair the fond winds stir,
4. And all the birds make songs for her.

5. Her thrushes sing in Rathburn bowers,
6. And Rathburn side is gay with flowers;
7. But ne'er like hers, in flower or bird,
8. Was beauty seen or music heard.

9. The distance of the stars is hers;
10. The least of all her worshippers,
11. The dust beneath her dainty heel,
12. She knows not that I see or feel.

13. Oh, proud and calm!-she cannot know
14. Where'er she goes with her I go;
15. Oh, cold and fair!-she cannot guess
16. I kneel to share her hound's caress!

17. Gay knights beside her hunt and hawk,
18. I rob their ears of her sweet talk;
19. Her suitors come from east and west,
20. I steal her smiles from every guest.

21. Unheard of her, in loving words,
22. I greet her with the song of birds;
23. I reach her with her green-armed bowers,
24. I kiss her with the lips of flowers.

25. The hound and I are on her trail,
26. The wind and I uplift her veil;
27. As if the calm, cold moon she were,
28. And I the tide, I follow her.

29. As unrebuked as they, I share
30. The license of the sun and air,
31. And in a common homage hide
32. My worship from her scorn and pride.

33. World-wide apart, and yet so near,
34. I breathe her charmed atmosphere,
35. Wherein to her my service brings
36. The reverence due to holy things.

37. Her maiden pride, her haughty name,
38. My dumb devotion shall not shame;
39. The love that no return doth crave
40. To knightly levels lifts the slave,

41. No lance have I, in joust or fight,
42. To splinter in my lady's sight
43. But, at her feet, how blest were I
44. For any need of hers to die!
