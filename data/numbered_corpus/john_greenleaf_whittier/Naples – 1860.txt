1. I GIVE thee joy!—I know to thee
2. The dearest spot on earth must be
3. Where sleeps thy loved one by the summer sea;

4. Where, near her sweetest poet’s tomb,
5. The land of Virgil gave thee room
6. To lay thy flower with her perpetual bloom.

7. I know that when the sky shut down
8. Behind thee on the gleaming town,
9. On Baiae’s baths and Posilippo’s crown;

10. And, through thy tears, the mocking day
11. Burned Ischia’s mountain lines away,
12. And Capri melted in its sunny bay;

13. Through thy great farewell sorrow shot
14. The sharp pang of a bitter thought
15. That slaves must tread around that holy spot.

16. Thou knewest not the land was blest
17. In giving thy beloved rest,
18. Holding the fond hope closer to her breast,

19. That every sweet and saintly grave
20. Was freedom’s prophecy, and gave
21. The pledge of Heaven to sanctify and save.

22. That pledge is answered. To thy ear
23. The unchained city sends its cheer,
24. And, tuned to joy, the muffled bells of fear

25. Ring Victor in. The land sits free
26. And happy by the summer sea,
27. And Bourbon Naples now is Italy!

28. She smiles above her broken chain
29. The languid smile that follows pain,
30. Stretching her cramped limbs to the sun again.

31. Oh, joy for all, who hear her call
32. From gray Camaldoli’s convent wall
33. And Elmo’s towers to freedom’s carnival!

34. A new life breathes among her vines
35. And olives, like the breath of pines
36. Blown downward from the breezy Apennines.

37. Lean, O my friend, to meet that breath,
38. Rejoice as one who witnesseth
39. Beauty from ashes rise, and life from death!

40. Thy sorrow shall no more be pain,
41. Its tears shall fall in sunlit rain,
42. Writing the grave with flowers: “Arisen again!”
