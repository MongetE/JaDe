1. On the isle of Penikese,
2. Ringed about by sapphire seas,
3. Fanned by breezes salt and cool,
4. Stood the Master with his school.
5. Over sails that not in vain
6. Wooed the west-wind's steady strain,
7. Line of coast that low and far
8. Stretched its undulating bar,
9. Wings aslant along the rim
10. Of the waves they stooped to skim,
11. Rock and isle and glistening bay,
12. Fell the beautiful white day.

13. Said the Master to the youth
14. 'We have come in search of truth,
15. Trying with uncertain key
16. Door by door of mystery;
17. We are reaching, through His laws,
18. To the garment-hem of Cause,
19. Him, the endless, unbegun,
20. The Unnamable, the One
21. Light of all our light the Source,
22. Life of life, and Force of force.
23. As with fingers of the blind,
24. We are groping here to find
25. What the hieroglyphics mean
26. Of the Unseen in the seen,
27. What the Thought which underlies
28. Nature's masking and disguise,
29. What it is that hides beneath
30. Blight and bloom and birth and death.
31. By past efforts unavailing,
32. Doubt and error, loss and failing,
33. Of our weakness made aware,
34. On the threshold of our task
35. Let us light and guidance ask,
36. Let us pause in silent prayer!'

37. Then the Master in his place
38. Bowed his head a little space,
39. And the leaves by soft airs stirred,
40. Lapse of wave and cry of bird,
41. Left the solemn hush unbroken
42. Of that wordless prayer unspoken,
43. While its wish, on earth unsaid,
44. Rose to heaven interpreted.
45. As, in life's best hours, we hear
46. By the spirit's finer ear
47. His low voice within us, thus
48. The All-Father heareth us;
49. And His holy ear we pain
50. With our noisy words and vain.
51. Not for Him our violence
52. Storming at the gates of sense,
53. His the primal language, His
54. The eternal silences!

55. Even the careless heart was moved,
56. And the doubting gave assent,
57. With a gesture reverent,
58. To the Master well-beloved.
59. As thin mists are glorified
60. By the light they cannot hide,
61. All who gazed upon him saw,
62. Through its veil of tender awe,
63. How his face was still uplit
64. By the old sweet look of it.
65. Hopeful, trustful, full of cheer,
66. And the love that casts out fear.
67. Who the secret may declare
68. Of that brief, unuttered prayer?
69. Did the shade before him come
70. Of th' inevitable doom,
71. Of the end of earth so near,
72. And Eternity's new year?

73. In the lap of sheltering seas
74. Rests the isle of Penikese;
75. But the lord of the domain
76. Comes not to his own again
77. Where the eyes that follow fail,
78. On a vaster sea his sail
79. Drifts beyond our beck and hail.
80. Other lips within its bound
81. Shall the laws of life expound;
82. Other eyes from rock and shell
83. Read the world's old riddles well
84. But when breezes light and bland
85. Blow from Summer's blossomed land,
86. When the air is glad with wings,
87. And the blithe song-sparrow sings,
88. Many an eye with his still face
89. Shall the living ones displace,
90. Many an ear the word shall seek
91. He alone could fitly speak.
92. And one name forevermore
93. Shall be uttered o'er and o'er
94. By the waves that kiss the shore,
95. By the curlew's whistle sent
96. Down the cool, sea-scented air;
97. In all voices known to her,
98. Nature owns her worshipper,
99. Half in triumph, half lament.
100. Thither Love shall tearful turn,
101. Friendship pause uncovered there,
102. And the wisest reverence learn
103. From the Master's silent prayer.
