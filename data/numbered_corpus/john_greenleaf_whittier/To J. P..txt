1. John Pierpont, the eloquent preacher and poet of Boston.

2. Not as a poor requital of the joy
3. With which my childhood heard that lay of thine,
4. Which, like an echo of the song divine
5. At Bethlehem breathed above the Holy Boy,
6. Bore to my ear the Airs of Palestine,--
7. Not to the poet, but the man I bring
8. In friendship's fearless trust my offering
9. How much it lacks I feel, and thou wilt see,
10. Yet well I know that thou Last deemed with me
11. Life all too earnest, and its time too short
12. For dreamy ease and Fancy's graceful sport;
13. And girded for thy constant strife with wrong,
14. Like Nehemiah fighting while he wrought
15. The broken walls of Zion, even thy song
16. Hath a rude martial tone, a blow in every thought!
