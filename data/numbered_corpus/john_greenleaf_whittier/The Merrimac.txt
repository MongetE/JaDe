1. Stream of my fathers! sweetly still
2. The sunset rays thy valley fill;
3. Poured slantwise down the long defile,
4. Wave, wood, and spire beneath them smile.
5. I see the winding Powow fold
6. The green hill in its belt of gold,
7. And following down its wavy line,
8. Its sparkling waters blend with thine.
9. There 's not a tree upon thy side,
10. Nor rock, which thy returning tide
11. As yet hath left abrupt and stark
12. Above thy evening water-mark;
13. No calm cove with its rocky hem,
14. No isle whose emerald swells begin
15. Thy broad, smooth current; not a sail
16. Bowed to the freshening ocean gale;
17. No small boat with its busy oars,
18. Nor gray wall sloping to thy shores;
19. Nor farm-house with its maple shade,
20. Or rigid poplar colonnade,
21. But lies distinct and full in sight,
22. Beneath this gush of sunset light.
23. Centuries ago, that harbor-bar,
24. Stretching its length of foam afar,
25. And Salisbury's beach of shining sand,
26. And yonder island's wave-smoothed strand,
27. Saw the adventurer's tiny sail,
28. Flit, stooping from the eastern gale;
29. And o'er these woods and waters broke
30. The cheer from Britain's hearts of oak,
31. As brightly on the voyager's eye,
32. Weary of forest, sea, and sky,
33. Breaking the dull continuous wood,
34. The Merrimac rolled down his flood;
35. Mingling that clear pellucid brook,
36. Which channels vast Agioochook
37. When spring-time's sun and shower unlock
38. The frozen fountains of the rock,
39. And more abundant waters given
40. From that pure lake, 'The Smile of Heaven,'
41. Tributes from vale and mountain-side,-
42. With ocean's dark, eternal tide!

43. On yonder rocky cape, which braves
44. The stormy challenge of the waves,
45. Midst tangled vine and dwarfish wood,
46. The hardy Anglo-Saxon stood,
47. Planting upon the topmost crag
48. The staff of England's battle-flag;
49. And, while from out its heavy fold
50. Saint George's crimson cross unrolled,
51. Midst roll of drum and trumpet blare,
52. And weapons brandishing in air,
53. He gave to that lone promontory
54. The sweetest name in all his story;
55. Of her, the flower of Islam's daughters,
56. Whose harems look on Stamboul's waters,-
57. Who, when the chance of war had bound
58. The Moslem chain his limbs around,
59. Wreathed o'er with silk that iron chain,
60. Soothed with her smiles his hours of pain,
61. And fondly to her youthful slave
62. A dearer gift than freedom gave.

63. But look! the yellow light no more
64. Streams down on wave and verdant shore;
65. And clearly on the calm air swells
66. The twilight voice of distant bells.
67. From Ocean's bosom, white and thin,
68. The mists come slowly rolling in;
69. Hills, woods, the river's rocky rim,
70. Amidst the sea-like vapor swim,
71. While yonder lonely coast-light, set
72. Within its wave-washed minaret,
73. Half quenched, a beamless star and pale,
74. Shines dimly through its cloudy veil!

75. Home of my fathers!-I have stood
76. Where Hudson rolled his lordly flood
77. Seen sunrise rest and sunset fade
78. Along his frowning Palisade;
79. Looked down the Appalachian peak
80. On Juniata's silver streak;
81. Have seen along his valley gleam
82. The Mohawk's softly winding stream;
83. The level light of sunset shine
84. Through broad Potomac's hem of pine;
85. And autumn's rainbow-tinted banner
86. Hang lightly o'er the Susquehanna;
87. Yet wheresoe'er his step might be,
88. Thy wandering child looked back to thee!
89. Heard in his dreams thy river's sound
90. Of murmuring on its pebbly bound,
91. The unforgotten swell and roar
92. Of waves on thy familiar shore;
93. And saw, amidst the curtained gloom
94. And quiet of his lonely room,
95. Thy sunset scenes before him pass;
96. As, in Agrippa's magic glass,
97. The loved and lost arose to view,
98. Remembered groves in greenness grew,
99. Bathed still in childhood's morning dew,
100. Along whose bowers of beauty swept
101. Whatever Memory's mourners wept,
102. Sweet faces, which the charnel kept,
103. Young, gentle eyes, which long had slept;
104. And while the gazer leaned to trace,
105. More near, some dear familiar face,
106. He wept to find the vision flown,-
107. A phantom and a dream alone!
