1. O Dearly loved!
2. And worthy of our love! No more
3. Thy aged form shall rise before
4. The bushed and waiting worshiper,
5. In meek obedience utterance giving
6. To words of truth, so fresh and living,
7. That, even to the inward sense,
8. They bore unquestioned evidence
9. Of an anointed Messenger!
10. Or, bowing down thy silver hair
11. In reverent awfulness of prayer,
12. The world, its time and sense, shut out
13. The brightness of Faith's holy trance
14. Gathered upon thy countenance,
15. As if each lingering cloud of doubt,
16. The cold, dark shadows resting here
17. In Time's unluminous atmosphere,
18. Were lifted by an angel's hand,
19. And through them on thy spiritual eye
20. Shone down the blessedness on high,
21. The glory of the Better Land!

22. The oak has fallen!
23. While, meet for no good work, the vine
24. May yet its worthless branches twine,
25. Who knoweth not that with thee fell
26. A great man in our Israel?
27. Fallen, while thy loins were girded still,
28. Thy feet with Zion's dews still wet,
29. And in thy hand retaining yet
30. The pilgrim's staff and scallop-shell
31. Unharmed and safe, where, wild and free,
32. Across the Neva's cold morass
33. The breezes from the Frozen Sea
34. With winter's arrowy keenness pass;
35. Or where the unwarning tropic gale
36. Smote to the waves thy tattered sail,
37. Or where the noon-hour's fervid heat
38. Against Tahiti's mountains beat;
39. The same mysterious Hand which gave
40. Deliverance upon land and wave,
41. Tempered for thee the blasts which blew
42. Ladaga's frozen surface o'er,
43. And blessed for thee the baleful dew
44. Of evening upon Eimeo's shore,
45. Beneath this sunny heaven of ours,
46. Midst our soft airs and opening flowers
47. Hath given thee a grave!

48. His will be done,
49. Who seeth not as man, whose way
50. Is not as ours! 'T is well with thee!
51. Nor anxious doubt nor dark dismay
52. Disquieted thy closing day,
53. But, evermore, thy soul could say,
54. 'My Father careth still for me!'
55. Called from thy hearth and home,--from her,
56. The last bud on thy household tree,
57. The last dear one to minister
58. In duty and in love to thee,
59. From all which nature holdeth dear,
60. Feeble with years and worn with pain,
61. To seek our distant land again,
62. Bound in the spirit, yet unknowing
63. The things which should befall thee here,
64. Whether for labor or for death,
65. In childlike trust serenely going
66. To that last trial of thy faith!
67. Oh, far away,
68. Where never shines our Northern star
69. On that dark waste which Balboa saw
70. From Darien's mountains stretching far,
71. So strange, heaven-broad, and lone, that there,
72. With forehead to its damp wind bare,
73. He bent his mailed knee in awe;
74. In many an isle whose coral feet
75. The surges of that ocean beat,
76. In thy palm shadows, Oahu,
77. And Honolulu's silver bay,
78. Amidst Owyhee's hills of blue,
79. And taro-plains of Tooboonai,
80. Are gentle hearts, which long shall be
81. Sad as our own at thought of thee,
82. Worn sowers of Truth's holy seed,
83. Whose souls in weariness and need
84. Were strengthened and refreshed by thine.
85. For blessed by our Father's hand
86. Was thy deep love and tender care,
87. Thy ministry and fervent prayer,--
88. Grateful as Eshcol's clustered vine
89. To Israel in a weary land.

90. And they who drew
91. By thousands round thee, in the hour
92. Of prayerful waiting, hushed and deep,
93. That He who bade the islands keep
94. Silence before Him, might renew
95. Their strength with His unslumbering power,
96. They too shall mourn that thou art gone,
97. That nevermore thy aged lip
98. Shall soothe the weak, the erring warn,
99. Of those who first, rejoicing, heard
100. Through thee the Gospel's glorious word,--
101. Seals of thy true apostleship.
102. And, if the brightest diadem,
103. Whose gems of glory purely burn
104. Around the ransomed ones in bliss,
105. Be evermore reserved for them
106. Who here, through toil and sorrow, turn
107. Many to righteousness,
108. May we not think of thee as wearing
109. That star-like crown of light, and bearing,
110. Amidst Heaven's white and blissful band,
111. Th' unfading palm-branch in thy hand;
112. And joining with a seraph's tongue
113. In that new song the elders sung,
114. Ascribing to its blessed Giver
115. Thanksgiving, love, and praise forever!

116. Farewell!
117. And though the ways of Zion mourn
118. When her strong ones are called away,
119. Who like thyself have calmly borne
120. The heat and burden of the day,
121. Yet He who slumbereth not nor sleepeth
122. His ancient watch around us keepeth;
123. Still, sent from His creating hand,
124. New witnesses for Truth shall stand,
125. New instruments to sound abroad
126. The Gospel of a risen Lord;
127. To gather to the fold once more
128. The desolate and gone astray,
129. The scattered of a cloudy day,
130. And Zion's broken walls restore;
131. And, through the travail and the toil
132. Of true obedience, minister
133. Beauty for ashes, and the oil
134. Of joy for mourning, unto her!
135. So shall her holy bounds increase
136. With walls of praise and gates of peace
137. So shall the Vine, which martyr tears
138. And blood sustained in other years,
139. With fresher life be clothed upon;
140. And to the world in beauty show
141. Like the rose-plant of Jericho,
142. And glorious as Lebanon!
