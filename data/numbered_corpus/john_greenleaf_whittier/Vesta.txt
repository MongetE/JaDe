1. O CHRIST of God! whose life and death
2. Our own have reconciled,
3. Most quietly, most tenderly
4. Take home thy star-named child!

5. Thy grace is in her patient eyes,
6. Thy words are on her tongue;
7. The very silence round her seems
8. As if the angels sung.

9. Her smile is as a listening child's
10. Who hears its mother's call;
11. The lilies of Thy perfect peace
12. About her pillow fall.

13. She leans from out our clinging arms
14. To rest herself in Thine;
15. Alone to Thee, dear Lord, can we
16. Our well-beloved resign.

17. O, less for her than for ourselves
18. We bow our heads and pray;
19. Her setting star, like Bethlehem's,
20. To Thee shall point the way!
