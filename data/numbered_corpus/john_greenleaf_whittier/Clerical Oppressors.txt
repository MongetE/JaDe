1. JUST God! and these are they
2. Who minister at thine altar, God of Right!
3. Men who their hands with prayer and blessing lay
4. On Israel's Ark of light!
5. What! preach, and kidnap men?
6. Give thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?
7. Talk of thy glorious liberty, and then
8. Bolt hard the captive's door?
9. What! servants of thy own
10. Merciful Son, who came to seek and save
11. The homeless and the outcast, fettering down
12. The tasked and plundered slave!
13. Pilate and Herod, friends!
14. Chief priests and rulers, as of old, combine!
15. Just God and holy! is that church, which lends
16. Strength to the spoiler, thine?
17. Paid hypocrites, who turn
18. Judgment aside, and rob the Holy Book
19. Of those high words of truth which search and burn
20. In warning and rebuke;
21. Feed fat, ye locusts, feed!
22. And, in your tasselled pulpits, thank the Lord
23. That, from the toiling bondman's utter need,
24. Ye pile your own full board.
25. How long, O Lord! how long
26. Shall such a priesthood barter truth away,
27. And in Thy name, for robbery and wrong
28. At Thy own altars pray?
29. Is not Thy hand stretched forth
30. Visibly in the heavens, to awe and smite?
31. Shall not the living God of all the earth,
32. And heaven above, do right?
33. Woe, then, to all who grind
34. Their brethren of a common Father down!
35. To all who plunder from the immortal mind
36. Its bright and glorious crown!
37. Woe to the priesthood! woe
38. To those whose hire is with the price of blood;
39. Perverting, darkening, changing, as they go,
40. The searching truths of God!
41. Their glory and their might.
42. Shall perish; and their very names shall be
43. Vile before all the people, in the light
44. Of a world's liberty.
45. Oh, speed the moment on
46. When Wrong shall cease, and Liberty and Love
47. And Truth and Right throughout the earth be known
48. As in their home above.
