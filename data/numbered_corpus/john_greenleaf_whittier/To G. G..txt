1. AN AUTOGRAPH.

2. Graceful in name and in thyself, our river
3. None fairer saw in John Ward's pilgrim flock,
4. Proof that upon their century-rooted stock
5. The English roses bloom as fresh as ever.

6. Take the warm welcome of new friends with thee,
7. And listening to thy home's familiar chime
8. Dream that thou hearest, with it keeping time,
9. The bells on Merrimac sound across the sea.

10. Think of our thrushes, when the lark sings clear,
11. Of our sweet Mayflowers when the daisies bloom;
12. And bear to our and thy ancestral home
13. The kindly greeting of its children here.

14. Say that our love survives the severing strain;
15. That the New England, with the Old, holds fast
16. The proud, fond memories of a common past;
17. Unbroken still the ties of blood remain!
