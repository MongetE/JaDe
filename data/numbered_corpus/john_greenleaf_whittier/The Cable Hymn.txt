1. O lonely bay of Trinity,
2. O dreary shores, give ear!
3. Lean down unto the white-lipped sea
4. The voice of God to hear!

5. From world to world His couriers fly,
6. Thought-winged and shod with fire;
7. The angel of His stormy sky
8. Rides down the sunken wire.

9. What saith the herald of the Lord?
10. 'The world's long strife is done;
11. Close wedded by that mystic cord,
12. Its continents are one.

13. 'And one in heart, as one in blood,
14. Shall all her peoples be;
15. The hands of human brotherhood
16. Are clasped beneath the sea.

17. 'Through Orient seas, o'er Afric's plain
18. And Asian mountains borne,
19. The vigor of the Northern brain
20. Shall nerve the world outworn.

21. 'From clime to clime, from shore to shore,
22. Shall thrill the magic thread;
23. The new Prometheus steals once more
24. The fire that wakes the dead.'

25. Throb on, strong pulse of thunder! beat
26. From answering beach to beach;
27. Fuse nations in thy kindly heat,
28. And melt the chains of each!

29. Wild terror of the sky above,
30. Glide tamed and dumb below!
31. Bear gently, Ocean's carrier-dove,
32. Thy errands to and fro.

33. Weave on, swift shuttle of the Lord,
34. Beneath the deep so far,
35. The bridal robe of earth's accord,
36. The funeral shroud of war!

37. For lo! the fall of Ocean's wall
38. Space mocked and time outrun;
39. And round the world the thought of all
40. Is as the thought of one!

41. The poles unite, the zones agree,
42. The tongues of striving cease;
43. As on the Sea of Galilee
44. The Christ is whispering, Peace!

45. . . . . .

46. 'Glad prophecy! to this at last,'
47. The Reader said, 'shall all things come.
48. Forgotten be the bugle's blast,
49. And battle-music of the drum.

50. 'A little while the world may run
51. Its old mad way, with needle-gun
52. And iron-clad, but truth, at last, shall reign
53. The cradle-song of Christ was never sung in vain!'

54. Shifting his scattered papers, 'Here,'
55. He said, as died the faint applause,
56. 'Is something that I found last year
57. Down on the island known as Orr's.
58. I had it from a fair-haired girl
59. Who, oddly, bore the name of Pearl,
60. (As if by some droll freak of circumstance,)
61. Classic, or wellnigh so, in Harriet Stowe's romance.'
