1. Type of two mighty continents!--combining
2. The strength of Europe with the warmth and glow
3. Of Asian song and prophecy,--the shining
4. Of Orient splendors over Northern snow!
5. Who shall receive him? Who, unblushing, speak
6. Welcome to him, who, while he strove to break
7. The Austrian yoke from Magyar necks, smote off
8. At the same blow the fetters of the serf,
9. Rearing the altar of his Fatherland
10. On the firm base of freedom, and thereby
11. Lifting to Heaven a patriot's stainless hand,
12. Mocked not the God of Justice with a lie!
13. Who shall be Freedom's mouthpiece? Who shall give
14. Her welcoming cheer to the great fugitive?
15. Not he who, all her sacred trusts betraying,
16. Is scourging back to slavery's hell of pain
17. The swarthy Kossuths of our land again!
18. Not he whose utterance now from lips designed
19. The bugle-march of Liberty to wind,
20. And call her hosts beneath the breaking light,
21. The keen reveille of her morn of fight,
22. Is but the hoarse note of the blood-hound's baying,
23. The wolf's long howl behind the bondman's flight!
24. Oh for the tongue of him who lies at rest
25. In Quincy's shade of patrimonial trees,
26. Last of the Puritan tribunes and the best,
27. To lend a voice to Freedom's sympathies,
28. And hail the coming of the noblest guest
29. The Old World's wrong has given the New World of the West!
