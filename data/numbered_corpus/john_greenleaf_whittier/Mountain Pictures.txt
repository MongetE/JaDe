1. I.
2. FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET

3. Once more, O Mountains of the North, unveil
4. Your brows, and lay your cloudy mantles by
5. And once more, ere the eyes that seek ye fail,
6. Uplift against the blue walls of the sky
7. Your mighty shapes, and let the sunshine weave
8. Its golden net-work in your belting woods,
9. Smile down in rainbows from your falling floods,
10. And on your kingly brows at morn and eve
11. Set crowns of fire! So shall my soul receive
12. Haply the secret of your calm and strength,
13. Your unforgotten beauty interfuse
14. My common life, your glorious shapes and hues
15. And sun-dropped splendors at my bidding come,
16. Loom vast through dreams, and stretch in billowy length
17. From the sea-level of my lowland home!

18. They rise before me! Last night's thunder-gust
19. Roared not in vain: for where its lightnings thrust
20. Their tongues of fire, the great peaks seem so near,
21. Burned clean of mist, so starkly bold and clear,
22. I almost pause the wind in the pines to hear,
23. The loose rock's fall, the steps of browsing deer.
24. The clouds that shattered on yon slide-worn walls
25. And splintered on the rocks their spears of rain
26. Have set in play a thousand waterfalls,
27. Making the dusk and silence of the woods
28. Glad with the laughter of the chasing floods,
29. And luminous with blown spray and silver gleams,
30. While, in the vales below, the dry-lipped streams
31. Sing to the freshened meadow-lands again.
32. So, let me hope, the battle-storm that beats
33. The land with hail and fire may pass away
34. With its spent thunders at the break of day,
35. Like last night's clouds, and leave, as it retreats,
36. A greener earth and fairer sky behind,
37. Blown crystal-clear by Freedom's Northern wind!

38. II.
39. MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET.

40. I would I were a painter, for the sake
41. Of a sweet picture, and of her who led,
42. A fitting guide, with reverential tread,
43. Into that mountain mystery. First a lake
44. Tinted with sunset; next the wavy lines
45. Of far receding hills; and yet more far,
46. Monadnock lifting from his night of pines
47. His rosy forehead to the evening star.
48. Beside us, purple-zoned, Wachuset laid
49. His head against the West, whose warm light made
50. His aureole; and o'er him, sharp and clear,
51. Like a shaft of lightning in mid-launching stayed,
52. A single level cloud-line, shone upon
53. By the fierce glances of the sunken sun,
54. Menaced the darkness with its golden spear!

55. So twilight deepened round us. Still and black
56. The great woods climbed the mountain at our back;
57. And on their skirts, where yet the lingering day
58. On the shorn greenness of the clearing lay,
59. The brown old farm-house like a bird's-nest hung.
60. With home-life sounds the desert air was stirred
61. The bleat of sheep along the hill we heard,
62. The bucket plashing in the cool, sweet well,
63. The pasture-bars that clattered as they fell;
64. Dogs barked, fowls fluttered, cattle lowed; the gate
65. Of the barn-yard creaked beneath the merry weight
66. Of sun-brown children, listening, while they swung,
67. The welcome sound of supper-call to hear;
68. And down the shadowy lane, in tinklings clear,
69. The pastoral curfew of the cow-bell rung.
70. Thus soothed and pleased, our backward path we took,
71. Praising the farmer's home. He only spake,
72. Looking into the sunset o'er the lake,
73. Like one to whom the far-off is most near:
74. 'Yes, most folks think it has a pleasant look;
75. I love it for my good old mother's sake,
76. Who lived and died here in the peace of God!'
77. The lesson of his words we pondered o'er,
78. As silently we turned the eastern flank
79. Of the mountain, where its shadow deepest sank,
80. Doubling the night along our rugged road:
81. We felt that man was more than his abode,--
82. The inward life than Nature's raiment more;
83. And the warm sky, the sundown-tinted hill,
84. The forest and the lake, seemed dwarfed and dim
85. Before the saintly soul, whose human will
86. Meekly in the Eternal footsteps trod,
87. Making her homely toil and household ways
88. An earthly echo of the song of praise
89. Swelling from angel lips and harps of seraphim.
