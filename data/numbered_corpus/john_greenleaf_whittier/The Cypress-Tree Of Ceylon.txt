1. THEY sat in silent watchfulness
2. The sacred cypress-tree about,
3. And, from beneath old wrinkled brows,
4. Their failing eyes looked out.

5. Gray Age and Sickness waiting there
6. Through weary night and lingering day,--
7. Grim as the idols at their side,
8. And motionless as they.

9. Unheeded in the boughs above
10. The song of Ceylon's birds was sweet;
11. Unseen of them the island flowers
12. Bloomed brightly at their feet.

13. O'er them the tropic night-storm swept,
14. The thunder crashed on rock and hill;
15. The cloud-fire on their eyeballs blazed,
16. Yet there they waited still!

17. What was the world without to them?
18. The Moslem's sunset-call, the dance
19. Of Ceylon's maids, the passing gleam
20. Of battle-flag and lance?

21. They waited for that falling leaf
22. Of which the wandering Jogees sing:
23. Which lends once more to wintry age
24. The greenness of its spring.

25. Oh, if these poor and blinded ones
26. In trustful patience wait to feel
27. O'er torpid pulse and failing limb
28. A youthful freshness steal;

29. Shall we, who sit beneath that Tree
30. Whose healing leaves of life are shed,
31. In answer to the breath of prayer,
32. Upon the waiting head;

33. Not to restore our failing forms,
34. And build the spirit's broken shrine,
35. But on the fainting soul to shed
36. A light and life divine--

37. Shall we grow weary in our watch,
38. And murmur at the long delay?
39. Impatient of our Father's time
40. And His appointed way?

41. Or shall the stir of outward things
42. Allure and claim the Christian's eye,
43. When on the heathen watcher's ear
44. Their powerless murmurs die?

45. Alas! a deeper test of faith
46. Than prison cell or martyr's stake,
47. The self-abasing watchfulness
48. Of silent prayer may make.

49. We gird us bravely to rebuke
50. Our erring brother in the wrong,--
51. And in the ear of Pride and Power
52. Our warning voice is strong.

53. Easier to smite with Peter's sword
54. Than 'watch one hour' in humbling prayer.
55. Life's 'great things,' like the Syrian lord,
56. Our hearts can do and dare.

57. But oh! we shrink from Jordan's side,
58. From waters which alone can save;

59. And murmur for Abana's banks
60. And Pharpar's brighter wave.

61. O Thou, who in the garden's shade
62. Didst wake Thy weary ones again,
63. Who slumbered at that fearful hour
64. Forgetful of Thy pain;

65. Bend o'er us now, as over them,
66. And set our sleep-bound spirits free,
67. Nor leave us slumbering in the watch
68. Our souls should keep with Thee!
