1. WITH COPIES OF THE AUTHOR'S WRITINGS.

2. Friend of mine! whose lot was cast
3. With me in the distant past;
4. Where, like shadows flitting fast,

5. Fact and fancy, thought and theme,
6. Word and work, begin to seem
7. Like a half-remembered dream!

8. Touched by change have all things been,
9. Yet I think of thee as when
10. We had speech of lip and pen.

11. For the calm thy kindness lent
12. To a path of discontent,
13. Rough with trial and dissent;

14. Gentle words where such were few,
15. Softening blame where blame was true,
16. Praising where small praise was due;

17. For a waking dream made good,
18. For an ideal understood,
19. For thy Christian womanhood;

20. For thy marvellous gift to cull
21. From our common life and dull
22. Whatsoe'er is beautiful;

23. Thoughts and fancies, Hybla's bees
24. Dropping sweetness; true heart's-ease
25. Of congenial sympathies;--

26. Still for these I own my debt;
27. Memory, with her eyelids wet,
28. Fain would thank thee even yet!

29. And as one who scatters flowers
30. Where the Queen of May's sweet hours
31. Sits, o'ertwined with blossomed bowers,

32. In superfluous zeal bestowing
33. Gifts where gifts are overflowing,
34. So I pay the debt I'm owing.

35. To thy full thoughts, gay or sad,
36. Sunny-hued or sober clad,
37. Something of my own I add;

38. Well assured that thou wilt take
39. Even the offering which I make
40. Kindly for the giver's sake.
