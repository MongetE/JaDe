1. GEORGE FULLER

2. Haunted of Beauty, like the marvellous youth
3. Who sang Saint Agnes' Eve! How passing fair
4. Her shapes took color in thy homestead air!
5. How on thy canvas even her dreams were truth!
6. Magician! who from commonest elements
7. Called up divine ideals, clothed upon
8. By mystic lights soft blending into one
9. Womanly grace and child-like innocence.
10. Teacher I thy lesson was not given in vain.
11. Beauty is goodness; ugliness is sin;
12. Art's place is sacred: nothing foul therein
13. May crawl or tread with bestial feet profane.
14. If rightly choosing is the painter's test,
15. Thy choice, O master, ever was the best.
