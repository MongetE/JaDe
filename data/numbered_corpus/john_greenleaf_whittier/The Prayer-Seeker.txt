1. Along the aisle where prayer was made,
2. A woman, all in black arrayed,
3. Close-veiled, between the kneeling host,
4. With gliding motion of a ghost,
5. Passed to the desk, and laid thereon
6. A scroll which bore these words alone,
7. _Pray for me_!

8. Back from the place of worshipping
9. She glided like a guilty thing
10. The rustle of her draperies, stirred
11. By hurrying feet, alone was heard;
12. While, full of awe, the preacher read,
13. As out into the dark she sped:
14. '_Pray for me_!'

15. Back to the night from whence she came,
16. To unimagined grief or shame!
17. Across the threshold of that door
18. None knew the burden that she bore;
19. Alone she left the written scroll,
20. The legend of a troubled soul,--
21. _Pray for me_!

22. Glide on, poor ghost of woe or sin!
23. Thou leav'st a common need within;
24. Each bears, like thee, some nameless weight,
25. Some misery inarticulate,
26. Some secret sin, some shrouded dread,
27. Some household sorrow all unsaid.
28. _Pray for us_!
29. Pass on! The type of all thou art,
30. Sad witness to the common heart!
31. With face in veil and seal on lip,
32. In mute and strange companionship,
33. Like thee we wander to and fro,
34. Dumbly imploring as we go
35. _Pray for us_!
36. Ah, who shall pray, since he who pleads
37. Our want perchance hath greater needs?
38. Yet they who make their loss the gain
39. Of others shall not ask in vain,
40. And Heaven bends low to hear the prayer
41. Of love from lips of self-despair
42. _Pray for us_!
43. In vain remorse and fear and hate
44. Beat with bruised bands against a fate
45. Whose walls of iron only move
46. And open to the touch of love.
47. He only feels his burdens fall
48. Who, taught by suffering, pities all.
49. _Pray for us_!
50. He prayeth best who leaves unguessed
51. The mystery of another's breast.
52. Why cheeks grow pale, why eyes o'erflow,
53. Or heads are white, thou need'st not know.
54. Enough to note by many a sign
55. That every heart hath needs like thine.
56. _Pray for us_!
