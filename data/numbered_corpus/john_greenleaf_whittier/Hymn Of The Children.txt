1. Thine are all the gifts, O God!
2. Thine the broken bread;
3. Let the naked feet be shod,
4. And the starving fed.

5. Let Thy children, by Thy grace,
6. Give as they abound,
7. Till the poor have breathing-space,
8. And the lost are found.

9. Wiser than the miser's hoards
10. Is the giver's choice;
11. Sweeter than the song of birds
12. Is the thankful voice.

13. Welcome smiles on faces sad
14. As the flowers of spring;
15. Let the tender hearts be glad
16. With the joy they bring.

17. Happier for their pity's sake
18. Make their sports and plays,
19. And from lips of childhood take
20. Thy perfected praise!
