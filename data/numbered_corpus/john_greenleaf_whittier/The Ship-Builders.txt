1. THE sky is ruddy in the east,
2. The earth is gray below,
3. And, spectral in the river-mist,
4. The ship's white timbers show.
5. Then let the sounds of measured stroke
6. And grating saw begin;
7. The broad-axe to the gnarlÃ«d oak,
8. The mallet to the pin!
9. Hark! roars the bellows, blast on blast,
10. The sooty smithy jars,
11. And fire-sparks, rising far and fast,
12. Are fading with the stars.
13. All day for us the smith shall stand
14. Beside that flashing forge;
15. All day for us his heavy hand
16. The groaning anvil scourge.
17. From far-off hills, the panting team
18. For us is toiling near;
19. For us the raftsmen down the stream
20. Their island barges steer.
21. Rings out for us the axe-man's stroke
22. In forests old and still;
23. For us the century-circled oak
24. Falls crashing down his hill.
25. Up! up! in nobler toil than ours
26. No craftsmen bear a part:
27. We make of Nature's giant powers
28. The slaves of human Art.
29. Lay rib to rib and beam to beam,
30. And drive the treenails free;
31. Nor faithless joint nor yawning seam
32. Shall tempt the searching sea!
33. Where'er the keel of our good ship
34. The sea's rough field shall plough;
35. Where'er her tossing spars shall drip
36. With salt-spray caught below;
37. That ship must heed her master's beck,
38. Her helm obey his hand,
39. And seamen tread her reeling deck
40. As if they trod the land.
41. Her oaken ribs the vulture-beak
42. Of Northern ice may peel;
43. The sunken rock and coral peak
44. May grate along her keel;
45. And know we well the painted shell
46. We give to wind and wave,
47. Must float, the sailor's citadel,
48. Or sink, the sailor's grave!
49. Ho! strike away the bars and blocks,
50. And set the good ship free!
51. Why lingers on these dusty rocks
52. The young bride of the sea?
53. Look! how she moves adown the grooves,
54. In graceful beauty now!
55. How lowly on the breast she loves
56. Sinks down her virgin prow!
57. God bless-her! wheresoe'er the breeze
58. Her snowy wing shall fan,
59. Aside the frozen Hebrides,
60. Or sultry Hindostan!
61. Where'er, in mart or on the main,
62. With peaceful flag unfurled,
63. She helps to wind the silken chain
64. Of commerce round the world!
65. Speed on the ship! But let her bear
66. No merchandise of sin,
67. No groaning cargo of despair
68. Her roomy hold within;
69. No Lethean drug for Eastern lands,
70. For poison-draught for ours;
71. But honest fruits of toiling hands
72. And Nature's sun and showers.
73. Be hers the Prairie's golden grain,
74. The Desert's golden sand,
75. The clustered fruits of sunny Spain,
76. The spice of Morning-land!
77. Her pathway on the open main
78. May blessings follow free,
79. And glad hearts welcome back again
80. Her white sails from the sea!
