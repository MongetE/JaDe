1. The fourteen centuries fall away
2. Between us and the Afric saint,
3. And at his side we urge, to-day,
4. The immemorial quest and old complaint.

5. No outward sign to us is given,--
6. From sea or earth comes no reply;
7. Hushed as the warm Numidian heaven
8. He vainly questioned bends our frozen sky.

9. No victory comes of all our strife,--
10. From all we grasp the meaning slips;
11. The Sphinx sits at the gate of life,
12. With the old question on her awful lips.

13. In paths unknown we hear the feet
14. Of fear before, and guilt behind;
15. We pluck the wayside fruit, and eat
16. Ashes and dust beneath its golden rind.

17. From age to age descends unchecked
18. The sad bequest of sire to son,
19. The body's taint, the mind's defect;
20. Through every web of life the dark threads run.

21. Oh, why and whither? God knows all;
22. I only know that He is good,
23. And that whatever may befall
24. Or here or there, must be the best that could.

25. Between the dreadful cherubim
26. A Father's face I still discern,
27. As Moses looked of old on Him,
28. And saw His glory into goodness turn!

29. For He is merciful as just;
30. And so, by faith correcting sight,
31. I bow before His will, and trust
32. Howe'er they seem He doeth all things right.

33. And dare to hope that Tie will make
34. The rugged smooth, the doubtful plain;
35. His mercy never quite forsake;
36. His healing visit every realm of pain;

37. That suffering is not His revenge
38. Upon His creatures weak and frail,
39. Sent on a pathway new and strange
40. With feet that wander and with eyes that fail;

41. That, o'er the crucible of pain,
42. Watches the tender eye of Love
43. The slow transmuting of the chain
44. Whose links are iron below to gold above!

45. Ah me! we doubt the shining skies,
46. Seen through our shadows of offence,
47. And drown with our poor childish cries
48. The cradle-hymn of kindly Providence.

49. And still we love the evil cause,
50. And of the just effect complain
51. We tread upon life's broken laws,
52. And murmur at our self-inflicted pain;

53. We turn us from the light, and find
54. Our spectral shapes before us thrown,
55. As they who leave the sun behind
56. Walk in the shadows of themselves alone.

57. And scarce by will or strength of ours
58. We set our faces to the day;
59. Weak, wavering, blind, the Eternal Powers
60. Alone can turn us from ourselves away.

61. Our weakness is the strength of sin,
62. But love must needs be stronger far,
63. Outreaching all and gathering in
64. The erring spirit and the wandering star.

65. A Voice grows with the growing years;
66. Earth, hushing down her bitter cry,
67. Looks upward from her graves, and hears,
68. 'The Resurrection and the Life am I.'

69. O Love Divine!--whose constant beam
70. Shines on the eyes that will not see,
71. And waits to bless us, while we dream
72. Thou leavest us because we turn from thee!

73. All souls that struggle and aspire,
74. All hearts of prayer by thee are lit;
75. And, dim or clear, thy tongues of fire
76. On dusky tribes and twilight centuries sit.

77. Nor bounds, nor clime, nor creed thou know'st,
78. Wide as our need thy favors fall;
79. The white wings of the Holy Ghost
80. Stoop, seen or unseen, o'er the heads of all.

81. O Beauty, old yet ever new!
82. Eternal Voice, and Inward Word,
83. The Logos of the Greek and Jew,
84. The old sphere-music which the Samian heard!

85. Truth, which the sage and prophet saw,
86. Long sought without, but found within,
87. The Law of Love beyond all law,
88. The Life o'erflooding mortal death and sin!

89. Shine on us with the light which glowed
90. Upon the trance-bound shepherd's way.
91. Who saw the Darkness overflowed
92. And drowned by tides of everlasting Day.

93. Shine, light of God!--make broad thy scope
94. To all who sin and suffer; more
95. And better than we dare to hope
96. With Heaven's compassion make our longings poor!
