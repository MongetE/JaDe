2. GIFT from the cold and silent Past!
3. A relic to the present cast,
4. Left on the ever-changing strand
5. Of shifting and unstable sand,
6. Which wastes beneath the steady chime
7. And beating of the waves of Time!
8. Who from its bed of primal rock
9. First wrenched thy dark, unshapely block?
10. Whose hand, of curious skill untaught,
11. Thy rude and savage outline wrought?
12. The waters of my native stream
13. Are glancing in the sun's warm beam;
14. From sail-urged keel and flashing oar
15. The circles widen to its shore;
16. And cultured field and peopled town
17. Slope to its willowed margin down.
18. Yet, while this morning breeze is bringing
19. The home-life sound of school-bells ringing,
20. And rolling wheel, and rapid jar
21. Of the fire-winged and steedless car,
22. And voices from the wayside near
23. Come quick and blended on my ear,--
24. A spell is in this old gray stone,
25. My thoughts are with the Past alone!

26. A change! -- The steepled town no more
27. Stretches along the sail-thronged shore;
28. Like palace-domes in sunset's cloud,
29. Fade sun-gilt spire and mansion proud:
30. Spectrally rising where they stood,
31. I see the old, primeval wood;
32. Dark, shadow-like, on either hand
33. I see its solemn waste expand;
34. It climbs the green and cultured hill,
35. It arches o'er the valley's rill,
36. And leans from cliff and crag to throw
37. Its wild arms o'er the stream below.
38. Unchanged, alone, the same bright river
39. Flows on, as it will flow forever!
40. I listen, and I hear the low
41. Soft ripple where its water go;
42. I hear behind the panther's cry,
43. The wild-bird's scream goes thrilling by,
44. And shyly on the river's brink
45. The deer is stooping down to drink.

46. But hard! -- from wood and rock flung back,
47. What sound come up the Merrimac?
48. What sea-worn barks are those which throw
49. The light spray from each rushing prow?
50. Have they not in the North Sea's blast
51. Bowed to the waves the straining mast?
52. Their frozen sails the low, pale sun
53. Of ThulÃ«'s night has shone upon;
54. Flapped by the sea-wind's gusty sweep
55. Round icy drift, and headland steep.
56. Wild Jutland's wives and Lochlin's daughters
57. Have watched them fading o'er the waters,
58. Lessening through driving mist and spray,
59. Like white-winged sea-birds on their way!

60. Onward they glide, -- and now I view
61. Their iron-armed and stalwart crew;
62. Joy glistens in each wild blue eye,
63. Turned to green earth and summer sky.
64. Each broad, seamed breast has cast aside
65. Its cumbering vest of shaggy hide;
66. Bared to the sun and soft warm air,
67. Streams back the Northmen's yellow hair.
68. I see the gleam of axe and spear,
69. A sound of smitten shields I hear,
70. Keeping a harsh and fitting time
71. To Saga's chant, and Runic rhyme;
72. Such lays as Zetland's Scald has sung,
73. His gray and naked isles among;
74. Or mutter low at midnight hour
75. Round Odin's mossy stone of power.
76. The wolf beneath the Arctic moon
77. Has answered to that startling rune;
78. The Gael has heard its stormy swell,
79. The light Frank knows its summons well;
80. Iona's sable-stoled Culdee
81. Has heard it sounding o'er the sea,
82. And swept, with hoary beard and hair,
83. His altar's foot in trembling prayer!

84. 'T is past, -- the 'wildering vision dies
85. In darkness on my dreaming eyes!
86. The forest vanishes in air,
87. Hill-slope and vale lie starkly bare;
88. I hear the common tread of men,
89. And hum of work-day life again;
90. The mystic relic seems alone
91. A broken mass of common stone;
92. And if it be the chiselled limb
93. Of Berserker or idol grim,
94. A fragment of Valhalla's Thor,
95. The stormy Viking's god of War,
96. Or Praga of the Runic lay,
97. Or love-awakening Siona,
98. I know not, -- for no graven line,
99. Nor Druid mark, nor Runic sign,
100. Is left me here, by which to trace
101. Its name, or origin, or place.
102. Yet, for this vision of the Past,
103. This glance upon its darkness cast,
104. My spirit bows in gratitude
105. Before the Giver of all good,
106. Who fashioned so the human mind,
107. That, from the waste of Time behind,
108. A simple stone, or mound of earth,
109. Can summon the departed forth;
110. Quicken the Past to life again,
111. The Present lose in what hath been,
112. And in their primal freshness show
113. The buried forms of long ago.
114. As if a portion of that Thought
115. By which the Eternal will is wrought,
116. Whose impulse fills anew with breath
117. The frozen solitude of Death,
118. To mortal mind were sometimes lent,
119. To mortal musing sometimes sent,
120. To whisper -- even when it seems
121. But Memory's fantasy of dreams --
122. Through the mind's waste of woe and sin,
123. Of an immortal origin!
