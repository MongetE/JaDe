1. Of A Virginia Slave Mother To Her Daughters Sold Into Southern Bondage

2. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone
3. To the rice-swamp dank and lone.
4. Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings
5. Where the noisome insect stings
6. Where the fever demon strews
7. Poison with the falling dews
8. Where the sickly sunbeams glare
9. Through the hot and misty air;
10. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
11. To the rice-swamp dank and lone,
12. From Virginia's hills and waters;
13. Woe is me, my stolen daughters!
14. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone
15. To the rice-swamp dank and lone
16. There no mother's eye is near them,
17. There no mother's ear can hear them;
18. Never, when the torturing lash
19. Seams their back with many a gash
20. Shall a mother's kindness bless them
21. Or a mother's arms caress them.
22. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
23. To the rice-swamp dank and lone,
24. From Virginia's hills and waters;
25. Woe is me, my stolen daughters!
26. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
27. To the rice-swamp dank and lone,
28. Oh, when weary, sad, and slow,
29. From the fields at night they go
30. Faint with toil, and racked with pain
31. To their cheerless homes again,
32. There no brother's voice shall greet them
33. There no father's welcome meet them.
34. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
35. To the rice-swamp dank and lone,
36. From Virginia's hills and waters;
37. Woe is me, my stolen daughters!
38. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
39. To the rice-swamp dank and lone
40. From the tree whose shadow lay
41. On their childhood's place of play;
42. From the cool sprmg where they drank;
43. Rock, and hill, and rivulet bank;
44. From the solemn house of prayer,
45. And the holy counsels there;
46. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
47. To the rice-swamp dank and lone,
48. From Virginia's hills and waters;
49. Woe is me, my stolen daughters!
50. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
51. To the rice-swamp dank and lone;
52. Toiling through the weary day,
53. And at night the spoiler's prey.
54. Oh, that they had earlier died,
55. Sleeping calmly, side by side,
56. Where the tyrant's power is o'er
57. And the fetter galls no more!
58. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
59. To the rice-swamp dank and lone;
60. From Virginia's hills and waters
61. Woe is me, my stolen daughters!
62. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
63. To the rice-swamp dank and lone;
64. By the holy love He beareth;
65. By the bruised reed He spareth;
66. Oh, may He, to whom alone
67. All their cruel wrongs are known,
68. Still their hope and refuge prove,
69. With a more than mother's love.
70. Gone, gone, -- sold and gone,
71. To the rice-swamp dank and lone,
72. From Virginia's hills and waters;
73. Woe is me, my stolen daughters!
