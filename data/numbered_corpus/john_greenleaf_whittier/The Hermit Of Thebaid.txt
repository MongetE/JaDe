1. O strong, upwelling prayers of faith,
2. From inmost founts of life ye start,-
3. The spirit's pulse, the vital breath
4. Of soul and heart!

5. From pastoral toil, from traffic's din,
6. Alone, in crowds, at home, abroad,
7. Unheard of man, ye enter in
8. The ear of God.

9. Ye brook no forced and measured tasks,
10. Nor weary rote, nor formal chains;
11. The simple heart, that freely asks
12. In love, obtains.

13. For man the living temple is
14. The mercy-seat and cherubim,
15. And all the holy mysteries,
16. He bears with him.

17. And most avails the prayer of love,
18. Which, wordless, shapes itself in needs,
19. And wearies Heaven for naught above
20. Our common needs.

21. Which brings to God's all-perfect will
22. That trust of His undoubting child
23. Whereby all seeming good and ill
24. Are reconciled.

25. And, seeking not for special signs
26. Of favor, is content to fall
27. Within the providence which shines
28. And rains on all.

29. Alone, the Thebaid hermit leaned
30. At noontime o'er the sacred word.
31. Was it an angel or a fiend
32. Whose voice be heard?

33. It broke the desert's hush of awe,
34. A human utterance, sweet and mild;
35. And, looking up, the hermit saw
36. A little child.

37. A child, with wonder-widened eyes,
38. O'erawed and troubled by the sight
39. Of hot, red sands, and brazen skies,
40. And anchorite.

41. ''What dost thou here, poor man? No shade
42. Of cool, green palms, nor grass, nor well,
43. Nor corn, nor vines.' The hermit said
44. 'With God I dwell.

45. 'Alone with Him in this great calm,
46. I live not by the outward sense;
47. My Nile his love, my sheltering palm
48. His providence.'

49. The child gazed round him. 'Does God live
50. Here only?-where the desert's rim
51. Is green with corn, at morn and eve,
52. We pray to Him.

53. 'My brother tills beside the Nile
54. His little field; beneath the leaves
55. My sisters sit and spin, the while
56. My mother weaves.

57. 'And when the millet's ripe heads fall,
58. And all the bean-field hangs in pod,
59. My mother smiles, and, says that all
60. Are gifts from God.'

61. Adown the hermit's wasted cheeks
62. Glistened the flow of human tears;
63. 'Dear Lord!' he said, 'Thy angel speaks,
64. Thy servant hears.'

65. Within his arms the child he took,
66. And thought of home and life with men;
67. And all his pilgrim feet forsook
68. Returned again.

69. The palmy shadows cool and long,
70. The eyes that smiled through lavish locks,
71. Home's cradle-hymn and harvest-song,
72. And bleat of flocks.

73. 'O child!' he said, 'thou teachest me
74. There is no place where God is not;
75. That love will make, where'er it be,
76. A holy spot.'

77. He rose from off the desert sand,
78. And, leaning on his staff of thorn,
79. Went with the young child hand in hand,
80. Like night with morn.

81. They crossed the desert's burning line,
82. And heard the palm-tree's rustling fan,
83. The Nile-bird's cry, the low of kine,
84. And voice of man.

85. Unquestioning, his childish guide
86. He followed, as the small hand led
87. To where a woman, gentle-eyed,
88. Her distaff fed.

89. She rose, she clasped her truant boy,
90. She thanked the stranger with her eyes;
91. The hermit gazed in doubt and joy
92. And dumb surprise.

93. And to!-with sudden warmth and light
94. A tender memory thrilled his frame;
95. New-born, the world-lost anchorite
96. A man became.

97. 'O sister of El Zara's race,
98. Behold me!-had we not one mother?'
99. She gazed into the stranger's face
100. 'Thou art my brother!'

101. 'And when to share our evening meal,
102. She calls the stranger at the door,
103. She says God fills the hands that deal
104. Food to the poor.'

105. 'O kin of blood! Thy life of use
106. And patient trust is more than mine;
107. And wiser than the gray recluse
108. This child of thine.

109. 'For, taught of him whom God hath sent,
110. That toil is praise, and love is prayer,
111. I come, life's cares and pains content
112. With thee to share.'

113. Even as his foot the threshold crossed,
114. The hermit's better life began;
115. Its holiest saint the Thebaid lost,
116. And found a man!
