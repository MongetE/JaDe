1. I have not felt, o'er seas of sand,
2. The rocking of the desert bark;
3. Nor laved at Hebron's fount my hand,
4. By Hebron's palm-trees cool and dark;
5. Nor pitched my tent at even-fall,
6. On dust where Job of old has lain,
7. Nor dreamed beneath its canvas wall,
8. The dream of Jacob o'er again.

9. One vast world-page remains unread;
10. How shine the stars in Chaldea's sky,
11. How sounds the reverent pilgrim's tread,
12. How beats the heart with God so nigh
13. How round gray arch and column lone
14. The spirit of the old time broods,
15. And sighs in all the winds that moan
16. Along the sandy solitudes!

17. In thy tall cedars, Lebanon,
18. I have not heard the nations' cries,
19. Nor seen thy eagles stooping down
20. Where buried Tyre in ruin lies.
21. The Christian's prayer I have not said
22. In Tadmor's temples of decay,
23. Nor startled, with my dreary tread,
24. The waste where Memnon's empire lay.

25. Nor have I, from thy hallowed tide,
26. O Jordan! heard the low lament,
27. Like that sad wail along thy side
28. Which Israel's mournful prophet sent!
29. Nor thrilled within that grotto lone
30. Where, deep in night, the Bard of Kings
31. Felt hands of fire direct his own,
32. And sweep for God the conscious strings.

33. I have not climbed to Olivet,
34. Nor laid me where my Saviour lay,
35. And left His trace of tears as yet
36. By angel eyes unwept away;
37. Nor watched, at midnight's solemn time,
38. The garden where His prayer and groan,
39. Wrung by His sorrow and our crime,
40. Rose to One listening ear alone.

41. I have not kissed the rock-hewn grot
42. Where in His mother's arms He lay,
43. Nor knelt upon the sacred spot
44. Where last His footsteps pressed the clay;
45. Nor looked on that sad mountain head,
46. Nor smote my sinful breast, where wide
47. His arms to fold the world He spread,
48. And bowed His head to bless-and died!
