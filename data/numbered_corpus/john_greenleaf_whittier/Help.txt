1. Dream not, O Soul, that easy is the task
2. Thus set before thee. If it proves at length,
3. As well it may, beyond thy natural strength,
4. Faint not, despair not. As a child may ask
5. A father, pray the Everlasting Good
6. For light and guidance midst the subtle snares
7. Of sin thick planted in life's thoroughfares,
8. For spiritual strength and moral hardihood;
9. Still listening, through the noise of time and sense,
10. To the still whisper of the Inward Word;
11. Bitter in blame, sweet in approval heard,
12. Itself its own confirming evidence
13. To health of soul a voice to cheer and please,
14. To guilt the wrath of the Eumenides.
