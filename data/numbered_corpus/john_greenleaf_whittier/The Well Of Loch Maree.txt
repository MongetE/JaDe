1. Calm on the breast of Loch Maree
2. A little isle reposes;
3. A shadow woven of the oak
4. And willow o'er it closes.

5. Within, a Druid's mound is seen,
6. Set round with stony warders;
7. A fountain, gushing through the turf,
8. Flows o'er its grassy borders.

9. And whoso bathes therein his brow,
10. With care or madness burning,
11. Feels once again his healthful thought
12. And sense of peace returning.

13. O restless heart and fevered brain,
14. Unquiet and unstable,
15. That holy well of Loch Maree
16. Is more than idle fable!

17. Life's changes vex, its discords stun,
18. Its glaring sunshine blindeth,
19. And blest is he who on his way
20. That fount of healing findeth!

21. The shadows of a humbled will
22. And contrite heart are o'er it;
23. Go read its legend, 'TRUST IN GOD,'
24. On Faith's white stones before it.
