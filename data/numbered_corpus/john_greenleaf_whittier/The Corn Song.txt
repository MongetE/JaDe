1. HEAP HIGH the farmer’s wintry hoard!
2. Heap high the golden corn!
3. No richer gift has Autumn poured
4. From out her lavish horn!
5. Let other lands, exulting, glean
6. The apple from the pine,
7. The orange from its glossy green,
8. The cluster from the vine;

9. We better love the hardy gift
10. Our rugged vales bestow,
11. To cheer us when the storm shall drift
12. Our harvest-fields with snow.

13. Through vales of grass and meads of flowers
14. Our ploughs their furrows made,
15. While on the hills the sun and showers
16. Of changeful April played.

17. We dropped the seed o’er hill and plain
18. Beneath the sun of May,
19. And frightened from our sprouting grain
20. The robber crows away.

21. All through the long, bright days of June
22. Its leaves grew green and fair,
23. And waved in hot midsummer’s noon
24. Its soft and yellow hair.

25. And now, with autumn’s moonlit eves,
26. Its harvest-time has come,
27. We pluck away the frosted leaves,
28. And bear the treasure home.

29. There, richer than the fabled gift
30. Apollo showered of old,
31. Fair hands the broken grain shall sift,
32. And knead its meal of gold.

33. Let vapid idlers loll in silk
34. Around their costly board;
35. Give us the bowl of samp and milk,
36. By homespun beauty poured!

37. Where’er the wide old kitchen hearth
38. Sends up its smoky curls,
39. Who will not thank the kindly earth
40. And bless our farmer girls?

41. Then shame on all the proud and vain,
42. Whose folly laughs to scorn
43. The blessing of our hardy grain,
44. Our wealth of golden corn!

45. Let earth withhold her goodly root,
46. Let mildew blight the rye,
47. Give to the worm the orchard’s fruit,
48. The wheat-field to the fly:

49. But let the good old crop adorn
50. The hills our fathers trod;
51. Still let us, for His golden corn,
52. Send up our thanks to God!
