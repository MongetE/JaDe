1. Weep not too much, my darling;
2. Sigh not too oft for me;
3. Say not the face of Nature
4. Has lost its charm for thee.
5. I have enough of anguish
6. In my own breast alone;
7. Thou canst not ease the burden, Love,
8. By adding still thine own.
9. I know the faith and fervour
10. Of that true heart of thine;
11. But I would have it hopeful
12. As thou wouldst render mine.
13. At night, when I lie waking,
14. More soothing it will be
15. To say 'She slumbers calmly now,'
16. Than say 'She weeps for me.'

17. When through the prison grating
18. The holy moonbeams shine,
19. And I am wildly longing
20. To see the orb divine
21. Not crossed, deformed, and sullied
22. By those relentless bars
23. That will not show the crescent moon,
24. And scarce the twinkling stars,

25. It is my only comfort
26. To think, that unto thee
27. The sight is not forbidden --
28. The face of heaven is free.
29. If I could think Zerona
30. Is gazing upward now --
31. Is gazing with a tearless eye
32. A calm unruffled brow;

33. That moon upon her spirit
34. Sheds sweet, celestial balm, --
35. The thought, like Angel's whisper,
36. My misery would calm.
37. And when, at early morning,
38. A faint flush comes to me,
39. Reflected from those glowing skies
40. I almost weep to see;

41. Or when I catch the murmur
42. Of gently swaying trees,
43. Or hear the louder swelling
44. Of the soul-inspiring breeze,
45. And pant to feel its freshness
46. Upon my burning brow,
47. Or sigh to see the twinkling leaf,
48. And watch the waving bough;

49. If, from these fruitless yearnings
50. Thou wouldst deliver me,
51. Say that the charms of Nature
52. Are lovely still to thee;
53. While I am thus repining,
54. O! let me but believe,
55. 'These pleasures are not lost to her,'
56. And I will cease to grieve.

57. O, scorn not Nature's bounties!
58. My soul partakes with thee.
59. Drink bliss from all her fountains,
60. Drink for thyself and me!
61. Say not, 'My soul is buried
62. In dungeon gloom with thine;'
63. But say, 'His heart is here with me;
64. His spirit drinks with mine.'

65. A.E.
