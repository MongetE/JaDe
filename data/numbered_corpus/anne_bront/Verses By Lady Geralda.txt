1. Why, when I hear the stormy breath
2. Of the wild winter wind
3. Rushing o'er the mountain heath,
4. Does sadness fill my mind?
5. For long ago I loved to lie
6. Upon the pathless moor,
7. To hear the wild wind rushing by
8. With never ceasing roar;

9. Its sound was music then to me;
10. Its wild and lofty voice
11. Made by heart beat exultingly
12. And my whole soul rejoice.

13. But now, how different is the sound?
14. It takes another tone,
15. And howls along the barren ground
16. With melancholy moan.

17. Why does the warm light of the sun
18. No longer cheer my eyes?
19. And why is all the beauty gone
20. From rosy morning skies?

21. Beneath this lone and dreary hill
22. There is a lovely vale;
23. The purling of a crystal rill,
24. The sighing of the gale,

25. The sweet voice of the singing bird,
26. The wind among the trees,
27. Are ever in that valley heard;
28. While every passing breeze

29. Is loaded with the pleasant scent
30. Of wild and lovely flowers.
31. To yonder vales I often went
32. To pass my evening hours.

33. Last evening when I wandered there
34. To soothe my weary heart,
35. Why did the unexpected tear
36. From my sad eyelid start?

37. Why did the trees, the buds, the stream
38. Sing forth so joylessly?
39. And why did all the valley seem
40. So sadly changed to me?

41. I plucked a primrose young and pale
42. That grew beneath a tree
43. And then I hastened from the vale
44. Silent and thoughtfully.

45. Soon I was near my lofty home,
46. But when I cast my eye
47. Upon that flower so fair and lone
48. Why did I heave a sigh?

49. I thought of taking it again
50. To the valley where it grew.
51. But soon I spurned that thought as vain
52. And weak and childish too.

53. And then I cast that flower away
54. To die and wither there;
55. But when I found it dead today
56. Why did I shed a tear?

57. O why are things so changed to me?
58. What gave me joy before
59. Now fills my heart with misery,
60. And nature smiles no more.

61. And why are all the beauties gone
62. From this my native hill?
63. Alas! my heart is changed alone:
64. Nature is constant still.

65. For when the heart is free from care,
66. Whatever meets the eye
67. Is bright, and every sound we hear
68. Is full of melody.

69. The sweetest strain, the wildest wind,
70. The murmur of a stream,
71. To the sad and weary mind
72. Like doleful death knells seem.

73. Father! thou hast long been dead,
74. Mother! thou art gone,
75. Brother! thou art far away,
76. And I am left alone.

77. Long before my mother died
78. I was sad and lone,
79. And when she departed too
80. Every joy was flown.

81. But the world's before me now,
82. Why should I despair?
83. I will not spend my days in vain,
84. I will not linger here!

85. There is still a cherished hope
86. To cheer me on my way;
87. It is burning in my heart
88. With a feeble ray.

89. I will cheer the feeble spark
90. And raise it to a flame;
91. And it shall light me through the world,
92. And lead me on to fame.

93. I leave thee then, my childhood's home,
94. For all thy joys are gone;
95. I leave thee through the world to roam
96. In search of fair renown,

97. From such a hopeless home to part
98. Is happiness to me,
99. For nought can charm my weary heart
100. Except activity.
