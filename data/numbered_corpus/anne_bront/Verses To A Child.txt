1. 1

2. O raise those eyes to me again
3. And smile again so joyously,
4. And fear not, love; it was not pain
5. Nor grief that drew these tears from me;
6. Beloved child, thou canst not tell
7. The thoughts that in my bosom dwell
8. Whene'er I look on thee!

9. 2

10. Thou knowest not that a glance of thine
11. Can bring back long departed years
12. And that thy blue eyes' magic shine
13. Can overflow my own with tears,
14. And that each feature soft and fair
15. And every curl of golden hair,
16. Some sweet remembrance bears.

17. 3

18. Just then thou didst recall to me
19. A distant long forgotten scene,
20. One smile, and one sweet word from thee
21. Dispelled the years that rolled between;
22. I was a little child again,
23. And every after joy and pain
24. Seemed never to have been.

25. 4

26. Tall forest trees waved over me,
27. To hide me from the heat of day,
28. And by my side a child like thee
29. Among the summer flowerets lay.
30. He was thy sire, thou merry child.
31. Like thee he spoke, like thee he smiled,
32. Like thee he used to play.

33. 5

34. O those were calm and happy days,
35. We loved each other fondly then;
36. But human love too soon decays,
37. And ours can never bloom again.
38. I never thought to see the day
39. When Florian's friendship would decay
40. Like those of colder men.

41. 6

42. Now, Flora, thou hast but begun
43. To sail on life's deceitful sea,
44. O do not err as I have done,
45. For I have trusted foolishly;
46. The faith of every friend I loved
47. I never doubted till I proved
48. Their heart's inconstancy.

49. 7

50. 'Tis mournful to look back upon
51. Those long departed joys and cares,
52. But I will weep since thou alone
53. Art witness to my streaming tears.
54. This lingering love will not depart,
55. I cannot banish from my heart
56. The friend of childish years.

57. 8

58. But though thy father loves me not,
59. Yet I shall still be loved by thee,
60. And though I am by him forgot,
61. Say wilt thou not remember me!
62. I will not cause thy heart to ache;
63. For thy regretted father's sake
64. I'll love and cherish thee.

65. Alexandrina Zenobia
