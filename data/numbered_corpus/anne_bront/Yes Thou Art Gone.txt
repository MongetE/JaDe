1. Yes, thou art gone! and never more
2. Thy sunny smile shall gladden me;
3. But I may pass the old church door,
4. And pace the floor that covers thee,
5. May stand upon the cold, damp stone,
6. And think that, frozen, lies below
7. The lightest heart that I have known,
8. The kindest I shall ever know.

9. Yet, though I cannot see thee more,
10. 'Tis still a comfort to have seen;
11. And though thy transient life is o'er,
12. 'Tis sweet to think that thou hast been;

13. To think a soul so near divine,
14. Within a form, so angel fair,
15. United to a heart like thine,
16. Has gladdened once our humble sphere.

17. Acton
