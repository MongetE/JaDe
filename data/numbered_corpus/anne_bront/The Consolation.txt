1. Though bleak these woods and damp the ground
2. With fallen leaves so thickly strewn,
3. And cold the wind that wanders round
4. With wild and melancholy moan,
5. There is a friendly roof I know
6. Might shield me from the wintry blast;
7. There is a fire whose ruddy glow
8. Will cheer me for my wanderings past.

9. And so, though still where'er I roam
10. Cold stranger glances meet my eye,
11. Though when my spirit sinks in woe
12. Unheeded swells the unbidden sigh,

13. Though solitude endured too long
14. Bids youthful joys too soon decay,
15. Makes mirth a stranger to my tongue
16. And overclouds my noon of day,

17. When kindly thoughts that would have way
18. Flow back discouraged to my breast
19. I know there is, though far away
20. A home where heart and soul may rest.

21. Warm hands are there that clasped in mine
22. The warmer heart will not belie,
23. While mirth and truth and friendship shine
24. In smiling lip and earnest eye.

25. The ice that gathers round my heart
26. May there be thawed; and sweetly then
27. The joys of youth that now depart
28. Will come to cheer my soul again.

29. Though far I roam, this thought shall be
30. My hope, my comfort everywhere;
31. While such a home remains to me
32. My heart shall never know despair.

33. Hespera Caverndel
