1. 'Maiden, thou wert thoughtless once
2. Of beauty or of grace,
3. Simple and homely in attire
4. Careless of form and face.
5. Then whence this change, and why so oft
6. Dost smooth thy hazel hair?
7. And wherefore deck thy youthful form
8. With such unwearied care?
9. 'Tell us ­- and cease to tire our ears
10. With yonder hackneyed strain ­-
11. Why wilt thou play those simple tunes
12. So often o'er again?'
13. 'Nay, gentle friends, I can but say
14. That childhood's thoughts are gone.
15. Each year its own new feelings brings
16. And years move swiftly on,

17. And for these little simple airs,
18. I love to play them o'er ­-
19. So much I dare not promise now
20. To play them never more.'
21. I answered and it was enough;
22. They turned them to depart;
23. They could not read my secret thoughts
24. Nor see my throbbing heart.

25. I've noticed many a youthful form
26. Upon whose changeful face
27. The inmost workings of the soul
28. The gazer's eye might trace.
29. The speaking eye, the changing lip,
30. The ready blushing cheek,
31. The smiling or beclouded brow
32. Their different feelings speak.

33. But, thank God! you might gaze on mine
34. For hours and never know
35. The secret changes of my soul
36. From joy to bitter woe.
37. Last night, as we sat round the fire
38. Conversing merrily,
39. We heard without approaching steps
40. Of one well known to me.

41. There was no trembling in my voice,
42. No blush upon my cheek,
43. No lustrous sparkle in my eyes,
44. Of hope or joy to speak;
45. But O my spirit burned within,
46. My heart beat thick and fast.
47. He came not nigh ­- he went away
48. And then my joy was past.

49. And yet my comrades marked it not,
50. My voice was still the same;
51. They saw me smile, and o'er my face ­-
52. No signs of sadness came;
53. They little knew my hidden thoughts
54. And they will never know
55. The anguish of my drooping heart,
56. The bitter aching woe!
