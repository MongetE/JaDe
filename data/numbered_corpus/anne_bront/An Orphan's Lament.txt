1. She's gone -- and twice the summer's sun
2. Has gilt Regina's towers,
3. And melted wild Angora's snows,
4. And warmed Exina's bowers.
5. The flowerets twice on hill and dale
6. Have bloomed and died away,
7. And twice the rustling forest leaves
8. Have fallen to decay,

9. And thrice stern winter's icy hand
10. Has checked the river's flow,
11. And three times o'er the mountains thrown
12. His spotless robe of snow.

13. Two summers springs and autumns sad
14. Three winters cold and grey --
15. And is it then so long ago
16. That wild November day!

17. They say such tears as children weep
18. Will soon be dried away,
19. That childish grief however strong
20. Is only for a day,

21. And parted friends how dear soe'er
22. Will soon forgotten be;
23. It may be so with other hearts,
24. It is not thus with me.

25. My mother, thou wilt weep no more
26. For thou art gone above,
27. But can I ever cease to mourn
28. Thy good and fervent love?

29. While that was mine the world to me
30. Was sunshine bright and fair;
31. No feeling rose within my heart
32. But thou couldst read it there.

33. And thou couldst feel for all my joys
34. And all my childish cares
35. And never weary of my play
36. Or scorn my foolish fears.

37. Beneath thy sweet maternal smile
38. All pain and sorrow fled,
39. And even the very tears were sweet
40. Upon thy bosom shed.

41. Thy loss can never be repaired;
42. I shall not know again
43. While life remains, the peaceful joy
44. That filled my spirit then.

45. Where shall I find a heart like thine
46. While life remains to me,
47. And where shall I bestow the love
48. I ever bore for thee?

49. A.H.
