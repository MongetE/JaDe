1. What though the sun had left my sky;
2. To save me from despair
3. The blessed moon arose on high,
4. And shone serenely there.
5. I watched her, with a tearful gaze,
6. Rise slowly o'er the hill,
7. While through the dim horizon's haze
8. Her light gleamed faint and chill.

9. I thought such wan and lifeless beams
10. Could ne'er my heart repay,
11. For the bright sun's most transient gleams
12. That cheered me through the day:

13. But as above that mist's control
14. She rose, and brighter shone,
15. I felt her light upon my soul;
16. But now -- that light is gone!

17. Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,
18. And I was darkling left,
19. All in the cold and gloomy night,
20. Of light and hope bereft:

21. Until, methought, a little star
22. Shone forth with trembling ray,
23. To cheer me with its light afar --
24. But that, too, passed away.

25. Anon, an earthly meteor blazed
26. The gloomy darkness through;
27. I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed --
28. But that soon vanished too!

29. And darker, drearier fell the night
30. Upon my spirit then; --
31. But what is that faint struggling light?
32. Is it the Moon again?

33. Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam,
34. And bid these clouds depart,
35. And let her soft celestial beam
36. Restore my fainting heart!
