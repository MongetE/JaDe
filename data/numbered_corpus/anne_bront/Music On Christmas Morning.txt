1. Music I love -­ but never strain
2. Could kindle raptures so divine,
3. So grief assuage, so conquer pain,
4. And rouse this pensive heart of mine -­
5. As that we hear on Christmas morn,
6. Upon the wintry breezes borne.
7. Though Darkness still her empire keep,
8. And hours must pass, ere morning break;
9. From troubled dreams, or slumbers deep,
10. That music kindly bids us wake:
11. It calls us, with an angel's voice,
12. To wake, and worship, and rejoice;

13. To greet with joy the glorious morn,
14. Which angels welcomed long ago,
15. When our redeeming Lord was born,
16. To bring the light of Heaven below;
17. The Powers of Darkness to dispel,
18. And rescue Earth from Death and Hell.

19. While listening to that sacred strain,
20. My raptured spirit soars on high;
21. I seem to hear those songs again
22. Resounding through the open sky,
23. That kindled such divine delight,
24. In those who watched their flocks by night.

25. With them, I celebrate His birth -­
26. Glory to God, in highest Heaven,
27. Good-will to men, and peace on Earth,
28. To us a Saviour-king is given;
29. Our God is come to claim His own,
30. And Satan's power is overthrown!

31. A sinless God, for sinful men,
32. Descends to suffer and to bleed;
33. Hell must renounce its empire then;
34. The price is paid, the world is freed,
35. And Satan's self must now confess,
36. That Christ has earned a Right to bless:

37. Now holy Peace may smile from heaven,
38. And heavenly Truth from earth shall spring:
39. The captive's galling bonds are riven,
40. For our Redeemer is our king;
41. And He that gave his blood for men
42. Will lead us home to God again.
