1. I mourn with thee and yet rejoice
2. That thou shouldst sorrow so;
3. With Angel choirs I join my voice
4. To bless the sinner's woe.
5. Though friends and kindred turn away
6. And laugh thy grief to scorn,
7. I hear the great Redeemer say
8. 'Blessed are ye that mourn'.

9. Hold on thy course nor deem it strange
10. That earthly cords are riven.
11. Man may lament the wondrous change
12. But 'There is joy in Heaven'!
