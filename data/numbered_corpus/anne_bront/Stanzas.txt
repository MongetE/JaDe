1. Oh, weep not, love! each tear that springs
2. In those dear eyes of thine,
3. To me a keener suffering brings,
4. Than if they flowed from mine.
5. And do not droop! however drear
6. The fate awaiting thee;
7. For my sake combat pain and care,
8. And cherish life for me!

9. I do not fear thy love will fail;
10. Thy faith is true, I know;
11. But, oh, my love! thy strength is frail
12. For such a life of woe.

13. Were't not for this, I well could trace
14. (Though banished long from thee,)
15. Life's rugged path, and boldly face
16. The storms that threaten me.

17. Fear not for me -­ I've steeled my mind
18. Sorrow and strife to greet;
19. Joy with my love I leave behind,
20. Care with my friends I meet.

21. A mother's sad reproachful eye,
22. A father's scowling brow -­
23. But he may frown and she may sigh:
24. I will not break my vow!

25. I love my mother, I revere
26. My sire, but fear not me­
27. Believe that Death alone can tear
28. This faithful heart from thee.

29. Acton
