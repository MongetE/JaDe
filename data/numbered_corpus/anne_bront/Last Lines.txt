1. Jan 7th

2. A dreadful darkness closes in
3. On my bewildered mind;
4. O let me suffer and not sin,
5. Be tortured yet resigned.

6. Through all this world of whelming mist
7. Still let me look to Thee,
8. And give me courage to resist
9. The Tempter till he flee.

10. Weary I am -- O give me strength
11. And leave me not to faint;
12. Say Thou wilt comfort me at length
13. And pity my complaint.

14. I've begged to serve Thee heart and soul,
15. To sacrifice to Thee
16. No niggard portion, but the whole
17. Of my identity.

18. I hoped amid the brave and strong
19. My portioned task might lie,
20. To toil amid the labouring throng
21. With purpose pure and high.

22. But Thou hast fixed another part,
23. And Thou hast fixed it well;
24. I said so with my breaking heart
25. When first the anguish fell.

26. For Thou hast taken my delight
27. And hope of life away,
28. And bid me watch the painful night
29. And wait the weary day.

30. The hope and the delight were Thine;
31. I bless Thee for their loan;
32. I gave Thee while I deemed them mine
33. Too little thanks, I own.

34. Shall I with joy Thy blessings share
35. And not endure their loss?
36. Or hope the martyr's crown to wear
37. And cast away the cross?

38. These weary hours will not be lost,
39. These days of passive misery,
40. These nights of darkness anguish tost
41. If I can fix my heart on Thee.

42. Weak and weary though I lie,
43. Crushed with sorrow, worn with pain,
44. Still I may lift to Heaven mine eyes
45. And strive and labour not in vain,

46. That inward strife against the sins
47. That ever wait on suffering;
48. To watch and strike where first begins
49. Each ill that would corruption bring,

50. That secret labour to sustain
51. With humble patience every blow,
52. To gather fortitude from pain
53. And hope and holiness from woe.

54. Thus let me serve Thee from my heart
55. Whatever be my written fate,
56. Whether thus early to depart
57. Or yet awhile to wait.

58. If Thou shouldst bring me back to life
59. More humbled I should be;
60. More wise, more strengthened for the strife,
61. More apt to lean on Thee.

62. Should Death be standing at the gate
63. Thus should I keep my vow;
64. But, Lord, whate'er my future fate
65. So let me serve Thee now.

66. Finished. Jan. 28, 1849.
