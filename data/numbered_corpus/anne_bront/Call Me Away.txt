1. Call me away; there's nothing here,
2. That wins my soul to stay;
3. Then let me leave this prospect drear,
4. And hasten far away.
5. To our beloved land I'll flee,
6. Our land of thought and soul,
7. Where I have roved so oft with thee,
8. Beyond the world's control.

9. I'll sit and watch those ancient trees,
10. Those Scotch firs dark and high;
11. I'll listen to the eerie breeze,
12. Among their branches sigh.

13. The glorious moon shines far above;
14. How soft her radiance falls,
15. On snowy heights, and rock, and grove;
16. And yonder palace walls!

17. Who stands beneath yon fir trees high?
18. A youth both slight and fair,
19. Whose bright and restless azure eye
20. Proclaims him known to care,
21. Though fair that brow, it is not smooth;
22. Though small those features, yet in sooth
23. Stern passion has been there.

24. Now on the peaceful moon are fixed
25. Those eyes so glistening bright,
26. But trembling teardrops hang betwixt,
27. And dim the blessed light.

28. Though late the hour, and keen the blast,
29. That whistles round him now,
30. Those raven locks are backward cast,
31. To cool his burning brow.

32. His hands above his heaving breast
33. Are clasped in agony --
34. 'O Father! Father! let me rest!
35. And call my soul to thee!

36. I know 'tis weakness thus to pray;
37. But all this cankering care --
38. This doubt tormenting night and day
39. Is more than I can bear!

40. With none to comfort, none to guide
41. And none to strengthen me.
42. Since thou my only friend hast died --
43. I've pined to follow thee!
44. Since thou hast died! And did he live
45. What comfort could his counsel give --
46. To one forlorn like me?

47. Would he my Idol's form adore --
48. Her soul, her glance, her tone?
49. And say, "Forget for ever more
50. Her kindred and thine own;
51. Let dreams of her thy peace destroy,
52. Leave every other hope and joy
53. And live for her alone"?'

54. He starts, he smiles, and dries the tears,
55. Still glistening on his cheek,
56. The lady of his soul appears,
57. And hark! I hear her speak --

58. 'Aye, dry thy tears; thou wilt not weep --
59. While I am by thy side --
60. Our foes all day their watch may keep
61. But cannot thus divide
62. Such hearts as ours; and we tonight
63. Together in the clear moon's light
64. Their malice will deride.

65. No fear our present bliss shall blast
66. And sorrow we'll defy.
67. Do thou forget the dreary past,
68. The dreadful future I.'

69. Forget it? Yes, while thou art by
70. I think of nought but thee,
71. 'Tis only when thou art not nigh
72. Remembrance tortures me.

73. But such a lofty soul to find,
74. And such a heart as thine,
75. In such a glorious form enshrined
76. And still to call thee mine --
77. Would be for earth too great a bliss,
78. Without a taint of woe like this,
79. Then why should I repine?
