1. 'O cast away your sorrow; --
2. A while, at least, be gay!
3. If grief must come tomorrow,
4. At least, be glad today!
5. 'How can you still be sighing
6. When smiles are everywhere?
7. The little birds are flying
8. So blithely through the air;

9. 'The sunshine glows so brightly
10. O'er all the blooming earth;
11. And every heart beats lightly, --
12. Each face is full of mirth.'

13. 'I always feel the deepest gloom
14. When day most brightly shines:
15. When Nature shows the fairest bloom,
16. My spirit most repines;

17. 'For, in the brightest noontide glow,
18. The dungeon's light is dim;
19. Though freshest winds around us blow,
20. No breath can visit him.

21. 'If he must sit in twilight gloom,
22. Can I enjoy the sight
23. Of mountains clad in purple bloom,
24. And rocks in sunshine bright? --

25. 'My heart may well be desolate, --
26. These tears may well arise
27. While prison wall and iron grate
28. Oppress his weary eyes.'

29. 'But think of him tomorrow,
30. And join your comrades now; --
31. That constant cloud of sorrow
32. Ill suits so young a brow.

33. 'Hark, how their merry voices
34. Are sounding far and near!
35. While all the world rejoices
36. Can you sit moping here?'

37. 'When others' hearts most lightly bound
38. Mine feels the most oppressed;
39. When smiling faces greet me round
40. My sorrow will not rest:

41. 'I think of him whose faintest smile
42. Was sunshine to my heart,
43. Whose lightest word could care beguile
44. And blissful thoughts impart;

45. 'I think how he would bless that sun,
46. And love this glorious scene;
47. I think of all that has been done,
48. And all that might have been.

49. 'Those sparkling eyes, that blessed me so,
50. Are dim with weeping now;
51. And blighted hope and burning woe
52. Have ploughed that marble brow.

53. 'What waste of youth, what hopes destroyed,
54. What days of pining care,
55. What weary nights of comfort void
56. Art thou condemned to bear!

57. 'O! if my love must suffer so --
58. And wholly for my sake --
59. What marvel that my tears should flow, --
60. Or that my heart should break!'

61. Zerona
