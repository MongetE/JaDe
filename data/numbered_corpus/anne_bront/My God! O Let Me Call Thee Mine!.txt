1. My God! O let me call Thee mine!
2. Weak wretched sinner though I be,
3. My trembling soul would fain be Thine,
4. My feeble faith still clings to Thee,
5. My feeble faith still clings to Thee.
6. Not only for the past I grieve,
7. The future fills me with dismay;
8. Unless Thou hasten to relieve,
9. I know my heart will fall away,
10. I know my heart will fall away.

11. I cannot say my faith is strong,
12. I dare not hope my love is great;
13. But strength and love to Thee belong,
14. O, do not leave me desolate!
15. O, do not leave me desolate!

16. I know I owe my all to Thee,
17. O, take this heart I cannot give.
18. Do Thou my Strength my Saviour be;
19. And make me to Thy glory live!And make me to Thy glory live!
