1. That summer sun, whose genial glow
2. Now cheers my drooping spirit so
3. Must cold and distant be,
4. And only light our northern clime
5. With feeble ray, before the time
6. I long so much to see.
7. And this soft whispering breeze that now
8. So gently cools my fevered brow,
9. This too, alas, must turn --
10. To a wild blast whose icy dart
11. Pierces and chills me to the heart,
12. Before I cease to mourn.

13. And these bright flowers I love so well,
14. Verbena, rose and sweet bluebell,
15. Must droop and die away.
16. Those thick green leaves with all their shade
17. And rustling music, they must fade
18. And every one decay.

19. But if the sunny summer time
20. And woods and meadows in their prime
21. Are sweet to them that roam --
22. Far sweeter is the winter bare
23. With long dark nights and landscapes drear
24. To them that are at Home!
