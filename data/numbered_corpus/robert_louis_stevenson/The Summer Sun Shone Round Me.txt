1. THE summer sun shone round me,
2. The folded valley lay
3. In a stream of sun and odour,
4. That sultry summer day.

5. The tall trees stood in the sunlight
6. As still as still could be,
7. But the deep grass sighed and rustled
8. And bowed and beckoned me.

9. The deep grass moved and whispered
10. And bowed and brushed my face.
11. It whispered in the sunshine:
12. "The winter comes apace."
