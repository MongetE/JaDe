1. What are you able to build with your blocks?
2. Castles and palaces, temples and docks.
3. Rain may keep raining, and others go roam,
4. But I can be happy and building at home.

5. Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea,
6. There I'll establish a city for me:
7. A kirk and a mill and a palace beside,
8. And a harbor as well where my vessels may ride.

9. Great is the palace with pillar and wall,
10. A sort of a tower on top of it all,
11. And steps coming down in an orderly way
12. To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay.

13. This one is sailing and that one is moored:
14. Hark to the song of the sailors on board!
15. And see on the steps of my palace, the kings
16. Coming and going with presents and things!
