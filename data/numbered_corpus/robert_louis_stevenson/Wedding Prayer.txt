1. Lord, behold our family here assembled.
2. We thank you for this place in which we dwell,
3. for the love that unites us,
4. for the peace accorded us this day,
5. for the hope with which we expect the morrow,
6. for the health, the work, the food,
7. and the bright skies that make our lives delightful;
8. for our friends in all parts of the earth.
9. Amen
