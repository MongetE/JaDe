1. The lamps now glitter down the street;
2. Faintly sound the falling feet;
3. And the blue even slowly falls
4. About the garden trees and walls.

5. Now in the falling of the gloom
6. The red fire paints the empty room:
7. And warmly on the roof it looks,
8. And flickers on the back of books.

9. Armies march by tower and spire
10. Of cities blazing, in the fire;--
11. Till as I gaze with staring eyes,
12. The armies fall, the lustre dies.

13. Then once again the glow returns;
14. Again the phantom city burns;
15. And down the red-hot valley, lo!
16. The phantom armies marching go!

17. Blinking embers, tell me true
18. Where are those armies marching to,
19. And what the burning city is
20. That crumbles in your furnaces!
