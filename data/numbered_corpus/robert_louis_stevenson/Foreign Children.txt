2. Little frosty Eskimo,
3. Little Turk or Japanee,
4. Oh! don't you wish that you were me?
5. You have seen the scarlet trees
6. And the lions over seas;
7. You have eaten ostrich eggs,
8. And turned the turtle off their legs.

9. Such a life is very fine,
10. But it's not so nice as mine:
11. You must often as you trod,
12. Have wearied NOT to be abroad.

13. You have curious things to eat,
14. I am fed on proper meat;
15. You must dwell upon the foam,
16. But I am safe and live at home.
17. Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
18. Little frosty Eskimo,
