1. SINCE years ago for evermore
2. My cedar ship I drew to shore;
3. And to the road and riverbed
4. And the green, nodding reeds, I said
5. Mine ignorant and last farewell:
6. Now with content at home I dwell,
7. And now divide my sluggish life
8. Betwixt my verses and my wife:
9. In vain; for when the lamp is lit
10. And by the laughing fire I sit,
11. Still with the tattered atlas spread
12. Interminable roads I tread.
