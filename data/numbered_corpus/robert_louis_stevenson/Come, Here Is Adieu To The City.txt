1. COME, here is adieu to the city
2. And hurrah for the country again.
3. The broad road lies before me
4. Watered with last night's rain.
5. The timbered country woos me
6. With many a high and bough;
7. And again in the shining fallows
8. The ploughman follows the plough.

9. The whole year's sweat and study,
10. And the whole year's sowing time,
11. Comes now to the perfect harvest,
12. And ripens now into rhyme.
13. For we that sow in the Autumn,
14. We reap our grain in the Spring,
15. And we that go sowing and weeping
16. Return to reap and sing.
