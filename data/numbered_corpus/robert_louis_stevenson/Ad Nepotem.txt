2. We're door by door, by Flora's temple dome;
3. And in the country, still conjoined by fate,
4. Behold our villas standing gate by gate),
5. Thou hast a daughter, dearer far than life -
6. Thy image and the image of thy wife.
7. Thy image and thy wife's, and be it so!

10. And lose the prime of thy Falernian?
11. Hoard casks of money, if to hoard be thine;
12. But let thy daughter drink a younger wine!
13. Let her go rich and wise, in silk and fur;

14. Lay down a { bin that shall }  grow old with her;
15. { vintage to }

16. But thou, meantime, the while the batch is sound,
17. With pleased companions pass the bowl around;
18. Nor let the childless only taste delights,
19. For Fathers also may enjoy their nights.
