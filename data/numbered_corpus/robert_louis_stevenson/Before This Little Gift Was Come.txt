1. BEFORE this little gift was come
2. The little owner had made haste for home;
3. And from the door of where the eternal dwell,
4. Looked back on human things and smiled farewell.
5. O may this grief remain the only one!
6. O may our house be still a garrison
7. Of smiling children, and for evermore
8. The tune of little feet be heard along the floor!
