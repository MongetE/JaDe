1. I NOW, O friend, whom noiselessly the snows
2. Settle around, and whose small chamber grows
3. Dusk as the sloping window takes its load:

4. * * * * *

5. The kindly hill, as to complete our hap,
6. Has ta'en us in the shelter of her lap;
7. Well sheltered in our slender grove of trees
8. And ring of walls, we sit between her knees;
9. A disused quarry, paved with rose plots, hung
10. With clematis, the barren womb whence sprung
11. The crow-stepped house itself, that now far seen
12. Stands, like a bather, to the neck in green.
13. A disused quarry, furnished with a seat
14. Sacred to pipes and meditation meet
15. For such a sunny and retired nook.
16. There in the clear, warm mornings many a book
17. Has vied with the fair prospect of the hills
18. That, vale on vale, rough brae on brae, upfills
19. Halfway to the zenith all the vacant sky
20. To keep my loose attention. . . .
21. Horace has sat with me whole mornings through:
22. And Montaigne gossiped, fairly false and true;
23. And chattering Pepys, and a few beside
24. That suit the easy vein, the quiet tide,
25. The calm and certain stay of garden-life,
26. Far sunk from all the thunderous roar of strife.
27. There is about the small secluded place
28. A garnish of old times; a certain grace
29. Of pensive memories lays about the braes:
30. The old chestnuts gossip tales of bygone days.
31. Here, where some wandering preacher, blest Lazil,
32. Perhaps, or Peden, on the middle hill
33. Had made his secret church, in rain or snow,
34. He cheers the chosen residue from woe.
35. All night the doors stood open, come who might,
36. The hounded kebbock mat the mud all night.
37. Nor are there wanting later tales; of how
38. Prince Charlie's Highlanders . . .

39. * * * * *

40. I have had talents, too.  In life's first hour
41. God crowned with benefits my childish head.
42. Flower after flower, I plucked them; flower by flower
43. Cast them behind me, ruined, withered, dead.
44. Full many a shining godhead disappeared.
45. From the bright rank that once adorned her brow
46. The old child's Olympus

47. * * * * *

48. Gone are the fair old dreams, and one by one,
49. As, one by one, the means to reach them went,
50. As, one by one, the stars in riot and disgrace,
51. I squandered what . . .

52. There shut the door, alas! on many a hope
53. Too many;
54. My face is set to the autumnal slope,
55. Where the loud winds shall . . .

56. There shut the door, alas! on many a hope,
57. And yet some hopes remain that shall decide
58. My rest of years and down the autumnal slope.

59. * * * * *

60. Gone are the quiet twilight dreams that I
61. Loved, as all men have loved them; gone!
62. I have great dreams, and still they stir my soul on high -
63. Dreams of the knight's stout heart and tempered will.
64. Not in Elysian lands they take their way;
65. Not as of yore across the gay champaign,
66. Towards some dream city, towered . . .
67. and my . . .
68. The path winds forth before me, sweet and plain,
69. Not now; but though beneath a stone-grey sky
70. November's russet woodlands toss and wail,
71. Still the white road goes thro' them, still may I,
72. Strong in new purpose, God, may still prevail.

73. * * * * *

74. I and my like, improvident sailors!

75. * * * * *

76. At whose light fall awaking, all my heart
77. Grew populous with gracious, favoured thought,
78. And all night long thereafter, hour by hour,
79. The pageant of dead love before my eyes
80. Went proudly, and old hopes with downcast head
81. Followed like Kings, subdued in Rome's imperial hour,
82. Followed the car; and I . . .
