1. The friendly cow all red and white,
2. I love with all my heart:
3. She gives me cream with all her might,
4. To eat with apple-tart.

5. She wanders lowing here and there,
6. And yet she cannot stray,
7. All in the pleasant open air,
8. The pleasant light of day;

9. And blown by all the winds that pass
10. And wet with all the showers,
11. She walks among the meadow grass
12. And eats the meadow flowers.
