1. Down by a shining water well
2. I found a very little dell,
3. No higher than my head.
4. The heather and the gorse about
5. In summer bloom were coming out,
6. Some yellow and some red.

7. I called the little pool a sea;
8. The little hills were big to me;
9. For I am very small.
10. I made a boat, I made a town,
11. I searched the caverns up and down,
12. And named them one and all.

13. And all about was mine, I said,
14. The little sparrows overhead,
15. The little minnows too.
16. This was the world and I was king;
17. For me the bees came by to sing,
18. For me the swallows flew.

19. I played there were no deeper seas,
20. Nor any wider plains than these,
21. Nor other kings than me.
22. At last I heard my mother call
23. Out from the house at evenfall,
24. To call me home to tea.

25. And I must rise and leave my dell,
26. And leave my dimpled water well,
27. And leave my heather blooms.
28. Alas! and as my home I neared,
29. How very big my nurse appeared.
30. How great and cool the rooms!
