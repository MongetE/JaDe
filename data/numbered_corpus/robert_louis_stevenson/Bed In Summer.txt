1. In winter I get up at night
2. And dress by yellow candle-light.
3. In summer quite the other way,
4. I have to go to bed by day.

5. I have to go to bed and see
6. The birds still hopping on the tree,
7. Or hear the grown-up people's feet
8. Still going past me in the street.

9. And does it not seem hard to you,
10. When all the sky is clear and blue,
11. And I should like so much to play,
12. To have to go to bed by day?
