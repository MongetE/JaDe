1. WITH caws and chirrupings, the woods
2. In this thin sun rejoice.
3. The Psalm seems but the little kirk
4. That sings with its own voice.

5. The cloud-rifts share their amber light
6. With the surface of the mere -
7. I think the very stones are glad
8. To feel each other near.

9. Once more my whole heart leaps and swells
10. And gushes o'er with glee;
11. The fingers of the sun and shade
12. Touch music stops in me.

13. Now fancy paints that bygone day
14. When you were here, my fair -
15. The whole lake rang with rapid skates
16. In the windless winter air.

17. You leaned to me, I leaned to you,
18. Our course was smooth as flight -
19. We steered - a heel-touch to the left,
20. A heel-touch to the right.

21. We swung our way through flying men,
22. Your hand lay fast in mine:
23. We saw the shifting crowd dispart,
24. The level ice-reach shine.

25. I swear by yon swan-travelled lake,
26. By yon calm hill above,
27. I swear had we been drowned that day
28. We had been drowned in love.
