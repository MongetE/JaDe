1. The brilliant kernel of the night,
2. The flaming lightroom circles me:
3. I sit within a blaze of light

4. Held high above the dusky sea.
5. Far off the surf doth break and roar
6. Along bleak miles of moonlit shore,

7. Where through the tides the tumbling wave
8. Falls in an avalanche of foam
9. And drives its churned waters home
10. Up many an undercliff and cave.
