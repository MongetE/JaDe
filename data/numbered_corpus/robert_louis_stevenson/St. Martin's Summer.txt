1. AS swallows turning backward
2. When half-way o'er the sea,
3. At one word's trumpet summons
4. They came again to me -
5. The hopes I had forgotten
6. Came back again to me.

7. I know not which to credit,
8. O lady of my heart!
9. Your eyes that bade me linger,
10. Your words that bade us part -
11. I know not which to credit,
12. My reason or my heart.

13. But be my hopes rewarded,
14. Or be they but in vain,
15. I have dreamed a golden vision,
16. I have gathered in the grain -
17. I have dreamed a golden vision,
18. I have not lived in vain.
