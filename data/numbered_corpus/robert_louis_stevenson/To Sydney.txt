1. NOT thine where marble-still and white
2. Old statues share the tempered light
3. And mock the uneven modern flight,
4. But in the stream
5. Of daily sorrow and delight
6. To seek a theme.

7. I too, O friend, have steeled my heart
8. Boldly to choose the better part,
9. To leave the beaten ways of art,
10. And wholly free
11. To dare, beyond the scanty chart,
12. The deeper sea.

13. All vain restrictions left behind,
14. Frail bark! I loose my anchored mind
15. And large, before the prosperous wind
16. Desert the strand -
17. A new Columbus sworn to find
18. The morning land.

19. Nor too ambitious, friend.  To thee
20. I own my weakness.  Not for me
21. To sing the enfranchised nations' glee,
22. Or count the cost
23. Of warships foundered far at sea
24. And battles lost.

25. High on the far-seen, sunny hills,
26. Morning-content my bosom fills;
27. Well-pleased, I trace the wandering rills
28. And learn their birth.
29. Far off, the clash of sovereign wills
30. May shake the earth.

31. The nimble circuit of the wheel,
32. The uncertain poise of merchant weal,
33. Heaven of famine, fire and steel
34. When nations fall;
35. These, heedful, from afar I feel -
36. I mark them all.

37. But not, my friend, not these I sing,
38. My voice shall fill a narrower ring.
39. Tired souls, that flag upon the wing,
40. I seek to cheer:
41. Brave wines to strengthen hope I bring,
42. Life's cantineer!

43. Some song that shall be suppling oil
44. To weary muscles strained with toil,
45. Shall hearten for the daily moil,
46. Or widely read
47. Make sweet for him that tills the soil
48. His daily bread.

49. Such songs in my flushed hours I dream
50. (High thought) instead of armour gleam
51. Or warrior cantos ream by ream
52. To load the shelves -
53. Songs with a lilt of words, that seem
54. To sing themselves.
