1. IF you see this song, my dear,
2. And last year's toast,
3. I'm confoundedly in fear
4. You'll be serious and severe
5. About the boast.

6. Blame not that I sought such aid
7. To cure regret.
8. I was then so lowly laid
9. I used all the Gasconnade
10. That I could get.

11. Being snubbed is somewhat smart,
12. Believe, my sweet;
13. And I needed all my art
14. To restore my broken heart
15. To its conceit.

16. Come and smile, dear, and forget
17. I boasted so,
18. I apologise - regret -
19. It was all a jest; - and - yet -
20. I do not know.
