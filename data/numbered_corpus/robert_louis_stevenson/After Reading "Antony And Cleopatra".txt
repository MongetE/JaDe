1. AS when the hunt by holt and field
2. Drives on with horn and strife,
3. Hunger of hopeless things pursues
4. Our spirits throughout life.

5. The sea's roar fills us aching full
6. Of objectless desire -
7. The sea's roar, and the white moon-shine,
8. And the reddening of the fire.

9. Who talks to me of reason now?
10. It would be more delight
11. To have died in Cleopatra's arms
12. Than be alive to-night.
