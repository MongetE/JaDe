1. Birds all the summer day
2. Flutter and quarrel
3. Here in the arbour-like
4. Tent of the laurel.

5. Here in the fork
6. The brown nest is seated;
7. For little blue eggs
8. The mother keeps heated.

9. While we stand watching her
10. Staring like gabies,
11. Safe in each egg are the
12. Bird's little babies.

13. Soon the frail eggs they shall
14. Chip, and upspringing
15. Make all the April woods
16. Merry with singing.

17. Younger than we are,
18. O children, and frailer,
19. Soon in the blue air they'll be,
20. Singer and sailor.

21. We, so much older,
22. Taller and stronger,
23. We shall look down on the
24. Birdies no longer.

25. They shall go flying
26. With musical speeches
27. High overhead in the
28. Tops of the beeches.

29. In spite of our wisdom
30. And sensible talking,
31. We on our feet must go
32. Plodding and walking.
