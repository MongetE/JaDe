1. FLOWER god, god of the spring, beautiful, bountiful,
2. Cold-dyed shield in the sky, lover of versicles,
3. Here I wander in April
4. Cold, grey-headed; and still to my
5. Heart, Spring comes with a bound, Spring the deliverer,
6. Spring, song-leader in woods, chorally resonant;
7. Spring, flower-planter in meadows,
8. Child-conductor in willowy
9. Fields deep dotted with bloom, daisies and crocuses:
10. Here that child from his heart drinks of eternity:
11. O child, happy are children!
12. She still smiles on their innocence,
13. She, dear mother in God, fostering violets,
14. Fills earth full of her scents, voices and violins:
15. Thus one cunning in music
16. Wakes old chords in the memory:
17. Thus fair earth in the Spring leads her performances.
18. One more touch of the bow, smell of the virginal
19. Green - one more, and my bosom
20. Feels new life with an ecstasy.
