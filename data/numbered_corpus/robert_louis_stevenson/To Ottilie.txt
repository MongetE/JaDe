1. YOU remember, I suppose,
2. How the August sun arose,
3. And how his face
4. Woke to trill and carolette
5. All the cages that were set
6. About the place.

7. In the tender morning light
8. All around lay strange and bright
9. And still and sweet,
10. And the gray doves unafraid
11. Went their morning promenade
12. Along the street.
