1. GOD gave to me a child in part,
2. Yet wholly gave the father's heart:
3. Child of my soul, O whither now,
4. Unborn, unmothered, goest thou?

5. You came, you went, and no man wist;
6. Hapless, my child, no breast you kist;
7. On no dear knees, a privileged babbler, clomb,
8. Nor knew the kindly feel of home.

9. My voice may reach you, O my dear-
10. A father's voice perhaps the child may hear;
11. And, pitying, you may turn your view
12. On that poor father whom you never knew.

13. Alas! alone he sits, who then,
14. Immortal among mortal men,
15. Sat hand in hand with love, and all day through
16. With your dear mother wondered over you.
