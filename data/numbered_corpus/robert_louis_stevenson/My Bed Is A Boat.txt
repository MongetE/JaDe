1. My bed is like a little boat;
2. Nurse helps me in when I embark;
3. She girds me in my sailor's coat
4. And starts me in the dark.

5. At night I go on board and say
6. Good-night to all my friends on shore;
7. I shut my eyes and sail away
8. And see and hear no more.

9. And sometimes things to bed I take,
10. As prudent sailors have to do;
11. Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
12. Perhaps a toy or two.

13. All night across the dark we steer;
14. But when the day returns at last,
15. Safe in my room beside the pier,
16. I find my vessel fast.
