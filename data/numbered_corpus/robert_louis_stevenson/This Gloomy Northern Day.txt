1. THIS gloomy northern day,
2. Or this yet gloomier night,
3. Has moved a something high
4. In my cold heart; and I,
5. That do not often pray,
6. Would pray to-night.

7. And first on Thee I call
8. For bread, O God of might!
9. Enough of bread for all, -
10. That through the famished town
11. Cold hunger may lie down
12. With none to-night.

13. I pray for hope no less,
14. Strong-sinewed hope, O Lord,
15. That to the struggling young
16. May preach with brazen tongue
17. Stout Labour, high success,
18. And bright reward.

19. And last, O Lord, I pray
20. For hearts resigned and bold
21. To trudge the dusty way -
22. Hearts stored with song and joke
23. And warmer than a cloak
24. Against the cold.

25. If nothing else he had,
26. He who has this, has all.
27. This comforts under pain;
28. This, through the stinging rain,
29. Keeps ragamuffin glad
30. Behind the wall.

31. This makes the sanded inn
32. A palace for a Prince,
33. And this, when griefs begin
34. And cruel fate annoys,
35. Can bring to mind the joys
36. Of ages since.
