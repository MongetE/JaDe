1. AS one who having wandered all night long
2. In a perplexed forest, comes at length
3. In the first hours, about the matin song,
4. And when the sun uprises in his strength,
5. To the fringed margin of the wood, and sees,
6. Gazing afar before him, many a mile
7. Of falling country, many fields and trees,
8. And cities and bright streams and far-off Ocean's smile:

9. I, O Melampus, halting, stand at gaze:
10. I, liberated, look abroad on life,
11. Love, and distress, and dusty travelling ways,
12. The steersman's helm, the surgeon's helpful knife,
13. On the lone ploughman's earth-upturning share,
14. The revelry of cities and the sound
15. Of seas, and mountain-tops aloof in air,
16. And of the circling earth the unsupported round:

17. I, looking, wonder: I, intent, adore;
18. And, O Melampus, reaching forth my hands
19. In adoration, cry aloud and soar
20. In spirit, high above the supine lands
21. And the low caves of mortal things, and flee
22. To the last fields of the universe untrod,
23. Where is no man, nor any earth, nor sea,
24. And the contented soul is all alone with God.
