1. Dark brown is the river,
2. Golden is the sand.
3. It flows along for ever,
4. With trees on either hand.

5. Green leaves a-floating,
6. Castles of the foam,
7. Boats of mine a-boating -
8. Where will all come home?

9. On goes the river
10. And out past the mill,
11. Away down the valley,
12. Away down the hill.

13. Away down the river,
14. A hundred miles or more,
15. Other little children
16. Shall bring my boats ashore.
