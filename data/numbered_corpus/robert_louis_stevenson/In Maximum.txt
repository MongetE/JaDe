1. WOULDST thou be free?  I think it not, indeed;
2. But if thou wouldst, attend this simple rede:
3. When quite contented    }thou canst dine at home
4. Thou shall be free when }
5. And drink a small wine of the march of Rome;
6. When thou canst see unmoved thy neighbour's plate,
7. And wear my threadbare toga in the gate;
8. When thou hast learned to love a small abode,
9. And not to choose a mistress A LA MODE:
10. When thus contained and bridled thou shalt be,
11. Then, Maximus, then first shalt thou be free.
