1. So shall this book wax like unto a well,
2. Fairy with mirrored flowers about the brim,
3. Or like some tarn that wailing curlews skim,
4. Glassing the sallow uplands or brown fell;
5. And so, as men go down into a dell
6. (Weary with noon) to find relief and shade,
7. When on the uneasy sick-bed we are laid,
8. We shall go down into thy book, and tell
9. The leaves, once blank, to build again for us
10. Old summer dead and ruined, and the time
11. Of later autumn with the corn in stook.
12. So shalt thou stint the meagre winter thus
13. Of his projected triumph, and the rime
14. Shall melt before the sunshine in thy book.
