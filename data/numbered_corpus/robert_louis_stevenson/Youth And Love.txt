1. To the heart of youth the world is a highwayside.
2. Passing for ever, he fares; and on either hand,
3. Deep in the gardens golden pavilions hide,
4. Nestle in orchard bloom, and far on the level land
5. Call him with lighted lamp in the eventide.

6. Thick as the stars at night when the moon is down,
7. Pleasures assail him. He to his nobler fate
8. Fares; and but waves a hand as he passes on,
9. Cries but a wayside word to her at the garden gate,
10. Sings but a boyish stave and his face is gone.
