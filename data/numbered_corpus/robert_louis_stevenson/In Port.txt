1. Last, to the chamber where I lie
2. My fearful footsteps patter nigh,
3. And come out from the cold and gloom
4. Into my warm and cheerful room.

5. There, safe arrived, we turn about
6. To keep the coming shadows out,
7. And close the happy door at last
8. On all the perils that we past.

9. Then, when mamma goes by to bed,
10. She shall come in with tip-toe tread,
11. And see me lying warm and fast
12. And in the land of Nod at last.
