1. Youth now flees on feathered foot
2. Faint and fainter sounds the flute,
3. Rarer songs of gods; and still
4. Somewhere on the sunny hill,
5. Or along the winding stream,
6. Through the willows, flits a dream;
7. Flits but shows a smiling face,
8. Flees but with so quaint a grace,
9. None can choose to stay at home,
10. All must follow, all must roam.

11. This is unborn beauty: she
12. Now in air floats high and free,
13. Takes the sun and breaks the blue;--
14. Late with stooping pinion flew

15. Raking hedgerow trees, and wet
16. Her wing in silver streams, and set
17. Shining foot on temple roof:
18. Now again she flies aloof,
19. Coasting mountain clouds and kiss't
20. By the evening's amethyst.

21. In wet wood and miry lane,
22. Still we pant and pound in vain;
23. Still with leaden foot we chase
24. Waning pinion, fainting face;
25. Still with gray hair we stumble on,
26. Till, behold, the vision gone!
27. Where hath fleeting beauty led?
28. To the doorway of the dead.
29. Life is over, life was gay:
30. We have come the primrose way.
