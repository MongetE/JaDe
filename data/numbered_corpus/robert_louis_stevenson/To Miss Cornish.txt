1. THEY tell me, lady, that to-day
2. On that unknown Australian strand -
3. Some time ago, so far away -
4. Another lady joined the band.
5. She joined the company of those
6. Lovelily dowered, nobly planned,
7. Who, smiling, still forgive their foes
8. And keep their friends in close command.

9. She, lady, as I learn, was one
10. Among the many rarely good;
11. And destined still to be a sun
12. Through every dark and rainy mood:-
13. She, as they told me, far had come,
14. By sea and land, o'er many a rood:-
15. Admired by all, beloved by some,
16. She was yourself, I understood.

17. But, compliment apart and free
18. From all constraint of verses, may
19. Goodness and honour, grace and glee,
20. Attend you ever on your way -
21. Up to the measure of your will,
22. Beyond all power of mine to say -
23. As she and I desire you still,
24. Miss Cornish, on your natal day.
