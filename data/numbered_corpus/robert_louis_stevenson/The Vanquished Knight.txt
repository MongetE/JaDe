1. I HAVE left all upon the shameful field,
2. Honour and Hope, my God, and all but life;
3. Spurless, with sword reversed and dinted shield,
4. Degraded and disgraced, I leave the strife.

5. From him that hath not, shall there not be taken
6. E'en that he hath, when he deserts the strife?
7. Life left by all life's benefits forsaken,
8. O keep the promise, Lord, and take the life.
