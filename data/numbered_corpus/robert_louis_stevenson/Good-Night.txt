1. Then the bright lamp is carried in,
2. The sunless hours again begin;
3. O'er all without, in field and lane,
4. The haunted night returns again.

5. Now we behold the embers flee
6. About the firelit hearth; and see
7. Our faces painted as we pass,
8. Like pictures, on the window glass.

9. Must we to bed indeed? Well then,
10. Let us arise and go like men,
11. And face with an undaunted tread
12. The long black passage up to bed.

13. Farewell, O brother, sister, sire!
14. O pleasant party round the fire!
15. The songs you sing, the tales you tell,
16. Till far to-morrow, fare you well!
