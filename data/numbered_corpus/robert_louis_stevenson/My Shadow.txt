1. From Child's Garden of Verses

2. I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
3. And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
4. He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
5. And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

6. The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--
7. Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
8. For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
9. And he sometimes goes so little that there's none of him at all.

10. He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,
11. And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
12. He stays so close behind me, he's a coward you can see;
13. I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

14. One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
15. I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
16. But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
17. Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.
