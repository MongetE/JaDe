1. WHEN the sun comes after rain
2. And the bird is in the blue,
3. The girls go down the lane
4. Two by two.

5. When the sun comes after shadow
6. And the singing of the showers,
7. The girls go up the meadow,
8. Fair as flowers.

9. When the eve comes dusky red
10. And the moon succeeds the sun,
11. The girls go home to bed
12. One by one.

13. And when life draws to its even
14. And the day of man is past,
15. They shall all go home to heaven,
16. Home at last.
