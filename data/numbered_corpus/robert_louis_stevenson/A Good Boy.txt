1. I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,
2. I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play.

3. And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,
4. And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good.

5. My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair,
6. And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.

7. I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,
8. No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.

9. But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn,
10. And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.
