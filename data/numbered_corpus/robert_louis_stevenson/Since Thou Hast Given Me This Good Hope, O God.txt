1. SINCE thou hast given me this good hope, O God,
2. That while my footsteps tread the flowery sod
3. And the great woods embower me, and white dawn
4. And purple even sweetly lead me on
5. From day to day, and night to night, O God,
6. My life shall no wise miss the light of love;
7. But ever climbing, climb above
8. Man's one poor star, man's supine lands,
9. Into the azure steadfastness of death,
10. My life shall no wise lack the light of love,
11. My hands not lack the loving touch of hands;
12. But day by day, while yet I draw my breath,
13. And day by day, unto my last of years,
14. I shall be one that has a perfect friend.
15. Her heart shall taste my laughter and my tears,
16. And her kind eyes shall lead me to the end.
