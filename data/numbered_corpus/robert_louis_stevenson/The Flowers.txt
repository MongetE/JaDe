1. All the names I know from nurse:
2. Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse,
3. Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock,
4. And the Lady Hollyhock.

5. Fairy places, fairy things,
6. Fairy woods where the wild bee wings,
7. Tiny trees for tiny dames--
8. These must all be fairy names!

9. Tiny woods below whose boughs
10. Shady fairies weave a house;
11. Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme,
12. Where the braver fairies climb!

13. Fair are grown-up people's trees,
14. But the fairest woods are these;
15. Where, if I were not so tall,
16. I should live for good and all.
