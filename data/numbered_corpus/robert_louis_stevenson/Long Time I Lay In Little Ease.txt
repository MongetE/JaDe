1. LONG TIME I LAY IN LITTLE EASE


2. LONG time I lay in little ease
3. Where, placed by the Turanian,
4. Marseilles, the many-masted, sees
5. The blue Mediterranean.

6. Now songful in the hour of sport,
7. Now riotous for wages,
8. She camps around her ancient port,
9. As ancient of the ages.

10. Algerian airs through all the place
11. Unconquerably sally;
12. Incomparable women pace
13. The shadows of the alley.

14. And high o'er dark and graving yard
15. And where the sky is paler,
16. The golden virgin of the guard
17. Shines, beckoning the sailor.

18. She hears the city roar on high,
19. Thief, prostitute, and banker;
20. She sees the masted vessels lie
21. Immovably at anchor.

22. She sees the snowy islets dot
23. The sea's immortal azure,
24. And If, that castellated spot,
25. Tower, turret, and embrasure.
