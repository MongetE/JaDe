1. AS in their flight the birds of song
2. Halt here and there in sweet and sunny dales,
3. But halt not overlong;
4. The time one rural song to sing
5. They pause; then following bounteous gales
6. Steer forward on the wing:
7. Sun-servers they, from first to last,
8. Upon the sun they wait
9. To ride the sailing blast.

10. So he awhile in our contested state,
11. Awhile abode, not longer, for his Sun -
12. Mother we say, no tenderer name we know -
13. With whose diviner glow
14. His early days had shone,
15. Now to withdraw her radiance had begun.
16. Or lest a wrong I say, not she withdrew,
17. But the loud stream of men day after day
18. And great dust columns of the common way
19. Between them grew and grew:
20. And he and she for evermore might yearn,
21. But to the spring the rivulets not return
22. Nor to the bosom comes the child again.

23. And he (O may we fancy so!),
24. He, feeling time forever flow
25. And flowing bear him forth and far away
26. From that dear ingle where his life began
27. And all his treasure lay -
28. He, waxing into man,
29. And ever farther, ever closer wound
30. In this obstreperous world's ignoble round,
31. From that poor prospect turned his face away.
