1. THE relic taken, what avails the shrine?
2. The locket, pictureless?  O heart of mine,
3. Art thou not worse than that,
4. Still warm, a vacant nest where love once sat?

5. Her image nestled closer at my heart
6. Than cherished memories, healed every smart
7. And warmed it more than wine
8. Or the full summer sun in noon-day shine.

9. This was the little weather gleam that lit
10. The cloudy promontories - the real charm was
11. That gilded hills and woods
12. And walked beside me thro' the solitudes.

13. The sun is set.  My heart is widowed now
14. Of that companion-thought.  Alone I plough
15. The seas of life, and trace
16. A separate furrow far from her and grace.
