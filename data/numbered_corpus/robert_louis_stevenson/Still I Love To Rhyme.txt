1. STILL I love to rhyme, and still more, rhyming, to wander
2. Far from the commoner way;
3. Old-time trills and falls by the brook-side still do I ponder,
4. Dreaming to-morrow to-day.

5. Come here, come, revive me, Sun-God, teach me, Apollo,
6. Measures descanted before;
7. Since I ancient verses, I emulous follow,
8. Prints in the marbles of yore.

9. Still strange, strange, they sound in old-young raiment invested,
10. Songs for the brain to forget -
11. Young song-birds elate to grave old temples benested
12. Piping and chirruping yet.

13. Thoughts?  No thought has yet unskilled attempted to flutter
14. Trammelled so vilely in verse;
15. He who writes but aims at fame and his bread and his butter,
16. Won with a groan and a curse.
