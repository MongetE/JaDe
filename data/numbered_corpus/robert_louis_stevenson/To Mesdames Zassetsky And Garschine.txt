1. THE wind may blaw the lee-gang way
2. And aye the lift be mirk an' gray,
3. An deep the moss and steigh the brae
4. Where a' maun gang -
5. There's still an hoor in ilka day
6. For luve and sang.

7. And canty hearts are strangely steeled.
8. By some dikeside they'll find a bield,
9. Some couthy neuk by muir or field
10. They're sure to hit,
11. Where, frae the blatherin' wind concealed,
12. They'll rest a bit.

13. An' weel for them if kindly fate
14. Send ower the hills to them a mate;
15. They'll crack a while o' kirk an' State,
16. O' yowes an' rain:
17. An' when it's time to take the gate,
18. Tak' ilk his ain.

19. - Sic neuk beside the southern sea
20. I soucht - sic place o' quiet lee
21. Frae a' the winds o' life.  To me,
22. Fate, rarely fair,
23. Had set a freendly company
24. To meet me there.

25. Kindly by them they gart me sit,
26. An' blythe was I to bide a bit.
27. Licht as o' some hame fireside lit
28. My life for me.
29. - Ower early maun I rise an' quit
30. This happy lee.
