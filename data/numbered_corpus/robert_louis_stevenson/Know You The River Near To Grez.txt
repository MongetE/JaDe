1. KNOW you the river near to Grez,
2. A river deep and clear?
3. Among the lilies all the way,
4. That ancient river runs to-day
5. From snowy weir to weir.

6. Old as the Rhine of great renown,
7. She hurries clear and fast,
8. She runs amain by field and town
9. From south to north, from up to down,
10. To present on from past.

11. The love I hold was borne by her;
12. And now, though far away,
13. My lonely spirit hears the stir
14. Of water round the starling spur
15. Beside the bridge at Grez.

16. So may that love forever hold
17. In life an equal pace;
18. So may that love grow never old,
19. But, clear and pure and fountain-cold,
20. Go on from grace to grace.
