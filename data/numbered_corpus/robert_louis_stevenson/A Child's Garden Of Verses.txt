1. For the long nights you lay awake
2. And watched for my unworthy sake:
3. For your most comfortable hand
4. That led me through the uneven land:
5. For all the story-books you read:
6. For all the pains you comforted:

7. For all you pitied, all you bore,
8. In sad and happy days of yore:-
9. My second Mother, my first Wife,
10. The angel of my infant life-
11. From the sick child, now well and old,
12. Take, nurse, the little book you hold!

13. And grant it, Heaven, that all who read
14. May find as dear a nurse at need,
15. And every child who lists my rhyme,
16. In the bright, fireside, nursery clime,
17. May hear it in as kind a voice
18. As made my childish days rejoice!
