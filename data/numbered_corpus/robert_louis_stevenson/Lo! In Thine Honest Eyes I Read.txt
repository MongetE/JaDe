1. LO! in thine honest eyes I read
2. The auspicious beacon that shall lead,
3. After long sailing in deep seas,
4. To quiet havens in June ease.

5. Thy voice sings like an inland bird
6. First by the seaworn sailor heard;
7. And like road sheltered from life's sea
8. Thine honest heart is unto me.
