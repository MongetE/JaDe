1. IT'S forth across the roaring foam, and on towards the west,
2. It's many a lonely league from home, o'er many a mountain crest,
3. From where the dogs of Scotland call the sheep around the fold,
4. To where the flags are flying beside the Gates of Gold.

5. Where all the deep-sea galleons ride that come to bring the corn,
6. Where falls the fog at eventide and blows the breeze at morn;
7. It's there that I was sick and sad, alone and poor and cold,
8. In yon distressful city beside the Gates of Gold.

9. I slept as one that nothing knows; but far along my way,
10. Before the morning God rose and planned the coming day;
11. Afar before me forth he went, as through the sands of old,
12. And chose the friends to help me beside the Gates of Gold.

13. I have been near, I have been far, my back's been at the wall,
14. Yet aye and ever shone the star to guide me through it all:
15. The love of God, the help of man, they both shall make me bold
16. Against the gates of darkness as beside the Gates of Gold.
