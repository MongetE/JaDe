1. THOUGH deep indifference should drowse
2. The sluggish life beneath my brows,
3. And all the external things I see
4. Grow snow-showers in the street to me,
5. Yet inmost in my stormy sense
6. Thy looks shall be an influence.

7. Though other loves may come and go
8. And long years sever us below,
9. Shall the thin ice that grows above
10. Freeze the deep centre-well of love?
11. No, still below light amours, thou
12. Shalt rule me as thou rul'st me now.

13. Year following year shall only set
14. Fresh gems upon thy coronet;
15. And Time, grown lover, shall delight
16. To beautify thee in my sight;
17. And thou shalt ever rule in me
18. Crowned with the light of memory.
