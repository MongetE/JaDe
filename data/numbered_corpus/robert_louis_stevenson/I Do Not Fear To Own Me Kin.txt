1. I DO not fear to own me kin
2. To the glad clods in which spring flowers begin;
3. Or to my brothers, the great trees,
4. That speak with pleasant voices in the breeze,
5. Loud talkers with the winds that pass;
6. Or to my sister, the deep grass.

7. Of such I am, of such my body is,
8. That thrills to reach its lips to kiss.
9. That gives and takes with wind and sun and rain
10. And feels keen pleasure to the point of pain.

11. Of such are these,
12. The brotherhood of stalwart trees,
13. The humble family of flowers,
14. That make a light of shadowy bowers
15. Or star the edges of the bent:
16. They give and take sweet colour and sweet scent;
17. They joy to shed themselves abroad;
18. And tree and flower and grass and sod
19. Thrill and leap and live and sing
20. With silent voices in the Spring.

21. Hence I not fear to yield my breath,
22. Since all is still unchanged by death;
23. Since in some pleasant valley I may be,
24. Clod beside clod, or tree by tree,
25. Long ages hence, with her I love this hour;
26. And feel a lively joy to share
27. With her the sun and rain and air,
28. To taste her quiet neighbourhood
29. As the dumb things of field and wood,
30. The clod, the tree, and starry flower,
31. Alone of all things have the power.
