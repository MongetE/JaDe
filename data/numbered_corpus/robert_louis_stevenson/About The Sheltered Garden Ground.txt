1. ABOUT the sheltered garden ground
2. The trees stand strangely still.
3. The vale ne'er seemed so deep before,
4. Nor yet so high the hill.

5. An awful sense of quietness,
6. A fulness of repose,
7. Breathes from the dewy garden-lawns,
8. The silent garden rows.

9. As the hoof-beats of a troop of horse
10. Heard far across a plain,
11. A nearer knowledge of great thoughts
12. Thrills vaguely through my brain.

13. I lean my head upon my arm,
14. My heart's too full to think;
15. Like the roar of seas, upon my heart
16. Doth the morning stillness sink.
