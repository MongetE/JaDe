1. THERE'S just a twinkle in your eye
2. That seems to say I MIGHT, if I
3. Were only bold enough to try
4. An arm about your waist.
5. I hear, too, as you come and go,
6. That pretty nervous laugh, you know;
7. And then your cap is always so
8. Coquettishly displaced.

9. Your cap! the word's profanely said.
10. That little top-knot, white and red,
11. That quaintly crowns your graceful head,
12. No bigger than a flower,
13. Is set with such a witching art,
14. Is so provocatively smart,
15. I'd like to wear it on my heart,
16. An order for an hour!

17. O graceful housemaid, tall and fair,
18. I love your shy imperial air,
19. And always loiter on the stair
20. When you are going by.
21. A strict reserve the fates demand;
22. But, when to let you pass I stand,
23. Sometimes by chance I touch your hand
24. And sometimes catch your eye.
