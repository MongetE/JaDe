1. DEAR sir, good-morrow!  Five years back,
2. When you first girded for this arduous track,
3. And under various whimsical pretexts
4. Endowed another with your damned defects,
5. Could you have dreamed in your despondent vein
6. That the kind God would make your path so plain?
7. Non nobis, domine!  O, may He still
8. Support my stumbling footsteps on the hill!
