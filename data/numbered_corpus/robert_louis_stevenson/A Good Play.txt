1. We built a ship upon the stairs
2. All made of the back-bedroom chairs,
3. And filled it full of soft pillows
4. To go a-sailing on the billows.

5. We took a saw and several nails,
6. And water in the nursery pails;
7. And Tom said, "Let us also take
8. An apple and a slice of cake;"--
9. Which was enough for Tom and me
10. To go a-sailing on, till tea.

11. We sailed along for days and days,
12. And had the very best of plays;
13. But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
14. So there was no one left but me.
