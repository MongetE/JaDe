1. Not undelightful, friend, our rustic ease
2. To grateful hearts; for by especial hap,
3. Deep nested in the hill's enormous lap,
4. With its own ring of walls and grove of trees,
5. Sits, in deep shelter, our small cottage - nor
6. Far-off is seen, rose carpeted and hung
7. With clematis, the quarry whence she sprung,
8. O mater pulchra filia pulchrior,
9. Whither in early spring, unharnessed folk,
10. We join the pairing swallows, glad to stay
11. Where, loosened in the hills, remote, unseen,
12. From its tall trees, it breathes a slender smoke
13. To heaven, and in the noon of sultry day
14. Stands, coolly buried, to the neck in green.
