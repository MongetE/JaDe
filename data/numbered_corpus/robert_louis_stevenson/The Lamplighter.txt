1. My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky.
2. It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;
3. For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,
4. With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.

5. Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,
6. And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;
7. But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,
8. O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!

9. For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,
10. And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;
11. And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light;
12. O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night!
