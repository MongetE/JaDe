1. IF I have faltered more or less
2. In my great task of happiness;
3. If I have moved among my race
4. And shown no glorious morning face;
5. If beams from happy human eyes
6. Have moved me not; if morning skies,
7. Books, and my food, and summer rain
8. Knocked on my sullen heart in vain:â€”
9. Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take
10. And stab my spirit broad awake;
11. Or, Lord, if too obdurate I,
12. Choose thou, before that spirit die,
13. A piercing pain, a killing sin,
14. And to my dead heart run them in.
