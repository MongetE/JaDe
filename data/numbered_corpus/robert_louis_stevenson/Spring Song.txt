1. THE air was full of sun and birds,
2. The fresh air sparkled clearly.
3. Remembrance wakened in my heart
4. And I knew I loved her dearly.

5. The fallows and the leafless trees
6. And all my spirit tingled.
7. My earliest thought of love, and Spring's
8. First puff of perfume mingled.

9. In my still heart the thoughts awoke,
10. Came lone by lone together -
11. Say, birds and Sun and Spring, is Love
12. A mere affair of weather?
