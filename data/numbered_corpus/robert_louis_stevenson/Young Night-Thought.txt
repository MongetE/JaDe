1. All night long and every night,
2. When my mama puts out the light,
3. I see the people marching by,
4. As plain as day before my eye.

5. Armies and emperor and kings,
6. All carrying different kinds of things,
7. And marching in so grand a way,
8. You never saw the like by day.

9. So fine a show was never seen
10. At the great circus on the green;
11. For every kind of beast and man
12. Is marching in that caravan.

13. As first they move a little slow,
14. But still the faster on they go,
15. And still beside me close I keep
16. Until we reach the town of Sleep.
