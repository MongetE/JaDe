1. The coach is at the door at last;
2. The eager children, mounting fast
3. And kissing hands, in chorus sing:
4. Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!
5. To house and garden, field and lawn,
6. The meadow-gates we swang upon,
7. To pump and stable, tree and swing,
8. Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!
9. And fare you well for evermore,
10. O ladder at the hayloft door,
11. O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,
12. Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!
13. Crack goes the whip, and off we go;
14. The trees and houses smaller grow;
15. Last, round the woody turn we sing:
16. Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!
