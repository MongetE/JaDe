1. O DULL cold northern sky,
2. O brawling sabbath bells,
3. O feebly twittering Autumn bird that tells
4. The year is like to die!

5. O still, spoiled trees, O city ways,
6. O sun desired in vain,
7. O dread presentiment of coming rain
8. That cloys the sullen days!

9. Thee, heart of mine, I greet.
10. In what hard mountain pass
11. Striv'st thou?  In what importunate morass
12. Sink now thy weary feet?

13. Thou run'st a hopeless race
14. To win despair.  No crown
15. Awaits success, but leaden gods look down
16. On thee, with evil face.

17. And those that would befriend
18. And cherish thy defeat,
19. With angry welcome shall turn sour the sweet
20. Home-coming of the end.

21. Yea, those that offer praise
22. To idleness, shall yet
23. Insult thee, coming glorious in the sweat
24. Of honourable ways.
