1. If two may read aright
2. These rhymes of old delight
3. And house and garden play,
4. You too, my cousins, and you only, may.

5. You in a garden green
6. With me were king and queen,
7. Were hunter, soldier, tar,
8. And all the thousand things that children are.

9. Now in the elders' seat
10. We rest with quiet feet,
11. And from the window-bay
12. We watch the children, our successors, play.

13. "Time was," the golden head
14. Irrevocably said;
15. But time which one can bind,
16. While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.
