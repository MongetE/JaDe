1. How do you like to go up in a swing,
2. Up in the air so blue?
3. Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing
4. Ever a child can do!

5. Up in the air and over the wall,
6. Till I can see so wide,
7. River and trees and cattle and all
8. Over the countryside--

9. Till I look down on the garden green,
10. Down on the roof so brown--
11. Up in the air I go flying again,
12. Up in the air and down!
