1. THOU strainest through the mountain fern,
2. A most exiguously thin Burn.
3. For all thy foam, for all thy din,
4. Thee shall the pallid lake inurn,
5. With well-a-day for Mr. Swin-Burne!
6. Take then this quarto in thy fin
7. And, O thou stoker huge and stern,
8. The whole affair, outside and in,
9. Burn!
10. But save the true poetic kin,
11. The works of Mr. Robert Burn'
12. And William Wordsworth upon Tin-Tern!
