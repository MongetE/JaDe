1. As in the hostel by the bridge I sate,
2. Nailed with indifference fondly deemed complete,
3. And (O strange chance, more sorrowful than sweet)
4. The counterfeit of her that was my fate,
5. Dressed in like vesture, graceful and sedate,
6. Went quietly up the vacant village street,
7. The still small sound of her most dainty feet
8. Shook, like a trumpet blast, my soul's estate.
9. Instant revolt ran riot through my brain,
10. And all night long, thereafter, hour by hour,
11. The pageant of dead love before my eyes
12. Went proudly; and old hopes, broke loose again
13. From the restraint of wisely temperate power,
14. With ineffectual ardour sought to rise.
