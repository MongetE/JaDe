1. STOUT marches lead to certain ends,
2. We seek no Holy Grail, my friends -
3. That dawn should find us every day
4. Some fraction farther on our way.

5. The dumb lands sleep from east to west,
6. They stretch and turn and take their rest.
7. The cock has crown in the steading-yard,
8. But priest and people slumber hard.

9. We two are early forth, and hear
10. The nations snoring far and near.
11. So peacefully their rest they take,
12. It seems we are the first awake!

13. - Strong heart! this is no royal way,
14. A thousand cross-roads seek the day;
15. And, hid from us, to left and right,
16. A thousand seekers seek the light.
