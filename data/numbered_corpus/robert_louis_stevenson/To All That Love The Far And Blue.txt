1. TO all that love the far and blue:
2. Whether, from dawn to eve, on foot
3. The fleeing corners ye pursue,
4. Nor weary of the vain pursuit;
5. Or whether down the singing stream,
6. Paddle in hand, jocund ye shoot,
7. To splash beside the splashing bream
8. Or anchor by the willow root:

9. Or, bolder, from the narrow shore
10. Put forth, that cedar ark to steer,
11. Among the seabirds and the roar
12. Of the great sea, profound and clear;
13. Or, lastly if in heart ye roam,
14. Not caring to do else, and hear,
15. Safe sitting by the fire at home,
16. Footfalls in Utah or Pamere:

17. Though long the way, though hard to bear
18. The sun and rain, the dust and dew;
19. Though still attainment and despair
20. Inter the old, despoil the new;
21. There shall at length, be sure, O friends,
22. Howe'er ye steer, whate'er ye do -
23. At length, and at the end of ends,
24. The golden city come in view.
