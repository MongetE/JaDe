1. IN the highlands, in the country places,
2. Where the old plain men have rosy faces,
3. And the young fair maidens
4. Quiet eyes;
5. Where essential silence cheers and blesses,
6. And for ever in the hill-recesses
7. Her more lovely music
8. Broods and dies--

9. O to mount again where erst I haunted;
10. Where the old red hills are bird-enchanted,
11. And the low green meadows
12. Bright with sward;
13. And when even dies, the million-tinted,
14. And the night has come, and planets glinted,
15. Lo, the valley hollow
16. Lamp-bestarr'd!

17. O to dream, O to awake and wander
18. There, and with delight to take and render,
19. Through the trance of silence,
20. Quiet breath!
21. Lo! for there, among the flowers and grasses,
22. Only the mightier movement sounds and passes;
23. Only winds and rivers,
24. Life and death.
