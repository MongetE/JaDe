1. FIXED is the doom; and to the last of years
2. Teacher and taught, friend, lover, parent, child,
3. Each walks, though near, yet separate; each beholds
4. His dear ones shine beyond him like the stars.
5. We also, love, forever dwell apart;
6. With cries approach, with cries behold the gulph,
7. The Unvaulted; as two great eagles that do wheel in air
8. Above a mountain, and with screams confer,
9. Far heard athwart the cedars.
10. Yet the years
11. Shall bring us ever nearer; day by day
12. Endearing, week by week, till death at last
13. Dissolve that long divorce.  By faith we love,
14. Not knowledge; and by faith, though far removed,
15. Dwell as in perfect nearness, heart to heart.
16. We but excuse
17. Those things we merely are; and to our souls
18. A brave deception cherish.
19. So from unhappy war a man returns
20. Unfearing, or the seaman from the deep;
21. So from cool night and woodlands to a feast
22. May someone enter, and still breathe of dews,
23. And in her eyes still wear the dusky night.
