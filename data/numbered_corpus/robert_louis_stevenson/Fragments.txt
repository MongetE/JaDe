1. About my fields, in the broad sun
2. And blaze of noon, there goeth one,
3. Barefoot and robed in blue, to scan
4. With the hard eye of the husbandman
5. My harvests and my cattle.  Her,
6. When even puts the birds astir
7. And day has set in the great woods,
8. We seek, among her garden roods,
9. With bells and cries in vain: the while
10. Lamps, plate, and the decanter smile
11. On the forgotten board.  But she,
12. Deaf, blind, and prone on face and knee,
13. Forgets time, family, and feast,
14. And digs like a demented beast.

15. Tall as a guardsman, pale as the east at dawn,
16. Who strides in strange apparel on the lawn?
17. Rails for his breakfast? routs his vassals out
18. (Like boys escaped from school) with song and shout?
19. Kind and unkind, his Maker's final freak,
20. Part we deride the child, part dread the antique!
21. See where his gang, like frogs, among the dew
22. Crouch at their duty, an unquiet crew;
23. Adjust their staring kilts; and their swift eyes
24. Turn still to him who sits to supervise.
25. He in the midst, perched on a fallen tree,
26. Eyes them at labour; and, guitar on knee,
27. Now ministers alarm, now scatters joy,
28. Now twangs a halting chord, now tweaks a boy.
29. Thorough in all, my resolute vizier
30. Plays both the despot and the volunteer,
31. Exacts with fines obedience to my laws,
32. And for his music, too, exacts applause.

33. The Adorner of the uncomely - those
34. Amidst whose tall battalions goes
35. Her pretty person out and in
36. All day with an endearing din,
37. Of censure and encouragement;
38. And when all else is tried in vain
39. See her sit down and weep again.
40. She weeps to conquer;
41. She varies on her grenadiers
42. From satire up to girlish tears!

43. Or rather to behold her when
44. She plies for me the unresting pen,
45. And when the loud assault of squalls
46. Resounds upon the roof and walls,
47. And the low thunder growls and I
48. Raise my dictating voice on high.

49. What glory for a boy of ten
50. Who now must three gigantic men
51. And two enormous, dapple grey
52. New Zealand pack-horses array
53. And lead, and wisely resolute
54. Our day-long business execute
55. In the far shore-side town.  His soul
56. Glows in his bosom like a coal;
57. His innocent eyes glitter again,
58. And his hand trembles on the rein.
59. Once he reviews his whole command,
60. And chivalrously planting hand
61. On hip - a borrowed attitude -
62. Rides off downhill into the wood.

63. I meanwhile in the populous house apart
64. Sit snugly chambered, and my silent art
65. Uninterrupted, unremitting ply
66. Before the dawn, by morning lamplight, by
67. The glow of smelting noon, and when the sun
68. Dips past my westering hill and day is done;
69. So, bending still over my trade of words,
70. I hear the morning and the evening birds,
71. The morning and the evening stars behold;
72. So there apart I sit as once of old
73. Napier in wizard Merchiston; and my
74. Brown innocent aides in home and husbandry
75. Wonder askance.  What ails the boss? they ask.
76. Him, richest of the rich, an endless task
77. Before the earliest birds or servants stir
78. Calls and detains him daylong prisoner?
79. He whose innumerable dollars hewed
80. This cleft in the boar and devil-haunted wood,
81. And bade therein, from sun to seas and skies,
82. His many-windowed, painted palace rise
83. Red-roofed, blue-walled, a rainbow on the hill,
84. A wonder in the forest glade: he still,

85. Unthinkable Aladdin, dawn and dark,
86. Scribbles and scribbles, like a German clerk.
87. We see the fact, but tell, O tell us why?
88. My reverend washman and wise butler cry.
89. Meanwhile at times the manifold
90. Imperishable perfumes of the past
91. And coloured pictures rise on me thick and fast:
92. And I remember the white rime, the loud
93. Lamplitten city, shops, and the changing crowd;
94. And I remember home and the old time,
95. The winding river, the white moving rhyme,
96. The autumn robin by the river-side
97. That pipes in the grey eve.

98. The old lady (so they say), but I
99. Admire your young vitality.
100. Still brisk of foot, still busy and keen
101. In and about and up and down.

102. I hear you pass with bustling feet
103. The long verandahs round, and beat
104. Your bell, and "Lotu!  Lotu!" cry;
105. Thus calling our queer company,
106. In morning or in evening dim,
107. To prayers and the oft mangled hymn.

108. All day you watch across the sky
109. The silent, shining cloudlands ply,
110. That, huge as countries, swift as birds,
111. Beshade the isles by halves and thirds,
112. Till each with battlemented crest
113. Stands anchored in the ensanguined west,
114. An Alp enchanted.  All the day
115. You hear the exuberant wind at play,
116. In vast, unbroken voice uplift,
117. In roaring tree, round whistling clift.
