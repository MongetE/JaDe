1. Give to me the life I love,
2. Let the lave go by me,
3. Give the jolly heaven above
4. And the byway nigh me.
5. Bed in the bush with stars to see,
6. Bread I dip in the river -
7. There's the life for a man like me,
8. There's the life for ever.

9. Let the blow fall soon or late,
10. Let what will be o'er me;
11. Give the face of earth around
12. And the road before me.
13. Wealth I seek not, hope nor love,
14. Nor a friend to know me;
15. All I seek, the heaven above
16. And the road below me.
17. Or let autumn fall on me
18. Where afield I linger,
19. Silencing the bird on tree,
20. Biting the blue finger.
21. White as meal the frosty field -
22. Warm the fireside haven -
23. Not to autumn will I yield,
24. Not to winter even!

25. Let the blow fall soon or late,
26. Let what will be o'er me;
27. Give the face of earth around,
28. And the road before me.
29. Wealth I ask not, hope nor love,
30. Nor a friend to know me;
31. All I ask, the heaven above
32. And the road below me.
