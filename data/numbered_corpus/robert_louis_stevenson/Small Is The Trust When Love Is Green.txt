1. SMALL is the trust when love is green
2. In sap of early years;
3. A little thing steps in between
4. And kisses turn to tears.

5. Awhile - and see how love be grown
6. In loveliness and power!
7. Awhile, it loves the sweets alone,
8. But next it loves the sour.

9. A little love is none at all
10. That wanders or that fears;
11. A hearty love dwells still at call
12. To kisses or to tears.

13. Such then be mine, my love to give,
14. And such be yours to take:-
15. A faith to hold, a life to live,
16. For lovingkindness' sake:

17. Should you be sad, should you be gay,
18. Or should you prove unkind,
19. A love to hold the growing way
20. And keep the helping mind:-

21. A love to turn the laugh on care
22. When wrinkled care appears,
23. And, with an equal will, to share
24. Your losses and your tears.
