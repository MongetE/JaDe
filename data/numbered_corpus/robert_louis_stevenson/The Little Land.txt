1. When at home alone I sit
2. And am very tired of it,
3. I have just to shut my eyes
4. To go sailing through the skies--
5. To go sailing far away
6. To the pleasant Land of Play;
7. To the fairy land afar
8. Where the Little People are;
9. Where the clover-tops are trees,
10. And the rain-pools are the seas,
11. And the leaves, like little ships,
12. Sail about on tiny trips;
13. And above the Daisy tree
14. Through the grasses,
15. High o'erhead the Bumble Bee
16. Hums and passes.

17. In that forest to and fro
18. I can wander, I can go;
19. See the spider and the fly,
20. And the ants go marching by,
21. Carrying parcels with their feet
22. Down the green and grassy street.
23. I can in the sorrel sit
24. Where the ladybird alit.
25. I can climb the jointed grass
26. And on high
27. See the greater swallows pass
28. In the sky,
29. And the round sun rolling by
30. Heeding no such things as I.

31. Through that forest I can pass
32. Till, as in a looking-glass,
33. Humming fly and daisy tree
34. And my tiny self I see,
35. Painted very clear and neat
36. On the rain-pool at my feet.
37. Should a leaflet come to land
38. Drifting near to where I stand,
39. Straight I'll board that tiny boat
40. Round the rain-pool sea to float.

41. Little thoughtful creatures sit
42. On the grassy coasts of it;
43. Little things with lovely eyes
44. See me sailing with surprise.
45. Some are clad in armour green--
46. (These have sure to battle been!)--
47. Some are pied with ev'ry hue,
48. Black and crimson, gold and blue;
49. Some have wings and swift are gone;--
50. But they all look kindly on.

51. When my eyes I once again
52. Open, and see all things plain:
53. High bare walls, great bare floor;
54. Great big knobs on drawer and door;
55. Great big people perched on chairs,
56. Stitching tucks and mending tears,
57. Each a hill that I could climb,
58. And talking nonsense all the time--
59. O dear me,
60. That I could be
61. A sailor on a the rain-pool sea,
62. A climber in the clover tree,
63. And just come back a sleepy-head,
64. Late at night to go to bed.
