1. SWALLOWS travel to and fro,
2. And the great winds come and go,
3. And the steady breezes blow,
4. Bearing perfume, bearing love.
5. Breezes hasten, swallows fly,
6. Towered clouds forever ply,
7. And at noonday, you and I
8. See the same sunshine above.

9. Dew and rain fall everywhere,
10. Harvests ripen, flowers are fair,
11. And the whole round earth is bare
12. To the moonshine and the sun;
13. And the live air, fanned with wings,
14. Bright with breeze and sunshine, brings
15. Into contact distant things,
16. And makes all the countries one.

17. Let us wander where we will,
18. Something kindred greets us still;
19. Something seen on vale or hill
20. Falls familiar on the heart;
21. So, at scent or sound or sight,
22. Severed souls by day and night
23. Tremble with the same delight -
24. Tremble, half the world apart.
