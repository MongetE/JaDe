1. Summer fading, winter comes--
2. Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs,
3. Window robins, winter rooks,
4. And the picture story-books.

5. Water now is turned to stone
6. Nurse and I can walk upon;
7. Still we find the flowing brooks
8. In the picture story-books.

9. All the pretty things put by,
10. Wait upon the children's eye,
11. Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,
12. In the picture story-books.

13. We may see how all things are
14. Seas and cities, near and far,
15. And the flying fairies' looks,
16. In the picture story-books.

17. How am I to sing your praise,
18. Happy chimney-corner days,
19. Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
20. Reading picture story-books?
