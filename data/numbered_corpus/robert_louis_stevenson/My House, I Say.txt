1. My house, I say. But hark to the sunny doves
2. That make my roof the arena of their loves,
3. That gyre about the gable all day long
4. And fill the chimneys with their murmurous song:
5. Our house, they say; and mine, the cat declares
6. And spreads his golden fleece upon the chairs;
7. And mine the dog, and rises stiff with wrath
8. If any alien foot profane the path.
9. So, too, the buck that trimmed my terraces,
10. Our whilom gardener, called the garden his;
11. Who now, deposed, surveys my plain abode
12. And his late kingdom, only from the road.
