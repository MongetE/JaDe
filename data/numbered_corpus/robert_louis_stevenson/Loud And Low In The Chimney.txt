1. LOUD and low in the chimney
2. The squalls suspire;
3. Then like an answer dwindles
4. And glows the fire,
5. And the chamber reddens and darkens
6. In time like taken breath.
7. Near by the sounding chimney
8. The youth apart
9. Hearkens with changing colour
10. And leaping heart,
11. And hears in the coil of the tempest
12. The voice of love and death.
13. Love on high in the flute-like
14. And tender notes
15. Sounds as from April meadows
16. And hillside cotes;
17. But the deep wood wind in the chimney
18. Utters the slogan of death.
