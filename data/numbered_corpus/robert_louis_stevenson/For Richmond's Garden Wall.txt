1. WHEN Thomas set this tablet here,
2. Time laughed at the vain chanticleer;
3. And ere the moss had dimmed the stone,
4. Time had defaced that garrison.
5. Now I in turn keep watch and ward
6. In my red house, in my walled yard
7. Of sunflowers, sitting here at ease
8. With friends and my bright canvases.
9. But hark, and you may hear quite plain
10. Time's chuckled laughter in the lane.
