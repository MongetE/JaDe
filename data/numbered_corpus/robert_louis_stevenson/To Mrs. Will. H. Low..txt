1. Even in the bluest noonday of July,
2. There could not run the smallest breath of wind
3. But all the quarter sounded like a wood;
4. And in the chequered silence and above
5. The hum of city cabs that sought the Bois,
6. Suburban ashes shivered into song.
7. A patter and a chatter and a chirp
8. And a long dying hiss -  it was as though
9. Starched old brocaded dames through all the house
10. Had trailed a strident skirt, or her whole sky
11. Even in a wink had over-brimmed in rain.
12. Hark, in these shady parlours, how it talks
13. Of the near autumn, how the smitten ash
14. Trembles and augurs floods! O not too long
15. In these inconstant latitudes delay,
16. O not too late from the unbeloved north
17. Trim your escape! For soon shall this low roof
18. Resound indeed with rain, soon shall your eyes
19. Search the foul garden, search the darkened rooms,
20. Nor find one jewel but the blazing log.
