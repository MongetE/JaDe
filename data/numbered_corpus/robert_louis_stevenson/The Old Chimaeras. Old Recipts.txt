1. THE old Chimaeras, old receipts
2. For making "happy land,"
3. The old political beliefs
4. Swam close before my hand.

5. The grand old communistic myths
6. In a middle state of grace,
7. Quite dead, but not yet gone to Hell,
8. And walking for a space,

9. Quite dead, and looking it, and yet
10. All eagerness to show
11. The Social-Contract forgeries
12. By Chatterton - Rousseau -

13. A hundred such as these I tried,
14. And hundreds after that,
15. I fitted Social Theories
16. As one would fit a hat!

17. Full many a marsh-fire lured me on,
18. I reached at many a star,
19. I reached and grasped them and behold -
20. The stump of a cigar!

21. All through the sultry sweltering day
22. The sweat ran down my brow,
23. The still plains heard my distant strokes
24. That have been silenced now.

25. This way and that, now up, now down,
26. I hailed full many a blow.
27. Alas! beneath my weary arm
28. The thicket seemed to grow.

29. I take the lesson, wipe my brow
30. And throw my axe aside,
31. And, sorely wearied, I go home
32. In the tranquil eventide.

33. And soon the rising moon, that lights
34. The eve of my defeat,
35. Shall see me sitting as of yore
36. By my old master's feet.
