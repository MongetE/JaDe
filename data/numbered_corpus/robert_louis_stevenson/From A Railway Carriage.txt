1. Faster than fairies, faster than witches,
2. Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;
3. And charging along like troops in a battle
4. All through the meadows the horses and cattle:
5. All of the sights of the hill and the plain
6. Fly as thick as driving rain;
7. And ever again, in the wink of an eye,
8. Painted stations whistle by.
9. Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,
10. All by himself and gathering brambles;
11. Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;
12. And here is the green for stringing the daisies!
13. Here is a cart runaway in the road
14. Lumping along with man and load;
15. And here is a mill, and there is a river:
16. Each a glimpse and gone forever!
