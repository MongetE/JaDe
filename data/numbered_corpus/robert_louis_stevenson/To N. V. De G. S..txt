1. THE UNFATHOMABLE sea, and time, and tears,
2. The deeds of heroes and the crimes of kings
3. Dispart us; and the river of events
4. Has, for an age of years, to east and west
5. More widely borne our cradles. Thou to me
6. Art foreign, as when seamen at the dawn
7. Descry a land far off and know not which.
8. So I approach uncertain; so I cruise
9. Round thy mysterious islet, and behold
10. Surf and great mountains and loud river-bars,
11. And from the shore hear inland voices call.
12. Strange is the seamanâ€™s heart; he hopes, he fears;
13. Draws closer and sweeps wider from that coast;
14. Last, his rent sail refits, and to the deep
15. His shattered prow uncomforted puts back.
16. Yet as he goes he ponders at the helm
17. Of that bright island; where he feared to touch,
18. His spirit readventures; and for years,
19. Where by his wife he slumbers safe at home,
20. Thoughts of that land revisit him; he sees
21. The eternal mountains beckon, and awakes
22. Yearning for that far home that might have been.
