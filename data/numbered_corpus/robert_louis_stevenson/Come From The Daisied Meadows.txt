1. HOME from the daisied meadows, where you linger yet -
2. Home, golden-headed playmate, ere the sun is set;
3. For the dews are falling fast
4. And the night has come at last.
5. Home with you, home and lay your little head at rest,
6. Safe, safe, my little darling, on your mother's breast.
7. Lullaby, darling; your mother is watching you;
8. she'll be your guardian and shield.
9. Lullaby, slumber, my darling, till morning be
10. bright upon mountain and field.
11. Long, long the shadows fall.
12. All white and smooth at home your little bed is laid.
13. All round your head be angels.
