1. WHEN my young lady has grown great and staid,
2. And in long raiment wondrously arrayed,
3. She may take pleasure with a smile to know
4. How she delighted men-folk long ago.
5. For her long after, then, this tale I tell
6. Of the two fans and fairy Rosabelle.
7. Hot was the day; her weary sire and I
8. Sat in our chairs companionably nigh,
9. Each with a headache sat her sire and I.

10. Instant the hostess waked: she viewed the scene,
11. Divined the giants' languor by their mien,
12. And with hospitable care
13. Tackled at once an Atlantean chair.
14. Her pigmy stature scarce attained the seat -
15. She dragged it where she would, and with her feet
16. Surmounted; thence, a Phaeton launched, she crowned
17. The vast plateau of the piano, found
18. And culled a pair of fans; wherewith equipped,
19. Our mountaineer back to the level slipped;
20. And being landed, with considerate eyes,
21. Betwixt her elders dealt her double prize;
22. The small to me, the greater to her sire.
23. As painters now advance and now retire
24. Before the growing canvas, and anon
25. Once more approach and put the climax on:
26. So she awhile withdrew, her piece she viewed -
27. For half a moment half supposed it good -
28. Spied her mistake, nor sooner spied than ran
29. To remedy; and with the greater fan,
30. In gracious better thought, equipped the guest.

31. From ill to well, from better on to best,
32. Arts move; the homely, like the plastic kind;
33. And high ideals fired that infant mind.
34. Once more she backed, once more a space apart
35. Considered and reviewed her work of art:
36. Doubtful at first, and gravely yet awhile;
37. Till all her features blossomed in a smile.
38. And the child, waking at the call of bliss,
39. To each she ran, and took and gave a kiss.
