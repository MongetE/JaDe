1. UP with the sun, the breeze arose,
2. Across the talking corn she goes,
3. And smooth she rustles far and wide
4. Through all the voiceful countryside.

5. Through all the land her tale she tells;
6. She spins, she tosses, she compels
7. The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails
8. And all the trees in all the dales.

9. God calls us, and the day prepares
10. With nimble, gay and gracious airs:
11. And from Penzance to Maidenhead
12. The roads last night He watered.

13. God calls us from inglorious ease,
14. Forth and to travel with the breeze
15. While, swift and singing, smooth and strong
16. She gallops by the fields along.
