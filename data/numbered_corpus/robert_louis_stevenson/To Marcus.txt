1. YOU have been far, and I
2. Been farther yet,
3. Since last, in foul or fair
4. An impecunious pair,
5. Below this northern sky
6. Of ours, we met.

7. Now winter night shall see
8. Again us two,
9. While howls the tempest higher,
10. Sit warmly by the fire
11. And dream and plan, as we
12. Were wont to do.

13. And, hand in hand, at large
14. Our thoughts shall walk
15. While storm and gusty rain,
16. Again and yet again,
17. Shall drive their noisy charge
18. Across the talk.

19. The pleasant future still
20. Shall smile to me,
21. And hope with wooing hands
22. Wave on to fairy lands
23. All over dale and hill
24. And earth and sea.

25. And you who doubt the sky
26. And fear the sun -
27. You - Christian with the pack -
28. You shall not wander back
29. For I am Hopeful - I
30. Will cheer you on.

31. Come - where the great have trod,
32. The great shall lead -
33. Come, elbow through the press,
34. Pluck Fortune by the dress -
35. By God, we must - by God,
36. We shall succeed.
