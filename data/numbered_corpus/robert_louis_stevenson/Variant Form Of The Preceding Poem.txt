1. COME to me, all ye that labour; I will give your spirits rest;
2. Here apart in starry quiet I will give you rest.
3. Come to me, ye heavy laden, sin defiled and care opprest,
4. In your father's quiet mansions, soon to prove a welcome guest.
5. But an hour you bear your trial, sin and suffer, bleed and die;
6. But an hour you toil and combat here in day's inspiring eye.
7. See the feet of your deliverer; lo, the hour of freedom nigh.
