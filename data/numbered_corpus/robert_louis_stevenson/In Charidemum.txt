1. YOU, Charidemus, who my cradle swung,
2. And watched me all the days that I was young;
3. You, at whose step the laziest slaves awake,
4. And both the bailiff and the butler quake;
5. The barber's suds now blacken with my beard,
6. And my rough kisses make the maids afeared;
7. But with reproach your awful eyebrows twitch,
8. And for the cane, I see, your fingers itch.
9. If something daintily attired I go,
10. Straight you exclaim: "Your father did not so."
11. And fuming, count the bottles on the board
12. As though my cellar were your private hoard.
13. Enough, at last: I have done all I can,
14. And your own mistress hails me for a man.
