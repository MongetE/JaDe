1. NOW Antoninus, in a smiling age,
2. Counts of his life the fifteenth finished stage.
3. The rounded days and the safe years he sees,
4. Nor fears death's water mounting round his knees.
5. To him remembering not one day is sad,
6. Not one but that its memory makes him glad.
7. So good men lengthen life; and to recall
8. The past is to have twice enjoyed it all.
