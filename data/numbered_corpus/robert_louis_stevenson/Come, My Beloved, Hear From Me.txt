1. COME, my beloved, hear from me
2. Tales of the woods or open sea.
3. Let our aspiring fancy rise
4. A wren's flight higher toward the skies;
5. Or far from cities, brown and bare,
6. Play at the least in open air.
7. In all the tales men hear us tell
8. Still let the unfathomed ocean swell,
9. Or shallower forest sound abroad
10. Below the lonely stars of God;
11. In all, let something still be done,
12. Still in a corner shine the sun,
13. Slim-ankled maids be fleet of foot,
14. Nor man disown the rural flute.
15. Still let the hero from the start
16. In honest sweat and beats of heart
17. Push on along the untrodden road
18. For some inviolate abode.
19. Still, O beloved, let me hear
20. The great bell beating far and near-
21. The odd, unknown, enchanted gong
22. That on the road hales men along,
23. That from the mountain calls afar,
24. That lures a vessel from a star,
25. And with a still, aerial sound
26. Makes all the earth enchanted ground.
27. Love, and the love of life and act
28. Dance, live and sing through all our furrowed tract;
29. Till the great God enamoured gives
30. To him who reads, to him who lives,
31. That rare and fair romantic strain
32. That whoso hears must hear again.
