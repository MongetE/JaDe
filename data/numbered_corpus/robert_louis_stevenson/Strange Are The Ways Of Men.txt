1. STRANGE are the ways of men,
2. And strange the ways of God!
3. We tread the mazy paths
4. That all our fathers trod.

5. We tread them undismayed,
6. And undismayed behold
7. The portents of the sky,
8. The things that were of old.

9. The fiery stars pursue
10. Their course in heav'n on high;
11. And round the 'leaguered town,
12. Crest-tossing heroes cry.

13. Crest-tossing heroes cry;
14. And martial fifes declare
15. How small, to mortal minds,
16. Is merely mortal care.

17. And to the clang of steel
18. And cry of piercing flute
19. Upon the azure peaks
20. A God shall plant his foot:

21. A God in arms shall stand,
22. And seeing wide and far
23. The green and golden earth,
24. The killing tide of war,

25. He, with uplifted arm,
26. Shall to the skies proclaim
27. The gleeful fate of man,
28. The noble road to fame!
