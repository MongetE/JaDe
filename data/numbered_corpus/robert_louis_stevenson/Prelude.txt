1. BY sunny market-place and street
2. Wherever I go my drum I beat,
3. And wherever I go in my coat of red
4. The ribbons flutter about my head.

5. I seek recruits for wars to come -
6. For slaughterless wars I beat the drum,
7. And the shilling I give to each new ally
8. Is hope to live and courage to die.

9. I know that new recruits shall come
10. Wherever I beat the sounding drum,
11. Till the roar of the march by country and town
12. Shall shake the tottering Dagons down.

13. For I was objectless as they
14. And loitering idly day by day;
15. But whenever I heard the recruiters come,
16. I left my all to follow the drum.
