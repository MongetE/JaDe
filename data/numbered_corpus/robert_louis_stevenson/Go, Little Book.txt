1. GO, little book - the ancient phrase
2. And still the daintiest - go your ways,
3. My Otto, over sea and land,
4. Till you shall come to Nelly's hand.

5. How shall I your Nelly know?
6. By her blue eyes and her black brow,
7. By her fierce and slender look,
8. And by her goodness, little book!

9. What shall I say when I come there?
10. You shall speak her soft and fair:
11. See - you shall say - the love they send
12. To greet their unforgotten friend!

13. Giant Adulpho you shall sing
14. The next, and then the cradled king:
15. And the four corners of the roof
16. Then kindly bless; and to your perch aloof,
17. Where Balzac all in yellow dressed
18. And the dear Webster of the west
19. Encircle the prepotent throne
20. Of Shakespeare and of Calderon,
21. Shall climb an upstart.

22. There with these
23. You shall give ear to breaking seas
24. And windmills turning in the breeze,
25. A distant undetermined din
26. Without; and you shall hear within
27. The blazing and the bickering logs,
28. The crowing child, the yawning dogs,
29. And ever agile, high and low,
30. Our Nelly going to and fro.

31. There shall you all silent sit,
32. Till, when perchance the lamp is lit
33. And the day's labour done, she takes
34. Poor Otto down, and, warming for our sakes,
35. Perchance beholds, alive and near,
36. Our distant faces reappear.
