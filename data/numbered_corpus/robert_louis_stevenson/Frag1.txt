1. About my fields, in the broad sun
2. And blaze of noon, there goeth one,
3. Barefoot and robed in blue, to scan
4. With the hard eye of the husbandman
5. My harvests and my cattle.  Her,
6. When even puts the birds astir
7. And day has set in the great woods,
8. We seek, among her garden roods,
9. With bells and cries in vain: the while
10. Lamps, plate, and the decanter smile
11. On the forgotten board.  But she,
12. Deaf, blind, and prone on face and knee,
13. Forgets time, family, and feast,
14. And digs like a demented beast.
