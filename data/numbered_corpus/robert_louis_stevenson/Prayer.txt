1. I ASK good things that I detest,
2. With speeches fair;
3. Heed not, I pray Thee, Lord, my breast,
4. But hear my prayer.

5. I say ill things I would not say -
6. Things unaware:
7. Regard my breast, Lord, in Thy day,
8. And not my prayer.

9. My heart is evil in Thy sight:
10. My good thoughts flee:
11. O Lord, I cannot wish aright -
12. Wish Thou for me.

13. O bend my words and acts to Thee,
14. However ill,
15. That I, whate'er I say or be,
16. May serve Thee still.

17. O let my thoughts abide in Thee
18. Lest I should fall:
19. Show me Thyself in all I see,
20. Thou Lord of all.
