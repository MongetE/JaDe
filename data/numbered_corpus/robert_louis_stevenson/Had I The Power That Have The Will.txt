1. HAD I the power that have the will,
2. The enfeebled will - a modern curse -
3. This book of mine should blossom still
4. A perfect garden-ground of verse.

5. White placid marble gods should keep
6. Good watch in every shadowy lawn;
7. And from clean, easy-breathing sleep
8. The birds should waken me at dawn.

9. - A fairy garden; - none the less
10. Throughout these gracious paths of mine
11. All day there should be free access
12. For stricken hearts and lives that pine;

13. And by the folded lawns all day -
14. No idle gods for such a land -
15. All active Love should take its way
16. With active Labour hand in hand.
