1. Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,
2. A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;
3. Blinks but an hour or two; and then,
4. A blood-red orange, sets again.

5. Before the stars have left the skies,
6. At morning in the dark I rise;
7. And shivering in my nakedness,
8. By the cold candle, bathe and dress.

9. Close by the jolly fire I sit
10. To warm my frozen bones a bit;
11. Or with a reindeer-sled, explore
12. The colder countries round the door.

13. When to go out, my nurse doth wrap
14. Me in my comforter and cap;
15. The cold wind burns my face, and blows
16. Its frosty pepper up my nose.

17. Black are my steps on silver sod;
18. Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;
19. And tree and house, and hill and lake,
20. Are frosted like a wedding cake.
