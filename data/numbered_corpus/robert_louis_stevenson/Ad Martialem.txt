1. GO(D) knows, my Martial, if we two could be
2. To enjoy our days set wholly free;
3. To the true life together bend our mind,
4. And take a furlough from the falser kind.
5. No rich saloon, nor palace of the great,
6. Nor suit at law should trouble our estate;
7. On no vainglorious statues should we look,
8. But of a walk, a talk, a little book,
9. Baths, wells and meads, and the veranda shade,
10. Let all our travels and our toils be made.
11. Now neither lives unto himself, alas!
12. And the good suns we see, that flash and pass
13. And perish; and the bell that knells them cries:
14. "Another gone: O when will ye arise?"
