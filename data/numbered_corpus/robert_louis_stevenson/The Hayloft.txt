1. Through all the pleasant meadow-side
2. The grass grew shoulder-high,
3. Till the shining scythes went far and wide
4. And cut it down to dry.

5. Those green and sweetly smelling crops
6. They led the waggons home;
7. And they piled them here in mountain tops
8. For mountaineers to roam.

9. Here is Mount Clear, Mount Rusty-Nail,
10. Mount Eagle and Mount High;--
11. The mice that in these mountains dwell,
12. No happier are than I!

13. Oh, what a joy to clamber there,
14. Oh, what a place for play,
15. With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air,
16. The happy hills of hay!
