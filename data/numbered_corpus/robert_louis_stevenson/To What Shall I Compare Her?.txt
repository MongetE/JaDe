1. TO what shall I compare her,
2. That is as fair as she?
3. For she is fairer - fairer
4. Than the sea.
5. What shall be likened to her,
6. The sainted of my youth?
7. For she is truer - truer
8. Than the truth.
9. As the stars are from the sleeper,
10. Her heart is hid from me;
11. For she is deeper - deeper
12. Than the sea.
13. Yet in my dreams I view her
14. Flush rosy with new ruth -
15. Dreams!  Ah, may these prove truer
16. Than the truth.
