1. MY heart, when first the blackbird sings,
2. My heart drinks in the song:
3. Cool pleasure fills my bosom through
4. And spreads each nerve along.

5. My bosom eddies quietly,
6. My heart is stirred and cool
7. As when a wind-moved briar sweeps
8. A stone into a pool

9. But unto thee, when thee I meet,
10. My pulses thicken fast,
11. As when the maddened lake grows black
12. And ruffles in the blast.
