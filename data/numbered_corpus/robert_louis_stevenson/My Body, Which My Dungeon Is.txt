1. My body which my dungeon is,
2. And yet my parks and palaces: -
3. Which is so great that there I go
4. All the day long to and fro,
5. And when the night begins to fall
6. Throw down my bed and sleep, while all
7. The buildings hum with wakefulness -
8. Even as a child of savages
9. When evening takes her on her way,
10. (She having roamed a summer's day
11. Along the mountain-sides and scalp)
12. Sleeps in an antre of that alp: -
13. Which is so broad and high that there,
14. As in the topless fields of air
15. My fancy soars like to a kite
16. And faints in the blue infinite: -
17. Which is so strong, my strongest throes
18. And the rough world's besieging blows
19. Not break it, and so weak withal,
20. Death ebbs and flows in its loose wall
21. As the green sea in fishers' nets,
22. And tops its topmost parapets: -
23. Which is so wholly mine that I
24. Can wield its whole artillery,
25. And mine so little, that my soul
26. Dwells in perpetual control,
27. And I but think and speak and do
28. As my dead fathers move me to: -
29. If this born body of my bones
30. The beggared soul so barely owns,
31. What money passed from hand to hand,
32. What creeping custom of the land,
33. What deed of author or assign,
34. Can make a house a thing of mine?
