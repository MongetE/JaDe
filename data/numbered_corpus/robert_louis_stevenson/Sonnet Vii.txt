1. The strong man's hand, the snow-cool head of age,
2. The certain-footed sympathies of youth -
3. These, and that lofty passion after truth,
4. Hunger unsatisfied in priest or sage
5. Or the great men of former years, he needs
6. That not unworthily would dare to sing
7. (Hard task!) black care's inevitable ring
8. Settling with years upon the heart that feeds
9. Incessantly on glory.  Year by year
10. The narrowing toil grows closer round his feet;
11. With disenchanting touch rude-handed time
12. The unlovely web discloses, and strange fear
13. Leads him at last to eld's inclement seat,
14. The bitter north of life - a frozen clime.
