1. I saw you toss the kites on high
2. And blow the birds about the sky;
3. And all around I heard you pass,
4. Like ladies' skirts across the grass--
5. O wind, a-blowing all day long,
6. O wind, that sings so loud a song!
7. I saw the different things you did,
8. But always you yourself you hid.
9. I felt you push, I heard you call,
10. I could not see yourself at all--
11. O wind, a-blowing all day long,
12. O wind, that sings so loud a song!
13. O you that are so strong and cold,
14. O blower, are you young or old?
15. Are you a beast of field and tree,
16. Or just a stronger child than me?
17. O wind, a-blowing all day long,
18. O wind, that sings so loud a song!
