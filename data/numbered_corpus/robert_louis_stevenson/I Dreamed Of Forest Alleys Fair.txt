1. I.

2. I DREAMED of forest alleys fair
3. And fields of gray-flowered grass,
4. Where by the yellow summer moon
5. My Jenny seemed to pass.

6. I dreamed the yellow summer moon,
7. Behind a cedar wood,
8. Lay white on fields of rippling grass
9. Where I and Jenny stood.

10. I dreamed - but fallen through my dream,
11. In a rainy land I lie
12. Where wan wet morning crowns the hills
13. Of grim reality.

14. II.

15. I am as one that keeps awake
16. All night in the month of June,
17. That lies awake in bed to watch
18. The trees and great white moon.

19. For memories of love are more
20. Than the white moon there above,
21. And dearer than quiet moonshine
22. Are the thoughts of her I love.

23. III.

24. Last night I lingered long without
25. My last of loves to see.
26. Alas! the moon-white window-panes
27. Stared blindly back on me.

28. To-day I hold her very hand,
29. Her very waist embrace -
30. Like clouds across a pool, I read
31. Her thoughts upon her face.

32. And yet, as now, through her clear eyes
33. I seek the inner shrine -
34. I stoop to read her virgin heart
35. In doubt if it be mine -

36. O looking long and fondly thus,
37. What vision should I see?
38. No vision, but my own white face
39. That grins and mimics me.

40. IV.

41. Once more upon the same old seat
42. In the same sunshiny weather,
43. The elm-trees' shadows at their feet
44. And foliage move together.

45. The shadows shift upon the grass,
46. The dial point creeps on;
47. The clear sun shines, the loiterers pass,
48. As then they passed and shone.

49. But now deep sleep is on my heart,
50. Deep sleep and perfect rest.
51. Hope's flutterings now disturb no more
52. The quiet of my breast.
