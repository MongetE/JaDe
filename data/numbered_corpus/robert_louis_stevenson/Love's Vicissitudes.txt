1. AS Love and Hope together
2. Walk by me for a while,
3. Link-armed the ways they travel
4. For many a pleasant mile -
5. Link-armed and dumb they travel,
6. They sing not, but they smile.

7. Hope leaving, Love commences
8. To practise on the lute;
9. And as he sings and travels
10. With lingering, laggard foot,
11. Despair plays obligato
12. The sentimental flute.

13. Until in singing garments
14. Comes royally, at call -
15. Comes limber-hipped Indiff'rence
16. Free stepping, straight and tall -
17. Comes singing and lamenting,
18. The sweetest pipe of all.
