1. OVER the land is April,
2. Over my heart a rose;
3. Over the high, brown mountain
4. The sound of singing goes.
5. Say, love, do you hear me,
6. Hear my sonnets ring?
7. Over the high, brown mountain,
8. Love, do you hear me sing?

9. By highway, love, and byway
10. The snows succeed the rose.
11. Over the high, brown mountain
12. The wind of winter blows.
13. Say, love, do you hear me,
14. Hear my sonnets ring?
15. Over the high, brown mountain
16. I sound the song of spring,
17. I throw the flowers of spring.
18. Do you hear the song of spring?
19. Hear you the songs of spring?
