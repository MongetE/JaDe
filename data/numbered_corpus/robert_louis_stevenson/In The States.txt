1. With half a heart I wander here
2. As from an age gone by
3. A brother yet— though young in years,
4. An elder brother, I.

5. You speak another tongue than mine,
6. Though both were English born.
7. I towards the night of time decline,
8. You mount into the morn.

9. You shall grow great and strong and free,
10. But age must still decay:
11. To-morrow for the States— for me,
12. England and Yesterday.
