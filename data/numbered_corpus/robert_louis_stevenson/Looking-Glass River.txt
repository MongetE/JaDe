1. Smooth it glides upon its travel,
2. Here a wimple, there a gleam--
3. O the clean gravel!
4. O the smooth stream!

5. Sailing blossoms, silver fishes,
6. Pave pools as clear as air--
7. How a child wishes
8. To live down there!

9. We can see our colored faces
10. Floating on the shaken pool
11. Down in cool places,
12. Dim and very cool;

13. Till a wind or water wrinkle,
14. Dipping marten, plumping trout,
15. Spreads in a twinkle
16. And blots all out.

17. See the rings pursue each other;
18. All below grows black as night,
19. Just as if mother
20. Had blown out the light!

21. Patience, children, just a minute--
22. See the spreading circles die;
23. The stream and all in it
24. Will clear by-and-by.
