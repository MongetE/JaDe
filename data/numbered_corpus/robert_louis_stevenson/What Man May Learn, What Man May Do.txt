1. WHAT man may learn, what man may do,
2. Of right or wrong of false or true,
3. While, skipper-like, his course he steers
4. Through nine and twenty mingled years,
5. Half misconceived and half forgot,
6. So much I know and practise not.

7. Old are the words of wisdom, old
8. The counsels of the wise and bold:
9. To close the ears, to check the tongue,
10. To keep the pining spirit young;
11. To act the right, to say the true,
12. And to be kind whate'er you do.

13. Thus we across the modern stage
14. Follow the wise of every age;
15. And, as oaks grow and rivers run
16. Unchanged in the unchanging sun,
17. So the eternal march of man
18. Goes forth on an eternal plan.
