1. NOW in the sky
2. And on the hearth of
3. Now in a drawer the direful cane,
4. That sceptre of the . . . reign,
5. And the long hawser, that on the back
6. Of Marsyas fell with many a whack,
7. Twice hardened out of Scythian hides,
8. Now sleep till the October ides.

9. In summer if the boys be well.
