1. MINE eyes were swift to know thee, and my heart
2. As swift to love.  I did become at once
3. Thine wholly, thine unalterably, thine
4. In honourable service, pure intent,
5. Steadfast excess of love and laughing care:
6. And as she was, so am, and so shall be.
7. I knew thee helpful, knew thee true, knew thee
8. And Pity bedfellows: I heard thy talk
9. With answerable throbbings.  On the stream,
10. Deep, swift, and clear, the lilies floated; fish
11. Through the shadows ran.  There, thou and I
12. Read Kindness in our eyes and closed the match.
