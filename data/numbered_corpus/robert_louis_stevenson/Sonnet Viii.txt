1. As Daniel, bird-alone, in that far land,
2. Kneeling in fervent prayer, with heart-sick eyes
3. Turned thro' the casement toward the westering skies;
4. Or as untamed Elijah, that red brand
5. Among the starry prophets; or that band
6. And company of Faithful sanctities
7. Who in all times, when persecutions rise,
8. Cherish forgotten creeds with fostering hand:
9. Such do ye seem to me, light-hearted crew,
10. O turned to friendly arts with all your will,
11. That keep a little chapel sacred still,
12. One rood of Holy-land in this bleak earth
13. Sequestered still (our homage surely due!)
14. To the twin Gods of mirthful wine and mirth.
