1. TEMPEST tossed and sore afflicted, sin defiled and care oppressed,
2. Come to me, all ye that labour; come, and I will give ye rest.
3. Fear no more, O doubting hearted; weep no more, O weeping eye!
4. Lo, the voice of your redeemer; lo, the songful morning near.

5. Here one hour you toil and combat, sin and suffer, bleed and die;
6. In my father's quiet mansion soon to lay your burden by.
7. Bear a moment, heavy laden, weary hand and weeping eye.
8. Lo, the feet of your deliverer; lo, the hour of freedom here.
