1. Up into the cherry tree
2. Who should climb but little me?
3. I held the trunk with both my hands
4. And looked abroad in foreign lands.

5. I saw the next door garden lie,
6. Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
7. And many pleasant places more
8. That I had never seen before.

9. I saw the dimpling river pass
10. And be the sky's blue looking-glass;
11. The dusty roads go up and down
12. With people tramping in to town.

13. If I could find a higher tree
14. Farther and farther I should see,
15. To where the grown-up river slips
16. Into the sea among the ships,

17. To where the road on either hand
18. Lead onward into fairy land,
19. Where all the children dine at five,
20. And all the playthings come alive.
