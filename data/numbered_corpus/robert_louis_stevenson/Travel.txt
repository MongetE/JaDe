1. I should like to rise and go
2. Where the golden apples grow;--
3. Where below another sky
4. Parrot islands anchored lie,
5. And, watched by cockatoos and goats,
6. Lonely Crusoes building boats;--
7. Where in sunshine reaching out
8. Eastern cities, miles about,
9. Are with mosque and minaret
10. Among sandy gardens set,
11. And the rich goods from near and far
12. Hang for sale in the bazaar;--
13. Where the Great Wall round China goes,
14. And on one side the desert blows,
15. And with the voice and bell and drum,
16. Cities on the other hum;--
17. Where are forests hot as fire,
18. Wide as England, tall as a spire,
19. Full of apes and cocoa-nuts
20. And the negro hunters' huts;--
21. Where the knotty crocodile
22. Lies and blinks in the Nile,
23. And the red flamingo flies
24. Hunting fish before his eyes;--
25. Where in jungles near and far,
26. Man-devouring tigers are,
27. Lying close and giving ear
28. Lest the hunt be drawing near,
29. Or a comer-by be seen
30. Swinging in the palanquin;--
31. Where among the desert sands
32. Some deserted city stands,
33. All its children, sweep and prince,
34. Grown to manhood ages since,
35. Not a foot in street or house,
36. Not a stir of child or mouse,
37. And when kindly falls the night,
38. In all the town no spark of light.
39. There I'll come when I'm a man
40. With a camel caravan;
41. Light a fire in the gloom
42. Of some dusty dining-room;
43. See the pictures on the walls,
44. Heroes fights and festivals;
45. And in a corner find the toys
46. Of the old Egyptian boys.
