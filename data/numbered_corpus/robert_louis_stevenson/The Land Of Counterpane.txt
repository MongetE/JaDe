1. When I was sick and lay a-bed,
2. I had two pillows at my head,
3. And all my toys beside me lay,
4. To keep me happy all the day.

5. And sometimes for an hour or so
6. I watched my leaden soldiers go,
7. With different uniforms and drills,
8. Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;

9. And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
10. All up and down among the sheets;
11. Or brought my trees and houses out,
12. And planted cities all about.

13. I was the giant great and still
14. That sits upon the pillow-hill,
15. And sees before him, dale and plain,
16. The pleasant land of counterpane.
