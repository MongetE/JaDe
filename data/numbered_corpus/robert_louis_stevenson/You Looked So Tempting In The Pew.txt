1. YOU looked so tempting in the pew,
2. You looked so sly and calm -
3. My trembling fingers played with yours
4. As both looked out the Psalm.

5. Your heart beat hard against my arm,
6. My foot to yours was set,
7. Your loosened ringlet burned my cheek
8. Whenever they two met.

9. O little, little we hearkened, dear,
10. And little, little cared,
11. Although the parson sermonised,
12. The congregation stared.
