1. NOW bare to the beholder's eye
2. Your late denuded bindings lie,
3. Subsiding slowly where they fell,
4. A disinvested citadel;
5. The obdurate corset, Cupid's foe,
6. The Dutchman's breeches frilled below.
7. Those that the lover notes to note,
8. And white and crackling petticoat.

9. From these, that on the ground repose,
10. Their lady lately re-arose;
11. And laying by the lady's name,
12. A living woman re-became.
13. Of her, that from the public eye
14. They do enclose and fortify,
15. Now, lying scattered as they fell,
16. An indiscreeter tale they tell:
17. Of that more soft and secret her
18. Whose daylong fortresses they were,
19. By fading warmth, by lingering print,
20. These now discarded scabbards hint.

21. A twofold change the ladies know:
22. First, in the morn the bugles blow,
23. And they, with floral hues and scents,
24. Man their beribboned battlements.
25. But let the stars appear, and they
26. Shed inhumanities away;
27. And from the changeling fashion see,
28. Through comic and through sweet degree,
29. In nature's toilet unsurpassed,
30. Forth leaps the laughing girl at last.
