1. FAREWELL, and when forth
2. I through the Golden Gates to Golden Isles
3. Steer without smiling, through the sea of smiles,
4. Isle upon isle, in the seas of the south,
5. Isle upon island, sea upon sea,
6. Why should I sail, why should the breeze?
7. I have been young, and I have counted friends.
8. A hopeless sail I spread, too late, too late.
9. Why should I from isle to isle
10. Sail, a hopeless sailor?
