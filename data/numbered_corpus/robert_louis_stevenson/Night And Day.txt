1. When the golden day is done,
2. Through the closing portal,
3. Child and garden, Flower and sun,
4. Vanish all things mortal.

5. As the blinding shadows fall
6. As the rays diminish,
7. Under evening's cloak they all
8. Roll away and vanish.

9. Garden darkened, daisy shut,
10. Child in bed, they slumber--
11. Glow-worm in the hallway rut,
12. Mice among the lumber.

13. In the darkness houses shine,
14. Parents move the candles;
15. Till on all the night divine
16. Turns the bedroom handles.

17. Till at last the day begins
18. In the east a-breaking,
19. In the hedges and the whins
20. Sleeping birds a-waking.

21. In the darkness shapes of things,
22. Houses, trees and hedges,
23. Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings
24. Beat on window ledges.

25. These shall wake the yawning maid;
26. She the door shall open--
27. Finding dew on garden glade
28. And the morning broken.

29. There my garden grows again
30. Green and rosy painted,
31. As at eve behind the pane
32. From my eyes it fainted.

33. Just as it was shut away,
34. Toy-like, in the even,
35. Here I see it glow with day
36. Under glowing heaven.

37. Every path and every plot,
38. Every blush of roses,
39. Every blue forget-me-not
40. Where the dew reposes,

41. "Up!" they cry, "the day is come
42. On the smiling valleys:
43. We have beat the morning drum;
44. Playmate, join your allies!"
