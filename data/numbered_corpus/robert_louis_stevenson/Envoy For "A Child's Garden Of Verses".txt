1. WHETHER upon the garden seat
2. You lounge with your uplifted feet
3. Under the May's whole Heaven of blue;
4. Or whether on the sofa you,
5. No grown up person being by,
6. Do some soft corner occupy;
7. Take you this volume in your hands
8. And enter into other lands,
9. For lo! (as children feign) suppose
10. You, hunting in the garden rows,
11. Or in the lumbered attic, or
12. The cellar - a nail-studded door
13. And dark, descending stairway found
14. That led to kingdoms underground:
15. There standing, you should hear with ease
16. Strange birds a-singing, or the trees
17. Swing in big robber woods, or bells
18. On many fairy citadels:

19. There passing through (a step or so -
20. Neither mamma nor nurse need know!)
21. From your nice nurseries you would pass,
22. Like Alice through the Looking-Glass
23. Or Gerda following Little Ray,
24. To wondrous countries far away.
25. Well, and just so this volume can
26. Transport each little maid or man
27. Presto from where they live away
28. Where other children used to play.
29. As from the house your mother sees
30. You playing round the garden trees,
31. So you may see if you but look
32. Through the windows of this book
33. Another child far, far away
34. And in another garden play.
35. But do not think you can at all,
36. By knocking on the window, call
37. That child to hear you.  He intent
38. Is still on his play-business bent.
39. He does not hear, he will not look,
40. Nor yet be lured out of this book.
41. For long ago, the truth to say,
42. He has grown up and gone away;
43. And it is but a child of air
44. That lingers in the garden there.
