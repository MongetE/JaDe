1. NOW when the number of my years
2. Is all fulfilled, and I
3. From sedentary life
4. Shall rouse me up to die,
5. Bury me low and let me lie
6. Under the wide and starry sky.
7. Joying to live, I joyed to die,
8. Bury me low and let me lie.
9. Clear was my soul, my deeds were free,
10. Honour was called my name,
11. I fell not back from fear
12. Nor followed after fame.
13. Bury me low and let me lie
14. Under the wide and starry sky.
15. Joying to live, I joyed to die,
16. Bury me low and let me lie.
17. Bury me low in valleys green
18. And where the milder breeze
19. Blows fresh along the stream,
20. Sings roundly in the trees -
21. Bury me low and let me lie
22. Under the wide and starry sky.
23. Joying to live, I joyed to die,
24. Bury me low and let me lie.
