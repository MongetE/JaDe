1. Where the bells peal far at sea
2. Cunning fingers fashioned me.
3. There on palace walls I hung
4. While that Consuelo sung;
5. But I heard, though I listened well,
6. Never a note, never a trill,
7. Never a beat of the chiming bell.
8. There I hung and looked, and there
9. In my grey face, faces fair
10. Shone from under shining hair.
11. Well, I saw the poising head,
12. But the lips moved and nothing said;
13. And when lights were in the hall,
14. Silent moved the dancers all.
15. So awhile I glowed, and then
16. Fell on dusty days and men;
17. Long I slumbered packed in straw,
18. Long I none but dealers saw;
19. Till before my silent eye
20. On that sees came passing by.
21. Now with an outlandish grace,
22. To the sparkling fire I face
23. In the blue room at Skerryvore;
24. Where I wait until the door
25. Open, and the Prince of Men,
26. Henry James, shall come again.
