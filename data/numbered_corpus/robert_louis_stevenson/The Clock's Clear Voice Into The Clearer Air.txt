1. THE cock's clear voice into the clearer air
2. Where westward far I roam,
3. Mounts with a thrill of hope,
4. Falls with a sigh of home.

5. A rural sentry, he from farm and field
6. The coming morn descries,
7. And, mankind's bugler, wakes
8. The camp of enterprise.

9. He sings the morn upon the westward hills
10. Strange and remote and wild;
11. He sings it in the land
12. Where once I was a child.

13. He brings to me dear voices of the past,
14. The old land and the years:
15. My father calls for me,
16. My weeping spirit hears.

17. Fife, fife, into the golden air, O bird,
18. And sing the morning in;
19. For the old days are past
20. And new days begin.
