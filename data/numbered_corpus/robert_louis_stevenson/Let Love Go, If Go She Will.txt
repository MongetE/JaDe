1. LET love go, if go she will.
2. Seek not, O fool, her wanton flight to stay.
3. Of all she gives and takes away
4. The best remains behind her still.

5. The best remains behind; in vain
6. Joy she may give and take again,
7. Joy she may take and leave us pain,
8. If yet she leave behind
9. The constant mind
10. To meet all fortunes nobly, to endure
11. All things with a good heart, and still be pure,
12. Still to be foremost in the foremost cause,
13. And still be worthy of the love that was.
14. Love coming is omnipotent indeed,
15. But not Love going.  Let her go.  The seed
16. Springs in the favouring Summer air, and grows,
17. And waxes strong; and when the Summer goes,
18. Remains, a perfect tree.

19. Joy she may give and take again,
20. Joy she may take and leave us pain.
21. O Love, and what care we?
22. For one thing thou hast given, O Love, one thing
23. Is ours that nothing can remove;
24. And as the King discrowned is still a King,
25. The unhappy lover still preserves his love.
