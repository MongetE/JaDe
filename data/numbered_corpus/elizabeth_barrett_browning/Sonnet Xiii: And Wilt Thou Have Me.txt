1. And wilt thou have me fashion into speech
2. The love I bear thee, finding words enough,
3. And hold the torch out, while the winds are rough,
4. Between our faces, to cast light upon each?
5. I drop it at thy feet. I cannot teach
6. My hand to hold my spirit so far off
7. From myself.. me.. that I should bring thee proof,
8. In words of love hid in me...out of reach.
9. Nay, let the silence of my womanhood
10. Commend my woman-love to thy belief,
11. Seeing that I stand unwon (however wooed)
12. And rend the garment of my life in brief
13. By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,
14. Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief.
