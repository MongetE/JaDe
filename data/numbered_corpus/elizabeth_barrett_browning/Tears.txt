1. THANK God, bless God, all ye who suffer not
2. More grief than ye can weep for. That is well--
3. That is light grieving ! lighter, none befell
4. Since Adam forfeited the primal lot.
5. Tears ! what are tears ? The babe weeps in its cot,
6. The mother singing, at her marriage-bell
7. The bride weeps, and before the oracle
8. Of high-faned hills the poet has forgot
9. Such moisture on his cheeks. Thank God for grace,
10. Ye who weep only ! If, as some have done,
11. Ye grope tear-blinded in a desert place

12. And touch but tombs,--look up I those tears will run
13. Soon in long rivers down the lifted face,
14. And leave the vision clear for stars and sun
