1. XVIII

2. I never gave a lock of hair away
3. To a man, Dearest, except this to thee,
4. Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,
5. I ring out to the full brown length and say
6. 'Take it.' My day of youth went yesterday;
7. My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
8. Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,
9. As girls do, any more: it only may
10. Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
11. Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
12. Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears
13. Would take this first, but Love is justified,—
14. Take it thou,—finding pure, from all those years,
15. The kiss my mother left here when she died.
