1. WORDSWORTH upon Helvellyn ! Let the cloud
2. Ebb audibly along the mountain-wind,
3. Then break against the rock, and show behind
4. The lowland valleys floating up to crowd
5. The sense with beauty. He with forehead bowed
6. And humble-lidded eyes, as one inclined
7. Before the sovran thought of his own mind,
8. And very meek with inspirations proud,
9. Takes here his rightful place as poet-priest
10. By the high altar, singing prayer and prayer

11. To the higher Heavens. A noble vision free
12. Our Haydon's hand has flung out from the mist:
13. No portrait this, with Academic air !
14. This is the poet and his poetry.
