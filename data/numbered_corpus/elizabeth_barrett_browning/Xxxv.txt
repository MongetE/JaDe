1. If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange
2. And be all to me ? Shall I never miss
3. Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss
4. That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,
5. When I look up, to drop on a new range
6. Of walls and floors, another home than this ?
7. Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
8. Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change ?
9. That 's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried,
10. To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove;
11. For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
12. Alas, I have grieved sol am hard to love.
13. Yet love me--wilt thou ? Open thine heart wide,
14. And fold within the wet wings of thy dove.
