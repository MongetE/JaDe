1. I think that look of Christ might seem to say--
2. 'Thou Peter ! art thou then a common stone
3. Which I at last must break my heart upon
4. For all God's charge to his high angels may
5. Guard my foot better ? Did I yesterday
6. Wash thy feet, my beloved, that they should run
7. Quick to deny me 'neath the morning sun ?
8. And do thy kisses, like the rest, betray ?
9. The cock crows coldly.--GO, and manifest
10. A late contrition, but no bootless fear !
11. For when thy final need is dreariest,
12. Thou shalt not be denied, as I am here;
13. My voice to God and angels shall attest,
14. Because I KNOW this man, let him be clear.'
