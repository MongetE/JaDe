1. EXPERIENCE, like a pale musician, holds
2. A dulcimer of patience in his hand,
3. Whence harmonies, we cannot understand,
4. Of God; will in his worlds, the strain unfolds
5. In sad-perplexed minors: deathly colds
6. Fall on us while we hear, and countermand
7. Our sanguine heart back from the fancyland
8. With nightingales in visionary wolds.
9. We murmur ' Where is any certain tune
10. Or measured music in such notes as these ? '
11. But angels, leaning from the golden seat,
12. Are not so minded their fine ear hath won
13. The issue of completed cadences,
14. And, smiling down the stars, they whisper--
15. SWEET.
