1. Is it indeed so? If I lay here dead,
2. Wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine?
3. And would the sun for thee more coldly shine
4. Because of grave-damps falling round my head?
5. I marvelled, my Belov√®d, when I read
6. Thy thought so in the letter. I am thine--
7. But...so much to thee? Can I pour your wine
8. While my hands tremble? Then my soul, instead
9. Of dreams of death, resumes life's lower range.
10. Then, love me, Love! Look on me--breathe on me!
11. As brighter ladies do not count it strange,
12. For love, to give up acres and degree,
13. I yield the grave for thy sake, and exchange
14. My near sweet view of Heaven, for earth with thee!
