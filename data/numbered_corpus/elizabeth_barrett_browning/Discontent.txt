1. LIGHT human nature is too lightly tost
2. And ruffled without cause, complaining on--
3. Restless with rest, until, being overthrown,
4. It learneth to lie quiet. Let a frost
5. Or a small wasp have crept to the inner-most
6. Of our ripe peach, or let the wilful sun
7. Shine westward of our window,--straight we run
8. A furlong's sigh as if the world were lost.
9. But what time through the heart and through the brain
10. God hath transfixed us,--we, so moved before,
11. Attain to a calm. Ay, shouldering weights of pain,
12. We anchor in deep waters, safe from shore,
13. And hear submissive o'er the stormy main
14. God's chartered judgments walk for evermore.
