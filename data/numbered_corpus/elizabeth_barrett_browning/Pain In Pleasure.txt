1. A THOUGHT ay like a flower upon mine heart,
2. And drew around it other thoughts like bees
3. For multitude and thirst of sweetnesses;
4. Whereat rejoicing, I desired the art
5. Of the Greek whistler, who to wharf and mart
6. Could lure those insect swarms from orange-trees
7. That I might hive with me such thoughts and please
8. My soul so, always. foolish counterpart
9. Of a weak man's vain wishes ! While I spoke,
10. The thought I called a flower grew nettle-rough
11. The thoughts, called bees, stung me to festering:
12. Oh, entertain (cried Reason as she woke)
13. Your best and gladdest thoughts but long enough,
14. And they will all prove sad enough to sting !
