1. XLIII

2. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
3. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
4. My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
5. For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
6. I love thee to the level of everyday's
7. Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
8. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
9. I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
10. I love thee with the passion put to use
11. In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
12. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
13. With my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,
14. Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,
15. I shall but love thee better after death.
