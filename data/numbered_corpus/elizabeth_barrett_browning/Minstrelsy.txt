1. For ever, since my childish looks
2. Could rest on Nature's pictured books;
3. For ever, since my childish tongue
4. Could name the themes our bards have sung;
5. So long, the sweetness of their singing
6. Hath been to me a rapture bringing!
7. Yet ask me not the reason why
8. I have delight in minstrelsy.

9. I know that much whereof I sing,
10. Is shapen but for vanishing;
11. I know that summer's flower and leaf
12. And shine and shade are very brief,
13. And that the heart they brighten, may,
14. Before them all, be sheathed in clay! --
15. I do not know the reason why
16. I have delight in minstrelsy.

17. A few there are, whose smile and praise
18. My minstrel hope, would kindly raise:
19. But, of those few -- Death may impress
20. The lips of some with silentness;
21. While some may friendship's faith resign,
22. And heed no more a song of mine. --
23. Ask not, ask not the reason why
24. I have delight in minstrelsy.

25. The sweetest song that minstrels sing,
26. Will charm not Joy to tarrying;
27. The greenest bay that earth can grow,
28. Will shelter not in burning woe;
29. A thousand voices will not cheer,
30. When one is mute that aye is dear! --
31. Is there, alas! no reason why
32. I have delight in minstrelsy.

33. I do not know! The turf is green
34. Beneath the rain's fast-dropping sheen,
35. Yet asks not why that deeper hue
36. Doth all its tender leaves renew; --
37. And I, like-minded, am content,
38. While music to my soul is sent,
39. To question not the reason why
40. I have delight in minstrelsy.

41. Years pass -- my life with them shall pass:
42. And soon, the cricket in the grass
43. And summer bird, shall louder sing
44. Than she who owns a minstrel's string.
45. Oh then may some, the dear and few,
46. Recall her love, whose truth they knew;
47. When all forget to question why
48. She had delight in minstrelsy!
