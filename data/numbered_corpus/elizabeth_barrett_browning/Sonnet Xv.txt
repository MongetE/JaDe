1. Accuse me not, beseech thee, that I wear
2. Too calm and sad a face in front of thine;
3. For we two look two ways, and cannot shine
4. With the same sunlight on our brow and hair.
5. On me thou lookest with no doubting care,
6. As on a bee shut in a crystalline;
7. Since sorrow hath shut me safe in love's divine,
8. And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
9. Were most impossible failure, if I strove
10. To fail so. But I look on thee--on thee--
11. Beholding, besides love, the end of love,
12. Hearing oblivion beyond memory;
13. As one who sits and gazes from above,
14. Over the rivers to the bitter sea.
