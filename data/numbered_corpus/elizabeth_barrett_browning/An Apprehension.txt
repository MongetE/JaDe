1. IF all the gentlest-hearted friends I know
2. Concentred in one heart their gentleness,
3. That still grew gentler till its pulse was less
4. For life than pity,--I should yet be slow
5. To bring my own heart nakedly below
6. The palm of such a friend, that he should press
7. Motive, condition, means, appliances,

8. My false ideal joy and fickle woe,
9. Out full to light and knowledge; I should fear
10. Some plait between the brows, some rougher chime
11. In the free voice. O angels, let your flood
12. Of bitter scorn dash on me ! do ye hear
13. What I say who hear calmly all the time
14. This everlasting face to face with GOD ?
