1. IF God compel thee to this destiny,
2. To die alone, with none beside thy bed
3. To ruffle round with sobs thy last word said
4. And mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee,--
5. Pray then alone, ' O Christ, come tenderly !
6. By thy forsaken Sonship in the red
7. Drear wine-press,--by the wilderness out-spread,--
8. And the lone garden where thine agony
9. Fell bloody from thy brow,--by all of those
10. Permitted desolations, comfort mine !
11. No earthly friend being near me, interpose
12. No deathly angel 'twixt my face aud thine,
13. But stoop Thyself to gather my life's rose,
14. And smile away my mortal to Divine ! '
