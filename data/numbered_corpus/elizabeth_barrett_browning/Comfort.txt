1. SPEAK low to me, my Saviour, low and sweet
2. From out the hallelujahs, sweet and low
3. Lest I should fear and fall, and miss Thee so
4. Who art not missed by any that entreat.
5. Speak to mo as to Mary at thy feet !
6. And if no precious gums my hands bestow,
7. Let my tears drop like amber while I go
8. In reach of thy divinest voice complete
9. In humanest affection -- thus, in sooth,
10. To lose the sense of losing. As a child,
11. Whose song-bird seeks the wood for evermore
12. Is sung to in its stead by mother's mouth
13. Till, sinking on her breast, love-reconciled,
14. He sleeps the faster that he wept before.
