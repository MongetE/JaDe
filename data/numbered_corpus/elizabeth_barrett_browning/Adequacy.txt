1. NOW, by the verdure on thy thousand hills,
2. Beloved England, doth the earth appear
3. Quite good enough for men to overbear
4. The will of God in, with rebellious wills !
5. We cannot say the morning-sun fulfils
6. Ingloriously its course, nor that the clear
7. Strong stars without significance insphere
8. Our habitation: we, meantime, our ills
9. Heap up against this good and lift a cry
10. Against this work-day world, this ill-spread feast,
11. As if ourselves were better certainly
12. Than what we come to. Maker and High Priest,
13. I ask thee not my joys to multiply,--
14. Only to make me worthier of the least.
