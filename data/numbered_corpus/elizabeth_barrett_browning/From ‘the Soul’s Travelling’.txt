1. God, God!
2. With a child’s voice I cry,
3. Weak, sad, confidingly—
4. God, God!
5. Thou knowest, eyelids, raised not always up
6. Unto Thy love (as none of ours are), droop
7. As ours, o’er many a tear!
8. Thou knowest, though Thy universe is broad,
9. Two little tears suffice to cover all:
10. Thou knowest, Thou, who art so prodigal
11. Of beauty, we are oft but stricken deer
12. Expiring in the woods—that care for none
13. Of those delightsome flowers they die upon.

14. O blissful Mouth which breathed the mournful breath
15. We name our souls, self-spoilt!—by that strong passion
16. Which paled Thee once with sighs,—by that strong death
17. Which made Thee once unbreathing—from the wrack
18. Themselves have called around them, call them back,
19. Back to Thee in continuous aspiration!
20. For here, O Lord,
21. For here they travel vainly,—vainly pass
22. From city-pavement to untrodden sward,
23. Where the lark finds her deep nest in the grass
24. Cold with the earth’s last dew. Yea, very vain
25. The greatest speed of all these souls of men
26. Unless they travel upward to the throne
27. Where sittest THOU, the satisfying ONE,
28. With help for sins and holy perfectings
29. For all requirements—while the archangel, raising
30. Unto Thy face his full ecstatic gazing,
31. Forgets the rush and rapture of his wings.
