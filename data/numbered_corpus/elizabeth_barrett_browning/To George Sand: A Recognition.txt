1. TRUE genius, but true woman ! dost deny
2. The woman's nature with a manly scorn
3. And break away the gauds and armlets worn
4. By weaker women in captivity?
5. Ah, vain denial ! that revolted cry
6. Is sobbed in by a woman's voice forlorn, _
7. Thy woman's hair, my sister, all unshorn
8. Floats back dishevelled strength in agony
9. Disproving thy man's name: and while before
10. The world thou burnest in a poet-fire,
11. We see thy woman-heart beat evermore
12. Through the large flame. Beat purer, heart, and higher,
13. Till God unsex thee on the heavenly shore
14. Where unincarnate spirits purely aspire !
