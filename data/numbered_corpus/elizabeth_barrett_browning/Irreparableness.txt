1. I HAVE been in the meadows all the day
2. And gathered there the nosegay that you see
3. Singing within myself as bird or bee
4. When such do field-work on a morn of May.
5. But, now I look upon my flowers, decay
6. Has met them in my hands more fatally
7. Because more warmly clasped,--and sobs are free
8. To come instead of songs. What do you say,
9. Sweet counsellors, dear friends ? that I should go
10. Back straightway to the fields and gather more ?
11. Another, sooth, may do it, but not I !
12. My heart is very tired, my strength is low,
13. My hands are full of blossoms plucked before,
14. Held dead within them till myself shall die.
