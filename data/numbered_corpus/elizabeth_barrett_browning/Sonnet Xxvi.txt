1. I lived with visions for my company
2. Instead of men and women, years ago,
3. And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
4. A sweefer music than they played to me.
5. But soon their trailing purple was not free
6. Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,
7. And I myself grew faint and blind below
8. Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst come--to be,
9. Beloved, what they seemed. Their shining fronts,
10. Their songs, their splendors (better, yet the same,
11. As river-water hallowed into fonts),
12. Met in thee, and from out thee overcame
13. My soul with satisfaction of all wants:
14. Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.
