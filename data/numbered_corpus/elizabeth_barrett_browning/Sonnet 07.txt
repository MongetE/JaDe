1. VII

2. The face of all the world is changed, I think,
3. Since first I heard the footsteps of thy soul
4. Move still, oh, still, beside me, as they stole
5. Betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
6. Of obvious death, where I, who thought to sink,
7. Was caught up into love, and taught the whole
8. Of life in a new rhythm. The cup of dole
9. God gave for baptism, I am fain to drink,
10. And praise its sweetness, Sweet, with thee anear.
11. The names of country, heaven, are changed away
12. For where thou art or shalt be, there or here;
13. And this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday,
14. (The singing angels know) are only dear
15. Because thy name moves right in what they say.
