1. THOU large-brained woman and large-hearted man,
2. Self-called George Sand ! whose soul, amid the lions
3. Of thy tumultuous senses, moans defiance
4. And answers roar for roar, as spirits can:
5. I would some mild miraculous thunder ran
6. Above the applauded circus, in appliance
7. Of thine own nobler nature's strength and science,
8. Drawing two pinions, white as wings of swan,
9. From thy strong shoulders, to amaze the place
10. With holier light ! that thou to woman's claim
11. And man's, mightst join beside the angel's grace
12. Of a pure genius sanctified from blame
13. Till child and maiden pressed to thine embrace
14. To kiss upon thy lips a stainless fame.
