1. You see this dog. It was but yesterday
2. I mused, forgetful of his presence here,
3. Till thought on thought drew downward tear on tear;
4. When from the pillow, where wet-cheeked I lay,
5. A head as hairy as Faunus, thrust its way
6. Right sudden against my face,—two golden-clear
7. Large eyes astonished mine,—a drooping ear
8. Did flap me on either cheek, to dry the spray!
9. I started first, as some Arcadian
10. Amazed by goatly god in twilight grove:
11. But as my bearded vision closelier ran
12. My tears off, I knew Flush, and rose above
13. Surprise and sadness; thanking the true Pan,
14. Who, by low creatures, leads to heights of love.
