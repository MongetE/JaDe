1. Say over again, and yet once over again,
2. That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated
3. Should seem ' a cuckoo-song,' as thou dost treat it,
4. Remember, never to the hill or plain,
5. Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain
6. Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
7. Beloved, I, amid the darkness greeted
8. By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain
9. Cry, ' Speak once more--thou lovest ! ' Who can fear
10. Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,
11. Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year ?
12. Say thou dost love me, love me, love me--toll
13. The silver iterance !--only minding, Dear,
14. To love me also in silence with thy soul.
