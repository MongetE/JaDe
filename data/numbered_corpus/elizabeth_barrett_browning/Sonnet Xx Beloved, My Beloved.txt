1. Beloved, my Beloved, when I think
2. That thou wast in the world a year ago,
3. What time I sat alone here in the snow
4. And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink
5. No moment at thy voice, but, link by link,
6. Went counting all my chains as if that so
7. They never could fall off at any blow
8. Struck by thy possible hand,- why, thus I drink
9. Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful,
10. Never to feel thee thrill the day or night
11. With personal act or speech,- nor ever cull
12. Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
13. Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull,
14. Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.
