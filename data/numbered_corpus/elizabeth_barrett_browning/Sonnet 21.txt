1. XXI

2. Say over again, and yet once over again,
3. That thou dost love me. Though the word repeated
4. Should seem 'a cuckoo-song,' as thou dost treat it,
5. Remember, never to the hill or plain,
6. Valley and wood, without her cuckoo-strain
7. Comes the fresh Spring in all her green completed.
8. Beloved, I, amid the darkness greeted
9. By a doubtful spirit-voice, in that doubt's pain
10. Cry, 'Speak once more—thou lovest! 'Who can fear
11. Too many stars, though each in heaven shall roll,
12. Too many flowers, though each shall crown the year?
13. Say thou dost love me, love me, love me—toll
14. The silver iterance!—only minding, Dear,
15. To love me also in silence with thy soul.
