1. And therefore if to love can be desert,
2. I am not all unworthy. Cheeks as pale
3. As these you see, and trembling knees that fail
4. To bear the burden of a heavy heart,--
5. This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
6. To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
7. To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale
8. A melancholy music,--why advert
9. To these things ? O Beloved, it is plain
10. I am not of thy worth nor for thy place !
11. And yet, because I love thee, I obtain
12. From that same love this vindicating grace,
13. To live on still in love, and yet in vain,--
14. To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.
