1. I LEFT thee last, a child at heart,
2. A woman scarce in years:
3. I come to thee, a solemn corpse
4. Which neither feels nor fears.
5. I have no breath to use in sighs;
6. They laid the dead-weights on mine eyes
7. To seal them safe from tears.

8. Look on me with thine own calm look:
9. I meet it calm as thou.
10. No look of thine can change this smile,
11. Or break thy sinful vow:
12. I tell thee that my poor scorn'd heart
13. Is of thine earth--thine earth--a part:
14. It cannot vex thee now.

15. I have pray'd for thee with bursting sob
16. When passion's course was free;
17. I have pray'd for thee with silent lips
18. In the anguish none could see;
19. They whisper'd oft, 'She sleepeth soft'--
20. But I only pray'd for thee.

21. Go to! I pray for thee no more:
22. The corpse's tongue is still;
23. Its folded fingers point to heaven,
24. But point there stiff and chill:
25. No farther wrong, no farther woe
26. Hath licence from the sin below
27. Its tranquil heart to thrill.

28. I charge thee, by the living's prayer,
29. And the dead's silentness,
30. To wring from out thy soul a cry
31. Which God shall hear and bless!
32. Lest Heaven's own palm droop in my hand,
33. And pale among the saints I stand,
34. A saint companionless.
