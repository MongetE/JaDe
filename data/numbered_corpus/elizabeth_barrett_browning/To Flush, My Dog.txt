1. Loving friend, the gift of one
2. Who her own true faith has run
3. Through thy lower nature,
4. Be my benediction said
5. With my hand upon thy head,
6. Gentle fellow-creature!

7. Like a lady's ringlets brown,
8. Flow thy silken ears adown
9. Either side demurely
10. Of thy silver-suited breast
11. Shining out from all the rest
12. Of thy body purely.

13. Darkly brown thy body is,
14. Till the sunshine striking this
15. Alchemise its dullness,
16. When the sleek curls manifold
17. Flash all over into gold
18. With a burnished fulness.

19. Underneath my stroking hand,
20. Startled eyes of hazel bland
21. Kindling, growing larger,
22. Up thou leapest with a spring,
23. Full of prank and curveting,
24. Leaping like a charger.

25. Leap! thy broad tail waves a light,
26. Leap! thy slender feet are bright,
27. Canopied in fringes;
28. Leap! those tasselled ears of thine
29. Flicker strangely, fair and fine
30. Down their golden inches

31. Yet, my pretty, sportive friend,
32. Little is't to such an end
33. That I praise thy rareness;
34. Other dogs may be thy peers
35. Haply in these drooping ears
36. And this glossy fairness.

37. But of thee it shall be said,
38. This dog watched beside a bed
39. Day and night unweary,
40. Watched within a curtained room
41. Where no sunbeam brake the gloom
42. Round the sick and dreary.

43. Roses, gathered for a vase,
44. In that chamber died apace,
45. Beam and breeze resigning;
46. This dog only, waited on,
47. Knowing that when light is gone
48. Love remains for shining.

49. Other dogs in thymy dew
50. Tracked the hares and followed through
51. Sunny moor or meadow;
52. This dog only, crept and crept
53. Next a languid cheek that slept,
54. Sharing in the shadow.

55. Other dogs of loyal cheer
56. Bounded at the whistle clear,
57. Up the woodside hieing;
58. This dog only, watched in reach
59. Of a faintly uttered speech
60. Or a louder sighing.

61. And if one or two quick tears
62. Dropped upon his glossy ears
63. Or a sigh came double,
64. Up he sprang in eager haste,
65. Fawning, fondling, breathing fast,
66. In a tender trouble.

67. And this dog was satisfied
68. If a pale thin hand would glide
69. Down his dewlaps sloping, -
70. Which he pushed his nose within,
71. After, -  platforming his chin
72. On the palm left open.

73. This dog, if a friendly voice
74. Call him now to blither choice
75. Than such chamber-keeping,
76. 'Come out! ' praying from the door, -
77. Presseth backward as before,
78. Up against me leaping.

79. Therefore to this dog will I,
80. Tenderly not scornfully,
81. Render praise and favor:
82. With my hand upon his head,
83. Is my benediction said
84. Therefore and for ever.

85. And because he loves me so,
86. Better than his kind will do
87. Often man or woman,
88. Give I back more love again
89. Than dogs often take of men,
90. Leaning from my Human.

91. Blessings on thee, dog of mine,
92. Pretty collars make thee fine,
93. Sugared milk make fat thee!
94. Pleasures wag on in thy tail,
95. Hands of gentle motion fail
96. Nevermore, to pat thee

97. Downy pillow take thy head,
98. Silken coverlid bestead,
99. Sunshine help thy sleeping!
100. No fly's buzzing wake thee up,
101. No man break thy purple cup
102. Set for drinking deep in.

103. Whiskered cats arointed flee,
104. Sturdy stoppers keep from thee
105. Cologne distillations;
106. Nuts lie in thy path for stones,
107. And thy feast-day macaroons
108. Turn to daily rations!

109. Mock I thee, in wishing weal? -
110. Tears are in my eyes to feel
111. Thou art made so straitly,
112. Blessing needs must straiten too, -
113. Little canst thou joy or do,
114. Thou who lovest greatly.

115. Yet be blessed to the height
116. Of all good and all delight
117. Pervious to thy nature;
118. Only loved beyond that line,
119. With a love that answers thine,
120. Loving fellow-creature!
