1. WHEN our two souls stand up erect and strong,
2. Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,
3. Until the lengthening wings break into fire
4. At either curving point,--what bitter wrong
5. Can the earth do us, that we should not long
6. Be here contented? Think! In mounting higher,
7. The angels would press on us, and aspire
8. To drop some golden orb of perfect song
9. Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay
10. Rather on earth, Beloved--where the unfit
11. Contrarious moods of men recoil away
12. And isolate pure spirits, and permit
13. A place to stand and love in for a day,
14. With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.
