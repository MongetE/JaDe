1. I count the dismal time by months and years
2. Since last I felt the green sward under foot,
3. And the great breath of all things summer-
4. Met mine upon my lips. Now earth appears
5. As strange to me as dreams of distant spheres
6. Or thoughts of Heaven we weep at. Nature's lute
7. Sounds on, behind this door so closely shut,
8. A strange wild music to the prisoner's ears,
9. Dilated by the distance, till the brain
10. Grows dim with fancies which it feels too
11. While ever, with a visionary pain,
12. Past the precluded senses, sweep and Rhine
13. Streams, forests, glades, and many a golden train
14. Of sunlit hills transfigured to Divine.
