1. And yet, because thou overcomest so,
2. Because thou art more noble and like a king,
3. Thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
4. Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow
5. Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
6. How it shook when alone. Why, conquering
7. May prove as lordly and complete a thing
8. In lifting upward, as in crushing low !
9. And as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
10. To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,
11. Even so, Beloved, I at last record,
12. Here ends my strife. If thou invite me forth,
13. I rise above abasement at the word.
14. Make thy love larger to enlarge my worth.
