1. XXXV

2. If I leave all for thee, wilt thou exchange
3. And be all to me? Shall I never miss
4. Home-talk and blessing and the common kiss
5. That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange,
6. When I look up, to drop on a new range
7. Of walls and floors, another home than this?
8. Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is
9. Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change?
10. That 's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried,
11. To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove;
12. For grief indeed is love and grief beside.
13. Alas, I have grieved sol am hard to love.
14. Yet love meâ€”wilt thou? Open thine heart wide,
15. And fold within the wet wings of thy dove.
