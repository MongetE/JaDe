1. How do I love thee ? Let me count the ways.
2. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
3. My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
4. For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
5. I love thee to the level of everyday's
6. Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
7. I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
8. I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
9. I love thee with the passion put to use
10. In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
11. I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
12. With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath,
13. Smiles, tears, of all my life !--and, if God choose,
14. I shall but love thee better after death.
