1. 1
2. He listened at the porch that day,
3. To hear the wheel go on, and on;
4. And then it stopped, ran back away,
5. While through the door he brought the sun:
6. But now my spinning is all done.

7. 2
8. He sat beside me, with an oath
9. That love ne'er ended, once begun;
10. I smiled--believing for us both,
11. What was the truth for only one:
12. And now my spinning is all done.

13. 3
14. My mother cursed me that I heard
15. A young man's wooing as I spun:
16. Thanks, cruel mother, for that word--
17. For I have, since, a harder known!
18. And now my spinning is all done.

19. 4
20. I thought--O God!--my first-born's cry
21. Both voices to mine ear would drown:
22. I listened in mine agony--
23. It was the silence made me groan!
24. And now my spinning is all done.

25. 5
26. Bury me 'twixt my mother's grave,
27. (Who cursed me on her death-bed lone)
28. And my dead baby's (God it save!)
29. Who, not to bless me, would not moan.
30. And now my spinning is all done.

31. 6
32. A stone upon my heart and head,
33. But no name written on the stone!
34. Sweet neighbours, whisper low instead,
35. "This sinner was a loving one--
36. And now her spinning is all done."

37. 7
38. And let the door ajar remain,
39. In case he should pass by anon;
40. And leave the wheel out very plain,--
41. That HE, when passing in the sun,
42. May see the spinning is all done.
