1. WE overstate the ills of life, and take
2. Imagination (given us to bring down
3. The choirs of singing angels overshone
4. By God's clear glory) down our earth to rake
5. The dismal snows instead, flake following flake,
6. To cover all the corn; we walk upon
7. The shadow of hills across a level thrown,
8. And pant like climbers: near the alder brake
9. We sigh so loud, the nightingale within
10. Refuses to sing loud, as else she would.
11. O brothers, let us leave the shame and sin
12. Of taking vainly, in a plaintive mood,
13. The holy name of GRIEF !--holy herein
14. That by the grief of ONE came all our good.
