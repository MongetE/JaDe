1. XXXI

2. Thou comest! all is said without a word.
3. I sit beneath thy looks, as children do
4. In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through
5. Their happy eyelids from an unaverred
6. Yet prodigal inward joy. Behold, I erred
7. In that last doubt! and yet I cannot rue
8. The sin most, but the occasionâ€”that we two
9. Should for a moment stand unministered
10. By a mutual presence. Ah, keep near and close,
11. Thou dovelike help! and, when my fears would rise,
12. With thy broad heart serenely interpose:
13. Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
14. These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,
15. Like callow birds left desert to the skies.
