1. THE seraph sings before the manifest
2. God-One, and in the burning of the Seven,
3. And with the full life of consummate
4. Heaving beneath him like a mother's
5. Warm with her first-born's slumber in that
6. The poet sings upon the earth grave-riven,
7. Before the naughty world, soon self-forgiven
8. For wronging him,--and in the darkness prest
9. From his own soul by worldly weights.
10. Even so,
11. Sing, seraph with the glory ! heaven is high;
12. Sing, poet with the sorrow ! earth is low:
13. The universe's inward voices cry
14. ' Amen ' to either song of joy and woe:
15. Sing, seraph,--poet,--sing on equally !
