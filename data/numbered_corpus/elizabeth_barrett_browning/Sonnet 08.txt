1. VIII

2. What can I give thee back, O liberal
3. And princely giver, who hast brought the gold
4. And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,
5. And laid them on the outside of the-wall
6. For such as I to take or leave withal,
7. In unexpected largesse? am I cold,
8. Ungrateful, that for these most manifold
9. High gifts, I render nothing back at all?
10. Not so; not cold,â€”but very poor instead.
11. Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run
12. The colors from my life, and left so dead
13. And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done
14. To give the same as pillow to thy head.
15. Go farther! let it serve to trample on.
