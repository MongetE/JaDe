1. I never gave a lock of hair away
2. To a man, dearest, except this to thee,
3. Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,
4. I ring out to the full brown length and say
5. Take it. My day of youth went yesterday;
6. My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
7. Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,
8. As girls do, any more: it only may
9. Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
10. Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
11. Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears
12. Would take this first, but Love is justified,--
13. Take it thou,--finding pure, from all those years,
14. The kiss my mother left here when she died.
