1. All are not taken; there are left behind
2. Living Belovèds, tender looks to bring
3. And make the daylight still a happy thing,
4. And tender voices, to make soft the wind:
5. But if it were not so—if I could find
6. No love in all this world for comforting,
7. Nor any path but hollowly did ring
8. Where 'dust to dust' the love from life disjoin'd;
9. And if, before those sepulchres unmoving
10. I stood alone (as some forsaken lamb
11. Goes bleating up the moors in weary dearth)
12. Crying 'Where are ye, O my loved and loving?'—
13. I know a voice would sound, 'Daughter, I AM.
14. Can I suffice for Heaven and not for earth?'
