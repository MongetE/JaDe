1. I

2. The face, which, duly as the sun,
3. Rose up for me with life begun,
4. To mark all bright hours of the day
5. With hourly love, is dimmed away—
6. And yet my days go on, go on.

7. II

8. The tongue which, like a stream, could run
9. Smooth music from the roughest stone,
10. And every morning with ' Good day'
11. Make each day good, is hushed away,
12. And yet my days go on, go on.

13. III

14. The heart which, like a staff, was one
15. For mine to lean and rest upon,
16. The strongest on the longest day
17. With steadfast love, is caught away,
18. And yet my days go on, go on.

19. IV

20. And cold before my summer's done,
21. And deaf in Nature's general tune,
22. And fallen too low for special fear,
23. And here, with hope no longer here,
24. While the tears drop, my days go on.

25. V

26. The world goes whispering to its own,
27. ‘This anguish pierces to the bone;’
28. And tender friends go sighing round,
29. ‘What love can ever cure this wound ?'
30. My days go on, my days go on.

31. VI

32. The past rolls forward on the sun
33. And makes all night. O dreams begun,
34. Not to be ended! Ended bliss,
35. And life that will not end in this!
36. My days go on, my days go on.

37. VII

38. Breath freezes on my lips to moan:
39. As one alone, once not alone,
40. I sit and knock at Nature's door,
41. Heart-bare, heart-hungry, very poor,
42. Whose desolated days go on.

43. VIII

44. I knock and cry, —Undone, undone!
45. Is there no help, no comfort, —none?
46. No gleaning in the wide wheat plains
47. Where others drive their loaded wains?
48. My vacant days go on, go on.

49. IX

50. This Nature, though the snows be down,
51. Thinks kindly of the bird of June:
52. The little red hip on the tree
53. Is ripe for such. What is for me,
54. Whose days so winterly go on?

55. X

56. No bird am I, to sing in June,
57. And dare not ask an equal boon.
58. Good nests and berries red are Nature's
59. To give away to better creatures, —
60. And yet my days go on, go on.

61. XI

62. I ask less kindness to be done, —
63. Only to loose these pilgrim shoon,
64. (Too early worn and grimed) with sweet
65. Cool deadly touch to these tired feet.
66. Till days go out which now go on.

67. XII

68. Only to lift the turf unmown
69. From off the earth where it has grown,
70. Some cubit-space, and say ‘Behold,
71. Creep in, poor Heart, beneath that fold,
72. Forgetting how the days go on.’


73. XIII

74. What harm would that do? Green anon
75. The sward would quicken, overshone
76. By skies as blue; and crickets might
77. Have leave to chirp there day and night
78. While my new rest went on, went on.

79. XIV

80. From gracious Nature have I won
81. Such liberal bounty? may I run
82. So, lizard-like, within her side,
83. And there be safe, who now am tried
84. By days that painfully go on?

85. XV

86. —A Voice reproves me thereupon,
87. More sweet than Nature's when the drone
88. Of bees is sweetest, and more deep
89. Than when the rivers overleap
90. The shuddering pines, and thunder on.

91. XVI

92. God's Voice, not Nature's! Night and noon
93. He sits upon the great white throne
94. And listens for the creatures' praise.
95. What babble we of days and days?
96. The Day-spring He, whose days go on.

97. XVII

98. He reigns above, He reigns alone;
99. Systems burn out and have his throne;
100. Fair mists of seraphs melt and fall
101. Around Him, changeless amid all,
102. Ancient of Days, whose days go on.

103. XVIII

104. He reigns below, He reigns alone,
105. And, having life in love forgone
106. Beneath the crown of sovran thorns,
107. He reigns the Jealous God. Who mourns
108. Or rules with Him, while days go on?

109. XIX

110. By anguish which made pale the sun,
111. I hear Him charge his saints that none
112. Among his creatures anywhere
113. Blaspheme against Him with despair,
114. However darkly days go on.

115. XX

116. Take from my head the thorn-wreath brown!
117. No mortal grief deserves that crown.
118. O supreme Love, chief misery,
119. The sharp regalia are for Thee
120. Whose days eternally go on!

121. XXI

122. For us, —whatever's undergone,
123. Thou knowest, willest what is done,
124. Grief may be joy misunderstood;
125. Only the Good discerns the good.
126. I trust Thee while my days go on.

127. XXII

128. Whatever's lost, it first was won;
129. We will not struggle nor impugn.
130. Perhaps the cup was broken here,
131. That Heaven's new wine might show more clear.
132. I praise Thee while my days go on.

133. XXIII

134. I praise Thee while my days go on;
135. I love Thee while my days go on:
136. Through dark and dearth, through fire and frost,
137. With emptied arms and treasure lost,
138. I thank Thee while my days go on.

139. XXIV

140. And having in thy life-depth thrown
141. Being and suffering (which are one),
142. As a child drops his pebble small
143. Down some deep well, and hears it fall
144. Smiling—so I. THY DAYS GO ON.
