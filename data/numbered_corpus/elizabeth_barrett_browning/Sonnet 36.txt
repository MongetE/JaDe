1. XXXVI

2. When we met first and loved, I did not build
3. Upon the event with marble. Could it mean
4. To last, a love set pendulous between
5. Sorrow and sorrow? Nay, I rather thrilled,
6. Distrusting every light that seemed to gild
7. The onward path, and feared to overlean
8. A finger even. And, though I have grown serene
9. And strong since then, I think that God has willed
10. A still renewable fear . . . O love, O troth . . .
11. Lest these enclasped hands should never hold,
12. This mutual kiss drop down between us both
13. As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold.
14. And Love, be false! if he, to keep one oath,
15. Must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold.
