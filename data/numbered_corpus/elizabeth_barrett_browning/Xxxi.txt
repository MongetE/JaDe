1. Thou comest ! all is said without a word.
2. I sit beneath thy looks, as children do
3. In the noon-sun, with souls that tremble through
4. Their happy eyelids from an unaverred
5. Yet prodigal inward joy. Behold, I erred
6. In that last doubt ! and yet I cannot rue
7. The sin most, but the occasion--that we two
8. Should for a moment stand unministered
9. By a mutual presence. Ah, keep near and close,
10. Thou dovelike help ! and, when my fears would rise,
11. With thy broad heart serenely interpose:
12. Brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
13. These thoughts which tremble when bereft of those,
14. Like callow birds left desert to the skies.
