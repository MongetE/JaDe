1. The first time that the sun rose on thine oath
2. To love me, I looked forward to the moon
3. To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
4. And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
5. Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
6. And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
7. For such man's love !--more like an out-of-tune
8. Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
9. To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
10. Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
11. I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
12. A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float
13. 'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,--
14. And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.
