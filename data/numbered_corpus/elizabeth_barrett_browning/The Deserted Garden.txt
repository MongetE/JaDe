1. I mind me in the days departed,
2. How often underneath the sun
3. With childish bounds I used to run
4. To a garden long deserted.

5. The beds and walks were vanished quite;
6. And wheresoe'er had struck the spade,
7. The greenest grasses Nature laid
8. To sanctify her right.

9. I called the place my wilderness,
10. For no one entered there but I;
11. The sheep looked in, the grass to espy,
12. And passed it ne'ertheless.

13. The trees were interwoven wild,
14. And spread their boughs enough about
15. To keep both sheep and shepherd out,
16. But not a happy child.

17. Adventurous joy it was for me!
18. I crept beneath the boughs, and found
19. A circle smooth of mossy ground
20. Beneath a poplar tree.

21. Old garden rose-trees hedged it in,
22. Bedropt with roses waxen-white
23. Well satisfied with dew and light
24. And careless to be seen.

25. Long years ago it might befall,
26. When all the garden flowers were trim,
27. The grave old gardener prided him
28. On these the most of all.

29. Some lady, stately overmuch,
30. Here moving with a silken noise,
31. Has blushed beside them at the voice
32. That likened her to such.

33. And these, to make a diadem,
34. She often may have plucked and twined,
35. Half-smiling as it came to mind
36. That few would look at them.

37. Oh, little thought that lady proud,
38. A child would watch her fair white rose,
39. When buried lay her whiter brows,
40. And silk was changed for shroud!

41. Nor thought that gardener, (full of scorns
42. For men unlearned and simple phrase,)
43. A child would bring it all its praise
44. By creeping through the thorns!

45. To me upon my low moss seat,
46. Though never a dream the roses sent
47. Of science or love's compliment,
48. I ween they smelt as sweet.

49. It did not move my grief to see
50. The trace of human step departed:
51. Because the garden was deserted,
52. The blither place for me!

53. Friends, blame me not! a narrow ken
54. Has childhood 'twixt the sun and sward;
55. We draw the moral afterward,
56. We feel the gladness then.

57. And gladdest hours for me did glide
58. In silence at the rose-tree wall:
59. A thrush made gladness musical
60. Upon the other side.

61. Nor he nor I did e'er incline
62. To peck or pluck the blossoms white;
63. How should I know but roses might
64. Lead lives as glad as mine?

65. To make my hermit-home complete,
66. I brought dear water from the spring
67. Praised in its own low murmuring,
68. And cresses glossy wet.

69. And so, I thought, my likeness grew
70. (Without the melancholy tale)
71. To 'Gentle Hermit of the Dale,'
72. And Angelina too.

73. For oft I read within my nook
74. Such minstrel stories; till the breeze
75. Made sounds poetic in the trees,
76. And then I shut the book.

77. If I shut this wherein I write
78. I hear no more the wind athwart
79. Those trees, nor feel that childish heart
80. Delighting in delight.

81. My childhood from my life is parted,
82. My footstep from the moss which drew
83. Its fairy circle round: anew
84. The garden is deserted.

85. Another thrush may there rehearse
86. The madrigals which sweetest are;
87. No more for me! myself afar
88. Do sing a sadder verse.

89. Ah me, ah me! when erst I lay
90. In that child's-nest so greenly wrought,
91. I laughed unto myself and thought
92. 'The time will pass away.'

93. And still I laughed, and did not fear
94. But that, whene'er was past away
95. The childish time, some happier play
96. My womanhood would cheer.

97. I knew the time would pass away,
98. And yet, beside the rose-tree wall,
99. Dear God, how seldom, if at all,
100. Did I look up to pray!

101. The time is past; and now that grows
102. The cypress high among the trees,
103. And I behold white sepulchres
104. As well as the white rose, --

105. When graver, meeker thoughts are given,
106. And I have learnt to lift my face,
107. Reminded how earth's greenest place
108. The color draws from heaven, --

109. It something saith for earthly pain,
110. But more for Heavenly promise free,
111. That I who was, would shrink to be
112. That happy child again.
