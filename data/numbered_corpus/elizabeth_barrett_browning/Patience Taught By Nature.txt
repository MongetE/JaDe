1. 'O DREARY life,' we cry, ' O dreary life ! '
2. And still the generations of the birds
3. Sing through our sighing, and the flocks and herds
4. Serenely live while we are keeping strife
5. With Heaven's true purpose in us, as a knife
6. Against which we may struggle ! Ocean girds
7. Unslackened the dry land, savannah-swards
8. Unweary sweep, hills watch unworn, and rife
9. Meek leaves drop year]y from the forest-trees
10. To show, above, the unwasted stars that pass
11. In their old glory: O thou God of old,
12. Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these !--
13. But so much patience as a blade of grass
14. Grows by, contented through the heat and cold.
