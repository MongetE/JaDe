8. From myself—me—that I should bring thee proof
9. In words, of love hid in me out of reach.
10. Nay, let the silence of my womanhood
11. Commend my woman-love to thy belief,—
12. Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,
13. And rend the garment of my life, in brief,
14. By a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude,
15. Lest one touch of this heart convey its grief
