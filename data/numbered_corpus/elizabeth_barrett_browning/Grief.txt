1. I TELL you, hopeless grief is passionless;
2. That only men incredulous of despair,
3. Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air
4. Beat upward to God's throne in loud access
5. Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,
6. In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare
7. Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare
8. Of the absolute Heavens. Deep-hearted man, express
9. Grief for thy Dead in silence like to death--
10. Most like a monumental statue set
11. In everlasting watch and moveless woe
12. Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.
13. Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:
14. If it could weep, it could arise and go.
