1. With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee
2. As those, when thou shalt call me by my name--
3. Lo, the vain promise ! is the same, the same,
4. Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy ?
5. When called before, I told how hastily
6. I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game,
7. To run and answer with the smile that came
8. At play last moment, and went on with me
9. Through my obedience. When I answer now,
10. I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;
11. Yet still my heart goes to thee--ponder how--
12. Not as to a single good, but all my good !
13. Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow
14. That no child's foot could run fast as this blood.
