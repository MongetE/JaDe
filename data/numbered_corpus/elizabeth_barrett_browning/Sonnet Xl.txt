1. Oh, yes ! they love through all this world of ours !
2. I will not gainsay love, called love forsooth.
3. I have heard love talked in my early youth,
4. And since, not so long back but that the flowers
5. Then gathered, smell still. Mussulmans and Giaours
6. Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth
7. For any weeping. Polypheme's white tooth
8. Slips on the nut if, after frequent showers,
9. The shell is over-smooth,--and not so much
10. Will turn the thing called love, aside to hate
11. Or else to oblivion. But thou art not such
12. A lover, my Beloved ! thou canst wait
13. Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch,
14. And think it soon when others cry ' Too late.'
