1. The woman singeth at her spinning-wheel
2. A pleasant chant, ballad or barcarole;
3. She thinketh of her song, upon the whole,
4. Far more than of her flax; and yet the reel
5. Is full, and artfully her fingers feel
6. With quick adjustment, provident control,
7. The lines--too subtly twisted to unroll--
8. Out to a perfect thread. I hence appeal
9. To the dear Christian Church--that we may do
10. Our Father's business in these temples mirk,
11. Thus swift and steadfast, thus intent and strong;
12. While thus, apart from toil, our souls pursue
13. Some high calm spheric tune, and prove our work
14. The better for the sweetness of our song.
