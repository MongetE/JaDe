1. I see thine image through my tears to-night,
2. And yet to-day I saw thee smiling. How
3. Refer the cause ?--Beloved, is it thou
4. Or I, who makes me sad ? The acolyte
5. Amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
6. May so fall flat, with pale insensate brow,
7. On the altar-stair. I hear thy voice and vow,
8. Perplexed, uncertain, since thou art out of sight,
9. As he, in his swooning ears, the choir's Amen.
10. Beloved, dost thou love ? or did I see all
11. The glory as I dreamed, and fainted when
12. Too vehement light dilated my ideal,
13. For my soul's eyes ? Will that light come again,
14. As now these tears come--falling hot and real ?
