1. Said a people to a poet---' Go out from among us straightway!
2. While we are thinking earthly things, thou singest of divine.
3. There's a little fair brown nightingale, who, sitting in the gateways
4. Makes fitter music to our ears than any song of thine!'

5. The poet went out weeping---the nightingale ceased chanting;
6. 'Now, wherefore, O thou nightingale, is all thy sweetness done?'
7. I cannot sing my earthly things, the heavenly poet wanting,
8. Whose highest harmony includes the lowest under sun.'

9. The poet went out weeping,---and died abroad, bereft there---
10. The bird flew to his grave and died, amid a thousand wails:---
11. And, when I last came by the place, I swear the music left there
12. Was only of the poet's song, and not the nightingale's.
