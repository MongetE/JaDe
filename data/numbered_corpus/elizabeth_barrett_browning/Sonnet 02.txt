1. II

2. But only three in all God's universe
3. Have heard this word thou hast said,—Himself, beside
4. Thee speaking, and me listening! and replied
5. One of us . . . that was God, . . . and laid the curse
6. So darkly on my eyelids, as to amerce
7. My sight from seeing thee,—that if I had died,
8. The deathweights, placed there, would have signified
9. Less absolute exclusion. 'Nay' is worse
10. From God than from all others, O my friend!
11. Men could not part us with their worldly jars,
12. Nor the seas change us, nor the tempests bend;
13. Our hands would touch for all the mountain-bars:
14. And, heaven being rolled between us at the end,
15. We should but vow the faster for the stars.
