1. Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
2. And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
3. Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
4. Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
5. And love is fire. And when I say at need
6. I love thee...mark!...I love thee--in thy sight
7. I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
8. With conscience of the new rays that proceed
9. Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
10. In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
11. Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
12. And what I feel, across the inferior features
13. Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
14. How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.
