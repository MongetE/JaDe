1. I

2. Love me Sweet, with all thou art,
3. Feeling, thinking, seeing;
4. Love me in the lightest part,
5. Love me in full being.

6. II

7. Love me with thine open youth
8. In its frank surrender;
9. With the vowing of thy mouth,
10. With its silence tender.

11. III

12. Love me with thine azure eyes,
13. Made for earnest grantings;
14. Taking colour from the skies,
15. Can Heaven's truth be wanting?

16. IV

17. Love me with their lids, that fall
18. Snow-like at first meeting;
19. Love me with thine heart, that all
20. Neighbours then see beating.

21. V

22. Love me with thine hand stretched out
23. Freely -- open-minded:
24. Love me with thy loitering foot, --
25. Hearing one behind it.

26. VI

27. Love me with thy voice, that turns
28. Sudden faint above me;
29. Love me with thy blush that burns
30. When I murmur 'Love me!'

31. VII

32. Love me with thy thinking soul,
33. Break it to love-sighing;
34. Love me with thy thoughts that roll
35. On through living -- dying.

36. VIII

37. Love me in thy gorgeous airs,
38. When the world has crowned thee;
39. Love me, kneeling at thy prayers,
40. With the angels round thee.

41. IX

42. Love me pure, as muses do,
43. Up the woodlands shady:
44. Love me gaily, fast and true,
45. As a winsome lady.

46. X

47. Through all hopes that keep us brave,
48. Farther off or nigher,
49. Love me for the house and grave,
50. And for something higher.

51. XI

52. Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear,
53. Woman's love no fable,
54. I will love thee -- half a year --
55. As a man is able.
