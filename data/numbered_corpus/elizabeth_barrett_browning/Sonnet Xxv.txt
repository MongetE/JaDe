1. A heavy heart, Beloved, have I borne
2. From year to year until I saw thy face,
3. And sorrow after sorrow took the place
4. Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
5. As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn
6. By a beating heart at dance-time. Hopes apace
7. Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace
8. Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
9. My heavy heart. Then thou didst bid me bring
10. And let it drop adown thy calmly great
11. Deep being ! Fast it sinketh, as a thing
12. Which its own nature doth precipitate,
13. While thine doth close above it, mediating
14. Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.
