1. XXVI


2. I lived with visions for my company
3. Instead of men and women, years ago,
4. And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
5. A sweeter music than they played to me.
6. But soon their trailing purple was not free
7. Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,
8. And I myself grew faint and blind below
9. Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst comeâ€”to be,
10. Beloved, what they seemed. Their shining fronts,
11. Their songs, their splendors (better, yet the same,
12. As river-water hallowed into fonts),
13. Met in thee, and from out thee overcame
14. My soul with satisfaction of all wants:
15. Because God's gifts put man's best dreams to shame.
