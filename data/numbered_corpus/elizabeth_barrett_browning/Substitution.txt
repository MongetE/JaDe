1. WHEN some beloved voice that was to you
2. Both sound and sweetness, faileth suddenly,
3. And silence, against which you dare not cry,
4. Aches round you like a strong disease and new--
5. What hope ? what help ? what music will undo
6. That silence to your sense ? Not friendship's sigh,
7. Not reason's subtle count; not melody
8. Of viols, nor of pipes that Faunus blew;
9. Not songs of poets, nor of nightingales
10. Whose hearts leap upward through the cypress-trees
11. To the clear moon; nor yet the spheric laws
12. Self-chanted, nor the angels' sweet ' All hails,'
13. Met in the smile of God: nay, none of these.
14. Speak THOU, availing Christ !--and fill this pause.
