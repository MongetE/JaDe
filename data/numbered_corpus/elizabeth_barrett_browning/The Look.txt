1. The Saviour looked on Peter. Ay, no word,
2. No gesture of reproach; the Heavens serene
3. Though heavy with armed justice, did not lean
4. Their thunders that way: the forsaken Lord
5. Looked only, on the traitor. None record
6. What that look was, none guess; for those who have seen
7. Wronged lovers loving through a death-pang keen,
8. Or pale-cheeked martyrs smiling to a sword,
9. Have missed Jehovah at the judgment-call.
10. And Peter, from the height of blasphemy--
11. 'I never knew this man '--did quail and fall
12. As knowing straight THAT GOD; and turned free
13. And went out speechless from the face of all
14. And filled the silenc, weeping bitterly.
