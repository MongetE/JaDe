1. I

2. I thought once how Theocritus had sung
3. Of the sweet years, the dear and wished-for years,
4. Who each one in a gracious hand appears
5. To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:
6. And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
7. I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,
8. The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
9. Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
10. A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,
11. So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
12. Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair:
13. And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,—
14. 'Guess now who holds thee? '—' Death,' I said. But, there,
15. The silver answer rang,—' Not Death, but Love.'
