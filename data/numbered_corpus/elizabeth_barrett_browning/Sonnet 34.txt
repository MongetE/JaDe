1. XXXIV

2. With the same heart, I said, I'll answer thee
3. As those, when thou shalt call me by my name—
4. Lo, the vain promise! is the same, the same,
5. Perplexed and ruffled by life's strategy?
6. When called before, I told how hastily
7. I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game,
8. To run and answer with the smile that came
9. At play last moment, and went on with me
10. Through my obedience. When I answer now,
11. I drop a grave thought, break from solitude;
12. Yet still my heart goes to thee—ponder how—
13. Not as to a single good, but all my good!
14. Lay thy hand on it, best one, and allow
15. That no child's foot could run fast as this blood.
