1. I THOUGHT once how Theocritus had sung
2. Of the sweet years, the dear and wish'd-for years,
3. Who each one in a gracious hand appears
4. To bear a gift for mortals old or young:
5. And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
6. I saw in gradual vision through my tears
7. The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years--
8. Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
9. A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,
10. So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
11. Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair;
12. And a voice said in mastery, while I strove,
13. 'Guess now who holds thee?'--'Death,' I said. But there
14. The silver answer rang--'Not Death, but Love.'
