1. My dear Belov√®d, who hast lifted me
2. From this drear flat of earth where I was thrown,
3. And, in betwixt the languid ringlets, blown
4. A life-breath, till the forehead hopefully
5. Shines out again, as all the angels see,
6. Before thy saving kiss! My own, my own,
7. Who camest to me when the world was gone,
8. And I who looked for only God, found thee!
9. I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad.
10. As one who stands in dewless asphodel
11. Looks backward on the tedious time he had
12. In the upper life,--so I, with bosom-swell,
13. Make witness, here, between the good and bad,
14. That Love, as strong as Death, retrieves as well.
