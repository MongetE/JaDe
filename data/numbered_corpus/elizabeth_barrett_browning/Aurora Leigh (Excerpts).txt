1. [Book 1]
2. I am like,
3. They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows
4. Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth
5. Of delicate features, -- paler, near as grave ;
6. But then my mother's smile breaks up the whole,
7. And makes it better sometimes than itself.
8. So, nine full years, our days were hid with God
9. Among his mountains : I was just thirteen,
10. Still growing like the plants from unseen roots
11. In tongue-tied Springs, -- and suddenly awoke
12. To full life and life 's needs and agonies,
13. With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside
14. A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,
15. Makes awful lightning. His last word was, `Love --'
16. `Love, my child, love, love !' -- (then he had done with grief)
17. `Love, my child.' Ere I answered he was gone,
18. And none was left to love in all the world.
19. There, ended childhood. What succeeded next
20. I recollect as, after fevers, men
21. Thread back the passage of delirium,
22. Missing the turn still, baffled by the door ;
23. Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives ;
24. A weary, wormy darkness, spurr'd i' the flank
25. With flame, that it should eat and end itself
26. Like some tormented scorpion. Then at last
27. I do remember clearly, how there came
28. A stranger with authority, not right,
29. (I thought not) who commanded, caught me up
30. From old Assunta's neck ; how, with a shriek,
31. She let me go, -- while I, with ears too full
32. Of my father's silence, to shriek back a word,
33. In all a child's astonishment at grief
34. Stared at the wharf-edge where she stood and moaned,
35. My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned !
36. The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,
37. Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck,
38. Like one in anger drawing back her skirts
39. Which supplicants catch at. Then the bitter sea
40. Inexorably pushed between us both,
41. And sweeping up the ship with my despair
42. Threw us out as a pasture to the stars.
43. Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep ;
44. Ten nights and days, without the common face
45. Of any day or night ; the moon and sun
46. Cut off from the green reconciling earth,
47. To starve into a blind ferocity
48. And glare unnatural ; the very sky
49. (Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea
50. As if no human heart should 'scape alive,)
51. Bedraggled with the desolating salt,
52. Until it seemed no more that holy heaven
53. To which my father went. All new and strange
54. The universe turned stranger, for a child.
55. Then, land ! -- then, England ! oh, the frosty cliffs
56. Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home
57. Among those mean red houses through the fog ?
58. And when I heard my father's language first
59. From alien lips which had no kiss for mine
60. I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,
61. And some one near me said the child was mad
62. Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on.
63. Was this my father's England ? the great isle ?
64. The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship
65. Of verdure, field from field, as man from man ;
66. The skies themselves looked low and positive,
67. As almost you could touch them with a hand,
68. And dared to do it they were so far off
69. From God's celestial crystals ; all things blurred
70. And dull and vague. Did Shakspeare and his mates
71. Absorb the light here ? -- not a hill or stone
72. With heart to strike a radiant colour up
73. Or active outline on the indifferent air.
74. I think I see my father's sister stand
75. Upon the hall-step of her country-house
76. To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,
77. Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight
78. As if for taming accidental thoughts
79. From possible pulses ; brown hair pricked with grey
80. By frigid use of life, (she was not old
81. Although my father's elder by a year)
82. A nose drawn sharply yet in delicate lines ;
83. A close mild mouth, a little soured about
84. The ends, through speaking unrequited loves
85. Or peradventure niggardly half-truths ;
86. Eyes of no colour, -- once they might have smiled,
87. But never, never have forgot themselves
88. In smiling ; cheeks, in which was yet a rose
89. Of perished summers, like a rose in a book,
90. Kept more for ruth than pleasure, -- if past bloom,
91. Past fading also.
92. She had lived, we'll say,
93. A harmless life, she called a virtuous life,
94. A quiet life, which was not life at all,
95. (But that, she had not lived enough to know)
96. Between the vicar and the country squires,
97. The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes
98. From the empyrean to assure their souls
99. Against chance-vulgarisms, and, in the abyss
100. The apothecary, looked on once a year
101. To prove their soundness of humility.
102. The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts
103. Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,
104. Because we are of one flesh after all
105. And need one flannel (with a proper sense
106. Of difference in the quality) -- and still
107. The book-club, guarded from your modern trick
108. Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease,
109. Preserved her intellectual. She had lived
110. A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,
111. Accounting that to leap from perch to perch
112. Was act and joy enough for any bird.
113. Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live
114. In thickets, and eat berries !
115. I, alas,
116. A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,
117. And she was there to meet me. Very kind.
118. Bring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.
119. She stood upon the steps to welcome me,
120. Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck, --
121. Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool
122. To draw the new light closer, catch and cling
123. Less blindly. In my ears, my father's word
124. Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,
125. `Love, love, my child.' She, black there with my grief,
126. Might feel my love -- she was his sister once,
127. I clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved,
128. Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,
129. And drew me feebly through the hall into
130. The room she sate in.
131. There, with some strange spasm
132. Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands
133. Imperiously, and held me at arm's length,
134. And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes
135. Searched through my face, -- ay, stabbed it through and through,
136. Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find
137. A wicked murderer in my innocent face,
138. If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,
139. She struggled for her ordinary calm
140. And missed it rather, -- told me not to shrink,
141. As if she had told me not to lie or swear, --
142. `She loved my father, and would love me too
143. As long as I deserved it.' Very kind.

145. AURORA LEIGH, be humble. Shall I hope
146. To speak my poems in mysterious tune
147. With man and nature ? -- with the lava-lymph
148. That trickles from successive galaxies
149. Still drop by drop adown the finger of God
150. In still new worlds ? -- with summer-days in this ?
151. That scarce dare breathe they are so beautiful ?--
152. With spring's delicious trouble in the ground,
153. Tormented by the quickened blood of roots,
154. And softly pricked by golden crocus-sheaves
155. In token of the harvest-time of flowers ?--
156. With winters and with autumns, -- and beyond,
157. With the human heart's large seasons, when it hopes
158. And fears, joys, grieves, and loves ? -- with all that strain
159. Of sexual passion, which devours the flesh
160. In a sacrament of souls ? with mother's breasts
161. Which, round the new-made creatures hanging there,
162. Throb luminous and harmonious like pure spheres ? --
163. With multitudinous life, and finally
164. With the great escapings of ecstatic souls,
165. Who, in a rush of too long prisoned flame,
166. Their radiant faces upward, burn away
167. This dark of the body, issuing on a world,
168. Beyond our mortal ? -- can I speak my verse
169. Sp plainly in tune to these things and the rest,
170. That men shall feel it catch them on the quick,
171. As having the same warrant over them
172. To hold and move them if they will or no,
173. Alike imperious as the primal rhythm
174. Of that theurgic nature ? I must fail,
175. Who fail at the beginning to hold and move
176. One man, -- and he my cousin, and he my friend,
177. And he born tender, made intelligent,
178. Inclined to ponder the precipitous sides
179. Of difficult questions ; yet, obtuse to me,
180. Of me, incurious ! likes me very well,
181. And wishes me a paradise of good,
182. Good looks, good means, and good digestion, -- ay,
183. But otherwise evades me, puts me off
184. With kindness, with a tolerant gentleness, --
185. Too light a book for a grave man's reading ! Go,
186. Aurora Leigh : be humble.
187. There it is,
188. We women are too apt to look to One,
189. Which proves a certain impotence in art.
190. We strain our natures at doing something great,
191. Far less because it 's something great to do,
192. Than haply that we, so, commend ourselves
193. As being not small, and more appreciable
194. To some one friend. We must have mediators
195. Betwixt our highest conscience and the judge ;
196. Some sweet saint's blood must quicken in our palms
197. Or all the life in heaven seems slow and cold :
198. Good only being perceived as the end of good,
199. And God alone pleased, -- that's too poor, we think,
200. And not enough for us by any means.
201. Ay, Romney, I remember, told me once
202. We miss the abstract when we comprehend.
203. We miss it most when we aspire, -- and fail.
204. Yet, so, I will not. -- This vile woman's way
205. Of trailing garments, shall not trip me up :
206. I 'll have no traffic with the personal thought
207. In art's pure temple. Must I work in vain,
208. Without the approbation of a man ?
209. It cannot be ; it shall not. Fame itself,
210. That approbation of the general race,
211. Presents a poor end, (though the arrow speed,
212. Shot straight with vigorous finger to the white,)
213. And the highest fame was never reached except
214. By what was aimed above it. Art for art,
215. And good for God Himself, the essential Good !
216. We 'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,
217. Although our woman-hands should shake and fail ;
218. And if we fail .. But must we ? --
219. Shall I fail ?
220. The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,
221. `Let no one be called happy till his death.'
222. To which I add, -- Let no one till his death
223. Be called unhappy. Measure not the work
224. Until the day 's out and the labour done,
225. Then bring your gauges. If the day's work 's scant,
226. Why, call it scant ; affect no compromise ;
227. And, in that we have nobly striven at least,
228. Deal with us nobly, women though we be.
229. And honour us with truth if not with praise.
