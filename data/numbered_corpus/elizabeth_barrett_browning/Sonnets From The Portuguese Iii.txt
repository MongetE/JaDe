1. GO from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand
2. Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore
3. Alone upon the threshold of my door
4. Of individual life I shall command
5. The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
6. Serenely in the sunshine as before,
7. Without the sense of that which I forbore--
8. Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land
9. Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
10. With pulses that beat double. What I do
11. And what I dream include thee, as the wine
12. Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue
13. God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
14. And sees within my eyes the tears of two.
