1. Thou indeed, little Swallow,
2. A sweet yearly comer.
3. Art building a hollow
4. New nest every summer.
5. And straight dost depart
6. Where no gazing can follow.
7. Past Memphis, down Nile!
8. Ay! but love all the while
9. Builds his nest in my heart,
10. Through the cold winter-weeks:
11. And as one Love takes flight.
12. Comes another, O Swallow,
13. In an egg warm and white,
14. And another is callow.
15. And the large gaping beaks
16. Chirp all day and all night:
17. And the Loves who are older
18. Help the young and the poor Loves,
19. And the young Loves grown bolder
20. Increase by the score Lovesâ€”
21. Why, what can be done?
22. If a noise comes from one.
23. Can I bear all this rout of a hundred and more Loves?
