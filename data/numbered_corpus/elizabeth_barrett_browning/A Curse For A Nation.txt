1. I heard an angel speak last night,
2. And he said 'Write!
3. Write a Nation's curse for me,
4. And send it over the Western Sea.'

5. I faltered, taking up the word:
6. 'Not so, my lord!
7. If curses must be, choose another
8. To send thy curse against my brother.

9. 'For I am bound by gratitude,
10. By love and blood,
11. To brothers of mine across the sea,
12. Who stretch out kindly hands to me.'

13. 'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write
14. My curse to-night.
15. From the summits of love a curse is driven,
16. As lightning is from the tops of heaven.'

17. 'Not so,' I answered. 'Evermore
18. My heart is sore
19. For my own land's sins: for little feet
20. Of children bleeding along the street:

21. 'For parked-up honors that gainsay
22. The right of way:
23. For almsgiving through a door that is
24. Not open enough for two friends to kiss:

25. 'For love of freedom which abates
26. Beyond the Straits:
27. For patriot virtue starved to vice on
28. Self-praise, self-interest, and suspicion:

29. 'For an oligarchic parliament,
30. And bribes well-meant.
31. What curse to another land assign,
32. When heavy-souled for the sins of mine?'

33. 'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write
34. My curse to-night.
35. Because thou hast strength to see and hate
36. A foul thing done within thy gate.'

37. 'Not so,' I answered once again.
38. 'To curse, choose men.
39. For I, a woman, have only known
40. How the heart melts and the tears run down.'

41. 'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write
42. My curse to-night.
43. Some women weep and curse, I say
44. (And no one marvels), night and day.

45. 'And thou shalt take their part to-night,
46. Weep and write.
47. A curse from the depths of womanhood
48. Is very salt, and bitter, and good.'

49. So thus I wrote, and mourned indeed,
50. What all may read.
51. And thus, as was enjoined on me,
52. I send it over the Western Sea.

53. The Curse

54. Because ye have broken your own chain
55. With the strain
56. Of brave men climbing a Nation's height,
57. Yet thence bear down with brand and thong
58. On souls of others, -- for this wrong
59. This is the curse. Write.
60. Because yourselves are standing straight
61. In the state
62. Of Freedom's foremost acolyte,
63. Yet keep calm footing all the time
64. On writhing bond-slaves, -- for this crime
65. This is the curse. Write.
66. Because ye prosper in God's name,
67. With a claim
68. To honor in the old world's sight,
69. Yet do the fiend's work perfectly
70. In strangling martyrs, -- for this lie
71. This is the curse. Write.
72. Ye shall watch while kings conspire
73. Round the people's smouldering fire,
74. And, warm for your part,
75. Shall never dare -- O shame!
76. To utter the thought into flame
77. Which burns at your heart.
78. This is the curse. Write.
79. Ye shall watch while nations strive
80. With the bloodhounds, die or survive,
81. Drop faint from their jaws,
82. Or throttle them backward to death;
83. And only under your breath
84. Shall favor the cause.
85. This is the curse. Write.
86. Ye shall watch while strong men draw
87. The nets of feudal law
88. To strangle the weak;
89. And, counting the sin for a sin,
90. Your soul shall be sadder within
91. Than the word ye shall speak.
92. This is the curse. Write.
93. When good men are praying erect
94. That Christ may avenge His elect
95. And deliver the earth,
96. The prayer in your ears, said low,
97. Shall sound like the tramp of a foe
98. That's driving you forth.
99. This is the curse. Write.
100. When wise men give you their praise,
101. They shall praise in the heat of the phrase,
102. As if carried too far.
103. When ye boast your own charters kept true,
104. Ye shall blush; for the thing which ye do
105. Derides what ye are.
106. This is the curse. Write.
107. When fools cast taunts at your gate,
108. Your scorn ye shall somewhat abate
109. As ye look o'er the wall;
110. For your conscience, tradition, and name
111. Explode with a deadlier blame
112. Than the worst of them all.
113. This is the curse. Write.
114. Go, wherever ill deeds shall be done,
115. Go, plant your flag in the sun
116. Beside the ill-doers!
117. And recoil from clenching the curse
118. Of God's witnessing Universe
119. With a curse of yours.
120. This is the curse. Write.
