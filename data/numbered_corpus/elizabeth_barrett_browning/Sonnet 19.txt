1. XIX

2. The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
3. I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
4. And from my poet's forehead to my heart
5. Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,â€”
6. As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
7. The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
8. The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . .
9. The bay-crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise,
10. Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black!
11. Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
12. I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
13. And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
14. Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
15. No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
