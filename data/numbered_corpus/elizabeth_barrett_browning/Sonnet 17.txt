1. XVII

2. My poet, thou canst touch on all the notes
3. God set between his After and Before,
4. And strike up and strike off the general roar
5. Of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
6. In a serene air purely. Antidotes
7. Of medicated music, answering for
8. Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour
9. From thence into their ears. God's will devotes
10. Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine.
11. How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?
12. A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine
13. Sad memory, with thy songs to interfuse?
14. A shade, in which to singâ€”of palm or pine?
15. A grave, on which to rest from singing? Choose.
