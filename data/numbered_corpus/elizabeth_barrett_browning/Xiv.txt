1. If thou must love me, let it be for nought
2. Except for love's sake only. Do not say
3. 'I love her for her smile--her look--her way
4. Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought
5. That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
6. A sense of pleasant ease on such a day'--
7. For these things in themselves, Beloved, may
8. Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,
9. May be unwrought so. Neither love me for
10. Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,--
11. A creature might forget to weep, who bore
12. Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby !
13. But love me for love's sake, that evermore
14. Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.
