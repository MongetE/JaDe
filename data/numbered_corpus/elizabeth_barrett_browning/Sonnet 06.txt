1. VI

2. Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand
3. Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore
4. Alone upon the threshold of my door
5. Of individual life, I shall command
6. The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
7. Serenely in the sunshine as before,
8. Without the sense of that which I forboreâ€”
9. Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land
10. Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
11. With pulses that beat double. What I do
12. And what I dream include thee, as the wine
13. Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue
14. God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
15. And sees within my eyes the tears of two.
