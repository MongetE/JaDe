1. IX

2. Can it be right to give what I can give?
3. To let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
4. As salt as mine, and hear the sighing years
5. Re-sighing on my lips renunciative
6. Through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
7. For all thy adjurations? O my fears,
8. That this can scarce be right! We are not peers,
9. So to be lovers; and I own, and grieve,
10. That givers of such gifts as mine are, must
11. Be counted with the ungenerous. Out, alas!
12. I will not soil thy purple with my dust,
13. Nor breathe my poison on thy Venice-glass,
14. Nor give thee any loveâ€”which were unjust.
15. Beloved, I only love thee! let it pass.
