1. XXIV

2. Let the world's sharpness, like a clasping knife,
3. Shut in upon itself and do no harm
4. In this close hand of Love, now soft and warm,
5. And let us hear no sound of human strife
6. After the click of the shutting. Life to lifeâ€”
7. I lean upon thee, Dear, without alarm,
8. And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
9. Against the stab of worldlings, who if rife
10. Are weak to injure. Very whitely still
11. The lilies of our lives may reassure
12. Their blossoms from their roots, accessible
13. Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer,
14. Growing straight, out of man's reach, on the hill.
15. God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.
