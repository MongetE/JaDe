1. AND, O beloved voices, upon which
2. Ours passionately call because erelong
3. Ye brake off in the middle of that song
4. We sang together softly, to enrich
5. The poor world with the sense of love, and witch,
6. The heart out of things evil,--I am strong,
7. Knowing ye are not lost for aye among

8. The hills, with last year's thrush. God keeps a niche
9. In Heaven to hold our idols; and albeit
10. He brake them to our faces and denied
11. That our close kisses should impair their white,
12. I know we shall behold them raised, complete,
13. The dust swept from their beauty,--glorified
14. New Memnons singing in the great God-light.
