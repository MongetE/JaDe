1. XXIX

2. I think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and bud
3. About thee, as wild vines, about a tree,
4. Put out broad leaves, and soon there 's nought to see
5. Except the straggling green which hides the wood.
6. Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood
7. I will not have my thoughts instead of thee
8. Who art dearer, better! Rather, instantly
9. Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,
10. Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,
11. And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee
12. Drop heavily down,—burst, shattered, everywhere!
13. Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee
14. And breathe within thy shadow a new air,
15. I do not think of thee—I am too near thee.
