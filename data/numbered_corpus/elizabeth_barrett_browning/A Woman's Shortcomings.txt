1. She has laughed as softly as if she sighed,
2. She has counted six, and over,
3. Of a purse well filled, and a heart well tried -
4. Oh, each a worthy lover!
5. They "give her time"; for her soul must slip
6. Where the world has set the grooving;
7. She will lie to none with her fair red lip:
8. But love seeks truer loving.

9. She trembles her fan in a sweetness dumb,
10. As her thoughts were beyond recalling;
11. With a glance for one, and a glance for some,
12. From her eyelids rising and falling;
13. Speaks common words with a blushful air,
14. Hears bold words, unreproving;
15. But her silence says - what she never will swear -
16. And love seeks better loving.

17. Go, lady! lean to the night-guitar,
18. And drop a smile to the bringer;
19. Then smile as sweetly, when he is far,
20. At the voice of an in-door singer.
21. Bask tenderly beneath tender eyes;
22. Glance lightly, on their removing;
23. And join new vows to old perjuries -
24. But dare not call it loving!

25. Unless you can think, when the song is done,
26. No other is soft in the rhythm;
27. Unless you can feel, when left by One,
28. That all men else go with him;
29. Unless you can know, when unpraised by his breath,
30. That your beauty itself wants proving;
31. Unless you can swear "For life, for death!" -
32. Oh, fear to call it loving!

33. Unless you can muse in a crowd all day
34. On the absent face that fixed you;
35. Unless you can love, as the angels may,
36. With the breadth of heaven betwixt you;
37. Unless you can dream that his faith is fast,
38. Through behoving and unbehoving;
39. Unless you can die when the dream is past -
40. Oh, never call it loving!
