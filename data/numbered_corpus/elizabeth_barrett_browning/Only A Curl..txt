1. I.
2. FRIENDS of faces unknown and a land
3. Unvisited over the sea,
4. Who tell me how lonely you stand
5. With a single gold curl in the hand
6. Held up to be looked at by me, --


7. II.
8. While you ask me to ponder and say
9. What a father and mother can do,
10. With the bright fellow-locks put away
11. Out of reach, beyond kiss, in the clay
12. Where the violets press nearer than you.


13. III.
14. Shall I speak like a poet, or run
15. Into weak woman's tears for relief ?
16. Oh, children ! -- I never lost one, --
17. Yet my arm 's round my own little son,
18. And Love knows the secret of Grief.


19. IV.
20. And I feel what it must be and is,
21. When God draws a new angel so
22. Through the house of a man up to His,
23. With a murmur of music, you miss,
24. And a rapture of light, you forgo.


25. V.
26. How you think, staring on at the door,
27. Where the face of your angel flashed in,
28. That its brightness, familiar before,
29. Burns off from you ever the more
30. For the dark of your sorrow and sin.


31. VI.
32. `God lent him and takes him,' you sigh ;
33. -- Nay, there let me break with your pain :
34. God 's generous in giving, say I, --
35. And the thing which He gives, I deny
36. That He ever can take back again.


37. VII.
38. He gives what He gives. I appeal
39. To all who bear babes -- in the hour
40. When the veil of the body we feel
41. Rent round us, -- while torments reveal
42. The motherhood's advent in power,


43. VIII.
44. And the babe cries ! -- has each of us known
45. By apocalypse (God being there
46. Full in nature) the child is our own,
47. Life of life, love of love, moan of moan,
48. Through all changes, all times, everywhere.


49. IX.
50. He 's ours and for ever. Believe,
51. O father ! -- O mother, look back
52. To the first love's assurance. To give
53. Means with God not to tempt or deceive
54. With a cup thrust in Benjamin's sack.


55. X.
56. He gives what He gives. Be content !
57. He resumes nothing given, -- be sure !
58. God lend ? Where the usurers lent
59. In His temple, indignant He went
60. And scourged away all those impure.


61. XI.
62. He lends not ; but gives to the end,
63. As He loves to the end. If it seem
64. That He draws back a gift, comprehend
65. 'Tis to add to it rather, -- amend,
66. And finish it up to your dream, --


67. XII.
68. Or keep, -- as a mother will toys
69. Too costly, though given by herself,
70. Till the room shall be stiller from noise,
71. And the children more fit for such joys,
72. Kept over their heads on the shelf.


73. XIII.
74. So look up, friends ! you, who indeed
75. Have possessed in your house a sweet piece
76. Of the Heaven which men strive for, must need
77. Be more earnest than others are,--speed
78. Where they loiter, persist where they cease.


79. XIV.
80. You know how one angel smiles there.
81. Then weep not. 'Tis easy for you
82. To be drawn by a single gold hair
83. Of that curl, from earth's storm and despair,
84. To the safe place above us. Adieu.
