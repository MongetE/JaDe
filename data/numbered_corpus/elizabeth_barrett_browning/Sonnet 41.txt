1. XLI

2. I thank all who have loved me in their hearts,
3. With thanks and love from mine. Deep thanks to all
4. Who paused a little near the prison-wall
5. To hear my music in its louder parts
6. Ere they went onward, each one to the mart's
7. Or temple's occupation, beyond call.
8. But thou, who, in my voice's sink and fall
9. When the sob took it, thy divinest Art's
10. Own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
11. To hearken what I said between my tears, . . .
12. Instruct me how to thank thee! Oh, to shoot
13. My soul's full meaning into future years,
14. That they should lend it utterance, and salute
15. Love that endures, from Life that disappears!
