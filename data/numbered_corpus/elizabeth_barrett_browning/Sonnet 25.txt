1. XXV

2. A heavy heart, Beloved, have I borne
3. From year to year until I saw thy face,
4. And sorrow after sorrow took the place
5. Of all those natural joys as lightly worn
6. As the stringed pearls, each lifted in its turn
7. By a beating heart at dance-time. Hopes apace
8. Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace
9. Could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
10. My heavy heart. Then thou didst bid me bring
11. And let it drop adown thy calmly great
12. Deep being! Fast it sinketh, as a thing
13. Which its own nature doth precipitate,
14. While thine doth close above it, mediating
15. Betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate.
