2. Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
3. And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
4. Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
5. Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
6. And love is fire. And when I say at need
7. I love thee . . . mark! . . . I love theeâ€”in thy sight
8. I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
9. With conscience of the new rays that proceed
10. Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
11. In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
12. Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
13. And what I feel, across the inferior features
14. Of what I am, doth flash itself, and show
15. How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.
