1. XXXVII

2. Pardon, oh, pardon, that my soul should make,
3. Of all that strong divineness which I know
4. For thine and thee, an image only so
5. Formed of the sand, and fit to shift and break.
6. It is that distant years which did not take
7. Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,
8. Have forced my swimming brain to undergo
9. Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake
10. Thy purity of likeness and distort
11. Thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit:
12. As if a shipwrecked Pagan, safe in port,
13. His guardian sea-god to commemorate,
14. Should set a sculptured porpoise, gills a-snort
15. And vibrant tail, within the temple-gate.
