1. XI

2. And therefore if to love can be desert,
3. I am not all unworthy. Cheeks as pale
4. As these you see, and trembling knees that fail
5. To bear the burden of a heavy heart,—
6. This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
7. To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail
8. To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale
9. A melancholy music,—why advert
10. To these things? O Beloved, it is plain
11. I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!
12. And yet, because I love thee, I obtain
13. From that same love this vindicating grace,
14. To live on still in love, and yet in vain,—
15. To bless thee, yet renounce thee to thy face.
