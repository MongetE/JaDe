1. I THINK we are too ready with complaint
2. In this fair world of God's. Had we no hope
3. Indeed beyond the zenith and the slope
4. Of yon gray blank of sky, we might grow faint
5. To muse upon eternity's constraint
6. Round our aspirant souls; but since the scope
7. Must widen early, is it well to droop,
8. For a few days consumed in loss and taint ?
9. O pusillanimous Heart, be comforted
10. And, like a cheerful traveller, take the road
11. Singing beside the hedge. What if the bread
12. Be bitter in thine inn, and thou unshod
13. To meet the flints ? At least it may be said
14. ' Because the way is short, I thank thee, God. '
