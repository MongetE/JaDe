1. UNLIKE are we, unlike, O princely Heart!
2. Unlike our uses and our destinies.
3. Our ministering two angels look surprise
4. On one another, as they strike athwart
5. Their wings in passing. Thou, bethink thee, art
6. A guest for queens to social pageantries,
7. With gages from a hundred brighter eyes
8. Than tears even can make mine, to play thy part
9. Of chief musician. What hast thou to do
10. With looking from the lattice-lights at me--
11. A poor, tired, wandering singer, singing through
12. The dark, and leaning up a cypress tree?
13. The chrism is on thine head--on mine the dew--
14. And Death must dig the level where these agree.
