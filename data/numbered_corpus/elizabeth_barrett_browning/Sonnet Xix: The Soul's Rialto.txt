1. The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise;
2. I barter curl for curl upon that mart,
3. And from my poet's forehead to my heart
4. Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,--
5. As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes
6. The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
7. The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart,...
8. The bay-crown's shade, Belov√®d, I surmise,
9. Still lingers on thy curl, it so black!
10. Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath,
11. I tie the shadows safe from gliding back,
12. And lay the gift where nothing hindereth;
13. Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack
14. No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.
