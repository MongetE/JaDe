1. Two savings of the Holy Scriptures beat
2. Like pulses in the Church's brow and breast;
3. And by them we find rest in our unrest
4. And, heart deep in salt-tears, do yet entreat
5. God's fellowship as if on heavenly seat.
6. The first is JESUS WEPT,--whereon is prest
7. Full many a sobbing face that drops its best
8. And sweetest waters on the record sweet:
9. And one is where the Christ, denied and scorned
10. LOOKED UPON PETER. Oh, to render plain
11. By help of having loved a little and mourned,
12. That look of sovran love and sovran pain
13. Which HE, who could not sin yet suffered, turned
14. On him who could reject but not sustain !
