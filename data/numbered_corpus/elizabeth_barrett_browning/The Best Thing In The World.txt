1. What's the best thing in the world?
2. June-rose, by May-dew impearled;
3. Sweet south-wind, that means no rain;
4. Truth, not cruel to a friend;
5. Pleasure, not in haste to end;
6. Beauty, not self-decked and curled
7. Till its pride is over-plain;
8. Love, when, so, you're loved again.
9. What's the best thing in the world?
10. --Something out of it, I think.
