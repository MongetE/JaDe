1. I think of thee!--my thoughts do twine and bud
2. About thee,as wild vines, about a tree,
3. Put out broad leaves, and soon there's nought to see
4. Except the straggling green which hides the wood.
5. Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood
6. I will not have my thoughts instead of thee
7. Who art dearer, better! Rather, instantly
8. Renew thy presence; as a strong tree should,
9. Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,
10. And let these bands of greenery which insphere thee
11. Drop heavily down,--burst, shattered, everywhere!
12. Because, in this deep joy to see and hear thee
13. And breathe within thy shadow a new air,
14. I do not think of thee--I am too near thee.
