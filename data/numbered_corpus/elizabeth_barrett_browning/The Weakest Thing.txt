1. Which is the weakest thing of all
2. Mine heart can ponder?
3. The sun, a little cloud can pall
4. With darkness yonder?
5. The cloud, a little wind can move
6. Where'er it listeth?
7. The wind, a little leaf above,
8. Though sere, resisteth?

9. What time that yellow leaf was green,
10. My days were gladder;
11. But now, whatever Spring may mean,
12. I must grow sadder.
13. Ah me! a leaf with sighs can wring
14. My lips asunder -
15. Then is mine heart the weakest thing
16. Itself can ponder.

17. Yet, Heart, when sun and cloud are pined
18. And drop together,
19. And at a blast, which is not wind,
20. The forests wither,
21. Thou, from the darkening deathly curse
22. To glory breakest, -
23. The Strongest of the universe
24. Guarding the weakest!
