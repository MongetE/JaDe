1. What can I give thee back, O liberal
2. And princely giver, who hast brought the gold
3. And purple of thine heart, unstained, untold,
4. And laid them on the outside of the-wall
5. For such as I to take or leave withal,
6. In unexpected largesse ? am I cold,
7. Ungrateful, that for these most manifold
8. High gifts, I render nothing back at all ?
9. Not so; not cold,--but very poor instead.
10. Ask God who knows. For frequent tears have run
11. The colors from my life, and left so dead
12. And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done
13. To give the same as pillow to thy head.
14. Go farther ! let it serve to trample on.
