1. We sow the glebe, we reap the corn,
2. We build the house where we may rest,
3. And then, at moments, suddenly,
4. We look up to the great wide sky,
5. Inquiring wherefore we were born…
6. For earnest or for jest?

7. The senses folding thick and dark
8. About the stifled soul within,
9. We guess diviner things beyond,
10. And yearn to them with yearning fond;
11. We strike out blindly to a mark
12. Believed in, but not seen.

13. We vibrate to the pant and thrill
14. Wherewith Eternity has curled
15. In serpent-twine about God’s seat;
16. While, freshening upward to His feet,
17. In gradual growth His full-leaved will
18. Expands from world to world.

19. And, in the tumult and excess
20. Of act and passion under sun,
21. We sometimes hear—oh, soft and far,
22. As silver star did touch with star,
23. The kiss of Peace and Righteousness
24. Through all things that are done.

25. God keeps His holy mysteries
26. Just on the outside of man’s dream;
27. In diapason slow, we think
28. To hear their pinions rise and sink,
29. While they float pure beneath His eyes,
30. Like swans adown a stream.

31. Abstractions, are they, from the forms
32. Of His great beauty?—exaltations
33. From His great glory?—strong previsions
34. Of what we shall be?—intuitions
35. Of what we are—in calms and storms,
36. Beyond our peace and passions?

37. Things nameless! which, in passing so,
38. Do stroke us with a subtle grace.
39. We say, ‘Who passes?’—they are dumb.
40. We cannot see them go or come:
41. Their touches fall soft, cold, as snow
42. Upon a blind man’s face.

43. Yet, touching so, they draw above
44. Our common thoughts to Heaven’s unknown,
45. Our daily joy and pain advance
46. To a divine significance,
47. Our human love—O mortal love,
48. That light is not its own!

49. And sometimes horror chills our blood
50. To be so near such mystic Things,
51. And we wrap round us for defence
52. Our purple manners, moods of sense—
53. As angels from the face of God
54. Stand hidden in their wings.

55. And sometimes through life’s heavy swound
56. We grope for them!—with strangled breath
57. We stretch our hands abroad and try
58. To reach them in our agony,—
59. And widen, so, the broad life-wound
60. Which soon is large enough for death.
