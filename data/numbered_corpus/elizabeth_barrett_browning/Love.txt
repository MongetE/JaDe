1. We cannot live, except thus mutually
2. We alternate, aware or unaware,
3. The reflex act of life: and when we bear
4. Our virtue onward most impulsively,
5. Most full of invocation, and to be
6. Most instantly compellant, certes, there
7. We live most life, whoever breathes most air
8. And counts his dying years by sun and sea.
9. But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth
10. Throw out her full force on another soul,
11. The conscience and the concentration both make
12. mere life, Love. For Life in perfect whole
13. And aim consummated, is Love in sooth,
14. As nature's magnet-heat rounds pole with pole.
