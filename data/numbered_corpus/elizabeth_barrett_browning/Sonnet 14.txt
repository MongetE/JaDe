2. If thou must love me, let it be for nought
3. Except for love's sake only. Do not say
4. 'I love her for her smile—her look—her way
5. Of speaking gently,—for a trick of thought
6. That falls in well with mine, and certes brought
7. A sense of pleasant ease on such a day'—
8. For these things in themselves, Beloved, may
9. Be changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,
10. May be unwrought so. Neither love me for
11. Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,—
12. A creature might forget to weep, who bore
13. Thy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!
14. But love me for love's sake, that evermore
15. Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.
