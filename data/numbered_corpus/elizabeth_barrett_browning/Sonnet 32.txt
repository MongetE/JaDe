1. XXXII

2. The first time that the sun rose on thine oath
3. To love me, I looked forward to the moon
4. To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
5. And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.
6. Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;
7. And, looking on myself, I seemed not one
8. For such man's love!—more like an out-of-tune
9. Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth
10. To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,
11. Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.
12. I did not wrong myself so, but I placed
13. A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float
14. 'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,—
15. And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.
