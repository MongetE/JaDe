1. Madonna, Madonnina
2. Sat by the grey road-side,
3. Saint Joseph her beside,
4. And Our Lord at her breast;
5. Oh they were fain to rest,
6. Mary and Joseph and Jesus,
7. All by the grey road-side.

8. She said, Madonna Mary,
9. 'I am thirsty, Joseph, and weary,
10. All in the desert wide.'
11. Then bent down a tall palm-tree
12. Its branches low to her knee;
13. 'Behold,' the palm-tree said,
14. 'My fruit that is drink and bread.'
15. So were they satisfied,
16. Mary and Joseph and Jesus,
17. All by the grey road-side.

18. From Herod they were fled
19. Over the desert wide,
20. Mary and Joseph and Jesus,
21. In Egypt to abide:
22. Mary and Joseph and Jesus,
23. In Egypt to abide.

24. The blesse`d Queen of Heaven
25. Her own dear Son hath given
26. For my son's sake; his sleep
27. Is safe and sweet and deep.
