1. Lo, All the Way,
2. Look you, I said, the clouds will break, the sky
3. Grow clear, the road
4. Be easier for my travelling the field,
5. So sodden and dead,
6. Will shimmer with new green and starry bloom,
7. And there will be,
8. There wil be then, with all serene and fair,
9. Some little while
10. For some light laughter in the sun; and lo,
11. The journey's end,
12. Grey road, grey fields, wind and a bitter rain.
