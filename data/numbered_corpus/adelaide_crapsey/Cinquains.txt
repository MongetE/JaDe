1. Fate Defied

2. As it
3. Were tissue of silver
4. I'll wear, O fate, thy grey,
5. And go mistily radiant, clad
6. Like the moon.

7. Night Winds

8. The old
9. Old winds that blew
10. When chaos was, what do
11. They tell the clattered trees that I
12. Should weep?

13. The Warning

14. Just now,
15. Out of the strange
16. Still dusk . . . as strange, as still . . .
17. A white moth flew . . . Why am I grown
18. So cold?
