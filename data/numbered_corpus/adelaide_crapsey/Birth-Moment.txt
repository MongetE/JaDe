1. Behold her,
2. Running through the waves
3. Eager to reach the land;
4. The water laps her,
5. Sun and wind are on her,
6. Healthy, brine-drenched and young,
7. Behold Desire new-born;-
8. Desire on first fulfillment's radiant edge,
9. Love at miraculous moment of emergence,
10. This is she,
11. Who running,
12. Hastens, hastens to the land.

13. Look. . Look. .
14. Her blown gold hair and lucent eyes of youth,
15. Her body rose and ivory in the sun. .
16. Look,
17. How he hastens,
18. Running, running to the land.

19. Her hands are yearning and her feet are swift
20. To reach and hold
21. She knows not what
22. Yet knows that it is life;
23. Need urges her,
24. Self, uncomprehended but most deep divined,
25. Unwilled but all-comprelling, drives her on.
26. Life runs to life.
27. She who longs,
28. But hath not yet accepted or bestowed,
29. All virginal dear and bright,
30. Runs, runs to reach the land.

31. And she who runs shall be
32. married to blue of summer skies at noon,
33. companion to green fields,
34. held bride to subtle fragrance and of all sweet sound,
35. beloved of the stars,
36. and wanton priestess to the veering winds.
37. Oh breathless space between:
38. Womb-time just passed,
39. Dark-hidden, chaotic formative, unpersonal,
40. And individual life of fresh-created force
41. Not yet begun:
42. One moment more
43. Before desire shall meet desire
44. And new creation start.
45. Oh breathless space,
46. While she,
47. Just risen from the waves,
48. Runs, runs to reach the land.

49. (Ah, keenest personal moment
50. When mouth unkissed turns eager-slow and tremulous
51. Toward lover's mouth,
52. That tremulous and eager-slow
53. Droops down to it:
54. But breathless space of breath or two
55. Lies in between
56. Before the mouth upturned and mouth down-drooped
57. Shall meet and make the kiss.)
58. Look. . Look. .

59. She runs. .
60. Love fresh-emerged,
61. Desire new-born. .
62. Blown on by wind,
63. And shone on by the sun,
64. She rises from the waves
65. And running,
66. Hasten, hastens to the land.

67. Belove'd and Belove'd and Belove'd,
68. Even so right
69. And beautiful and
70. Is my desire;
71. Even so longing-swift
72. I run to your receiving arms.

73. O Aphrodite!
74. O Aphrodite hear!
75. Hear my wrung cry flame upward poignant-gladâ€¦
76. This is my time for me.
77. I too am young;
78. I too am all of love!
