1. I have minded me
2. Of the noon-day brightness,
3. And the cricket's drowsy
4. Singing in the sunshine. .

5. I have minded me
6. Of the slim marsh-grasses
7. That the winds at twilight,
8. Dying, scarcely ripple. .

9. And I cannot sleep.I have minded me
10. Of a lily-pond,
11. Where the waters sway
12. All the moonlit leaves
13. And the curled long stems. .
14. And I cannot sleep.
