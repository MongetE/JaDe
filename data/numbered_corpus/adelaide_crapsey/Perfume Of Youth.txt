1. (Girl's Song)

2. In Babylon, in Nineveh,
3. And long ago, and far away,
4. The lilies and the lotus blew
5. That are my sweet of youth to-day.

6. From those high gardens of the Gods
7. That eyes of men may never see,
8. The amaranth and asphodel
9. Immortal odours shed on me.

10. In vial of my early years,
11. As in a crystal vial held,
12. What precious fragrance treasured up
13. Of age and agelessness distill'd.

14. XThine but to give. Give straightway all.Y
15. Yea, straight, mine hands, the ointment rare
16. In great libation joyous pour!
17. Oh, look of youth. . . Oh, golden hair. . .
