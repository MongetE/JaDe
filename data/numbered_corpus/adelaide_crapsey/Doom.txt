1. Peter stands by the gate,
2. And Michael by the throne.
3. 'Peter, I would pass the gate
4. And come before the throne.'
5. 'Whose spirit prayed never at the gate
6. In life nor at the throne,
7. In death he may not pass the gate
8. To come before the throne:'
9. Peter said from the gate;
10. Said Michael from the throne.
