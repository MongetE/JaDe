1. I make my shroud, but no one knows --
2. So shimmering fine it is and fair,
3. With stitches set in even rows,
4. I make my shroud, but no one knows.

5. In door-way where the lilac blows,
6. Humming a little wandering air,
7. I make my shroud and no one knows,
8. So shimmering fine it is and fair.
