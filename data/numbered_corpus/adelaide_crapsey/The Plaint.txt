1. Musicians O Musicians: Heartsease
2. Heartsease: an you will have me live play heartsease.


3. Light wind in the small green leaves
4. Play, oh play, my sad heart ease;

5. Birds, shake from your wilding throats
6. Tune`d charm of happy notes;

7. Shepherd, shepherd, pipe a shrill
8. A jocound pipe o'er vale and hill;

9. For from too much weeping I,
10. Maid forlorn, am like to die.
