1. Joy! Joy! Joy!
2. The hills are glad,
3. The valleys re-echo with merriment,
4. In my heart is the sound of laughter,
5. And my feet dance to the time of it;
6. Oh, little son, carried light on my shoulder,
7. Let us go laughing and dancing through the live days,
8. For this is the hour of the vintage,
9. When man gathereth for himself the fruits of the vineyard.

10. Look, little son, look:
11. The grapes are translucent and ripe,
12. They are heavy and fragrant with juice
13. They wait for the hands of the vintagers;

14. For a long time the grapes were not,

15. And were in the womb of the earth,

16. Then out of the heavens came the rain,

17. The sun sent down his warmth from the sky,

18. At the touch of life, life stirred,

19. And the earth brought forth her fruits in due season.


20. I was a maid and alone,

21. When, behold, there came to me a vision;

22. My heart cried out within me,

23. And the voice was the voice of God.

24. Yea, a virgin I dreamed of love,

25. And was troubled and sore afraid,

26. I wept and was glad,

27. For the word of my heart named me blesse'd,

28. My soul exhalted the might of creation.


29. I was a maid and alone,

30. When, behold, my lover came to me,

31. My belove'd held me in his arms.


32. Joy! Joy! Joy!

33. Now is the vision fulfilled;

34. I have conceived,

35. I have carried in my womb,

36. I have brought forth

37. The life of the world;

38. Out of my joy and my pain,

39. Out of the fulness of my living

40. Hath my son gained his life.


41. Look, little son, look:

42. The grapes are ripe for gathering;

43. The fresh, deep earth is in them,

44. And clean water from the clouds.

45. And golden, golden sun is in the heart of the grapes.

46. Look, little son, look:

47. The earth, your mother,

48. And the touch of life who is your father,

49. They have provided food for you

50. That you also may live.


51. The vineyards are planted on the hillside,

52. They are the vineyards of my belove'd,

53. He chose a favorable spot,

54. His hands prepared the soil for the planting;

55. He set out the young vines

56. And cared for them till the time of their bearing.

57. Nopw is his labour fulfilled who worked with God.

58. The fruit of the vineyard is ripe,

59. The vintagers laugh in the sun,


60. They sing while they gather the grapes,

61. For the vintage is a good one,

62. The wine vats are pressed down and running over.


63. Joy! Joy! Joy!

64. Now is the wonder accomplished;

65. Out of the heat of the living grape

66. Hath the hand of my belove'd

67. Wrung the wine of the dream of life.


68. Belove'd,

69. My little son's father,

70. Together we have given life,

71. And the vision of life;

72. Shall we not rejoice

73. Who have made eternal

74. The days of our living.


75. Look, little son, look:

76. The grapes glow with rich juice;

77. The juice of the grape hath in it

78. The substance of the earth,

79. And the air's breath;

80. It hath in it the soul of the vintage.

81. Put forth your hand, little son,

82. And take for yourself the life

83. That your father and your mother

84. Have provided for you.


85. Joy! Joy! Joy!

86. The halls are glad,

87. The valleys re-echo with merriment,

88. In my heart is the sound of laughter,

89. And my feet dance to the time of it;

90. Oh, little son, carried light on my shoulder,

91. Let us go laughing and dancing through the live days,

92. For this is the hour of vintage,

93. When man gathereth for himself the fruits of the vineyard.
