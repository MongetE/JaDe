1. A flickering light near spent
2. Her pale hand bore.

3. Have you seen Angelique?
4. Will she know the place
5. Dead feet must find,
6. The grave-cloth on her face
7. To make her blind?

8. Have you seen Angelique. .
9. At night I hear her moan,
10. And I shiver in my bed;
11. She wanders all alone,
12. She cannot find the dead.
