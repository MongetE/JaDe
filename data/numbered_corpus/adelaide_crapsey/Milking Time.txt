1. Heard ye the maidens
2. Went through the meadows,
3. Early, O, early,
4. While yet the dew was
5. Wet on the grass?
6. Heard ye the milk-maids
7. Singing and singing?


8. 'Cushy cow bonny let down your milk,
9. And I will give you a gown of silk,
10. A gown of silk asnd a silver tee,
11. If you will let down your milk to me.'

12. Hear ye the maidens,
13. Over the meadows,
14. Where the dew gathers,
15. Where shadows lengthen,
16. Hear ye the milk-maids'
17. Aery, hushed voices
18. Singing, ah, singing?

19. 'Cushy cow bonny let down your milk,
20. And I will give you a gown of silk,
21. A gown of silk asnd a silver tee,
22. If you will let down your milk to me.'

23. Morning and evening,
24. In the green meadows
25. Hear ye the milk-maids
26. And their sweet singing?
