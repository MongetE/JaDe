1. Grey gaolers are my griefs
2. That will not let me free;
3. The bitterness of tears
4. Is warder unto me.
5. I may not leap or run;
6. I may not laugh nor sing.
7. 'Thy cell is small,' they say,
8. 'Be still thou captived thing.'

9. But in the dusk of the night,
10. Too sudden-swift to see,
11. Closing and ivory gates
12. Are refuge unto me.

13. My griefs, my tears must watch,
14. And cold the watch they keep;
15. They whisper, whisper there -
16. I hear them in my sleep.

17. They know that I must come,
18. And patient watch they keep,
19. Whispering, shivering there,
20. Till I come back from sleep.

21. But in the dark of a night,
22. Too dark for them to see,
23. The refuge of black gates
24. Will open unto me.

25. Whisper up there in the dark. .
26. Shiver by bleak winds stung. .
27. My dead lips laugh to hear
28. How long you wait . . . how long!

29. Grey gaolers are my griefs
30. That will not let me free;
31. The bitterness of tears
32. Is warder unto me.
