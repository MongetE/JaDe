1. How can you lie so still? All day I watch

2. And never a blade of all the green sod moves

3. To show where restlessly you toss and turn,

4. And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees

5. Stiffened and aching from their long disuse;

6. I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth

7. To take its freedom of the midnight hour.

8. Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones?

9. The very worms must scorn you where you lie,

10. A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk,

11. Meek inhabitants of unresented graves.

12. Why are you there in your straight row on row

13. Where I must ever see you from my bed

14. That in your mere dumb presence iterate

15. The text so weary in my ears: 'Lie still

16. And rest; be patient and lie still and rest.'

17. I'll not be patient! I will not lie still!

18. There is a brown road runs between the pines,

19. And further on the purple woodlands lie,

20. And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom;

21. And I would walk the road and I would be

22. Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach

23. The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds.

24. My eyes follow but my feet are held.

25. Recumbent as you others must I too

26. Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness

27. With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod?

28. And if the many sayings of the wise

29. Teach of submission I will not submit

30. But with a spirit all unreconciled

31. Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars.

32. Better it is to walk, to run, to dance,

33. Better it is to laugh and leap and sing,

34. To know the open skies of dawn and night,

35. To move untrammel'd down the flaming noon,

36. And I will clamour it through weary days

37. Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp,

38. Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips

39. Of resignation, sister to defeat.

40. I'll not be patient. I will not lie still.

41. And in ironic quietude who is

42. The despot of our days and lord of dust

43. Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop

44. Grim casual comment on rebellion's end;

45. Yes;yes. . . Wilful and petulant but now

46. As dead and quiet as the others are.'

47. And this each body and ghost of you hath heard

48. That in your graves do therefore lie so still.
