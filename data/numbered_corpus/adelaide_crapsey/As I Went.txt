1. As I went, as I went
2. Over the mountains,
3. I heard, I heard,
4. Through cloud-wreath and mist,
5. A hound that was baying -
6. Death.. it was death.As I went, as I went
7. Over the meadows,
8. I heard, I heard,
9. From thicket, from shadow,
10. A hidden bird fluting -
11. Death.. it was death.As I went, as I went
12. By rocks and by sand-dunes,
13. I heard, I heard,
14. At the sea's bottom
15. A silver fish swimming -
16. Death.. it was death.As I went, as I went
17. In my house, in my house,
18. I heard, I heard,
19. A footfall, a footfall
20. Closely behind me -
21. Death.. it was death.
