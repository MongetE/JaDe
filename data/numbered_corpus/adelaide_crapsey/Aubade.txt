1. The morning is new and the skies are fresh washed with light,
2. The day cometh in with the sun and I awake laughing.

3. Hasten, belov`ed!
4. For see, while you were yet sleeping
5. The cool and virgin feet of dawn went soundless over grey meadows,

6. And the earth is requickened under her touch.
7. The vision that came with gradual steps departeth in an instant;
8. Hasten, let it be unbeheld of your eyes.
