1. Little Sister Rose-Marie,
2. Will thy feet as willing-light
3. Run through Paradise, I wonder,
4. As they run the blue skies under,
5. Willing feet, so airy-light?

6. Little Sister Rose-Marie
7. Will thy voice as bird-note clear
8. Lift and ripple over Heaven
9. As its mortal sound is given,
10. Swift bird-voice, so young and clear?

11. How God will be glad of thee,
12. Little Sister Rose-Marie!'
