1. For Aubrey Beardsley's picture

2. Pierrot is dying:
3. Tiptoe in,
4. Finger touched to lip,
5. Harlequin,
6. Columbine and Clown.

7. Hugh! how still he lies
8. In his bed,
9. White slipped hand and white
10. Sunker head.
11. Oh, poor Pierrot.
12. There's his dressing gown
13. Across the chair,
14. Slippers in the floor. . .
15. Can he hear
16. Us who tiptoe in?

17. Pillowed high he lies
18. In his bed;
19. Listen Columbine.
20. 'He is dead.'
21. Oh, poor Pierrot.
