1. Meet thou the event
2. And terrible happening of
3. Thine end: for thou are come
4. Upon the remote, cold place
5. Of ultimate dissolution and
6. With dumb, wide look
7. Thou, impotent, dost feel
8. Impotence creeping on
9. Thy potent soul. Yea, now, caught in
10. The aghast and voiceless pain
11. Of Death, thyself doth watch
12. Thyself becoming naught.


13. Peace. . Peace. . for at
14. The last is comfort. Lo, now
15. Thou hast no pain. Lo, now
16. The waited presence is
17. Within the room; the voice
18. Speaks final-gentle: 'Child,
19. Even thy careful nurse,
20. I lift thee in my arms
21. For greater ease and while
22. Thy heart still beats, place my
23. Cool fingers of oblivion on
24. Thine eyes and close them for

25. Eternity. Thou shalt
26. Pass sleeping, nor know
27. When sleeping ceases. Yet still
28. A little while thy breathing lasts,
29. Gradual is fainter: I
30. must listen close - the end.'

31. Rest. And you others..All.
32. Grave-fellows in
33. Green place. Here grows
34. Memorial every spring's
35. Fresh grass and here
36. Your marking monument
37. Was built for you long, long
38. Ago when Caius Cestius died.
