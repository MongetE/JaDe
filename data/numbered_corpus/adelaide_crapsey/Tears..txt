1. The immemorial grief of all years
2. Burdes my heart sorely, and the years
3. Of slow eternal crying stain my cheeks.
4. Forever and forever my soul speaks
5. Saying: I am thy self: Look on me -
6. And weep. Never and never shalt thou be
7. As I. Weep; for weeping and hard pain
8. Of loss measure joy of last visioned gain.
