1. And the centurion who stood by said:
2. Truly this was a son of God.
3. Not long ago but everywhere I go
4. There is a hill and a black windy sky.
5. Portent of hill, sky, day's eclipse I know;
6. Hill, sky, the shuddering darkness, these am I.
7. The dying at His right hand, at His left,
8. I am - the thief redeemed and the lost thief;
9. I am the careless folk; I those bereft,
10. The Well-Belov'd, the women bowed in grief.
11. The gathering Presence that in terror cried,
12. In earth's shock in the Temple's veil rent through,
13. I; and a watcher, ignorant, curious-eyed,
14. I the centurion who heard and knew.'
