1. In the cold I will rise, I will bathe
2. In waters of ice; myself
3. Will shiver, and shrive myself,
4. Alone in the dawn, and anoint
5. Forehead and feet and hands;
6. I will shutter the windows from light,
7. I will place in their sockets the four
8. Tall candles and set them aflame
9. In the grey of the dawn; and myself
10. Will lay myself straight in my bed,
11. And draw the sheet under my chin.
