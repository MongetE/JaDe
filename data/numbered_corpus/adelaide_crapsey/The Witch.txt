1. When I was girl by Nilus stream

2. I watched the deserts stars arise;

3. My lover, he who dreamed the Sphinx,

4. Learned all his dreaming from eyes.


5. I bore in Greece a burning name,

6. And I have been in Italy

7. Madonna to a painter-lad,

8. And mistress to a Medici.


9. And have you heard (and I have heard)

10. Of puzzled men with decorous mien,

11. Who judged - the wench knew far too much -

12. And burnt her on the Salem green?
