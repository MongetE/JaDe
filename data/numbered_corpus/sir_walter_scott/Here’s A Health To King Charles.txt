1. Bring the bowl which you boast,
2. Fill it up to the brim;
3. ’Tis to him we love most,
4. And to all who love him.
5. Brave gallants, stand up,
6. And avaunt ye, base carles!
7. Were there death in the cup,
8. Here’s a health to King Charles.

9. Though he wanders through dangers,
10. Unaided, unknown,
11. Dependent on strangers,
12. Estranged from his own;
13. Though ’tis under our breath,
14. Amidst forfeits and perils,
15. Here’s to honor and faith,
16. And a health to King Charles!

17. Let such honors abound
18. As the time can afford,
19. The knee on the ground,
20. And the hand on the sword;
21. But the time shall come round
22. When, ’mid Lords, Dukes, and Earls,
23. The loud trumpet shall sound,
24. Here’s a health to King Charles!
