1. Woman's faith, and woman's trust -
2. Write the characters in the dust;
3. Stamp them on the running stream,
4. Print them on the moon's pale beam,
5. And each evanescent letter
6. Shall be clearer, firmer, better,
7. And more permanent, I ween,
8. Than the thing those letters mean.

9. I have strain'd the spider's thread
10. 'Gainst the promise of a maid;
11. I have weigh'd a grain of sand
12. 'Gainst her plight of heart and hand;
13. I told my true love of the token,
14. How her faith proved light, and her word was broken:
15. Again her word and truth she plight,
16. And I believed them again ere night.
