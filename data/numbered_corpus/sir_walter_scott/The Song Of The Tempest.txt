1. Stern eagle of the far north-west,
2. Thou that bearest in thy grasp the thunderbolt,
3. Thou whose rushing pinions stir ocean to madness,
4. Thou the destroyer of herds, thou the scatterer of navies,
5. Amidst the scream of thy rage,
6. Amidst the scream be loud as the cry of a perishing nation,
7. Though the rushing of thy wings be like the roar of ten thousand waves,
8. Yet hear, in thine ire and thy haste,
9. Hear thou the voice of the Reim-kennar.

10. Thou hast met the pine-trees of Drontheim,
11. Their dark-green heads lie prostrate beside their up-rooted stems;
12. Thou hast met the rider of the ocean,
13. The tall, the strong bark of the fearless rover,
14. And she has struck to thee the topsail
15. That she had not veil'd to a royal armada;
16. Thou hast met the tower that bears its crest among the clouds,
17. The battled massive tower of the Jarl of former days,
18. And the cope-stone of the turret
19. Is lying upon its hospitable hearth;
20. But thou too shalt stoop. proud compeller of clouds,
21. When thou hearest the voice of the Reim-kennar.

22. There are verses that can stop the stag in the forest,
23. Ay, and when the dark-colour'd dog is opening on his track;
24. There are verses can make the wild hawk pause on the wing,
25. Like the falcon that wears the hood and the jesses,
26. And who knows the shrill whistle of the fowler.
27. Thou who canst mock at the scream of the drowning mariner,
28. And the crash of the ravaged forest,
29. And the groan of the overwhelmed crowds,
30. When the church hath fallen in the moment of prayer;
31. There are sounds which thou also must list,
32. When they are chanted by the voice of the Reim-kennar.

33. Enough of woe hast thou wrought on the ocean,
34. The widows wring their hands on the beach;
35. Enough of woe hast thou wrought on the land,
36. The husbandman folds his arms in despair;
37. Cease thou the waving of thy pinions,
38. Let the ocean repose in her dark strength;
39. Cease thou the flashing of thine eye,
40. Let the thunderbolt sleep in the armoury of Odin;
41. Be thou still at my bidding, viewless racer of the north-western heaven,-
42. Sleep thou at the voice of Norna the Reim-kennar.

43. Eagle of the far north-western waters,
44. Thou hast heard the voice of the Reim-kennar,
45. Thou hast closed thy wide sails at her bidding,
46. And folded them in peace by thy side.
47. My blessing be on thy retiring path;
48. When thou stoopest from thy place on high,
49. Soft be thy slumbers in the caverns of the unknown ocean,
50. Rest till destiny shall again awaken thee;
51. Eagle of the north-west, thou hast heard the voice of the Reim-kennar.
