1. I.
2. Hast thou not mark'd, when o'er thy startled head
3. Sudden and deep the thunder-peal has roll'd,
4. How when its echoes fell, a silence dead
5. Sunk on the wood, the meadow, and the wold?
6. The rye-glass shakes not on the sod-built fold,
7. The rustling aspen's leaves are mute and still,
8. The wall-flower waves not on the ruin'd hold,
9. Till, murmuring distant first, then near and shrill,
10. The savage whirlwind wakes, and sweeps the groaning hill.

11. II.
12. Artornish! such a silence sunk
13. Upon thy halls, when that grey Monk
14. His prophet-speech had spoke;
15. And his obedient brethren's sail
16. Was stretch'd to meet the southern gale
17. Before a whisper woke.
18. Then murmuring sounds of doubt and fear,
19. Close pour'd in many an anxious ear,
20. The solemn stillness broke;
21. And still they gazed with eager guess,
22. Where, in an oriel's deep recess,
23. The Island Prince seem'd bent to press
24. What Lorn, by his impatient cheer,
25. And gesture fierce, scarce deign'd to hear.

26. III.
27. Starting at length with frowning look,
28. His hand he clench'd, his head he shook,
29. And sternly flung apart;-
30. 'And deem'st thou me so mean of mood,
31. As to forget the mortal feud,
32. And clasp the hand with blood inbrued
33. From my dear Kinsman's heart?
34. Is this thy rede? - a due return
35. For ancient league and friendship sworn!
36. But well our mountain proverb shows
37. The faith of Islesmen ebbs and flows.
38. Be it even so - believe, ere long,
39. He that now bears shall wreak the wrong.-
40. Call Edith - call the Maid of Lorn!
41. My sister, slaves! - for further scorn,
42. Be sure nor she nor I will stay.-
43. Away, De Argentine, away! -
44. We nor ally nor brother know,
45. In Bruce's friend, or England's foe.'

46. IV.
47. But who the Chieftain's rage can tell,
48. When, sought from lowest dungeon cell
49. To highest tower the castle round,
50. No Lady Edith was there found!
51. He shouted - 'Falsehood! - treachery! -
52. Revenge and blood! - a lordly meed
53. To him that will avenge the deed!
54. A Baron's lands!' - His frantic mood
55. Was scarcely by the news withstood,
56. That Morag shared his sister's flight,
57. And that, in hurry of the night,
58. 'Scaped noteless, and without remark,
59. Two strangers sought the Abott's bark.-
60. 'Man every galley! - fly - pursue!
61. The priest his treachery shall rue!
62. Ay, and the time shall quickly come,
63. When we shall hear the thanks that Rome
64. Will pay his feigned prophecy!'
65. Such was fierce Lorn's indignant cry;
66. And Cormac Doil in haste obey'd,
67. Hoisted his sail, his anchor weigh'd,
68. (For, glad of each pretext for spoil,
69. A pirate sworn was Cormac Doil).
70. But others, lingering, spoke apart,-
71. 'The maid has given her maiden heart
72. To Ronald of the Isles,
73. And, fearful lest her brother's word
74. Bestow her on that English Lord,
75. She seeks Iona's piles,
76. And wisely deems it best to dwell
77. A votaress in the holy cell,
78. Until these feuds so fierce and fell
79. The Abbot reconciles.'

80. V.
81. As, impotent of ire, the hall
82. Echoed to Lorn's impatient call -
83. 'My horse, my mantle, and my train!
84. Let none who honours Lorn remain!'-
85. Courteous, but stern, a bold request
86. To Bruce De Argentine express'd: -
87. 'Lord Earl,' he said, - 'I cannot chuse
88. But yield such title to the Bruce,
89. Though name and earldom both are gone,
90. Since he braced rebel's armour on -
91. But, Earl or Serf - rude phrase was thine
92. Of late, and launch'd at Argentine;
93. Such as compels me to demand
94. Redress of honour at thy hand.
95. We need not to each other tell,
96. That both can wield their weapons well;
97. Then do me but the soldier grace,
98. This glove upon thy helm to place
99. Where we may meet in fight;
100. And I will say, as still I've said,
101. Though by ambition far misled,
102. Thou art a noble knight.'-

103. VI.
104. 'And I,' the princely Bruce replied,
105. 'Might term it stain on knighthood's pride,
106. That the bright sword of Argentine
107. Should in a tyrant's quarrel shine;
108. But, for your brave request,
109. Be sure the honour'd pledge you gave
110. In every battle-field shall wave
111. Upon my helmet-crest;
112. Believe, that if my hasty tongue
113. Hath done thine honour causeless wrong,
114. It shall be well redress'd.
115. Not dearer to my soul was glove,
116. Bestow'd in youth by lady's love,
117. Than this which thou hast given!
118. Thus, then, my noble foe I greet;
119. Health and high fortune till we meet,
120. And then - what pleases Heaven.'

121. VII.
122. Thus parted they - for now, with sound
123. Like waves roll'd back from rocky ground,
124. The friends of Lorn retire;
125. Each mainland chieftain, with his train,
126. Draws to his mountain towers again,
127. Pondering how mortal schemes prove vain,
128. And mortal hopes expire.
129. But through the castle double guard,
130. By Ronald's charge, kept wakeful ward,
131. Wicket and gate were trebly barr'd,
132. By beam and bolt and chain:
133. Then of the guests, in courteous sort,
134. He pray'd excuse for mirth broke short,
135. And bade them in Artornish fort
136. In confidence remain.
137. Now torch and menial tendance led
138. Chieftains and knight to bower and bed,
139. And beads were told, and Aves said,
140. And soon they sunk away
141. Into such sleep as wont to shed
142. Oblivion on the weary head,
143. After a toilsome day.

144. VIII.
145. But soon uproused, the Monarch cried
146. To Edward slumbering by his side,
147. 'Awake, or sleep for aye!
148. Even now there jarr'd a secret door -
149. A taper-light gleams on the floor -
150. Up, Edward! up, I say!
151. Some one glides in like midnight ghost -
152. Nay, strike not! 'tis our noble Host.'
153. Advancing then his taper's flame,
154. Ronald stept forth, and with him came
155. Dunvegan's chief - each bent the knee
156. To Bruce in sign of fealty,
157. And proffer'd him his sword,
158. And hail'd him in a monarch's style,
159. As king of mainland and of isle,
160. And Scotland's rightful lord.
161. 'And O,' said Ronald, 'Own'd of Heaven!
162. Say, is my erring youth forgiven,
163. By falsehood's arts from duty driven,
164. Who rebel falchion drew,
165. Yet ever to thy deeds of fame,
166. Even while I strove against thy claim,
167. Paid homage just and true?'-
168. 'Alas! dear youth, the unhappy time,'
169. Answer'd the Bruce, 'must bear the crime,
170. Since, guiltier far than you,
171. Even I' - he paused; for Falkirk's woes,
172. Upon his conscious soul arose.
173. The Chieftain to his breast he press'd,
174. And in a sigh conceal'd the rest.

175. IX.
176. They proffer'd aid, by arms and might,
177. To repossess him in his right;
178. But well their counsels must be weigh'd,
179. Ere banners raised and musters made,
180. For English hire and Lorn's intrigues
181. Bound many chiefs in southern leagues.
182. In answer, Bruce his purpose bold
183. To his new vassals frankly told:-
184. 'The winter worn in exile o'er,
185. I long'd for Carrick's kindred shore.
186. I thought upon my native Ayr,
187. And long'd to see the burly fare
188. That Clifford makes, whose lordly call
189. Now echoes through my father's hall.
190. But first my course to Arran led,
191. Where valiant Lennox gathers head,
192. And on the sea, by tempest toss'd,
193. Our barks dispersed, our purpose cross'd,
194. Mine own, a hostile sail to shun,
195. When that wise will, which masters ours,
196. Compell'd us to your friendly towers.'

197. X.
198. Then Torquil spoke:- 'The time craves speed!
199. We must not linger in our deed,
200. But instant pray our Sovereign Liege,
201. To shun the perils of a siege.
202. The vengeful Lorn, with all his powers,
203. Lies but too near Artornish towers,
204. And England's light-arm'd vessels ride,
205. Not distant far, the waves of Clyde,
206. Prompt at these tidings to unmoor,
207. And sweep each strait, and guard each shore.
208. Then, till this fresh alarm pass by,
209. Secret and safe my Liege must lie
210. In the far bounds of friendly Skye,
211. Torquil thy pilot and thy guide.'-
212. 'Not so, brave Chieftain,' Ronald cried;
213. 'Myself will on my Sovereign wait,
214. And raise in arms the men of Sleate,
215. Whilst thou, renown'd where chiefs debate,
216. Shalt sway them by thy locks of age.'
217. -'And if my words in weight shall fail,
218. This ponderous sword shall turn the scale.'

219. XI.
220. 'The scheme,' said Bruce, 'contents me well;
221. Meantime, 'twere best that Isabel,
222. For safety, with my bark and crew,
223. Again to friendly Erin drew.
224. There Edward, too, shall with her wend,
225. In need to cheer her and defend,
226. And muster up each scatter'd friend.'-
227. Here seem'd it as Lord Ronald's ear
228. Would other counsel gladlier hear;
229. But, all achieved as soon as plann'd,
230. Both barks, in secret arm'd and mann'd,
231. From out the haven bore;
232. On different voyage forth they ply,
233. This for the coast of winged Skye,
234. And that for Erin's shore.

235. XII.
236. With Bruce and Ronald bides the tale.-
237. To favouring winds they gave the sail,
238. Till Mull's dark headlands scarce they knew,
239. And Ardnamurchan's hills were blue.
240. But then the squalls blew close and hard,
241. And, fain to strike the galley's yard,
242. With these rude seas, in weary plight,
243. They strove the livelong day and night,
244. Nor till the dawning had a sight
245. Of Skye's romantic shore.
246. Where Coolin stoops him to the west,
247. They saw upon his shiver'd crest
248. The sun's arising gleam;
249. But such the labour and delay,
250. Ere they were moor'd in Scavigh bay,
251. (For calmer Heaven compell'd to stay),
252. He shot a western beam.
253. Then Ronald said, 'If true mine eye,
254. These are the savage wilds that lie
255. North of Strathnardill and Dunskye;
256. No human foot comes here,
257. And, since these adverse breezes blow,
258. If my good Liege love hunter's bow,
259. What hinders that on land we go,
260. And strike a mountain-deer?
261. Allan, my page, shall with us wend;
262. And, if we meet a herd, may send
263. A shaft shall mend our cheer.'
264. Then each took bow and bolts in hand,
265. Their row-boat launch'd and leapt to land,
266. And left their skiff and train,
267. Where a wild stream with headlong shock,
268. Came brawling down its bed of rock,
269. To mingle with the main.

270. XIII.
271. A while their route they silent made,
272. As men who stalk for mountain-deer,
273. Till the good Bruce to Ronald said, -
274. 'Saint Mary! what a scene is here!
275. I've traversed many a mountain-strand,
276. Abroad in my native land,
277. And it has been my lot to tread
278. Where safety more than pleasure led;
279. Thus, many a waste I've wander'd o'er,
280. Clombe many a crag, cross'd many a moor,
281. But, by my halidome,
282. A scene so rude, so wild as this,
283. Yet so sublime in barrenness,
284. Ne'er did my wandering footsteps press,
285. Where'er I happ'd to roam.'

286. XIV.
287. No marvel thus the Monarch spake;
288. For rarely human eye has known
289. A scene so stern as that dread lake,
290. With its dark ledge of barren stone.
291. Seems that primeval earthquake's sway
292. Hath rent a strange and shatter'd way
293. Through the rude bosom of the hill,
294. And that each naked precipice,
295. Sable ravine, and dark abyss,
296. Tells of the outrage still.
297. The wildest glen, but this, can show
298. Some touch of Nature's genial glow;
299. On high Benmore green mosses grow,
300. And heath-bells bud in deep Glencroe,
301. And copse on Cruchan-Ben;
302. But here, -above, around, below,
303. On mountain or in glen,
304. Nor tree, nor shrub, nor plant, nor flower,
305. Nor aught of vegetative power,
306. The weary eye may ken.
307. For all is rocks at random thrown,
308. Black waves, bare crags, and banks of stone,
309. As if were here denied
310. The summer sun, the spring's sweet dew,
311. That clothe with many a varied hue
312. The bleakest mountain-side.

313. XV.
314. And wilder, forward as they wound,
315. Were the proud cliffs and lake profound,
316. Huge terraces of granite black
317. Afforded rude and cumber'd track;
318. For from the mountain hoar,
319. Hurl'd headlong in some night of fear,
320. When yell'd the wolf and fled the deer,
321. Loose crags had toppled o'er;
322. And some, chance-poised and balanced, lay,
323. So that a stripling arm might sway
324. A mass no host could raise,
325. In Nature's rage at random thrown,
326. Yet trembling like the Druid's stone
327. On its precarious base.
328. The evening mists, with ceaseless change,
329. Now clothed the mountains' lofty range,
330. Now left their foreheads bare,
331. And round the skirts their mantle furl'd,
332. Or on the sable waters curl'd,
333. Or on the eddying breezes whirl'd,
334. Dispersed in middle air.
335. And oft, condensed, at once they lower,
336. When, brief and fierce, the mountain shower
337. Pours like a torrent down,
338. And when return the sun's glad beams,
339. Whiten'd with foam a thousand streams
340. Leap from the mountain's crown.

341. XVI.
342. 'This lake,' said Bruce, 'whose barriers drear
343. Are precipice sharp and sheer,
344. Yielding no track for goat or deer,
345. Save the black shelves we tread,
346. How term you its dark waves? and how
347. Yon northern mountain's pathless brow,
348. And yonder peak of dread,
349. That to the evening sun uplifts
350. The griesly gulfs and slaty rifts,
351. Which seam its shiver'd head?' -
352. 'Coriskin call the dark lake's name,
353. Coolin the ridge, as bards proclaim,
354. From old Cuchullin, chief of flame.
355. But bards, familiar in our isles
356. Rather with Nature's frowns than smiles,
357. Full oft their careless humours please
358. By sportive names from scenes like these.
359. I would old Torquil were to show
360. His maidens with their breasts of snow,
361. Or that my noble Liege were nigh
362. To hear his Nurse sing lullaby!
363. (The Maids - tall cliffs with breakers white,
364. The Nurse - a torrent's roaring might),
365. Or that your eye could see the mood
366. Of Corryvrekin's whirlpool rude,
367. When dons the Hag her whiten'd hood -
368. 'Tis thus our Islesmen's fancy frames,
369. For scenes so stern, fantastic names.'

370. XVII.
371. Answer'd the Bruce, 'And musing mind
372. Might here a graver moral find.
373. These mighty cliffs, that heave on high
374. Their naked brows to middle sky,
375. Indifferent to the sun or snow,
376. Where nought can fade, and nought can blow,
377. May they not mark a Monarch's fate, -
378. Raised high 'mid storms of strife and state,
379. Beyond life's lowlier pleasures placed,
380. His soul a rock, his heart a waste?
381. O'er hope and love and fear aloft
382. High rears his crowned head - But soft!
383. Look, underneath yon jutting crag
384. Are hunters and a slaughter'd stag.
385. Who may they be? But late you said
386. No steps these desert regions tread?'-

387. XVIII.
388. 'So said I - and believed in sooth,'
389. Ronald replied, 'I spoke the truth.
390. Yet now I spy, by yonder stone,
391. Five men - they mark us, and come on;
392. And by their badge on bonnet borne,
393. I guess them on the land of Lorn,
394. Foes to my Liege.' - 'So let it be;
395. I've faced worse odds than five to three-
396. -But the poor page can little aid;
397. Then be our battle thus array'd,
398. If our free passage they contest;
399. Cope thou with two, I'll match the rest.'-
400. 'Not so, my Liege - for, by my life,
401. This sword shall meet the treble strife;
402. My strength, my skill in arms, more small,
403. And less the loss should Ronald fall.
404. But islesmen soon to soldiers grow,
405. Allan has sword as well as bow,
406. And were my Monarch's order given,
407. Two shafts should make our number even.'-
408. 'No! not to save my life!' he said;
409. 'Enough of blood rests on my head,
410. Too rashly spill'd - we soon shall know,
411. Whether they come as friend or foe.'

412. XIX.
413. Nigh came the strangers, and more nigh;-
414. Still less they pleased the Monarch's eye.
415. Men were they all of evil mien,
416. Down-look'd, unwilling to be seen;
417. They moved with half-resolved pace,
418. And bent on earth each gloomy face.
419. The foremost two were fair array'd,
420. With brogue and bonnet, trews and plaid,
421. And bore the arms of mountaineers,
422. Daggers and broadswords, bows and spears,
423. The three, that lagg'd small space behind,
424. Seem'd serfs of more degraded kind;
425. Goat-skins or deer-hides o'er them cast,
426. Made a rude fence against the blast;
427. Matted their beards, unshorn their hair;
428. For arms, the caitiffs bore in hand,
429. A club, an axe, a rusty brand.

430. XX.
431. Onward still mute, they kept the track;-
432. 'Tell who ye be, or else stand back,'
433. Said Bruce; 'In deserts when they meet,
434. Men pass not as in peaceful street.'
435. Still, at his stern command, they stood,
436. And proferr'd greeting brief and rude,
437. But acted courtesy so ill,
438. As seem'd of fear, and not of will.
439. 'Wanderers we are, as you may be;
440. Men hither driven by wind and sea,
441. Who, if you list to taste our cheer,
442. Will share with you this fallow deer.'-
443. 'If from the sea, where lies your bark?'-
444. 'Ten fathom deep in ocean dark!
445. Wreck'd yesternight: but we are men,
446. Who little sense of peril ken.
447. The shades come down - the day is shut -
448. Will you go with us to our hut?'-
449. 'Our vessel waits us in the bay;
450. Thanks for your proffer - have good-day.'-
451. 'Was that your galley, then, which rode
452. Not far from shore when evening glow'd?'-
453. 'It was.' - 'Then spare your needless pain,
454. There will she now be sought in vain.
455. We saw her from the mountain head,
456. When, with St. George's blazon red
457. A southern vessel bore in sight,
458. And yours raised sail, and took to flight.'-

459. XXI.
460. 'Now, by the rood, unwelcome news!'
461. Thus with Lord Ronald communed Bruce;
462. 'Nor rests there light enough to show
463. If this their tale be true or no.
464. The men seem bred of churlish kind,
465. Yet mellow nuts have hardest rind;
466. We will go with them - food and fire
467. And sheltering roof our wants require.
468. Sure guard 'gainst treachery will we keep,
469. And watch by turns our comrades' sleep.-
470. Good fellows, thanks; your guests we'll be,
471. And well will pay the courtesy.
472. Come, lead us where your lodging lies,-
473. - Nay, soft! we mix not companies.-
474. Show us the path o'er crag and stone,
475. And we will follow you; - lead on.'

476. XXII.
477. They reach'd the dreary cabin, made
478. Of sails against a rock display'd,
479. And there on entering, found
480. A slender boy, whose form and mien
481. Ill suited with such savage scene,
482. In cap and cloak of velvet green,
483. Low seated on the ground.
484. His garb was such as minstrels wear,
485. Dark was his hue, and dark his hair,
486. His youthful cheek was marr'd by care,
487. His eyes in sorrow drown'd.
488. 'Whence this poor boy?' - As Ronald spoke,
489. The voice his trance of anguish broke;
490. As if awaked from ghastly dream,
491. He raised his head with start and scream,
492. And wildly gazed around;
493. Then to the wall his face he turn'd,
494. And his dark neck with blushes burn'd.

495. XXIII.
496. 'Whose is the boy?' again he said.
497. 'By chance of war our captive made;
498. He may be yours, if you should hold
499. That music has more charms than gold;
500. For, though from earliest childhood mute,
501. The lad can deftly touch the lute,
502. And on the rote and viol play,
503. And well can drive the time away
504. For those who love such glee;
505. For me, the favouring breeze, when loud
506. It pipes upon the galley's shroud,
507. Makes blither melody.'-
508. 'Hath he, then, sense of spoken sound?'-
509. 'Aye; so his mother bade us know,
510. A crone in our late shipwreck drown'd,
511. And hence the silly stripling's woe.
512. More of the youth I cannot say,
513. Our captive but since yesterday;
514. When wind and weather wax'd so grim,
515. We little listed think of him.-
516. But why waste time in idle words?
517. Sit to your cheer - unbelt your swords.'
518. Sudden the captive turn'd his head,
519. And one quick glance to Ronald sped.
520. It was a keen and warning look,
521. And well the Chief the signal took.

522. XXIV.
523. 'Kind host,' he said, 'our needs require
524. A separate board and separate fire;
525. Wend I, my comrade, and this page.
526. And, sworn to vigil and to fast,
527. Long as this hallow'd task shall last,
528. We never doff the plaid or sword,
529. Or feast us at a stranger's board;
530. And never share one common sleep,
531. But one must still his vigil keep.
532. Thus, for our separate use, good friend,
533. We'll hold this hut's remoter end.'-
534. 'A churlish vow,' the elder said,
535. 'And hard, methinks, to be obey'd.
536. How say you, if, to wreak the scorn
537. That pays our kindness harsh return,
538. 'Then say we, that our swords are steel!
539. And our vow binds us not to fast,
540. Where gold or force may buy repast.'-
541. Their host's dark brow grew keen and fell,
542. His teeth are clench'd, his features swell;
543. Yet sunk the felon's moody ire
544. Before Lord Ronald's glance of fire,
545. Nor could his craven courage brook
546. The Monarch's calm and dauntless look.
547. With laugh constrain'd - 'Let every man
548. Follow the fashion of his clan!
549. Each to his separate quarters keep,
550. And feed or fast, or wake or sleep.'

551. XXV.
552. Their fire at separate distance burns,
553. By turns they eat, keep guard by turns;
554. For evil seem'd that old man's eye,
555. Dark and designing, fierce yet shy.
556. Still he avoided forward look,
557. But slow, and circumspectly took
558. A circling, never-ceasing glance,
559. By doubt and cunning mark'd at once,
560. Which shot a mischief-boding ray,
561. From under eyebrows shagg'd and grey.
562. The younger, too, who seem'd his son,
563. Had that dark look to the timid shun;
564. The half-clad serfs behind them sate,
565. And scowl'd a glare 'twixt fear and hate-
566. Till all, as darkness onward crept,
567. Couch'd down, and seem'd to sleep, or slept.
568. Nor he, that boy, whose powerless tongue
569. Must trust his eyes to wail his wrong,
570. A longer watch of sorrow made,
571. But stretch'd his limbs to slumber laid.

572. XXVI.
573. Not in his dangerous host confides
574. The King, but wary watch provides.
575. Ronald keeps ward till midnight past,
576. Then wakes the King, young Allan last;
577. Thus rank'd, to give the youthful page
578. The rest required by tender age.
579. What is Lord Ronald's wakeful thought,
580. To chase the languor toil had brought?-
581. (For deem not that he deign'd to throw
582. Much care upon such coward foe),-
583. He thinks of lovely Isabel,
584. When at her foeman's feet she fell,
585. Nor less when, placed in princely selle,
586. She glanced on him with favouring eyes,
587. At Woodstocke when he won the prize.
588. Nor, fair in joy, in sorrow fair,
589. In pride of place as 'mid despair,
590. Must she alone engross his care.
591. His thoughts to his betrothed bride,
592. To Edith, turn - O how decide,
593. When here his love and heart are given,
594. And there his faith stands plight to Heaven!
595. No drowsy ward 'tis his to keep,
596. For seldom lovers long for sleep.
597. Till sung his midnight hymn the owl,
598. Answer'd the dog-fox with his howl,
599. Then waked the King - at his request,
600. Lord Ronald stretch'd himself to rest.

601. XXVII.
602. What spell was good King Robert's, say,
603. To drive the weary night away?
604. His was the patriot's burning thought,
605. Of Freedom's battle bravely fought,
606. Of castles storm'd, of cities freed,
607. Of deep design and daring deed,
608. Of England's roses reft and torn,
609. And Scotland's cross in triumph worn,
610. Of rout and rally, war and truce,-
611. As heroes think, so thought the Bruce.
612. No marvel, 'mid such musings high,
613. Sleep shunn'd the Monarch's thoughtful eye.
614. Now over Coolin's eastern head
615. The greyish light begins to spread,
616. The otter to his cavern drew,
617. And clamour'd shrill the wakening mew;
618. Then watch'd the Page - to needful rest
619. The King resigned his anxious breast.

620. XXVIII.
621. To Allan's eyes was harder task,
622. The weary watch their safeties ask.
623. He trimm'd the fire, and gave to shine
624. With bickering light the splinter'd pine;
625. Then gazed a while, where silent laid
626. Their hosts were shrouded by the plaid.
627. But little fear waked in his mind,
628. For he was bred of martial kind,
629. And, if to manhood he arrive,
630. May match the boldest knight alive.
631. Then thought he of his mother's tower,
632. His little sisters' greenwood bower,
633. How there the Easter-gambols pass,
634. And of Dan Joseph's lengthen'd mass.
635. But still before his weary eye
636. In rays prolong'd the blazes die -
637. Again he roused him - on the lake
638. Look'd forth, where now the twilight-flake
639. Of pale cold dawn began to wake.
640. On Coolin's cliffs the mist lay furl'd,
641. The morning breeze the lake had curl'd,
642. The short dark waves, heaved to the land,
643. With ceaseless plash kiss'd cliff or sand;-
644. It was a slumbrous sound - he turn'd
645. To tales at which his youth had burn'd,
646. Of pilgrim's path by demon cross'd,
647. Of sprightly elf or yelling ghost,
648. Of the wild witch's baneful cot,
649. And mermaid's alabaster grot,
650. Who bathes her limbs in sunless well
651. Deep in Strathaird's enchanted cell.
652. Thither in fancy rapt he flies,
653. And on his sight the vaults arise;
654. That hut's dark walls he sees no more,
655. His foot is on the marble floor,
656. And o'er his head the dazzling spars
657. Gleam like a firmament of stars!
658. -Hark! hears he not the sea-nymph speak
659. Her anger in that thrilling shriek!-
660. No! all too late, with Allan's dream
661. Mingled the captive's warning scream.
662. As from the ground he strives to start,
663. A ruffian's dagger finds his heart!
664. Upwards he cast his dizzy eyes,…
665. Murmurs his master's name,…and dies!

666. XXIX.
667. Not so awoke the King! his hand
668. Snatch'd from the flame a knotted brand,
669. The nearest weapon on his wrath;
670. With this he cross'd the murderer's path.
671. And venged young Allan well!
672. The spatter'd brain and bubbling blood
673. Hiss'd on the half-extinguish'd wood,
674. The miscreant gasp'd and fell!
675. Nor rose in peace the Island Lord;
676. One caitiff died upon his sword,
677. And one beneath his grasp lies prone,
678. And one beneath his grasp lies prone,
679. In mortal grapple overthrown.
680. But while Lord Ronald's dagger drank
681. The life-blood from his panting flank,
682. The Father-ruffian of the band
683. Behind him rears a coward hand!
684. - O for a moment's aid,
685. Till Bruce, who deals no double blow,
686. Dash to the earth another foe,
687. Above his comrade laid!-
688. And it is gain'd - the captive sprung
689. On the raised arm, and closely clung,
690. And, ere he shook him loose,
691. The master'd felon press'd the ground,
692. And gasp'd beneath a mortal wound,
693. While o'er him stands the Bruce.

694. XXX.
695. 'Miscreant! while lasts thy flitting spark,
696. Give me to know the purpose dark,
697. That arm'd thy hand with murderous knife,
698. Against offenceless stranger's life?' -
699. - 'No stranger thou!' with accent fell,
700. Murmur'd the wretch; 'I know thee well;
701. And know thee for the foeman sworn
702. Of my high Chief, the mighty Lorn.'-
703. 'Speak yet again, and speak the truth
704. For thy soul's sake! - from whence this youth?
705. His country, birth, and name declare,
706. And thus one evil deed repair.'-
707. 'Vex me no more!…my blood runs cold…
708. No more I know than I have told.
709. We found him in a bark we sought
710. With different purpose…and I thought'…
711. Fate cut him short; in blood and broil,
712. As he had lived, died Cormac Doil.

713. XXXI.
714. The resting on his bloody blade,
715. The valiant Bruce to Ronald said, -
716. 'Now shame upon us both! - that boy
717. Lifts his mute face to heaven,
718. And clasps his hands, to testify
719. His gratitude to God on high,
720. For strange deliverance given.
721. His speechless gesture thanks hath paid.
722. Which our free tongues have left unsaid!'
723. He raised the youth with kindly word,
724. But mark'd him shudder at the sword:
725. He cleansed it from its hue of death,
726. And plunged the weapon in its sheath.
727. 'Alas, poor child! unfitting part
728. Fate doom'd, when with so soft a heart,
729. And form so slight as thine,
730. She made thee first a pirate's slave,
731. Then, in his stead, a patron gave
732. Of wayward lot like mine;
733. A landless prince, whose wandering life
734. Is but one scene of blood and strife-
735. Yet scant of friends the Bruce shall be,
736. But he'll find resting-place for thee.-
737. Come, noble Ronald! o'er the dead
738. Enough thy generous grief is paid,
739. And well has Allen's fate been wroke;
740. Come, wend we hence - the day has broke.
741. Seek we our bark - I trust the tale
742. Was false, that she had hoisted sail.'

743. XXXII.
744. Yet, ere they left that charnel-cell,
745. The Island Lord bade sad farewell
746. To Allan: - 'Who shall tell this tale,'
747. He said, 'in halls of Donagaile!
748. Oh, who his widow'd mother tell,
749. That, ere his bloom, her fairest fell!-
750. Rest thee, poor youth! and trust my care
751. For mass and knell and funeral prayer;
752. While o'er those caitiffs, where they lie,
753. The wolf shall snarl, the raven cry!'-
754. And now the eastern mountain's head
755. On the dark lake threw lustre red;
756. Bright gleams of gold and purple streak
757. Ravine and precipice and peak -
758. (So earthly power at distance shows;
759. Reveals his splendour, hides his woes).
760. O'er sheets of granite, dark and broad,
761. Rent and unequal, lay the road.
762. In sad discourse the warriors wind,
763. And the mute captive moves behind.
