1. The scenes are desert now, and bare,
2. Where flourished once a forest fair
3. When these waste glens with copse were lined,
4. And peopled with the hart and hind.
5. Yon thorn-perchance whose prickly spears
6. Have fenced him for three hundred years,
7. While fell around his green compeers -
8. Yon lonely thorn, would he could tell
9. The changes of his parent dell,
10. Since he, so grey and stubborn now,
11. Waved in each breeze a sapling bough:
12. Would he could tell how deep the shade
13. A thousand mingled branches made;
14. How broad the shadows of the oak,
15. How clung the rowan to the rock,
16. And through the foliage showed his head,
17. With narrow leaves and berries red;
18. What pines on every mountain sprung,
19. O'er every dell what birches hung,
20. In every breeze what aspens shook,
21. What alders shaded every brook!

22. 'Here, in my shade,' methinks he'd say,
23. 'The mighty stag at noontide lay:
24. The wolf I've seen, a fiercer game
25. (The neighbouring dingle bears his name),
26. With lurching step around me prowl,
27. And stop, against the moon to howl;
28. The mountain-boar, on battle set,
29. His tusks upon my stem would whet;
30. While doe, and roe, and red-deer good,
31. Have bounded by, through gay greenwood.
32. Then oft, from Newark's riven tower,
33. Sallied a Scottish monarch's power:
34. A thousand vassals mustered round,
35. With horse, and hawk, and horn, and hound;
36. And I might see the youth intent,
37. Guard every pass with crossbow bent;
38. And through the brake the rangers stalk,
39. And falc'ners hold the ready hawk;
40. And foresters in greenwood trim,
41. Lead in the leash the gazehounds grim,
42. Attentive as the bratchet's bay
43. From the dark covert drove the prey,
44. To slip them as he broke away.
45. The startled quarry bounds amain,
46. As fast the gallant greyhounds strain;
47. Whistles the arrow from the bow,
48. Answers the arquebuss below;
49. While all the rocking hills reply,
50. To hoof-clang, hound, and hunter's cry,
51. And bugles ringing lightsomely.'

52. Of such proud huntings many tales
53. Yet linger in our lonely dales,
54. Up pathless Ettrick and on Yarrow,
55. Where erst the outlaw drew his arrow.
56. But not more blithe that silvan court,
57. Than we have been at humbler sport;
58. Though small our pomp, and mean our game
59. Our mirth, dear Mariott, was the same.
60. Remember'st thou my greyhounds true?
61. O'er holt or hill there never flew,
62. From slip or leash there never sprang,
63. More fleet of foot, or sure of fang.
64. Nor dull, between each merry chase,
65. Passed by the intermitted space;
66. For we had fair resource in store,
67. In Classic and in Gothic lore:
68. We marked each memorable scene,
69. And held poetic talk between;
70. Nor hill nor brook we paced along
71. But had its legend or its song.
72. All silent now-for now are still
73. Thy bowers, untenanted Bowhill!
74. No longer, from thy mountains dun,
75. The yeoman hears the well-known gun,
76. And while his honest heart glows Warm,
77. At thought of his paternal farm,
78. Round to his mates a brimmer fills,
79. And drinks, 'The Chieftain of the Hills!'
80. No fairy forms, in Yarrow's bowers,
81. Trip o'er the walks, or tend the flowers,
82. Fair as the elves whom Janet saw
83. By moonlight dance on Carterhaugh;
84. No youthful baron's left to grace
85. The forest-sheriff's lonely chase,
86. And ape, in manly step and tone,
87. The majesty of Oberon:
88. And she is gone, whose lovely face
89. Is but her least and lowest grace;
90. Though if to sylphid queen 'twere given
91. To show our earth the charms of Heaven,
92. She could not glide along the air,
93. With form more light, or face more fair.
94. No more the widow's deafened ear
95. Grows quick that lady's step to hear:
96. At noontide she expects her not,
97. Nor busies her to trim the cot:
98. Pensive she turns her humming wheel,
99. Or pensive cooks her orphans' meal;
100. Yet blesses, ere she deals their bread,
101. The gentle hand by which they're fed.

102. From Yair,-which hills so closely bind,
103. Scarce can the Tweed his passage find,
104. Though much he fret, and chafe, and toil,
105. Till all his eddying currents boil, -
106. Her long descended lord is gone,
107. And left us by the stream alone.
108. And much I miss those sportive boys,
109. Companions of my mountain joys,
110. Just at the age 'twixt boy and youth,
111. When thought is speech, and speech is truth.
112. Close to my side, with what delight
113. They pressed to hear of Wallace wight,
114. When, pointing to his airy mound,
115. I called his ramparts holy ground!
116. Kindled their brows to hear me speak;
117. And I have smiled, to feel my cheek,
118. Despite the difference of our years,
119. Return again the glow of theirs.
120. Ah, happy boys! such feelings pure,
121. They will not, cannot, long endure;
122. Condemned to stem the world's rude tide,
123. You may not linger by the side;
124. For Fate shall thrust you from the shore,
125. And Passion ply the sail and oar.
126. Yet cherish the remembrance still,
127. Of the lone mountain and the rill;
128. For trust, dear boys, the time will come
129. When fiercer transport shall be dumb,
130. And you will think right frequently,
131. But, well I hope, without a sigh,
132. On the free hours that we have spent
133. Together, on the brown hill's bent.

134. When, musing on companions gone,
135. We doubly feel ourselves alone,
136. Something, my friend, we yet may gain;
137. There is a pleasure in this pain:
138. It soothes the love of lonely rest,
139. Deep in each gentler heart impressed.
140. 'Tis silent amid worldly toils,
141. And stifled soon by mental broils;
142. But, in a bosom thus prepared,
143. Its still small voice is often heard,
144. Whispering a mingled sentiment,
145. 'Twixt resignation and content.
146. Oft in my mind such thoughts awake,
147. By lone Saint Mary's silent lake;
148. Thou know'st it well,-nor fen, nor sedge,
149. Pollute the pure lake's crystal edge;
150. Abrupt and sheer, the mountains sink
151. At once upon the level brink;
152. And just a trace of silver sand
153. Marks where the water meets the land.
154. Far in the mirror, bright and blue,
155. Each hill's huge outline you may view;
156. Shaggy with heath, but lonely bare,
157. Nor tree, nor bush, nor brake, is there,
158. Save where of land yon slender line
159. Bears thwart the lake the scattered pine.
160. Yet even this nakedness has power,
161. And aids the feeling of the hour:
162. Nor thicket, dell, nor copse you spy,
163. Where living thing concealed might lie;
164. Nor point, retiring, hides a dell,
165. Where swain, or woodman lone, might dwell;
166. There's nothing left to fancy's guess,
167. You see that all is loneliness:
168. And silence aids-though the steep hills
169. Send to the lake a thousand rills;
170. In summer tide, so soft they weep,
171. The sound but lulls the ear asleep;
172. Your horse's hoof-tread sounds too rude,
173. So stilly is the solitude.

174. Nought living meets the eye or ear,
175. But well I ween the dead are near;
176. For though, in feudal strife, a foe
177. Hath lain our Lady's chapel low,
178. Yet still beneath the hallowed soil,
179. The peasant rests him from his toil,
180. And, dying, bids his bones be laid,
181. Where erst his simple fathers prayed.

182. If age had tamed the passion's strife,
183. And fate had cut my ties to life,
184. Here, have I thought, 'twere sweet to dwell
185. And rear again the chaplain's cell,
186. Like that same peaceful hermitage
187. Where Milton longed to spend his age.
188. 'Twere sweet to mark the setting day
189. On Bourhope's lonely top decay;
190. And, as it faint and feeble died
191. On the broad lake and mountain's side,
192. To say, 'Thus pleasures fade away;
193. Youth, talents, beauty, thus decay,
194. And leave us dark, forlorn, and grey;'
195. Then gaze on Dryhope's ruined tower,
196. And think on Yarrow's faded Flower:
197. And when that mountain-sound I heard,
198. Which bids us be for storm prepared,
199. The distant rustling of his wings,
200. As up his force the tempest brings,
201. 'Twere sweet, ere yet his terrors rave,
202. To sit upon the wizard's grave -
203. That wizard-priest's, whose bones are thrust
204. From company of holy dust;
205. On which no sunbeam ever shines -
206. So superstition's creed divines -
207. Thence view the lake, with sullen roar,
208. Heave her broad billows to the shore;
209. And mark the wild swans mount the gale,
210. Spread wide through mist their snowy sail,
211. And ever stoop again, to lave
212. Their bosoms on the surging wave:
213. Then, when against the driving hail
214. No longer might my plaid avail,
215. Back to my lonely home retire,
216. And light my lamp, and trim my fire;
217. There ponder o'er some mystic lay,
218. Till the wild tale had all its sway,
219. And, in the bittern's distant shriek,
220. I heard unearthly voices speak,
221. And thought the wizard-priest was come
222. To claim again his ancient home!
223. And bade my busy fancy range,
224. To frame him fitting shape and strange,
225. Till from the task my brow I cleared,
226. And smiled to think that I had feared.

227. But chief 'twere sweet to think such life
228. (Though but escape from fortune's strife),
229. Something most matchless good and wise,
230. A great and grateful sacrifice;
231. And deem each hour to musing given
232. A step upon the road to heaven.

233. Yet him whose heart is ill at ease
234. Such peaceful solitudes displease;
235. He loves to drown his bosom's jar
236. Amid the elemental war:
237. And my black Palmer's choice had been
238. Some ruder and more savage scene,
239. Like that which frowns round dark Lochskene.
240. There eagles scream from isle to shore;
241. Down all the rocks the torrents roar;
242. O'er the black waves incessant driven,
243. Dark mists infect the summer heaven;
244. Through the rude barriers of the lake
245. Away its hurrying waters break,
246. Faster and whiter dash and curl,
247. Till down yon dark abyss they hurl.
248. Rises the fog-smoke white as snow,
249. Thunders the viewless stream below.
250. Diving, as if condemned to lave
251. Some demon's subterranean cave,
252. Who, prisoned by enchanter's spell,
253. Shakes the dark rock with groan and yell.
254. And well that Palmer's form and mien
255. Had suited with the stormy scene,
256. Just on the edge, straining his ken
257. To view the bottom of the den,
258. Where, deep deep down, and far within,
259. Toils with the rocks the roaring linn;
260. Then, issuing forth one foamy wave,
261. And wheeling round the giant's grave,
262. White as the snowy charger's tail
263. Drives down the pass of Moffatdale.

264. Marriott, thy harp, on Isis strung,
265. To many a Border theme has rung;
266. Then list to me, and thou shalt know
267. Of this mysterious man of woe.
