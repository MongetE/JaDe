1. I.
2. Stranger! if e'er thine ardent step hath traced
3. The northern realms of ancient Caledon,
4. Where the proud Queen of Wilderness hath placed,
5. By lake and cataract, her lonely throne;
6. Sublime but sad delight thy soul hath known,
7. Gazing on pathless glen and mountain high,
8. Listing where from the cliffs the torrents thrown
9. Mingle their echoes with the eagle's cry,
10. And with the sounding lake, and with the moaning sky.

11. Yes! 'twas sublime, but sad. - The loneliness
12. Loaded thy heart, the desert tired thine eye;
13. And strange and awful fears began to press
14. Thy bosom with a stern solemnity.
15. Then hast thou wish'd some woodman's cottage nigh,
16. Something that show'd of life, though low and mean;
17. Glad sight, its curling wreath of smoke to spy,
18. Glad sound, its cock's blithe carol would have been,
19. Or children whooping wild beneath the willows green.

20. Such are the scenes, where savage grandeur wakes
21. An awful thrill that softens into sighs;
22. Such feelings rouse them by dim Rannoch's lakes,
23. In dark Glencoe such gloomy raptures rise:
24. Or farther, where, beneath the northern skies,
25. Chides wild Loch-Eribol his caverns hoar-
26. But, be the minstrel judge, they yield the prize
27. Of desert dignity to that dread shore,
28. That sees grim Coolin rise, and hears Coriskin roar.

29. II.
30. Through such wild scenes the champion pass'd,
31. When bold halloo and bugle blast
32. Upon the breeze came loud and fast.
33. 'There,' said the Bruce, 'rung Edward's horn!
34. What can have caused such brief return?
35. And see, brave Ronald,- see him dart
36. O'er stock and stone like hunted hart,
37. Precipitate, as is the use,
38. In war or sport, or Edward Bruce.
39. - He marks us, and his eager cry
40. Will tell his news ere he be nigh.'

41. III.
42. Loud Edward shouts, 'What make ye here,
43. Warring upon the mountain-deer,
44. When Scotland wants her King?
45. A bark from Lennox cross'd our track,
46. With her in speed I hurried back,
47. These joyful news to bring -
48. The Stuart stirs in Teviotdale,
49. And Douglas wakes his native vale;
50. Thy storm-toss'd fleet hath won its way
51. With little loss to Brodick-Bay,
52. And Lennox, with a gallant band,
53. Waits but thy coming and command
54. To waft them o'er to Carrick strand.
55. There are blithe news! - but mark the close!
56. Edward, the deadliest of our foes,
57. As with his host he northward pass'd,
58. Hath on the borders breathed his last.'

59. IV.
60. Still stood the Bruce - his steady cheek
61. Was little wont his joy to speak,
62. But then his colour rose:-
63. 'Now, Scotland! shortly shalt thou see,
64. With God's high will, thy children free,
65. And vengeance on thy foes!
66. Yet to no sense of selfish wrongs,
67. Bear witness with me, Heaven, belongs
68. My joy o'er Edward's bier;
69. I took my knighthood at his hand,
70. And lordship held of him, and land,
71. And well may vouch it here,
72. That, blot the story from his page,
73. Of Scotland ruin'd in his rage,
74. You read a monarch brave and sage,
75. And to his people dear.'-
76. 'Let London's burghers mourn her Lord,
77. And Croydon monks his praise record,'
78. The eager Edward said;
79. 'Eternal as his own, my hate
80. Surmounts the bounds of mortal fate,
81. And dies not with the dead
82. Such hate was his on Solway's strand,
83. That pointed yet to Scotland's land,
84. As his last accents pray'd
85. Disgrace and curse upon his heir,
86. If he one Scottish head should spare,
87. Till stretch'd upon the bloody lair
88. Each rebel corpse was laid!
89. Such hate was his, when his last breath
90. Renounced the peaceful house of death,
91. And bade his bones to Scotland's coast
92. Be borne by his remorseless host,
93. As if his dead and stony eye
94. Could still enjoy her misery!
95. Such hate was his - dark, deadly, long:
96. Mine, - as enduring, deep, and strong!'-

97. V.
98. 'Let women, Edward, war with words,
99. With curses monks, but men with swords:
100. Nor doubt of living foes, to sate
101. Deepest revenge and deadliest hate.
102. Now, to the sea! Behold the beach,
103. And see the galleys' pendants stretch
104. Their fluttering length down favouring gale
105. Aboard, aboard! and hoist the sail.
106. Hold we our way for Arran first,
107. Where meet in arms our friends dispersed;
108. Lennox the loyal, De la Haye,
109. And Boyd the bold in battle fray.
110. I long the hardy band to head,
111. And see once more my standard spread.-
112. Does noble Ronald share our course,
113. Or stay to raise his island force?'-
114. 'Come weal, come woe, by Bruce's side,'
115. Replied the Chief, 'will Ronald bide.
116. And since two galleys yonder ride,
117. Be mine, so please my liege, dismiss'd
118. To wake the arms the clans of Uist,
119. And all who hear the Minche's roar,
120. On the Long Island's lonely shore.
121. The nearer Isles, with slight delay,
122. Ourselves may summon in our way;
123. And soon on Arran's shore shall meet,
124. With Torquil's aid, a gallant fleet,
125. If aught avails their Chieftain's hest
126. Among the islemen of the west.'

127. VI.
128. Thus was their venturous council said.
129. But, ere their sails the galleys spread,
130. Coriskin dark and Coolin high
131. Echoed the dirge's doleful cry.
132. Along that sable lake pass'd slow,-
133. Fit scene for such a sight of woe,-
134. The sorrowing islesmen, as they bore
135. The murder'd Allan to the shore.
136. At every pause, with dismal shout,
137. Their coronach of grief rung out,
138. And ever, when they moved again,
139. The pipes resumed their clamorous strain,
140. And, with the pibroch's shrilling wail,
141. Mourn'd the young heir of Donagaile.
142. Round and around, from cliff and cave,
143. His answer stern old Coolin gave,
144. Till high upon his misty side
145. Languish'd the mournful notes, and died.
146. For never sounds, by mortal made,
147. Attain'd his high and haggard head,
148. That echoes but the tempest's moan,
149. Or the deep thunder's rending groan.

150. VII.
151. Merrily, merrily bounds the bark,
152. She bounds before the gale,
153. The mountain breeze from Ben-na-darch
154. Is joyous in her sail!
155. With fluttering sound like laughter hoarse,
156. The cords and canvas strain,
157. The waves, divided by her force,
158. In rippling eddies chased her course,
159. As if they laugh'd again.
160. Not down the breeze more blithely flew,
161. Skimming the wave, the light sea-mew,
162. Than the gay galley bore
163. Her course upon that favouring wind,
164. And Coolin's crest has sunk behind,
165. And Slapin's cavern'd shore.
166. 'Twas then that warlike signals wake
167. Dunscaith's dark towers and Eisord's lake,
168. And soon, from Cavilgarrigh's head,
169. Thick wreaths of eddying smoke were spread;
170. A summons these of war and wrath
171. To the brave clans of Sleat and Strath,
172. And, ready at the sight,
173. Each warrior to his weapons sprung,
174. And targe upon his shoulder flung,
175. Impatient for the fight.
176. Mac-Kinnon's chief, in warfare grey,
177. Had charge to muster their array,
178. And guide their barks to Brodick-Bay.

179. VIII.
180. Signal of Ronald's high command,
181. A beacon gleam'd o'er sea and land,
182. From Canna's tower, that, steep and gray,
183. Like falcon-nest o'erhangs the bay.
184. Seek not the giddy crag to climb,
185. To view the turret scathed by time;
186. It is a task of doubt and fear
187. To aught but goat or mountain-deer.
188. But rest thee on the silver beach,
189. And let the aged herdsman teach
190. His tale of former day;
191. His cur's wild clamour he shall chide,
192. And for thy seat by ocean's side,
193. His varied plaid display;
194. Then tell, how with their Chieftain came,
195. In ancient times, a foreign dame
196. To yonder turret grey.
197. Stern was her Lord's suspicious mind,
198. Who in so rude a jail confined
199. So soft and fair a thrall!
200. And oft, when moon on ocean slept,
201. That lovely lady sate and wept
202. Upon the castle-wall,
203. And turn'd her eye to southern climes,
204. And thought perchance of happier times,
205. And touch'd her lute by fits, and sung
206. Wild ditties in her native tongue.
207. And still, when on the cliff and bay
208. Placid and pale the moonbeams play,
209. And every breeze is mute,
210. Upon the lone Hebridean's ear
211. Steals a strange pleasure mix'd with fear,
212. While from that cliff he seems to hear
213. The murmur of a lute,
214. And sounds, as of a captive lone,
215. That mourns her woes in tongue unknown.-
216. Strange is the tale - but all too long
217. Already hath it staid the song -
218. Yet who may pass them by,
219. That crag and tower in ruins grey,
220. Nor to their hapless tenant pay
221. The tribute of a sigh!

222. IX.
223. Merrily, merrily bounds the bark
224. O'er the broad ocean driven,
225. Her path by Ronin's mountains dark
226. The steerman's hand hath given.
227. And Ronin's mountains dark have sent
228. Their hunters to the shore,
229. And each his ashen bow unbent,
230. And gave his pastime o'er,
231. And at the Island Lord's command,
232. For hunting spear took warrior's brand.
233. On Scooreigg next a warning light
234. Summon'd her warriors to the fight;
235. A numerous race, ere stern MacLeod
236. O'er their bleak shores in vengeance strode,
237. When all in vain the ocean-cave
238. Its refuge to his victims gave.
239. The Chief, relentless in his wrath,
240. With blazing heath blockades the path;
241. In dense and stifling volumes roll'd,
242. The vapour fill'd the cavern'd hold!
243. The warrior-threat, the infant's plain,
244. The mother's screams, were heard in vain;
245. The vengeful Chief maintains his fires,
246. Till in the vault a tribe expires!
247. The bones which strew that cavern's gloom,
248. Too well attest their dismal doom.

249. X.
250. Merrily, merrily goes the bark
251. On a breeze from the northward free,
252. So shoots through the morning sky the lark
253. Or the swan through the summer sea.
254. The shores of Mull on the eastward lay,
255. And Ulva dark, and Colonsay,
256. And all the group of islets gay
257. That guard famed Staffa round.
258. Then all unknown its columns rose,
259. Where dark and undisturb'd repose
260. The cormorant had found,
261. And the shy seal had quiet home,
262. And welter'd in that wondrous dome,
263. Where, as to shame the temples deck'd
264. By skill of earthly architect,
265. Nature herself, it seem'd, would raise
266. A Minister to her Maker's praise!
267. Not for a meaner use ascend
268. Her columns, or her arches bend;
269. Nor of a theme less solemn tells
270. That mighty surge that ebbs and swells,
271. And still, between each awful pause,
272. From the high vault an answer draws,
273. In varied tone prolong'd and high,
274. That mocks the organ's melody.
275. Nor doth its entrance front in vain
276. To old Iona's holy fane,
277. That Nature's voice might seem to say,
278. 'Well hast thou done, frail Child of clay!
279. Thy humble powers that stately shrine
280. Task'd high and hard - but witness mine!'

281. XI.
282. Merrily, merrily goes the bark -
283. Before the gale she bounds;
284. So darts the dolphin from the shark,
285. Or the deer before the hounds.
286. They left Loch-Tua on their lee,
287. And they waken'd the men of the wild Tiree,
288. And the Chief of the sandy Coll;
289. They paused not at Columba's isle,
290. Though peal'd the bells from the holy pile
291. With long and measured toll;
292. No time for matin or for mass,
293. And the sounds of the holy summons pass
294. Away in the billows' roll.
295. Lochbuie's fierce and warlike Lord
296. Their signal saw, and grasp'd his sword,
297. And verdant Ilay call'd her host,
298. And the clans of Jura's rugged coast
299. Lord Ronald's call obey,
300. And Scarba's isle, whose tortured shore
301. Still rings to Corrievreken's roar,
302. And lonely Colonsay;
303. -Scenes sung by him who sings no more
304. His bright and brief career is o'er,
305. And mute his tuneful strains;
306. Quench'd is his lamp of varied lore,
307. That loved the light of song to pour;
308. A distant and a deadly shore
309. Has Leyden's cold remains!

310. XII.
311. Ever the breeze blows merrily,
312. But the galley ploughs no more the sea.
313. Lest, rounding wild Cantyre, they meet
314. The southern foeman's watchful fleet,
315. They held unwonted way;-
316. Up Tarbat's western lake they bore,
317. Then dragg'd their bark the isthmus o'er,
318. As far as Kilmaconnel's shore,
319. Upon the eastern bay.
320. It was a wondrous sight to see
321. Topmast and pennon glitter free,
322. High raised above the greenwood tree,
323. As on dry land the galley moves,
324. By cliff and copse and alder groves.
325. Deep import from that selcouth sign,
326. Did many a mountain Seer divine,
327. For ancient legends told the Gael,
328. That when a royal bark should sail
329. O'er Kilmaconnel moss,
330. Old Albyn should in fight prevail,
331. And every foe should faint and quail
332. Before her silver Cross.

333. XIII.
334. Now launch'd once more, the inland sea
335. They furrow with fair augury,
336. And steer for Arran's isle;
337. The sun, ere yet he sunk behind
338. Ben-Ghoil, 'the Mountain of the Wind,'
339. Gave his grim peaks a greeting kind,
340. And bade Loch Ranza smile.
341. Thither their destined course they drew;
342. It seem'd the isle her monarch knew,
343. So brilliant was the landward view,
344. The ocean so serene;
345. Each puny wave in diamonds roll'd
346. O'er the calm deep, where hues of gold
347. With azure strove and green.
348. The hill, the yale, the tree, the tower,
349. Glow'd with the tints of evening's hour,
350. The beech was silver sheen,
351. The wind breathed soft as lover's sigh,
352. And, oft renew'd, seem'd oft to die,
353. With breathless pause between.
354. O who, with speech of war and woes,
355. Would wish to break the soft repose
356. Of such enchanting scene!

357. XIV.
358. Is it of war Lord Ronald speaks?
359. The blush that dyes his manly cheeks,
360. The timid look, and downcast eye,
361. And faltering voice the theme deny.
362. And good King Robert's brow express'd,
363. He ponder'd o'er some high request
364. As doubtful to approve;
365. Yet in his eye and lip the while,
366. Dwelt the half-pitying glance and smile,
367. Which manhood's graver mood beguile,
368. When lover's talk of love.
369. Anxious his suit Lord Ronald pled;
370. - 'And for my bride betrothed,' he said,
371. 'My Liege has heard the rumour spread
372. Of Edith from Artornish fled.
373. Too hard her fate - I claim no right
374. To blame her for her hasty flight;
375. Be joy and happiness her lot!-
376. But she hath fled the bridal-knot,
377. And Lorn recall'd his promised plight,
378. In the assembled chieftains' sight.-
379. When, to fulfil our fathers' band,
380. I proffer'd all I could - my hand -
381. I was repulsed with scorn;
382. Mine honour I should ill assert,
383. And worse the feelings of my heart,
384. If I should play a suitor's part
385. Again, to pleasure Lorn.'-

386. XV.
387. 'Young Lord,' the Royal Bruce replied,
388. 'That question must the Church decide;
389. Yet seems it hard, since rumours state
390. Edith takes Clifford for her mate,
391. The very tie, which she hath broke,
392. To thee should still be binding yoke.
393. But, for my sister Isabel -
394. The mood of woman who can tell?
395. I guess the Champion of the Rock,
396. Victorious in the tourney shock,
397. That knight unknown, to whom the prize
398. She dealt, - had favour in her eyes;
399. But since our brother Nigel's fate,
400. Our ruin'd house and hapless state,
401. From worldly joy and hope estranged,
402. Much is the hapless mourner changed.
403. Perchance,' here smiled the noble King,
404. 'This tale may other musings bring.
405. Soon shall we know - yon mountains hide
406. The little convent of Saint Bride;
407. There, sent by Edward, she must stay,
408. Till fate shall give more prosperous day;
409. And thither will I bear thy suit,
410. Nor will thine advocate be mute.'

411. XVI.
412. As thus they talk'd in earnest mood,
413. That speechless boy beside them stood.
414. He stoop'd his head against the mast,
415. And bitter sobs came thick and fast,
416. A grief that would not be repress'd,
417. But seem'd to burst his youthful breast.
418. His hands, against his forehead held,
419. As if by force his tears repell'd,
420. But through his fingers, long and slight,
421. Fast trill'd the drops of crystal bright.
422. Edward, who walk'd the deck apart,
423. First spied this conflict of the heart.
424. Thoughtless as brave, with bluntness kind
425. He sought to cheer the sorrower's mind;
426. By force the slender hand he drew
427. From those poor eyes that stream'd with dew,
428. As in his hold the stripling strove,-
429. ('Twas a rough grasp, though meant in love),
430. Away his tears the warrior swept,
431. And bade shame on him that he wept.
432. 'I would to heaven, thy helpless tongue
433. Could tell me who hath wrought thee wrong!
434. For, were he of our crew the best,
435. The insult went not undress'd.
436. Come, cheer thee; thou art now of age
437. To be a warrior's gallant page;
438. Thou shalt be mine! - a palfrey fair
439. O'er hill and holt my boy shall bear,
440. To hold my bow in hunting grove,
441. Or speed on errand to my love;
442. For well I wot thou wilt not tell
443. The temple where my wishes dwell.'

444. XVII.
445. Bruce interposed, - 'Gay Edward, no,
446. This is no youth to hold thy bow,
447. To fill thy goblet, or to bear
448. Thy message light to lighter fair.
449. Thou art a patron all too wild
450. And thoughtless, for this orphan child.
451. See'st thou not how apart he steals,
452. Keeps lonely couch and lonely meals?
453. Fitter by far in yon calm cell
454. To tend our sister Isabel,
455. With Father Augustine to share
456. The peaceful change of convent prayer,
457. Than wander wild adventures through,
458. With such a reckless guide as you.'-
459. 'Thanks, brother!' Edward answer'd gay,
460. 'For the high laud thy words convey!
461. But we may learn some future day,
462. If thou or I can this poor boy
463. Protect the best, or best employ.
464. Meanwhile, our vessel nears the strand;
465. Launch we the boat, and seek the land.'

466. XVIII.
467. To land King Robert lightly sprung,
468. And thrice aloud his bugle rung
469. With note prolong'd and varied strain,
470. Till bold Ben-Ghoil replied again.
471. Good Douglas then, and De la Haye,
472. Had in a glen a hart at bay,
473. And Lennox cheered the laggard hounds,
474. When waked that horn the greenwood bounds.
475. 'It is the foe!' cried Boyd, who came
476. In breathless haste with eye of flame,-
477. 'It is the foe! - Each valiant lord
478. Fling by his bow, and grasp his sword!'-
479. 'Not so,' replied the good Lord James,
480. 'That blast no English bugle claims,
481. Oft have I heard it fire the fight.
482. Dead were my heart, and deaf mine ear,
483. If Bruce should call, nor Douglas hear!
484. Each to Loch Ranza's margin spring;
485. That blast was winded by the King!'

486. XIX.
487. Fast to their mates the tidings spread,
488. And fast to shore the warriors sped.
489. Bursting from glen and greenwood tree,
490. High waked their loyal jubilee!
491. Around the royal Bruce they crowd,
492. And clasp'd his hands, and wept aloud.
493. Veterans of early fields were there,
494. Whose helmets press'd their hoary hair,
495. Whose swords and axes bore a stain
496. From life-blood of the red-hair'd Dane;
497. And boys, whose hands scarce brook'd to wield
498. The heavy sword or bossy shield.
499. Men too were there, that bore the scars
500. Impress'd in Albyn's woeful wars,
501. At Falkirk's fierce and fatal fight,
502. Teyndrum's dread rout, and Methven's flight;
503. The might of Douglas there was seen,
504. There Lennox with his graceful mien;
505. Kirkpatrick, Closeburn's dreaded Knight;
506. The Lindsay, fiery, fierce, and light;
507. The Heir of murder'd De la Haye,
508. And Boyd the grave, and Seton gay.
509. Around their King regain'd they press'd,
510. Wept, shouted, clasp'd him to their breast,
511. And young and old, and serf and lord,
512. And he who ne'er unsheathed a sword,
513. And he in many a peril tried,
514. Alike resolved the brunt to bide,
515. And live or die by Bruce's side!

516. XX.
517. Oh, War, thou hast thy fierce delight,
518. Thy gleams of joy, intensely bright!
519. Such gleams, as from thy polish'd shield
520. Fly dazzling o'er the battle-field!
521. Such transports wake, severe and high,
522. Amid the pealing conquest-cry;
523. Scarce less, when, after battle lost,
524. Muster the remnants of a host,
525. And as each comrade's name they tell,
526. Who in the well-fought conflict fell,
527. Knitting stern brow o'er flashing eye,
528. Vow to avenge them or to die! -
529. Warriors! - and where are warriors found,
530. If not on martial Britain's ground?
531. And who, when waked with note of fire,
532. Love more than they the British lyre?-
533. Know ye not, - hearts to honour dear!
534. That joy, deep-thrilling, stern, severe,
535. At which the heartstrings vibrate high,
536. And wake the fountains of the eye?
537. And blame ye, then, the Bruce, if trace
538. Of tear is on his manly face,
539. When, scanty relics of the train
540. That hail'd at Scone his early reign,
541. This patriot band around him hung,
542. And to his knees and bosom clung?-
543. Blame ye the Bruce? - His brother blamed,
544. But shared the weakness, while ashamed,
545. With haughty laugh his head he turn'd,
546. And dash'd away the tear he scorn'd.

547. XXI.
548. 'Tis morning, and the Convent bell
549. Long time had ceased its matin knell,
550. Within thy walls, Saint Bride!
551. An aged Sister sought the cell
552. Assign'd to Lady Isabel,
553. And hurriedly she cried,
554. 'Haste, gentle Lady, haste! - there waits
555. A noble stranger at the gates;
556. Saint Bride's poor vot'ress ne'er has seen
557. A Knight of such a princely mien;
558. His errand, as he bade me tell,
559. Is with the Lady Isabel.'
560. The princess rose, - for on her knee
561. Low bent she told her rosary,-
562. 'Let him by thee his purpose teach;
563. I may not give a stranger speech.'-
564. 'Saint Bride forfend, thou royal Maid!'
565. The portress cross'd herself, and said, -
566. 'Not to be Prioress might I
567. Debate his will, his suit deny.'
568. 'Has earthly show, then, simple fool,
569. Power o'er a sister of thy rule?
570. And art thou, like the worldly train,
571. Subdued by splendours light and vain?'-

572. XXII.
573. 'No, Lady! in old eyes like mine,
574. Gauds have no glitter, gems no shine;
575. Nor grace his rank attendants vain,
576. One youthful page is all his train.
577. It is the form, the eye, the word,
578. The bearing of that stranger Lord;
579. His stature, manly, bold, and tall,
580. Built like a castle's battled wall,
581. Yet moulded in such just degrees,
582. His giant-strength seems lightsome ease.
583. Close as the tendrils of the vine
584. His locks upon his forehead twine,
585. Jet-black, save where some touch of grey
586. Has ta'en the youthful hue away.
587. Weather and war their rougher trace
588. Have left on that majestic face;-
589. But 'tis his dignity of eye!
590. There, if a suppliant, would I fly,
591. Secure, 'mid danger, wrongs, and grief,
592. Of sympathy, redress, relief-
593. That glance, if guilty, would I dread
594. More than the doom that spoke me dead!'-
595. 'Enough, enough,' the Princess cried,
596. ''Tis Scotland's hope, her joy, her pride!
597. To meaner front was ne'er assign'd
598. Such mastery o'er the common mind-
599. Bestow'd thy high designs to aid,
600. How long, O Heaven! how long delay'd!-
601. Haste, Mona, haste, to introduce
602. My darling brother, Royal Bruce!'

603. XXIII.
604. They met like friends who part in pain,
605. And meet in doubtful hope again.
606. But when subdued that fitful swell,
607. The Bruce survey'd the humble cell;-
608. 'And this is thine, poor Isabel!-
609. That pallet-couch, and naked wall,
610. For room of state, and bed of pall;
611. For costly robes and jewels rare,
612. A string of beads and zone of hair;
613. And for the trumpet's sprightly call
614. To sport or banquet, grove or hall,
615. The bell's grim voice divides thy care,
616. 'Twixt hours of penitence and prayer!-
617. O ill for thee, my royal claim
618. From the First David's sainted name!
619. O woe for thee, that while he sought
620. His right, thy brother feebly fought!'-

621. XXIV.
622. 'Now lay these vain regrets aside,
623. And be the unshaken Bruce!' she cried.
624. 'For more I glory to have shared
625. The woes thy venturous spirit dared,
626. When raising first thy valiant band
627. In rescue of thy native land,
628. Than had fair Fortune set me down
629. The partner of an empire's crown.
630. And grieve not that on Pleasure's stream
631. No more I drive in giddy dream,
632. For Heaven the erring pilot knew,
633. And from the gulf the vessel drew,
634. Tried me with judgements stern and great,
635. My house's ruin, thy defeat,
636. Poor Nigel's death, till, tamed, I own,
637. My hopes are fix'd on Heaven alone;
638. Nor e'er shall earthly prospects win
639. My heart to this vain world of sin.'-

640. XXV.
641. 'Nay, Isabel, for such stern choice,
642. First wilt thou wait thy brother's voice;
643. Then ponder if in convent scene
644. No softer thoughts might intervene-
645. Say they were of that unknown Knight,
646. Victor in Woodstock's tourney-fight -
647. Nay, if his name such blush you owe,
648. Victorious o'er a fairer foe!'
649. Truly his penetrating eye
650. Hath caught that blush's passing dye,-
651. Like the last beam of evening thrown
652. On a white cloud, - just seen and gone.
653. Soon with calm cheek and steady eye,
654. The Princess made composed reply: -
655. 'I guess my brother's meaning well;
656. For not so silent is the cell,
657. But we have heard the islemen all
658. Arm in thy cause at Ronald's call,
659. And mine eye proves that Knight unknown
660. And the brave Island Lord are one.-
661. Had then his suit been earlier made,
662. In his own name, with thee to aid,
663. (But that his plighted faith forbade),
664. I know not…But thy page so near?-
665. This is no tale for menial's ear.'

666. XXVI.
667. Still stood that page, as far apart
668. As the small cell would space afford;
669. With dizzy eye and bursting heart,
670. He leant his weight on Bruce's sword,
671. The monarch's mantle too he bore,
672. And drew the fold his visage o'er.
673. 'Fear not for him - in murderous strife,'
674. Said Bruce, 'his warning saved my life;
675. Full seldom parts he from my side,
676. And in his silence I confide,
677. Since he can tell no tale again.
678. He is a boy of gentle strain,
679. And I have purposed he shall dwell
680. In Augustine the chaplain's cell,
681. And wait on thee, my Isabel.-
682. Mind not his tears; I've seen them flow,
683. As in the thaw dissolves the snow.
684. 'Tis a kind youth, but fanciful,
685. Unfit against the tide to pull,
686. And those that with the Bruce would sail,
687. Must learn to strive with stream and gale.
688. But forward, gentle Isabel-
689. My answer for Lord Ronald tell.'-

690. XXVII.
691. 'This answer be to Ronald given -
692. The heart he asks is fix'd on heaven.
693. My love was like a summer flower,
694. That wither'd in the wintry hour
695. Born but of vanity and pride,
696. And with these sunny visions died.
697. If further press his suit - then say,
698. He should his plighted troth obey,
699. Troth plighted both with ring and word,
700. And sworn on crucifix and sword.-
701. Oh, shame thee, Robert! I have seen
702. Thou hast a woman's guardian been!
703. Even in extremity's dread hour,
704. When press'd on thee the Southern power,
705. And safety, to all human sight,
706. Was only found in rapid flight,
707. Thou heard'st a wretched female plain
708. In agony of travail-pain,
709. And thou didst bid thy little band
710. Upon the instant turn and stand,
711. And dare the worst the foe might do,
712. Rather than, like a knight untrue,
713. Leave to pursuers merciless
714. A woman in her last distress.-
715. And wilt thou now deny thine aid
716. To an oppress'd and injured maid,
717. Even plead for Ronald's perfidy,
718. And press his fickle faith on me?-
719. So witness Heaven, as true I vow,
720. Had I those earthly feelings now,
721. Which could my former bosom move
722. Ere taught to set its hopes above,
723. I'd spurn each proffer he could bring,
724. Till at my feet he laid the ring,
725. The ring and spousal contract both,
726. And fair aquittal of his oath,
727. By her who brooks his perjured scorn,
728. The ill-requited Maid of Lorn!'

729. XXVIII.
730. With sudden impulse forward sprung
731. The page, and on her neck he hung;
732. Then, recollected instantly,
733. His head he stoop'd, and bent his knee,
734. Kiss'd twice the hand of Isabel,
735. Arose, and sudden left the cell.-
736. The Princess, loosen'd from his hold,
737. Blush'd angry at his bearing bold;
738. But good King Robert cried,
739. 'Chafe not - by signs he speaks his mind,
740. He heard the plan my care design'd,
741. Nor could his transports hide.-
742. But, sister, now bethink thee well;
743. No easy choice the convent cell;
744. Trust, I shall play no tyrant part,
745. Either to force thy hand or heart,
746. Or suffer that Lord Ronald scorn,
747. Or wrong for thee, the Maid of Lorn.
748. But think, - not long the time has been,
749. That thou wert wont to sigh unseen,
750. And would'st the ditties best approve,
751. That told some lay of hapless love.
752. Now are thy wishes in thy power,
753. And thou art bent on cloister bower!
754. O! if our Edward knew the change,
755. How would his busy satire range,
756. With many a sarcasm varied still
757. On woman's wish, and woman's will!' -

758. XXIX.
759. 'Brother, I well believe,' she said,
760. 'Even so would Edward's part be play'd,
761. Kindly in heart, in word severe,
762. A foe to thought, and grief, and fear,
763. He holds his humour uncontroll'd;
764. But thou art of another mould.
765. Say then to Ronald, as I say,
766. Unless before my feet he lay
767. The ring which bound the faith he swore,
768. By Edith freely yielded o'er,
769. He moves his suit to me no more.
770. Nor do I promise, even if now
771. He stood absolved of spousal vow,
772. That I would change my purpose made,
773. To shelter me in holy shade.-
774. Brother, for little space, farewell!
775. To other duties warns the bell.'-

776. XXX.
777. 'Lost to the world,' King Robert said,
778. When he had left the royal maid,
779. 'Lost to the world by lot severe,
780. O what a gem lies buried here,
781. Nipp'd by misfortune's cruel frost,
782. The buds of fair affection lost!-
783. But what have I with love to do?
784. Far sterner cares my lot pursue.
785. -Pent in this isle we may not lie,
786. Nor would it long our wants supply.
787. Right opposite, the mainland towers
788. Of my own Turnberry court our powers -
789. -Might not my father's beadsman hoar,
790. Cuthbert, who dwells upon the shore,
791. Kindle a signal-flame, to show
792. The time propitious for the blow?
793. It shall be so - some friend shall bear
794. Our mandate with despatch and care;
795. -Edward shall find the messenger.
796. That fortress ours, the island fleet
797. May on the coast of Carrick meet.-
798. O Scotland! shall it e'er be mine
799. To wreak thy wrongs in battle-line,
800. To raise my victor-head, and see
801. Thy hills, thy dales, thy people free,-
802. That glance of bliss is all I crave,
803. Betwixt my labours and my grave!'
804. Then down the hill he slowly went,
805. Oft pausing on the steep descent,
806. And reach'd the spot where his bold train
807. Held rustic camp upon the plain.
