1. All joy was bereft me the day that you left me,
2. And climb'd the tall vessel to sail yon wide sea;
3. O weary betide it! I wander'd beside it,
4. And bann'd it for parting my Willie and me.

5. Far o'er the wave hast thou follow'd thy fortune,
6. Oft fought the squadrons of France and of Spain;
7. Ae kiss of welcome's worth twenty at parting,
8. Now I hae gotten my Willie again.

9. When the sky it was mirk, and the winds they were wailing,
10. I sat on the beach wi' the tear in my ee,
11. And thought o' the bark where my Willie was sailing,
12. And wish'd that the tempest could a' blaw on me.

13. Now that thy gallant ship rides at her mooring,
14. Now that my wanderer's in safety at hame,
15. Music to me were the wildest winds' roaring,
16. That e'er o'er Inch-Keith drove the dark ocean faem.

17. When the lights they did blaze, and the guns they did rattle,
18. And blithe was each heart for the great victory,
19. In secret I wept for the dangers of battle,
20. And thy glory itself was scarce comfort to me.

21. But now shalt thou tell, while I eagerly listen,
22. Of each bold adventure, and every brave scar;
23. And trust me, I'll smile, though my een they may glisten;
24. For sweet after danger's the tale of the war.

25. And oh, how we doubt when there's distance 'tween lovers,
26. When there's naething to speak to the heart thro' the ee;
27. How often the kindest and warmest prove rovers,
28. And the love of the faithfullest ebbs like the sea.

29. Till, at times - Could I help it? - I pined and I ponder'd
30. If love could change notes like the bird on the tree-
31. Now I'll ne'er ask if thine eyes may hae wander'd,
32. Enough, thy leal heart has been constant to me.

33. Welcome, from sweeping o'er sea and through channel,
34. Hardships and danger despising for fame,
35. Furnishing story for glory's bright annal,
36. Welcome, my wanderer, to Jeanie and hame!

37. Enough now thy story in annals of glory
38. Has humbled the pride of France, Holland, and Spain;
39. No more shalt thou grieve me, no more shalt thou leave me,
40. I never will part with my Willie again.
