1. Like April morning clouds, that pass,
2. With varying shadow, o'er the grass,
3. And imitate, on field and furrow,
4. Life's chequered scene of joy and sorrow;
5. Like streamlet of the mountain North,
6. Now in a torrent racing forth,
7. Now winding slow its silver train,
8. And almost slumbering on the plain;
9. Like breezes of the Autumn day,
10. Whose voice inconstant dies away,
11. And ever swells again as fast,
12. When the ear deems its murmur past;
13. Thus various, my romantic theme
14. Flits, winds, or sinks, a morning dream.
15. Yet pleased, our eye pursues the trace
16. Of light and shade's inconstant race;
17. Pleased, views the rivulet afar,
18. Weaving its maze irregular;
19. And pleased, we listen as the breeze
20. Heaves its wild sigh through Autumn trees;
21. Then, wild as cloud, or stream, or gale,
22. Flow on, flow unconfined, my tale!

23. Need I to thee, dear Erskine, tell
24. I love the license all too well,
25. In sounds now lowly, and now strong,
26. To raise the desultory song?
27. Oft, when mid such capricious chime,
28. Some transient fit of lofty rhyme
29. To thy kind judgment seemed excuse
30. For many an error of the muse,
31. Oft hast thou said, 'If, still misspent,
32. Thine hours to poetry are lent,
33. Go, and to tame thy wandering course,
34. Quaff from the fountain at the source;
35. Approach those masters, o'er whose tomb
36. Immortal laurels ever bloom:
37. Instructive of the feebler bard,
38. Still from the grave their voice is heard;
39. From them, and from the paths they showed,
40. Choose honoured guide and practised road:
41. Nor ramble on through brake and maze,
42. With harpers rude, of barbarous days.

43. 'Or deem'st thou not our later time
44. Yields topic meet for classic rhyme?
45. Hast thou no elegiac verse
46. For Brunswick's venerable hearse?
47. What! not a line, a tear, a sigh,
48. When valour bleeds for liberty?
49. Oh, hero of that glorious time,
50. When, with unrivalled light sublime -
51. Though martial Austria, and though all
52. The might of Russia, and the Gaul,
53. Though banded Europe stood her foes -
54. The star of Brandenburg arose!
55. Thou couldst not live to see her beam
56. For ever quenched in Jena's stream.
57. Lamented chief!-it was not given
58. To thee to change the doom of Heaven,
59. And crush that dragon in its birth,
60. Predestined scourge of guilty earth.
61. Lamented chief!-not thine the power
62. To save in that presumptuous hour,
63. When Prussia hurried to the field,
64. And snatched the spear, but left the shield!
65. Valour and skill 'twas thine to try,
66. And, tried in vain, 'twas thine to die.
67. Ill had it seemed thy silver hair
68. The last, the bitterest pang to share,
69. For princedom reft, and scutcheons riven,
70. And birthrights to usurpers given;
71. Thy land's, thy children's wrongs to feel,
72. And witness woes thou couldst not heal!
73. On thee relenting Heaven bestows
74. For honoured life an honoured close;
75. And when revolves, in time's sure change,
76. The hour of Germany's revenge,
77. When, breathing fury for her sake,
78. Some new Arminius shall awake,
79. Her champion, ere he strike, shall come
80. To whet his sword on Brunswick's tomb.

81. 'Or of the red-cross hero teach,
82. Dauntless in dungeon as on breach:
83. Alike to him the sea, the shore,
84. The brand, the bridle, or the oar.
85. Alike to him the war that calls
86. Its votaries to the shattered walls,
87. Which the grim Turk, besmeared with blood,
88. Against the invincible made good;
89. Or that, whose thundering voice could wake
90. The silence of the polar lake,
91. When stubborn Russ, and mettled Swede,
92. On the warped wave their death-game played;
93. Or that, where vengeance and affright
94. Howled round the father of the fight,
95. Who snatched, on Alexandria's sand,
96. The conqueror's wreath with dying hand.

97. 'Or, if to touch such chord be thine,
98. Restore the ancient tragic line,
99. And emulate the notes that rung
100. From the wild harp, which silent hung
101. By silver Avon's holy shore,
102. Till twice a hundred years rolled o'er;
103. When she, the bold enchantress, came,
104. With fearless hand and heart on flame!
105. From the pale willow snatched the treasure,
106. And swept it with a kindred measure,
107. Till Avon's swans, while rung the grove
108. With Montfort's hate and Basil's love,
109. Awakening at the inspired strain,
110. Deemed their own Shakespeare lived again.'

111. Thy friendship thus thy judgment wronging,
112. With praises not to me belonging,
113. In task more meet for mightiest powers,
114. Wouldst thou engage my thriftless hours.
115. But say, my Erskine, hast thou weighed
116. That secret power by all obeyed,
117. Which warps not less the passive mind,
118. Its source concealed, or undefined:
119. Whether an impulse, that has birth
120. Soon as the infant wakes on earth,
121. One with our feelings and our powers,
122. And rather part of us than ours;
123. Or whether fitlier termed the sway
124. Of habit formed in early day?
125. Howe'er derived, its force confessed
126. Rules with despotic sway the breast,
127. And drags us on by viewless chain,
128. While taste and reason plead in vain.
129. Look east, and ask the Belgian why,
130. Beneath Batavia's sultry sky,
131. He seeks not eager to inhale
132. The freshness of the mountain gale,
133. Content to rear his whitened wall
134. Beside the dank and dull canal?
135. He'll say, from youth he loved to see
136. The white sail gliding by the tree.
137. Or see yon weather-beaten hind,
138. Whose sluggish herds before him wind,
139. Whose tattered plaid and rugged cheek
140. His northern clime and kindred speak;
141. Through England's laughing meads he goes,
142. And England's wealth around him flows;
143. Ask, if it would content him well,
144. At ease in those gay plains to dwell,
145. Where hedgerows spread a verdant screen,
146. And spires and forests intervene,
147. And the neat cottage peeps between?
148. No! not for these would he exchange
149. His dark Lochaber's boundless range:
150. Nor for fair Devon's meads forsake
151. Ben Nevis grey, and Garry's lake.

152. Thus while I ape the measure wild
153. Of tales that charmed me yet a child,
154. Rude though they be, still with the chime
155. Return the thoughts of early time;
156. And feelings, roused in life's first day,
157. Glow in the line and prompt the lay.
158. Then rise those crags, that mountain tower,
159. Which charmed my fancy's wakening hour.
160. Though no broad river swept along,
161. To claim, perchance, heroic song;
162. Though sighed no groves in summer gale,
163. To prompt of love a softer tale;
164. Though scarce a puny streamlet's speed
165. Claimed homage from a shepherd's reed;
166. Yet was poetic impulse given,
167. By the green hill and clear blue heaven.
168. It was a barren scene, and wild,
169. Where naked cliffs were rudely piled;
170. But ever and anon between
171. Lay velvet tufts of loveliest green;
172. And well the lonely infant knew
173. Recesses where the wallflower grew,
174. And honeysuckle loved to crawl
175. Up the low crag and ruined wall.
176. I deemed such nooks the sweetest shade
177. The sun in all its round surveyed;
178. And still I thought that shattered tower
179. The mightiest work of human power;
180. And marvelled as the aged hind
181. With some strange tale bewitched my mind,
182. Of forayers, who, with headlong force,
183. Down from that strength had spurred their horse,
184. Their southern rapine to renew,
185. Far in the distant Cheviots blue,
186. And, home returning, filled the hall
187. With revel, wassail-rout, and brawl.
188. Methought that still, with trump and clang,
189. The gateway's broken arches rang;
190. Methought grim features, seamed with scars,
191. Glared through the window's rusty bars,
192. And ever, by the winter hearth,
193. Old tales I heard of woe or mirth,
194. Of lovers' slights, of ladies' charms,
195. Of witches' spells, of warriors' arms;
196. Of patriot battles, won of old
197. By Wallace wight and Bruce the bold;
198. Of later fields of feud and fight,
199. When, pouring from their Highland height,
200. The Scottish clans, in headlong sway,
201. Had swept the scarlet ranks away.
202. While stretched at length upon the floor,
203. Again I fought each combat o'er,
204. Pebbles and shells, in order laid,
205. The mimic ranks of war displayed;
206. And onward still the Scottish Lion bore,
207. And still the scattered Southron fled before.

208. Still, with vain fondness, could I trace,
209. Anew, each kind familiar face,
210. That brightened at our evening fire!
211. From the thatched mansion's grey-haired sire,
212. Wise without learning, plain and good,
213. And sprung of Scotland's gentler blood;
214. Whose eye, in age, quick, clear, and keen,
215. Showed what in youth its glance had been;
216. Whose doom discording neighbours sought,
217. Content with equity unbought;
218. To him the venerable priest,
219. Our frequent and familiar guest,
220. Whose life and manners well could paint
221. Alike the student and the saint;
222. Alas! whose speech too oft I broke
223. With gambol rude and timeless joke:
224. For I was wayward, bold, and wild,
225. A self-willed imp, a grandame's child;
226. But, half a plague, and half a jest,
227. Was still endured, beloved, caressed.
228. For me, thus nurtured, dost thou ask
229. The classic poet's well-conned task?
230. Nay, Erskine, nay-On the wild hill
231. Let the wild heathbell flourish still;
232. Cherish the tulip, prune the vine,
233. But freely let the woodbine twine,
234. And leave untrimmed the eglantine:
235. Nay, my friend, nay-Since oft thy praise
236. Hath given fresh vigour to my lays;
237. Since oft thy judgment could refine
238. My flattened thought, or cumbrous line;
239. Still kind, as is thy wont, attend,
240. And in the minstrel spare the friend.
241. Though wild as cloud, as stream, as gale,
242. Flow forth, flow unrestrained, my tale!
