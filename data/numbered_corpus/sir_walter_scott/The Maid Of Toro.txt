1. O, low shone the sun on the fair lake of Toro,
2. And weak were the whispers that waved the dark wood,
3. All as a fair maiden, bewilder'd in sorrow,
4. Sorely sigh'd to the breezes, and wept to the flood.
5. 'O, saints! from the mansions of bliss lowly bending;
6. Now grant my petition, in anguish ascending,
7. My Henry restore, or let Eleanor die!'

8. All distant and faint were the sounds of the battle,
9. With the breezes they rise, with the breezes they fail,
10. Till the shout, and the groan, and the conflict's dread rattle,
11. And the chase's wild clamour, came loading the gale.
12. Breathless she gazed on the woodlands so dreary;
13. Slowly approaching a warrior was seen;
14. Life's ebbing tide mark'd his footsteps so weary,
15. Cleft was his helmet, and woe was his mien.

16. 'O, save thee, fair maid, for our armies are flying!
17. O, save thee, fair maid, for thy guardian is low!
18. Deadly cold on yon heath thy brave Henry is lying,
19. Scarce could he falter the tidings of sorrow,
20. And scarce could she hear them, benumb'd with despair:
21. And when the sun sunk on the sweet lake of Toro,
22. For ever he set to the Brave and the Fair.
