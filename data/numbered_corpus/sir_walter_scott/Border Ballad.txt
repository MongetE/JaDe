1. March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale,
2. Why the deil dinna ye march forward in order!
3. March, march, Eskdale and Liddesdale,
4. All the Blue Bonnets are bound for the Border.
5. Many a banner spread,
6. Flutters above your head,
7. Many a crest that is famous in story.
8. Mount and make ready then,
9. Sons of the mountain glen,
10. Fight for the Queen and our old Scottish glory.

11. Come from the hills where your hirsels are grazing,
12. Come from the glen of the buck and the roe;
13. Come to the crag where the beacon is blazing,
14. Come with the buckler, the lance, and the bow.
15. Trumpets are sounding,
16. War-steeds are bounding,
17. Stand to your arms, then, and march in good order;
18. England shall many a day
19. Tell of the bloody fray,
20. When the Blue Bonnets came over the Border.
