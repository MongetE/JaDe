1. I.
2. Fill the bright goblet, spread the festive board!
3. Summon the gay, the noble, and the fair!
4. Through the loud hall, in joyous concert pour'd,
5. Let mirth and music sound the dirge of Care!
6. But ask thou not if Happiness be there,
7. If the loud laugh disguise convulsive throe,
8. Or if the brow the heart's true livery wear;
9. Lift not the festal mask! - enough to know,
10. No scene of mortal life but teems with mortal woe.

11. II.
12. With beaker's clang, with harpers' lay,
13. With all that olden time deem'd gay,
14. The Island Chieftain feasted high;
15. But there was in his troubled eye
16. A gloomy fire, and on his brow
17. Now sudden flush'd, and faded now,
18. Emotions such as draw their birth
19. From deeper source than festal mirth.
20. By fits he paused, and harper's strain
21. And jester's tale went round in vain,
22. Or fell but on his idle ear
23. Like distant sounds which dreamers hear.
24. Then would he rouse him, and employ
25. Each art to aid the clamorous joy,
26. And call for pledge and lay,
27. And, for brief space, of all the crowd,
28. As he was loudest of the loud,
29. Seem gayest of the gay.

30. III.
31. Yet nought amiss the bridal throng
32. Mark'd in brief mirth, or musing long;
33. The vacant brow, the unlistening ear,
34. They gave to thoughts of raptures near,
35. And his fierce starts of sudden glee
36. Seem'd bursts of bridegroom's ecstasy.
37. Nor thus alone misjudged the crowd,
38. Since lofty Lorn, suspicious, proud,
39. And jealous of his honour'd line,
40. And that keen knight, De Argentine,
41. (From England sent on errand high,
42. The western league more firm to tie),
43. Both deem'd in Ronald's mood to find
44. A lover's transport-troubled mind.
45. But one sad heart, one tearful eye,
46. Pierced deeper through the mystery,
47. And watch'd, with agony and fear,
48. Her wayward bridegroom's varied cheer.

49. IV.
50. She watch'd - yet fear'd to meet his glance,
51. And he shunn'd hers; - till when by chance
52. They met, the point of foeman's lance
53. Had given a milder pang!
54. Beneath the intolerable smart
55. He writhed; - then sternly mann'd his heart
56. To play his hard but destined part,
57. And from the table sprang,
58. 'Fill me the mighty cup!' he said,
59. 'Erst own'd by royal Somerled:
60. Fill it, till on the studded brim
61. In burning gold the bubbles swim,
62. And every gem of varied shine
63. Glow doubly bright in rosy wine!
64. To you, brave Lord, and brother mine,
65. Of Lorn, this pledge I drink -
66. The Union of Our House with thine,
67. By this fair bridal-link!'-

68. V.
69. 'Let it pass round!' quoth He of Lorn,
70. 'And in good time - that winded horn
71. Must of the Abbot tell;
72. The laggard monk is come at last.'
73. Lord Ronald heard the bugle-blast,
74. And on the floor at random cast,
75. The untasted goblet fell.
76. But when the Warder in his ear
77. Tells other news, his blither cheer
78. Returns like sun of May,
79. When through a thunder-cloud it beams!-
80. Lord of two hundred isles, he seems
81. As glad of brief delay,
82. As some poor criminal might feel,
83. When from the gibbet or the wheel
84. Respited for a day.

85. VI.
86. 'Brother of Lorn,' with hurried voice
87. He said, 'and you, fair lords, rejoice!
88. Here, to augment our glee,
89. Come wandering knights from travel far,
90. Well proved, they say, in strife of war,
91. And tempest on the sea.-
92. Ho! give them at your board such place
93. As best their presences may grace,
94. And bid them welcome free!'
95. With solemn step, and silver wand,
96. The Seneschal the presence scann'd
97. Of these strange guests; and well he knew
98. How to assign their rank its due;
99. For though the costly furs
100. That erst had deck'd their caps were torn,
101. And their gay robes were over-worn,
102. And soil'd their gilded spurs,
103. Yet such a high commanding grace
104. Was in their mien and in their face,
105. As suited best the princely dais,
106. And royal canopy;
107. And there he marshall'd them their place,
108. First of that company.

109. VII.
110. Then lords and ladies spake aside,
111. And angry looks the error chide,
112. That gave to guests unnamed, unknown,
113. A place so near their prince's throne;
114. But Owen Erraught said -
115. 'For forty tears a seneschal,
116. To marshal guests in bower and hall
117. Has been my honour'd trade.
118. Worship and birth to me are known,
119. By look, by bearing, and by tone,
120. Not by furr'd robe or broider'd zone;
121. And 'gainst an oaken bough
122. I'll gage my silver wand of state,
123. That these three strangers oft have sate
124. In higher place than now.' -

125. VIII.
126. 'I, too,' the aged Ferrand said,
127. 'Am qualified by minstrel trade
128. Of rank and place to tell;-
129. Mark'd ye the younger stranger's eye,
130. My mates, how quick, how keen, how high,
131. How fierce its flashes fell,
132. Glancing among the noble rout
133. As if to seek the noblest out,
134. Because the owner might not brook
135. On any save his peers to look?
136. And yet it moves me more,
137. That steady, calm, majestic brow,
138. With which the elder chief even now
139. Scann'd the gay presence o'er,
140. Life being of superior kind,
141. In whose high-toned impartial mind
142. Degrees of mortal rank and state
143. Seem objects of indifferent weight.
144. The lady too - though closely tied
145. Her motions' veil both face and eye,
146. Her motions' grace it could not hide,
147. Nor could her form's fair symmetry.'

148. IX.
149. Suspicious doubt and lordly scorn
150. Lour'd on the haughty front of Lorn,
151. From underneath his brows of pride,
152. The stranger guests her sternly eyed,
153. And whisper'd closely what the ear
154. Of Argentine alone might hear;
155. Then question'd, high and brief,
156. If, in their voyage, aught they knew
157. Of the rebellious Scottish crew,
158. Who to Rath-Erin's shelter drew,
159. With Carrick's outlaw'd Chief?
160. And if, their winter's exile o'er,
161. They harbour'd still by Ulster's shore,
162. Or launch'd their galleys on the main,
163. To vex their native land again?

164. X.
165. That younger stranger, fierce and high,
166. At once confronts the Chieftain's eye
167. With look of equal scorn; -
168. 'Of rebels have we nought to show;
169. But if of royal Bruce thou'dst know,
170. I warn thee he has sworn,
171. Ere thrice three days shall come and go,
172. His banner Scottish winds shall blow,
173. Despite each mean or mighty foe,
174. From England's every bill and bow,
175. To Allaster of Lorn.'
176. Kindled the mountain Chieftain's ire,
177. But Ronald quench'd the rising fire: -
178. 'Brother, it better suits the time
179. To chase the night with Ferrand's rhyme,
180. Than wake, 'midst mirth and wine, the jars
181. That flow from these unhappy wars.'-
182. 'Content,' said Lorn; and spoke apart
183. With Ferrand, master of his art,
184. Then whisper'd Argentine,-
185. 'The lay I named will carry smart
186. To these bold strangers' haughty heart,
187. If right his guess of mine.'
188. He ceased, and it was silence all,
189. Until the minstrel waked the hall.

190. XI.

191. The Broach of Lorn.


192. 'Whence the broach of burning gold,
193. That clasps the Chieftain's mantle-fold,
194. Wrought and chased with rare device,
195. Studded fair with gems of price,
196. On the varied tartans beaming,
197. As, through night's pale rainbow gleaming,
198. Fainter now, now seen afar,
199. Fitful shines the northern star?

200. 'Gem! ne'er wrought on Highland mountain,
201. Did the fairy of the fountain,
202. Or the mermaid of the wave,
203. Frame thee in some coral cave?
204. Did, in Iceland's darksome mine,
205. Dwarf's swart hands thy metal twine?
206. Or, mortal-moulded, comest thou here,
207. From England's love, or France's fear?

208. XII.

209. Song Continued.


210. 'No! - thy splendours nothing tell
211. Foreign art or faery spell.
212. Moulded thou for monarch's use,
213. By the overweening Bruce,
214. When the royal robe he tied
215. O'er a heart of wrath and pride;
216. Thence in triumph wert thou torn,
217. By the victor hand of Lorn!

218. 'When the gem was won and lost,
219. Widely was the war-cry toss'd!
220. Rung aloud Bendourish fell,
221. Answer'd Douchart's sounding dell,
222. Fled the deer from wild Teyndrum,
223. When the homicide, o'ercome,
224. Hardly 'scaped with scathe and scorn,
225. Left the pledge with conquering Lorn!

226. XIII.

227. Song Continued.


228. 'Vain was then the Douglas brand,
229. Vain the Campbell's vaunted hand,
230. Vain Kirkpatrick's bloody dirk,
231. Making sure of murder's work;
232. Barendown fled fast away,
233. Fled the fiery De la Haye,
234. When this broach, triumphant borne,
235. Beam'd upon the breast of Lorn.

236. 'Farthest fled its former Lord,
237. Left his men to brand and cord,
238. Bloody brand of Highland steel,
239. English gibbet, axe, and wheel.
240. Let him fly from coast to coast,
241. Dogg'd by Comyn's vengeful ghost,
242. While his spoils, in triumph worn,
243. Long shall grace victorious Lorn!'

244. XIV.
245. As glares the tiger on his foes,
246. Hemm'd in by hunters, spears, and bows,
247. And, ere he bounds upon the ring,
248. Selects the object of his spring,-
249. Now on the Bard, now on his Lord,
250. So Edward glared and grasp'd his sword-
251. But stern his brother spoke,- 'Be still.
252. What! art thou yet so wild of will,
253. After high deeds and sufferings long,
254. To chafe thee for a menial's song? -
255. Well hast thou framed, Old Man, thy strains,
256. To praise the hand that pays thy pains!
257. Yet something might thy song have told
258. Of Lorn's three vassals, true and bold,
259. Who rent their Lord from Bruce's hold,
260. As underneath his knee he lay,
261. And died to save him in the fray.
262. I've heard the Bruce's cloak and clasp
263. Was clench'd within their dying grasp,
264. What time a hundred foemen more
265. Rush'd in, and back the victor bore,
266. Long after Lorn had left the strife,
267. Full glad to 'scape with limb and life.-
268. Enough of this - And, Minstrel, hold,
269. As minstrel-hire, this chain of gold,
270. For future lays a fair excuse,
271. To speak more nobly of the Bruce.'-

272. XV.
273. 'Now, by Columba's shrine, I swear,
274. And every saint that's buried there,
275. 'Tis he himself!' Lorn sternly cries,
276. 'And for my kinsman's death he dies.'
277. As loudly Ronald calls - 'Forbear!
278. Not in my sight wile brand I wear,
279. O'ermatch'd by odds, shall warrior fall,
280. Or blood of stranger stain my hall!
281. This ancient fortress of my race
282. Shall be misfortune's resting-place,
283. Shelter and shield of the distress'd,
284. No slaughter-house for shipwreck'd guest.'-
285. 'Of odds or match! - when Comyn died,
286. Three daggers clash'd within his side!
287. Talk not to me of sheltering hall,
288. The Church of God saw Comyn fall!
289. On God's own altar stream'd his blood,
290. While o'er my prostrate kinsman stood
291. The ruthless murderer - e'en as now -
292. With armed hand and scornful brow! -
293. Up, all who love me! blow on blow!
294. And lay the outlaw'd felons low!'

295. XVI.
296. Then up sprang many a mainland Lord,
297. Obedient to their Chieftain's word.
298. Barcaldine's arm is high in air,
299. And Kinloch-Alline's blade is bare,
300. Black Murthok's dirk has left its sheath,
301. And clench'd is Dermid's hand of death.
302. Their mutter'd threats of vengeance swell
303. Into a wild and warlike yell;
304. Onward they press with weapons high,
305. The affrighted females shriek and fly,
306. And, Scotland, then thy brightest ray
307. Had darken'd ere its noon of day,
308. But every chief of birth and fame,
309. That from the Isles of Ocean came,
310. At Ronald's side that hour withstood
311. Fierce Lorn's relentless thirst for blood.

312. XVII.
313. Brave Torquil from Dunvegan high,
314. Lord of the misty hills of Skye,
315. Mac-Niel, wild Bara's ancient thane,
316. Duart, of bold Clan-Gillian's strain,
317. Fergus, of Canna's castled bay,
318. Mac-Duffith, Lord of Colonsay,
319. Soon as they saw the broadswords glance,
320. With ready weapons rose at once,
321. More prompt, that many an ancient feud,
322. Full oft suppress'd, full oft renew'd,
323. Glow'd 'twixt the chieftains of Argyle,
324. And many a lord of ocean's isle.
325. Wild was the scene - each sword was bare,
326. Back stream'd each chieftain's shaggy hair,
327. In gloomy opposition set,
328. Eyes, hands, and brandish'd weapons met;
329. Blue gleaming o'er the social board,
330. Flash'd to the torches many a sword;
331. And soon those bridal lights may shine
332. On purple blood for rosy wine.

333. XVIII.
334. While thus for blows and death prepared,
335. Each heart was up, and weapon bared,
336. Each foot advanced, - a surly pause
337. Still reverenced hospitable laws.
338. All menaced violence, but alike
339. Reluctant each the first to strike,
340. (For aye accursed in minstrel line
341. Is he who brawls 'mid song and wine),
342. And, match'd in numbers and in might,
343. Doubtful and desperate seem'd the fight.
344. Thus threat and murmur died away,
345. Till on the crowded hall there lay
346. Such silence, as the deadly still,
347. Ere bursts the thunder on the hill.
348. With blade advanced, each Chieftain bold
349. Show'd like the Sworder's form of old,
350. As wanting still the torch of life,
351. To wake the marble into strife.

352. XIX.
353. That awful pause the stranger maid,
354. And Edith, seized to pray for aid.
355. As to De Argentine she clung,
356. Away her veil the stranger flung,
357. And, lovely 'mid her wild despair,
358. Fast stream'd her eyes, wide flow'd her hair:-
359. 'O thou, of knighthood once the flower,
360. Sure refuge in distressful hour,
361. Thou, who in Judah well hast fought
362. For our dear faith, and oft hast sought
363. Renown in knightly exercise,
364. When this poor hand has dealt the prize,
365. Say, can thy soul of honour brook
366. On the unequal strife to look,
367. When, butcher'd thus in peaceful hall,
368. Those once thy friends, my brethren, fall!'
369. To Argentine she turn'd her word,
370. But her eye sought the Island Lord.
371. A flush like evening's setting flame
372. Glow'd on his cheek; his hardy frame,
373. As with a brief convulsion, shook:
374. With hurried voice and eager look, -
375. 'Fear not', he said, 'my Isabel!
376. What said I - Edith! - all is well -
377. Nay, fear not - I will well provide
378. The safety of my lovely bride -
379. My bride?' - but there the accents clung
380. In tremor to his faltering tongue.

381. XX.
382. Now rose De Argentine, to claim
383. The prisoners in his sovereign's name,
384. To England's crown, who, vassals sworn,
385. 'Gainst their liege lord had weapon borne -
386. (Such speech, I ween, was but to hide
387. His care their safety to provide;
388. For knight more true in thought and deed
389. Than Argentine ne'er spurr'd a steed) -
390. And Ronald, who his meaning guess'd,
391. Seem'd half to sanction the request.
392. This purpose fiery Torquil broke:-
393. 'Somewhat we've heard of England's yoke,'
394. He said, 'and, in our islands, Fame
395. Hath whisper'd of a lawful claim,
396. That calls the Bruce fair Scotland's Lord,
397. Though dispossess'd by foreign sword.
398. This craves reflection - but though right
399. And just the charge of England's Knight,
400. Let England's crown her rebels seize
401. Where she has power; - in towers like these,
402. 'Midst Scottish Chieftains summon'd here
403. To bridal mirth and bridal cheer,
404. Be sure, with no consent of mine,
405. Shall either Lorn or Argentine
406. With chains or violence, in our sight,
407. Oppress a brave and banish'd Knight.'

408. XXI.
409. Then waked the wild debate again,
410. With brawling threat and clamour vain.
411. Vassals and menials, thronging in,
412. Lent their brute rage to swell the din;
413. When, far and wide, a bugle-clang
414. From the dark ocean upward rang.
415. 'The Abbot comes!' they cry at once,
416. 'The holy man, whose favour'd glance
417. Hath sainted visions known;
418. Angels have met him on the way,
419. Beside the blessed martyr's bay,
420. And by Columba's stone.
421. His monks have heard their hymnings high
422. Sound from the summit of Dun-Y,
423. To cheer his penance lone,
424. When at each cross, on girth and wold,
425. (Their number thrice a hundred-fold),
426. His prayer he made, his beads he told,
427. With Aves many a one -
428. He comes man from sainted isle;
429. We will his holy doom abide,
430. The Abbot shall our strife decide.'

431. XXII.
432. Scarcely this fair accord was o'er,
433. When through the wide revolving door
434. The black-stol'd brethren wind;
435. Twelve sandall'd monks, who relics bore,
436. With many a torch-bearer before,
437. And many a cross behind.
438. Then sunk each fierce uplifted hand,
439. And dagger bright and flashing brand
440. Dropp'd swiftly at the sight;
441. They vanish'd from the Churchman's eye,
442. As shooting stars, that glance and die,
443. Dart from the vault of night.

444. XXIII.
445. The Abbot on the threshold stood,
446. And in his hand the holy rood;
447. Back on his shoulders flow'd his hood,
448. The torch's glaring ray
449. Show'd, in its red and flashing light,
450. His wither'd cheek and amice white,
451. His blue eye glistening cold and bright
452. His tresses scant and grey.
453. 'Fair Lords,' he said, 'Our Lady's love,
454. And peace be with you from above,
455. And Benedicite!-
456. -But what means this? - no peace is here! -
457. Do dirks unsheathed suit bridal cheer?
458. Or are these naked brands
459. A seemly show for Churchman's sight,
460. When he comes summon'd to unite
461. Betrothed hearts and hands?'

462. XXIV.
463. Then, cloaking hate with fiery zeal,
464. Proud Lorn first answer'd the appeal;-
465. 'Thou comest, O holy Man,
466. True sons of blessed church to greet,
467. But little deeming here to meet
468. A wretch, beneath the ban
469. Of Pope and Church, for murder done
470. Even on the sacred altar-stone -
471. Well may'st thou wonder we should know
472. Such miscreant here, nor lay him low,
473. Or dream of greeting, peace, or truce,
474. With excommunicated Bruce!
475. Yet well I grant, to end debate,
476. Thy sainted voice decide his fate.'

477. XXV.
478. Then Ronald pled the stranger's cause,
479. And knighthood's oath and honour's laws,
480. And Isabel, on bended knee,
481. Brought pray'rs and tears to back the plea:
482. And Edith lent her generous aid,
483. And wept, and Lorn for mercy pray'd.
484. 'Hence,' he exclaim'd, 'degenerate maid!
485. Was't not enough, to Ronald's bower
486. I brought thee, like a paramour,
487. Or bond-maid at her master's gate,
488. His careless cold approach to wait? -
489. But the bold Lord of Cumberland,
490. The gallant Clifford, seeks thy hand;
491. His it shall be - Nay, no reply!
492. Hence! till those rebel eyes be dry.' -
493. With grief the Abbot heard and saw,
494. Yet nought relax'd his brow of awe.

495. XXVI.
496. Then Argentine, in England's name,
497. So highly urged his sovereign's claim,
498. He wak'd a spark, that, long suppress'd,
499. Had smoulder'd in Lord Ronald's breast;
500. And now, as from the flint of fire,
501. Flash'd forth at once his generous ire.
502. 'Enough of noble blood,' he said,
503. 'By English Edward had been shed,
504. Since matchless Wallace first had been
505. In mock'ry crown'd with wreaths of green,
506. And done to death by felon hand,
507. For guarding well his father's land.
508. Where's Nigel Bruce? and De la Haye,
509. And valiant Seton - where are they?
510. Where Somerville, the kind and free?
511. And Fraser, flower of chivalry?
512. Have they not been on gibbet bound,
513. Their quarters flung to hawk and hound,
514. And hold we here a cold debate,
515. To yield more victims to their fate?
516. What! can the English Leopard's mood
517. Never be gorged with northern blood?
518. Was not the life of Athole shed,
519. To soothe the tyrant's sicken'd bed?
520. And must his word, till dying day,
521. Be nought but quarter, hang, and slay! -
522. Thou frown'st, De Argentine, - My gage
523. Is prompt to prove the strife I wage.' -

524. XXVII.
525. 'Nor deem,' said stout Dunvegan's knight,
526. 'That thou shalt brave alone the fight!
527. By saints of isle and mainland both,
528. By Woden wild, (my grandsire's oath),
529. Let Rome and England do their worst,
530. Howe'er attainted or accurs'd,
531. If Bruce shall e'er find friends again,
532. Once more to brave a battle-plain,
533. If Douglas couch again his lance,
534. Or Randolph dare another chance,
535. Old Torquil will not be to lack
536. With twice a thousand at his back. -
537. Nay, chafe not at my bearing bold,
538. Good Abbot! for thou know'st of old,
539. Torquil's rude thought and stubborn will
540. Smack of the wild Norwegian still;
541. Nor will I barter Freedom's cause
542. For England's wealth, or Rome's applause.'

543. XXVIII.
544. The Abbot seem'd with eye severe
545. The hardy Chieftain's speech to hear:
546. Then on King Robert turn'd the Monk
547. But twice his courage came and sunk,
548. Confronted with the hero's look;
549. Twice fell his eye, his accents shook;
550. At length, resolved in tone and brow,
551. Sternly he question'd him - 'And thou,
552. Unhappy! what hast thou to plead,
553. Why I denounce not on thy deed
554. That awful doom which canons tell
555. Shuts paradise, and opens hell;
556. Anathema of power so dread,
557. It blends the living with the dead,
558. Bids each good angel soar away,
559. And every ill one claim his prey;
560. Expels thee from the church's care,
561. And deafens Heaven against thy prayer;
562. Arms every hand against thy life,
563. Bans all who aid thee in the strife,
564. Nay, each whose succour, cold and scant,
565. With meanest alms relieves thy want;
566. Haunts thee while living, - and, when dead,
567. Dwells on thy yet devoted head,
568. Rends Honour's scutcheon from thy hearse,
569. Stills o'er thy bier the holy verse,
570. And spurns thy corpse from hallow'd ground,
571. Flung like vile carrion to the hound;
572. Such is the dire and desperate doom
573. For sacrilege, decreed by Rome;
574. And such the well-deserved meed
575. Of thine unhallow'd, ruthless deed.' -

576. XXIX.
577. 'Abbot!' the Bruce replied, 'thy charge
578. It boots not to dispute at large.
579. This much, howe'er, I bid thee know,
580. No selfish vengeance dealt the blow,
581. For Comyn died his country's foe.
582. Nor blame I friends whose ill-timed speed
583. Fulfill'd my soon-repented deed,
584. Nor censer those from whose stern tongue
585. The dire anathema has rung.
586. I only blame mine own wild ire,
587. By Scotland's wrongs incensed to fire.
588. Heaven knows my purpose to atone,
589. Far as I may, the evil done,
590. And hears a penitent's appeal
591. From papal curse and prelate's zeal.
592. My first and dearest task achieved,
593. Fair Scotland from her thrall relieved,
594. Shall many a priest in cope and stole
595. Say requiem for Red Comyn's soul,
596. While I the blessed cross advance,
597. And expiate this unhappy chance
598. In Palestine, with sword and lance.
599. But, while content the Church should know
600. My conscience owns the debt I owe,
601. Unto De Argentine and Lorn
602. The name of traitor I return,
603. Bid them defiance stern and high,
604. And give them in their throats the lie!
605. These brief words spoke, I speak no more.
606. Do what thou wilt; my shrift is o'er.'

607. XXX.
608. Like man by prodigy amazed,
609. Upon the King the Abbot gazed;
610. Then o'er his pallid features glance,
611. Convulsions of ecstatic trance.
612. His breathing came more thick and fast,
613. And from his pale blue eyes were cast
614. Strange rays of wild and wandering light;
615. Uprise his locks of silver white,
616. Flush'd in his brow, through every vein
617. In azure tide the currents strain,
618. And undistinguished accents broke
619. The awful silence ere he spoke.

620. XXXI.
621. 'De Bruce! I rose with purpose dread
622. To speak my curse upon thy head,
623. And give thee as an outcast o'er
624. To him who burns to shed thy gore;-
625. But, like the Midianite of old,
626. Who stood on Zophim, Heaven-controll'd,
627. I feel within mine aged breast
628. A power that will not be repress'd.
629. It prompts my voice, it swells my veins,
630. It burns, it maddens, it constrains!-
631. De Bruce, thy sacrilegious blow
632. Hath at God's altar slain thy foe:
633. O'ermaster'd yet by high behest,
634. I bless thee, and thou shalt be bless'd!'
635. He spoke, and o'er the astonish'd throng
636. Was silence, awful, deep, and long.

637. XXXII.
638. Again that light has fired his eye,
639. Again his form swells bold and high,
640. The broken voice of age is gone,
641. 'Tis vigorous manhood's lofty tone:-
642. 'Thrice vanquish'd on the battle-plain,
643. Thy followers slaughter'd, fled, or ta'en,
644. A hunted wanderer on the wild,
645. On foreign shores a man exiled,
646. Disown'd, deserted, and distress'd,
647. I bless thee, and thou shalt be bless'd!
648. Bless'd in the hall and in the field,
649. Under the mantle as the shield.
650. Avenger of thy country's shame,
651. Restorer of her injured fame,
652. Bless'd in thy sceptre and thy sword,
653. De Bruce, fair Scotland's rightful Lord,
654. Bless'd in thy deeds and in thy fame,
655. What lengthen'd honours wait thy name!
656. In distant ages, sire to son
657. Shall tell thy tale of freedom won,
658. And teach his infants, in the use
659. Of earliest speech, to falter Bruce.
660. Go, then, triumphant! sweep along
661. Thy course, the theme of many a song!
662. The Power, whose dictates swell my breast
663. Hath bless'd thee, and thou shalt be bless'd!-
664. Enough - my short-lived strength decays,
665. And sinks the momentary blaze. -
666. Heaven hath our destined purpose broke,
667. Not here must nuptial vow he spoke;
668. Brethren, our errand here is o'er,
669. Our task discharged. - Unmoor, unmoor!' -
670. His priests received the exhausted Monk,
671. As breathless in their arms he sunk.
672. Punctual his orders to obey,
673. The train refused all longer stay,
674. Embark'd, raised sail, and bore away.
