1. The glowing censers, and their rich perfume;
2. The splendid vestments, and the sounding choir;
3. The gentle sigh of soul-subduing piety;
4. The alms which open-hearted charity
5. Bestows, with kindly glance; and those
6. Which e'en stern avarice.
7. Though with unwilling hand,
8. Seems forced to tender; an offering sweet
9. To the bright throne of mercy; mark
10. This day a festival.

11. And well our Christian sires of old
12. Loved when the year its course had roll'd,
13. And brought blithe Christmas back again,
14. With all its hospitable train.
15. Domestic and religious rite
16. Gave honour to the holy night.
17. On Christmas eve the bells were rung,
18. On Christmas-eve the mass was sung;
19. That only night in all the year
20. Saw the stoled priest the chalice rear.
21. The damsel donn'd her Kirtle sheen;
22. The hall was dress'd with holly green;
23. Then open'd wide the baron's hall,
24. To vassal -- tenant -- serf and all:
25. Power laid his rod of rule aside,
26. And ceremony doff'd his pride.
27. All hail'd with uncontroll'd delight,
28. And general voice, the happy night,
29. That to the cottage, as the crown,
30. Brought tidings of salvation down.
