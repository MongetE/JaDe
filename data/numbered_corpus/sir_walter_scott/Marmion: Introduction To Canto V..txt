1. When dark December glooms the day,
2. And takes our autumn joys away;
3. When short and scant the sunbeam throws,
4. Upon the weary waste of snows,
5. A cold and profitless regard,
6. Like patron on a needy bard,
7. When silvan occupation's done,
8. And o'er the chimney rests the gun,
9. And hang, in idle trophy, near,
10. The game-pouch, fishing-rod, and spear;
11. When wiry terrier, rough and grim,
12. And greyhound, with his length of limb,
13. And pointer, now employed no more,
14. Cumber our parlour's narrow floor;
15. When in his stall the impatient steed
16. Is long condemned to rest and feed;
17. When from our snow-encircled home,
18. Scarce cares the hardiest step to roam,
19. Since path is none, save that to bring
20. The needful water from the spring;
21. When wrinkled news-page, thrice conned o'er,
22. Beguiles the dreary hour no more,
23. And darkling politican, crossed
24. Inveighs against the lingering post,
25. And answering housewife sore complains
26. Of carriers' snow-impeded wains;
27. When such the country cheer, I come,
28. Well pleased, to seek our city home;
29. For converse, and for books, to change
30. The Forest's melancholy range,
31. And welcome, with renewed delight,
32. The busy day and social night.
33. Not here need my desponding rhyme
34. Lament the ravages of time,
35. As erst by Newark's riven towers,
36. And Ettrick stripped of forest bowers.
37. True-Caledonia's Queen is changed,
38. Since on her dusky summit ranged,
39. Within its steepy limits pent,
40. By bulwark, line, and battlement,
41. And flanking towers, and laky flood,
42. Guarded and garrisoned she stood,
43. Denying entrance or resort,
44. Save at each tall embattled port;
45. Above whose arch, suspended, hung
46. Portcullis spiked with iron prong.
47. That long is gone,-but not so long,
48. Since, early closed, and opening late,
49. Jealous revolved the studded gate,
50. Whose task, from eve to morning tide,
51. A wicket churlishly supplied.
52. Stern then, and steel-girt was thy brow,
53. Dunedin! Oh, how altered now,
54. When safe amid thy mountain court
55. Thou sitt'st, like empress at her sport,
56. And liberal, unconfined, and free,
57. Flinging thy white arms to the sea,
58. For thy dark cloud, with umbered lower,
59. That hung o'er cliff, and lake, and tower,
60. Thou gleam'st against the western ray
61. Ten thousand lines of brighter day.
62. Not she, the championess of old,
63. In Spenser's magic tale enrolled,
64. She for the charmed spear renowned,
65. Which forced each knight to kiss the ground -
66. Not she more changed, when, placed at rest,
67. What time she was Malbecco's guest,
68. She gave to flow her maiden vest;
69. When from the corslet's grasp relieved,
70. Free to the sight her bosom heaved;
71. Sweet was her blue eye's modest smile,
72. Erst hidden by the aventayle;
73. And down her shoulders graceful rolled
74. Her locks profuse, of paly gold.
75. They who whilom, in midnight fight,
76. Had marvelled at her matchless might,
77. No less her maiden charms approved,
78. But looking liked, and liking loved.
79. The sight could jealous pangs beguile,
80. And charm Malbecco's cares a while;
81. And he, the wandering squire of dames,
82. Forgot his Columbella's claims,
83. And passion, erst unknown, could gain
84. The breast of blunt Sir Satyrane;
85. Nor durst light Paridel advance,
86. Bold as he was, a looser glance.
87. She charmed at once, and tamed the heart,
88. Incomparable Britomarte!
89. So thou, fair city! disarrayed
90. Of battled wall, and rampart's aid,
91. As stately seem'st, but lovelier far
92. Than in that panoply of war.
93. Nor deem that from thy fenceless throne
94. Strength and security are flown;
95. Still as of yore Queen of the North!
96. Still canst thou send thy children forth.
97. Ne'er readier at alarm-bell's call
98. Thy burghers rose to man thy wall,
99. Than now, in danger, shall be thine,
100. Thy dauntless voluntary line;
101. For fosse and turret proud to stand,
102. Their breasts the bulwarks of the land.
103. Thy thousands, trained to martial toil,
104. Full red would stain their native soil,
105. Ere from thy mural crown there fell
106. The slightest knosp or pinnacle.
107. And if it come-as come it may,
108. Dunedin! that eventful day -
109. Renowned for hospitable deed,
110. That virtue much with Heaven may plead
111. In patriarchal times whose care
112. Descending angels deigned to share;
113. That claim may wrestle blessings down
114. On those who fight for the good town,
115. Destined in every age to be
116. Refuge of injured royalty;
117. Since first, when conquering York arose,
118. To Henry meek she gave repose,
119. Till late, with wonder, grief, and awe,
120. Great Bourbon's relics, sad she saw.
121. Truce to these thoughts!-for, as they rise,
122. How gladly I avert mine eyes,
123. Bodings, or true or false, to change,
124. For Fiction's fair romantic range,
125. Or for tradition's dubious light,
126. That hovers 'twixt the day and night:
127. Dazzling alternately and dim,
128. Her wavering lamp I'd rather trim,
129. Knights, squires, and lovely dames, to see
130. Creation of my fantasy,
131. Than gaze abroad on reeky fen,
132. And make of mists invading men.
133. Who love not more the night of June
134. Than dull December's gloomy noon?
135. The moonlight than the fog of frost?
136. And can we say which cheats the most?
137. But who shall teach my harp to gain
138. A sound of the romantic strain,
139. Whose Anglo-Norman tones whilere
140. Could win the royal Henry's ear,
141. Famed Beauclerc called, for that he loved
142. The minstrel, and his lay approved?
143. Who shall these lingering notes redeem,
144. Decaying on Oblivion's stream;
145. Such notes as from the Breton tongue
146. Marie translated, Blondel sung?
147. O! born Time's ravage to repair,
148. And make the dying muse thy care;
149. Who, when his scythe her hoary foe
150. Was poising for the final blow,
151. The weapon from his hand could wring,
152. And break his glass, and shear his wing,
153. And bid, reviving in his strain,
154. The gentle poet live again;
155. Thou, who canst give to lightest lay
156. An unpedantic moral gay,
157. Nor less the dullest theme bid flit
158. On wings of unexpected wit;
159. In letters as in life approved,
160. Example honoured and beloved -
161. Dear Ellis! to the bard impart
162. A lesson of thy magic art,
163. To win at once the head and heart -
164. At once to charm, instruct, and mend,
165. My guide, my pattern, and my friend!
166. Such minstrel lesson to bestow
167. Be long thy pleasing task-but, oh!
168. No more by thy example teach -
169. What few can practise, all can preach -
170. With even patience to endure
171. Lingering disease, and painful cure,
172. And boast affliction's pangs subdued
173. By mild and manly fortitude.
174. Enough, the lesson has been given:
175. Forbid the repetition, Heaven!
176. Come, listen, then! for thou hast known,
177. And loved the minstrel's varying tone,
178. Who, like his Border sires of old,
179. Waked a wild measure rude and bold,
180. Till Windsor's oaks, and Ascot plain,
181. With wonder heard the Northern strain.
182. Come, listen! bold in thy applause,
183. The bard shall scorn pedantic laws;
184. And, as the ancient art could stain
185. Achievements on the storied pane,
186. Irregularly traced and planned,
187. But yet so glowing and so grand -
188. So shall he strive in changeful hue,
189. Field, feast, and combat to renew,
190. And loves, and arms, and harpers' glee,
191. And all the pomp of chivalry.
