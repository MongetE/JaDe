1. Young men will love thee more fair and more fast;
2. Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?
3. Old men's love the longest will last,
4. And the throstle-cock's head is under his wing.

5. The young man's wrath is like light straw on fire;
6. Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?
7. But like red-hot steel is the old man's ire,
8. And the throstle-cock's head is under his wing.

9. The young man will brawl at the evening board;
10. Heard ye so merry the little bird sing?
11. But the old man will draw at the dawning the sword,
12. And the throstle-cock's head is under his wing.
