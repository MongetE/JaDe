1. I.

2. The breeze, which swept away the smoke,
3. Round Norham Castle rolled,
4. When all the loud artillery spoke,
5. With lightning-flash, and thunder-stroke,
6. As Marmion left the hold.
7. It curled not Tweed alone, that breeze,
8. For, far upon Northumbrian seas,
9. It freshly blew, and strong,
10. Where, from high Whitby's cloistered pile,
11. Bound to St. Cuthbert's holy isle,
12. It bore a barque along.
13. Upon the gale she stooped her side,
14. And bounded o'er the swelling tide,
15. As she were dancing home;
16. The merry seamen laughed to see
17. Their gallant ship so lustily
18. Furrow the green sea-foam.
19. Much joyed they in their honoured freight;
20. For, on the deck, in chair of state,
21. The Abbess of Saint Hilda placed,
22. With five fair nuns, the galley graced.

23. II.

24. 'Twas sweet to see these holy maids,
25. Like birds escaped to greenwood shades,
26. Their first flight from the cage,
27. How timid, and how curious too,
28. For all to them was strange and new,
29. And all the common sights they view,
30. Their wonderment engage.
31. One eyed the shrouds and swelling sail,
32. With many a benedicite;
33. One at the rippling surge grew pale,
34. And would for terror pray;
35. Then shrieked, because the sea-dog, nigh,
36. His round black head, and sparkling eye,
37. Reared o'er the foaming spray;
38. And one would still adjust her veil,
39. Disordered by the summer gale,
40. Perchance lest some more worldly eye
41. Her dedicated charms might spy;
42. Perchance, because such action graced
43. Her fair-turned arm and slender waist.
44. Light was each simple bosom there,
45. Save two, who ill might pleasure share -
46. The Abbess and the novice Clare.

47. III.

48. The Abbess was of noble blood,
49. But early took the veil and hood,
50. Ere upon life she cast a look,
51. Or knew the world that she forsook.
52. Fair too she was, and kind had been
53. As she was fair, but ne'er had seen
54. For her a timid lover sigh,
55. Nor knew the influence of her eye.
56. Love, to her ear, was but a name,
57. Combined with vanity and shame;
58. Her hopes, her fears, her joys, were all
59. Bounded within the cloister wall:
60. The deadliest sin her mind could reach
61. Was of monastic rule the breach;
62. And her ambition's highest aim
63. To emulate Saint Hilda's fame.
64. For this she gave her ample dower,
65. To raise the convent's eastern tower;
66. For this, with carving rare and quaint,
67. She decked the chapel of the saint,
68. And gave the relic-shrine of cost,
69. With ivory and gems embossed.
70. The poor her convent's bounty blest,
71. The pilgrim in its halls found rest.

72. IV.

73. Black was her garb, her rigid rule
74. Reformed on Benedictine school;
75. Her cheek was pale, her form was spare;
76. Vigils, and penitence austere,
77. Had early quenched the light of youth,
78. But gentle was the dame, in sooth:
79. Though, vain of her religious sway,
80. She loved to see her maids obey;
81. Yet nothing stern was she in cell,
82. And the nuns loved their Abbess well.
83. Sad was this voyage to the dame;
84. Summoned to Lindisfarne, she came,
85. There, with Saint Cuthbert's Abbot old,
86. And Tynemouth's Prioress, to hold
87. A chapter of Saint Benedict,
88. For inquisition stern and strict,
89. On two apostates from the faith,
90. And, if need were, to doom to death.

91. V.

92. Nought say I here of Sister Clare,
93. Save this, that she was young and fair;
94. As yet a novice unprofessed,
95. Lovely and gentle, but distressed.
96. She was betrothed to one now dead,
97. Or worse, who had dishonoured fled.
98. Her kinsmen bade her give her hand
99. To one who loved her for her land;
100. Herself, almost heart-broken now,
101. Was bent to take the vestal vow,
102. And shroud, within Saint Hilda's gloom,
103. Her blasted hopes and withered bloom.

104. VI.

105. She sate upon the galley's prow,
106. And seemed to mark the waves below;
107. Nay, seemed, so fixed her look and eye,
108. To count them as they glided by.
109. She saw them not-'twas seeming all -
110. Far other scene her thoughts recall -
111. A sun-scorched desert, waste and bare,
112. Nor waves nor breezes murmured there;
113. There saw she, where some careless hand
114. O'er a dead corpse had heaped the sand,
115. To hide it till the jackals come,
116. To tear it from the scanty tomb.
117. See what a woful look was given,
118. As she raised up her eyes to heaven!

119. VII.

120. Lovely, and gentle, and distressed -
121. These charms might tame the fiercest breast;
122. Harpers have sung, and poets told,
123. That he, in fury uncontrolled,
124. The shaggy monarch of the wood,
125. Before a virgin, fair and good,
126. Hath pacified his savage mood.
127. But passions in the human frame
128. Oft put the lion's rage to shame:
129. And jealousy, by dark intrigue,
130. With sordid avarice in league,
131. Had practised with their bowl and knife
132. Against the mourner's harmless life.
133. This crime was charged 'gainst those who lay
134. Prisoned in Cuthbert's islet grey.

135. VIII.

136. And now the vessel skirts the strand
137. Of mountainous Northumberland;
138. Towns, towers, and halls successive rise,
139. And catch the nuns' delighted eyes.
140. Monkwearmouth soon behind them lay,
141. And Tynemouth's priory and bay;
142. They marked, amid her trees, the hall
143. Of lofty Seaton-Delaval;
144. They saw the Blythe and Wansbeck floods
145. Rush to the sea through sounding woods;
146. They passed the tower of Widderington,
147. Mother of many a valiant son;
148. At Coquet Isle their beads they tell
149. To the good saint who owned the cell;
150. Then did the Alne attention claim,
151. And Warkworth, proud of Percy's name;
152. And next, they crossed themselves, to hear
153. The whitening breakers sound so near,
154. Where, boiling through the rocks, they roar
155. On Dunstanborough's caverned shore;
156. Thy tower, proud Bamborough, marked they there,
157. King Ida's castle, huge and square,
158. From its tall rock look grimly down,
159. And on the swelling ocean frown;
160. Then from the coast they bore away,
161. And reached the Holy Island's bay.

162. IX.

163. The tide did now its floodmark gain,
164. And girdled in the saint's domain:
165. For, with the flow and ebb, its style
166. Varies from continent to isle;
167. Dry-shod, o'er sands, twice every day,
168. The pilgrims to the shrine find way;
169. Twice every day, the waves efface
170. Of staves and sandalled feet the trace.
171. As to the port the galley flew,
172. Higher and higher rose to view
173. The castle with its battled walls,
174. The ancient monastery's halls,
175. A solemn, huge, and dark-red pile,
176. Placed on the margin of the isle.

177. X.

178. In Saxon strength that abbey frowned,
179. With massive arches broad and round,
180. That rose alternate, row and row,
181. On ponderous columns, short and low,
182. Built ere the art was known,
183. By pointed aisle, and shafted stalk,
184. The arcades of an alleyed walk
185. To emulate in stone.
186. On the deep walls the heathen Dane
187. Had poured his impious rage in vain;
188. And needful was such strength to these,
189. Exposed to the tempestuous seas,
190. Scourged by the winds' eternal sway,
191. Open to rovers fierce as they,
192. Which could twelve hundred years withstand
193. Winds, waves, and northern pirates' hand.
194. Not but that portions of the pile,
195. Rebuilded in a later style,
196. Showed where the spoiler's hand had been;
197. Not hut the wasting sea-breeze keen
198. Had worn the pillar's carving quaint,
199. And mouldered in his niche the saint,
200. And rounded, with consuming power,
201. The pointed angles of each tower;
202. Yet still entire the abbey stood,
203. Like veteran, worn, but unsubdued.

204. XI.

205. Soon as they neared his turrets strong,
206. The maidens raised Saint Hilda's song,
207. And with the sea-wave and the wind,
208. Their voices, sweetly shrill, combined
209. And made harmonious close;
210. Then, answering from the sandy shore,
211. Half-drowned amid the breakers' roar,
212. According chorus rose:
213. Down to the haven of the isle
214. The monks and nuns in order file,
215. From Cuthbert's cloisters grim;
216. Banner, and cross, and relics there,
217. To meet Saint Hilda's maids, they bare;
218. And, as they caught the sounds on air,
219. They echoed back the hymn.
220. The islanders, in joyous mood,
221. Rushed emulously through the flood,
222. To hale the barque to land;
223. Conspicuous by her veil and hood,
224. Signing the cross, the Abbess stood,
225. And blessed them with her hand.

226. XII.

227. Suppose we now the welcome said,
228. Suppose the convent banquet made:
229. All through the holy dome,
230. Through cloister, aisle, and gallery,
231. Wherever vestal maid might pry,
232. Nor risk to meet unhallowed eye,
233. The stranger sisters roam;
234. Till fell the evening damp with dew,
235. And the sharp sea-breeze coldly blew,
236. For there e'en summer night is chill.
237. Then, having strayed and gazed their fill,
238. They closed around the fire;
239. And all, in turn, essayed to paint
240. The rival merits of their saint,
241. A theme that ne'er can tire
242. A holy maid; for, be it known,
243. That their saint's honour is their own.

244. XIII.

245. Then Whitby's nuns exulting told,
246. How to their house three barons bold
247. Must menial service do;
248. While horns blow out a note of shame,
249. And monks cry, 'Fye upon your name!
250. In wrath, for loss of silvan game,
251. Saint Hilda's priest ye slew.'
252. 'This, on Ascension Day, each year,
253. While labouring on our harbour-pier,
254. Must Herbert, Bruce, and Percy hear.'
255. They told, how in their convent cell
256. A Saxon princess once did dwell,
257. The lovely Edelfled.
258. And how, of thousand snakes, each one
259. Was changed into a coil of stone
260. When holy Hilda prayed;
261. Themselves, within their holy bound,
262. Their stony folds had often found.
263. They told, how sea-fowls' pinions fail,
264. As over Whitby's towers they sail,
265. And, sinking down, with flutterings faint,
266. They do their homage to the saint.

267. XIV.

268. Nor did Saint Cuthbert's daughters fail
269. To vie with these in holy tale;
270. His body's resting-place of old,
271. How oft their patron changed, they told;
272. How, when the rude Dane burned their pile,
273. The monks fled forth from Holy Isle;
274. O'er northern mountain, marsh, and moor,
275. From sea to sea, from shore to shore,
276. Seven years Saint Cuthbert's corpse they bore.
277. They rested them in fair Melrose;
278. But though alive he loved it well,
279. Not there his relics might repose;
280. For, wondrous tale to tell!
281. In his stone coffin forth he rides,
282. A ponderous barque for river tides,
283. Yet light as gossamer it glides,
284. Downward to Tilmouth cell.
285. Nor long was his abiding there,
286. For southward did the saint repair;
287. Chester-le-Street, and Rippon, saw
288. His holy corpse, ere Wardilaw
289. Hailed him with joy and fear;
290. And, after many wanderings past,
291. He chose his lordly seat at last,
292. Where his cathedral, huge and vast,
293. Looks down upon the Wear:
294. There, deep in Durham's Gothic shade,
295. His relics are in secret laid;
296. But none may know the place,
297. Save of his holiest servants three,
298. Deep sworn to solemn secrecy,
299. Who share that wondrous grace.

300. XV.

301. Who may his miracles declare!
302. Even Scotland's dauntless king and heir,
303. Although with them they led
304. Galwegians, wild as ocean's gale,
305. And Lodon's knights, all sheathed in mail,
306. And the bold men of Teviotdale,
307. Before his standard fled.
308. 'Twas he, to vindicate his reign,
309. Edged Alfred's falchion on the Dane,
310. And turned the Conqueror back again,
311. When, with his Norman bowyer band,
312. He came to waste Northumberland.

313. XVI.

314. But fain Saint Hilda's nuns would learn
315. If, on a rock, by Lindisfarne,
316. Saint Cuthbert sits, and toils to frame
317. The sea-born beads that bear his name:
318. Such tales had Whitby's fishers told,
319. And said they might his shape behold,
320. And hear his anvil sound:
321. A deadened clang-a huge dim form,
322. Seen but, and heard, when gathering storm
323. And night were closing round.
324. But this, as tale of idle fame,
325. The nuns of Lindisfarne disclaim.

326. XVII.

327. While round the fire such legends go,
328. Far different was the scene of woe,
329. Where, in a secret aisle beneath,
330. Council was held of life and death.
331. It was more dark and lone, that vault,
332. Than the worse dungeon cell:
333. Old Colwulf built it, for his fault,
334. In penitence to dwell,
335. When he, for cowl and beads, laid down
336. The Saxon battle-axe and crown.
337. This den, which, chilling every sense
338. Of feeling, hearing, sight,
339. Was called the Vault of Penitence,
340. Excluding air and light,
341. Was, by the prelate Sexhelm, made
342. A place of burial for such dead
343. As, having died in mortal sin,
344. Might not be laid the church within.
345. 'Twas now a place of punishment;
346. Whence if so loud a shriek were sent,
347. As reached the upper air,
348. The hearers blessed themselves, and said,
349. The spirits of the sinful dead
350. Bemoaned their torments there.

351. XVIII.

352. But though, in the monastic pile,
353. Did of this penitential aisle
354. Some vague tradition go,
355. Few only, save the Abbot, knew
356. Where the place lay; and still more few
357. Were those, who had from him the clue
358. To that dread vault to go.
359. Victim and executioner
360. Were blindfold when transported there.
361. In low dark rounds the arches hung,
362. From the rude rock the side-walls sprung;
363. The grave-stones, rudely sculptured o'er,
364. Half sunk in earth, by time half wore,
365. Were all the pavement of the floor;
366. The mildew-drops fell one by one,
367. With tinkling plash upon the stone.
368. A cresset, in an iron chain,
369. Which served to light this drear domain,
370. With damp and darkness seemed to strive,
371. As if it scarce might keep alive;
372. And yet it dimly served to show
373. The awful conclave met below.

374. XIX.

375. There, met to doom in secrecy,
376. Were placed the heads of convents three;
377. All servants of Saint Benedict,
378. The statutes of whose order strict
379. On iron table lay;
380. In long black dress, on seats of stone,
381. Behind were these three judges shown
382. By the pale cresset's ray,
383. The Abbess of Saint Hilda's, there,
384. Sat for a space with visage bare,
385. Until, to hide her bosom's swell,
386. And tear-drops that for pity fell,
387. She closely drew her veil:
388. Yon shrouded figure, as I guess,
389. By her proud mien and flowing dress,
390. Is Tynemouth's haughty Prioress,
391. And she with awe looks pale:
392. And he, that ancient man, whose sight
393. Has long been quenched by age's night,
394. Upon whose wrinkled brow alone
395. Nor ruth nor mercy's trace is shown,
396. Whose look is hard and stern -
397. Saint Cuthbert's Abbot is his style
398. For sanctity called, through the isle,
399. The saint of Lindisfarne.

400. XX.

401. Before them stood a guilty pair;
402. But, though an equal fate they share,
403. Yet one alone deserves our care.
404. Her sex a page's dress belied;
405. The cloak and doublet, loosely tied,
406. Obscured her charms, but could not hide.
407. Her cap down o'er her face she drew;
408. And, on her doublet breast,
409. She tried to hide the badge of blue,
410. Lord Marmion's falcon crest.
411. But, at the Prioress' command,
412. A monk undid the silken band,
413. That tied her tresses fair,
414. And raised the bonnet from her head,
415. And down her slender form they spread,
416. In ringlets rich and rare.
417. Constance de Beverley they know,
418. Sister professed of Fontevraud,
419. Whom the church numbered with the dead
420. For broken vows, and convent fled.

421. XXI.

422. When thus her face was given to view -
423. Although so pallid was her hue,
424. It did a ghastly contrast bear
425. To those bright ringlets glistering fair -
426. Her look composed, and steady eye,
427. Bespoke a matchless constancy;
428. And there she stood so calm and pale,
429. That, but her breathing did not fail,
430. And motion slight of eye and head,
431. And of her bosom, warranted
432. That neither sense nor pulse she lacks,
433. You might have thought a form of wax,
434. Wrought to the very life, was there;
435. So still she was, so pale, so fair.

436. XXII.

437. Her comrade was a sordid soul,
438. Such as does murder for a meed;
439. Who, but of fear, knows no control,
440. Because his conscience, seared and foul,
441. Feels not the import of his deed;
442. One, whose brute-feeling ne'er aspires
443. Beyond his own more brute desires.
444. Such tools the Tempter ever needs,
445. To do the savagest of deeds;
446. For them no visioned terrors daunt,
447. Their nights no fancied spectres haunt,
448. One fear with them, of all most base,
449. The fear of death-alone finds place.
450. This wretch was clad in frock and cowl,
451. And shamed not loud to moan and howl,
452. His body on the floor to dash,
453. And crouch, like hound beneath the lash;
454. While his mute partner, standing near,
455. Waited her doom without a tear.

456. XXIII.

457. Yet well the luckless wretch might shriek,
458. Well might her paleness terror speak!
459. For there were seen, in that dark wall,
460. Two niches, narrow, deep, and tall;
461. Who enters at such grisly door
462. Shall ne'er, I ween, find exit more.
463. In each a slender meal was laid,
464. Of roots, of water, and of bread:
465. By each, in Benedictine dress,
466. Two haggard monks stood motionless;
467. Who, holding high a blazing torch,
468. Showed the grim entrance of the porch:
469. Reflecting back the smoky beam,
470. The dark-red walls and arches gleam.
471. Hewn stones and cement were displayed,
472. And building tools in order laid.

473. XXIV.

474. These executioners were chose,
475. As men who were with mankind foes,
476. And with despite and envy fired,
477. Into the cloister had retired;
478. Or who, in desperate doubt of grace,
479. Strove, by deep penance, to efface
480. Of some foul crime the stain;
481. For, as the vassals of her will,
482. Such men the Church selected still,
483. As either joyed in doing ill,
484. Or thought more grace to gain,
485. If, in her cause, they wrestled down
486. Feelings their nature strove to own.
487. By strange device were they brought there,
488. They knew not how, nor knew not where.

489. XXV.

490. And now that blind old Abbot rose,
491. To speak the Chapter's doom
492. On those the wall was to enclose,
493. Alive, within the tomb:
494. But stopped, because that woful maid,
495. Gathering her powers, to speak essayed.
496. Twice she essayed, and twice in vain;
497. Her accents might no utterance gain;
498. Nought but imperfect murmurs slip
499. From her convulsed and quivering lip;
500. 'Twixt each attempt all was so still,
501. You seemed to hear a distant rill -
502. 'Twas ocean's swells and falls;
503. For though this vault of sin and fear
504. Was to the sounding surge so near,
505. A tempest there you scarce could hear,
506. So massive were the walls.

507. XXVI.

508. At length, an effort sent apart
509. The blood that curdled to her heart,
510. And light came to her eye,
511. And colour dawned upon her cheek,
512. A hectic and a fluttered streak,
513. Like that left on the Cheviot peak,
514. By autumn's stormy sky;
515. And when her silence broke at length,
516. Still as she spoke she gathered strength,
517. And armed herself to bear.
518. It was a fearful sight to see
519. Such high resolve and constancy,
520. In form so soft and fair.

521. XXVII.

522. 'I speak not to implore your grace,
523. Well know I, for one minute's space
524. Successless might I sue:
525. Nor do I speak your prayers to gain -
526. For if a death of lingering pain,
527. To cleanse my sins, be penance vain,
528. Vain are your masses too.
529. I listened to a traitor's tale,
530. I left the convent and the veil;
531. For three long years I bowed my pride,
532. A horse-boy in his train to ride;
533. And well my folly's meed he gave,
534. Who forfeited, to be his slave,
535. All here, and all beyond the grave.
536. He saw young Clara's face more fair,
537. He knew her of broad lands the heir,
538. Forgot his vows, his faith forswore,
539. And Constance was beloved no more.
540. 'Tis an old tale, and often told;
541. But did my fate and wish agree,
542. Ne'er had been read, in story old,
543. Of maiden true betrayed for gold,
544. That loved, or was avenged, like me.

545. XXVIII.

546. 'The king approved his favourite's aim;
547. In vain a rival barred his claim,
548. Whose fate with Clare's was plight,
549. For he attaints that rival's fame
550. With treason's charge-and on they came,
551. In mortal lists to fight.
552. Their oaths are said,
553. Their prayers are prayed,
554. Their lances in the rest are laid,
555. They meet in mortal shock;
556. And, hark! the throng, with thundering cry,
557. Shout 'Marmion! Marmion!' to the sky,
558. 'De Wilton to the block!'
559. Say ye, who preach Heaven shall decide
560. When in the lists two champions ride,
561. Say, was Heaven's justice here?
562. When, loyal in his love and faith,
563. Wilton found overthrow or death,
564. Beneath a traitor's spear?
565. How false the charge, how true he fell,
566. This guilty packet best can tell.'
567. Then drew a packet from her breast,
568. Paused, gathered voice, and spoke the rest.

569. XXIX.

570. 'Still was false Marmion's bridal stayed:
571. To Whitby's convent fled the maid,
572. The hated match to shun.
573. 'Ho! shifts she thus?' King Henry cried;
574. 'Sir Marmion, she shall be thy bride,
575. If she were sworn a nun.'
576. One way remained-the King's command
577. Sent Marmion to the Scottish land:
578. I lingered here, and rescue planned
579. For Clara and for me:
580. This caitiff monk, for gold, did swear,
581. He would to Whitby's shrine repair,
582. And, by his drugs, my rival fair
583. A saint in heaven should be.
584. But ill the dastard kept his oath,
585. Whose cowardice has undone us both.

586. XXX.

587. 'And now my tongue the secret tells,
588. Not that remorse my bosom swells,
589. But to assure my soul that none
590. Shall ever wed with Marmion.
591. Had fortune my last hope betrayed,
592. This packet, to the King conveyed,
593. Had given him to the headsman's stroke,
594. Although my heart that instant broke.
595. Now, men of death, work forth your will,
596. For I can suffer, and be still;
597. And come he slow, or come he fast,
598. It is but Death who comes at last.

599. XXXI.

600. 'Yet dread me, from my living tomb,
601. Ye vassal slaves of bloody Rome!
602. If Marmion's late remorse should wake,
603. Full soon such vengeance will he take,
604. That you shall wish the fiery Dane
605. Had rather been your guest again.
606. Behind, a darker hour ascends!
607. The altars quake, the crosier bends,
608. The ire of a despotic king
609. Rides forth upon destruction's wing;
610. Then shall these vaults, so strong and deep,
611. Burst open to the sea-winds' sweep;
612. Some traveller then shall find my bones
613. Whitening amid disjointed stones,
614. And, ignorant of priests' cruelty,
615. Marvel such relics here should be.'

616. XXXII.

617. Fixed was her look, and stern her air:
618. Back from her shoulders streamed her hair;
619. The locks, that wont her brow to shade,
620. Stared up erectly from her head;
621. Her figure seemed to rise more high;
622. Her voice, despair's wild energy
623. Had given a tone of prophecy.
624. Appalled the astonished conclave sate:
625. With stupid eyes, the men of fate
626. Gazed on the light inspired form,
627. And listened for the avenging storm;
628. The judges felt the victim's dread;
629. No hand was moved, no word was said,
630. Till thus the Abbot's doom was given,
631. Raising his sightless balls to heaven:-
632. 'Sister, let thy sorrows cease;
633. Sinful brother, part in peace!'
634. From that dire dungeon, place of doom,
635. Of execution too, and tomb,
636. Paced forth the judges three,
637. Sorrow it were, and shame, to tell
638. The butcher-work that there befell,
639. When they had glided from the cell
640. Of sin and misery.

641. XXXIII.

642. A hundred winding steps convey
643. That conclave to the upper day;
644. But, ere they breathed the fresher air,
645. They heard the shriekings of despair,
646. And many a stifled groan:
647. With speed their upward way they take,
648. Such speed as age and fear can make,
649. And crossed themselves for terror's sake,
650. As hurrying, tottering on:
651. Even in the vesper's heavenly tone,
652. They seemed to hear a dying groan,
653. And bade the passing knell to toll
654. For welfare of a parting soul.
655. Slow o'er the midnight wave it swung,
656. Northumbrian rocks in answer rung;
657. To Warkworth cell the echoes rolled,
658. His beads the wakeful hermit told,
659. The Bamborough peasant raised his head,
660. But slept ere half a prayer he said;
661. So far was heard the mighty knell,
662. The stag sprung up on Cheviot Fell,
663. Spread his broad nostril to the wind,
664. Listed before, aside, behind,
665. Then couched him down beside the hind,
666. And quaked among the mountain fern,
667. To hear that sound so dull and stern.
