1. Soldier, wake - the day is peeping,
2. Honour ne'er was won in sleeping,
3. Never when the sunbeams still
4. Lay unreflected on the hill:
5. 'Tis when they are glinted back
6. From axe and armour, spear and jack,
7. That they promise future story
8. Many a page of deathless glory.
9. Shields that are the foe man's terror,
10. Ever are the morning's mirror.

11. Arm and up - the morning beam
12. Hath call'd the rustic to his team,
13. Hath call'd the falc'ner to the lake,
14. Hath call'd the huntsman to the brake;
15. The early student ponders o'er
16. His dusty tomes of ancient lore.
17. Soldier, wake - thy harvest, fame;
18. Thy study, conquest; war, thy game.
19. Shield, that would be foeman's terror,
20. Still should gleam the morning's mirror.

21. Poor hire repays the rustic's pain;
22. More paltry still the sportsman's gain;
23. Vainest of all, the student's theme
24. End in gome metaphysic dream.
25. Yet each is up, and each has toil'd
26. Since first the peep of dawn has smiled;
27. And each is eagerer in his aim
28. Than he who barters life for fame.
29. Up, up, and arm thee, son of terror!
30. Be thy bright shield the morning's mirror.
