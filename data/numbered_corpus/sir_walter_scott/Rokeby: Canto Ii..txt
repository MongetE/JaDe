1. I.
2. Far in the chambers of the west,
3. The gale had sigh'd itself to rest;
4. The moon was cloudless now and clear,
5. But pale, and soon to disappear.
6. The thin grey clouds wax dimly light
7. On Brusleton and Houghton height;
8. And the rich dale, that eastward lay,
9. Waited the wakening touch of day,
10. To give its woods and cultured plain,
11. And towers and spires, to light again.
12. But, westward, Stanmore's shapeless swell,
13. And Lunedale wild, and Kelton-fell,
14. And rock-begirdled Gilmanscar,
15. And Arkingarth, lay dark afar;
16. While, as a livelier twilight falls,
17. Emerge proud Barnard's banner'd walls
18. High crown'd he sits, in dawning pale,
19. The sovereign of the lovely vale.

20. II.
21. What prospects, from his watch-tower high,
22. Gleam gradual on the warder's eye!
23. Far sweeping to the east, he sees
24. Down his deep woods the course of Tees,
25. And tracks his wanderings by the steam
26. Of summer vapours from the stream;
27. And ere he pace his destined hour
28. By Brackenbury's dungeon-tower,
29. These silver mists shall melt away,
30. And dew the woods with glittering spray.
31. Then in broad luster shall be shown
32. That mighty trench of living stone,
33. And each huge trunk that, from the side,
34. Reclines him o'er the darksome tide,
35. Where Tees, full many a fathom low,
36. Wears with his rage no common foe;
37. For pebbly bank, nor sand-bed here,
38. Nor clay-mound, checks his fierce career,
39. Condemn'd to mine a channell'd way,
40. O'er solid sheets of marble gray.

41. III.
42. Nor Tees alone, in dawning bright,
43. Shall rush upon the ravish'd sight;
44. But many a tributary stream
45. Each from its own dark dell shall gleam:
46. Staindrop, who, from her sylvan bowers,
47. Salutes proud Raby's battled towers;
48. The rural brook of Egliston,
49. And Balder, named from Odin's son;
50. And Greta, to whose banks ere long
51. We lead the lovers of the song;
52. And silver Lune, from Stanmore wild,
53. And fairy Thorsgill's murmuring child,
54. And last and least, but loveliest still,
55. Romantic Deepdale's slender rill.
56. Who in that dim-wood glen hath stray'd,
57. Yet long'd for Roslin's magic glade?
58. Who, wandering there, hath sought to change
59. Even for that vale so stern and strange,
60. Where Cartland's Crags, fantastic rent,
61. Through her green copse like spires are sent?
62. Yet, Albin, yet the praise be thine,
63. Thy scenes and story to combine!
64. Thou bid'st him, who by Roslin strays,
65. List to the deeds of other days;
66. Mid Cartland's Crags thou show'st the cave,
67. The refuge of thy champion brave;
68. Giving each rock its storied tale,
69. Pouring a lay for every dale,
70. Knitting, as with a moral band,
71. Thy native legends with thy land,
72. To lend each scene the interest high
73. Which genius beams from Beauty's eye.

74. IV.
75. Bertram awaited not the sight
76. Which sunrise shows from Barnard's height,
77. But from the towers, preventing day,
78. With Wilfrid took his early way,
79. While misty dawn, and moonbeam pale,
80. Still mingled in the silent dale.
81. By Barnard's bridge of stately stone,
82. The southern bank of Tees they won;
83. Their winding path then eastward cast,
84. And Egliston's gray ruins pass'd
85. Each on his own deep visions bent,
86. Silent and sad they onward went.
87. Well may you think that Bertram's mood,
88. To Wilfrid savage seem'd and rude;
89. Well may you think bold Risingham
90. Held Wilfrid trivial, poor, and tame;
91. And small the intercourse, I ween,
92. Such uncongenial souls between.

93. V.
94. Stern Bertram shunn'd the nearer way,
95. Through Rokeby's park and chase that lay,
96. And, skirting high the valley's ridge,
97. They cross'd by Greta's ancient bridge.
98. Descending where her waters wind
99. Free for a space and unconfined,
100. As, 'scaped from Brignall's dark-wood glen,
101. She seeks wild Mortham's deeper den.
102. There, as his eye glanced o'er the mound,
103. Raised by that Legion long renown'd,
104. Whose votive shrine asserts their claim,
105. Of pious, faithful, conquering fame,
106. 'Stern sons of war!' sad Wilfrid sigh'd,
107. 'Behold the boast of Roman pride!
108. What now of all your toils are known?
109. A grassy trench, a broken stone!'
110. This to himself; for moral strain
111. To Bertram were address'd in vain.

112. VI.
113. Of different mood, a deeper sigh
114. Awoke, when Rokeby's turrets high
115. Were northward in the dawning seen
116. To rear them o'er the thicket green.
117. O then, though Spenser's self had stray'd
118. Beside him through the lovely glade,
119. Lending his rich luxuriant glow
120. Of fancy, all its charms to show,
121. Pointing the stream rejoicing free,
122. As captive set at liberty,
123. Flashing her sparkling waves abroad,
124. And clamouring joyful on her road;
125. Pointing where, up the sunny banks,
126. The trees retire in scatter'd ranks,
127. Save where, advanced before the rest,
128. On knoll or hillock rears his crest,
129. Lonely and huge, the giant Oak,
130. As champions, when their band is broke,
131. Stand forth to guard the rearward post,
132. The bulwark of the scatter'd host
133. All this, and more, might Spenser say,
134. Yet waste in vain his magic lay,
135. While Wilfrid eyed the distant tower,
136. Whose lattice lights Matilda's bower.

137. VII.
138. The open vale is soon pass'd o'er,
139. Rokeby, though nigh, is seen no more;
140. Sinking mid Greta's thickets deep,
141. A wild and darker course they keep,
142. A stern and lone, yet lovely road,
143. As e'er the foot of Minstrel trode!
144. Broad shadows o'er their passage fell,
145. Deeper and narrower grew the dell;
146. It seem'd some mountain, rent and riven,
147. A channel for the stream had given,
148. So high the cliffs of limestone gray
149. Hung beetling o'er the torrent's way,
150. Yielding, along their rugged base,
151. A flinty footpath's niggard space,
152. Where he, who winds 'twixt rock and wave,
153. May hear the headlong torrent rave,
154. And like a steed in frantic fit,
155. That flings the froth from curb and bit,
156. May view her chafe her waves to spray,
157. O'er every rock that bars her way,
158. Till foam-globes on her eddies ride,
159. Thick as the schemes of human pride
160. That down life's current drive amain,
161. As frail, as frothy, and as vain!

162. VIII.
163. The cliffs that rear their haughty head
164. High o'er the river's darksome bed,
165. Were now all naked, wild, and gray,
166. Now waving all with greenwood spray;
167. Here trees to every crevice clung,
168. And o'er the dell their branches hung;
169. And there, all splinter'd and uneven,
170. The shiver'd rocks ascend to heaven;
171. Oft, too, the ivy swathed their breast,
172. And wreathed its garland round their crest,
173. Or from the spires bade loosely flare
174. Its tendrils in the middle air.
175. As pensons wont to wave of old
176. O'er the high feast of Baron bold,
177. When revell'd loud the feudal rout,
178. And the arch'd halls return'd their shout;
179. Such and more wild is Greta's roar,
180. And such the echoes from her shore.
181. And so the ivied banners gleam,
182. Waved wildly o'er the brawling stream.

183. IX.
184. Now from the stream the rocks recede,
185. But leave between no sunny mead,
186. No, nor the spot of pebbly sand,
187. Oft found by such a mountain strand;
188. Forming such warm and dry retreat,
189. As fancy deems the lonely seat,
190. Where hermit, wandering from his cell,
191. His rosary might love to tell.
192. But here, 'twixt rock and river, grew
193. A dismal grove of sable yew,
194. With whose sad tints were mingled seen
195. The blighted fir's sepulchral green.
196. Seem'd that tile trees their shadows cast
197. The earth that nourish'd them to blast;
198. For never knew that swarthy grove
199. The verdant hue that fairies love;
200. Nor wilding green, nor woodland flower,
201. Arose within its baleful bower:
202. The dank and sable earth receives
203. Its only carpet from the leaves,
204. That, from the withering branches cast,
205. Bestrew'd the ground with every blast.
206. Though now the sun was o'er the hill,
207. In this dark spot 'twas twilight still,
208. Save that on Greta's further side
209. Some straggling beams through copsewood glide;
210. And wild and savage contrast made
211. That dingle's deep and funeral shade,
212. With the bright tints of early day,
213. Which, glimmering through the ivy spray,
214. On the opposing summit lay.

215. X.
216. The lated peasant shunn'd the dell;
217. For Superstition wont to tell
218. Of many a grisly sound and sight,
219. Scaring its path at dead of night.
220. When Christmas logs blaze high and wide,
221. Such wonders speed the festal tide;
222. While Curiosity and Fear,
223. Pleasure and Pain, sit crouching near,
224. Till childhood's cheek no longer glows,
225. And village maidens lose the rose.
226. The thrilling interest rises higher,
227. The circle closes nigh and nigher,
228. And shuddering glance is cast behind,
229. As louder moans the wintry wind.
230. Believe, that fitting scene was laid
231. For such wild tales in Mortham glade;
232. For who had seen, on Greta's side,
233. By that dim light fierce Bertram stride,
234. In such a spot, at such an hour,
235. If touch'd by Superstition's power,
236. Might well have deemed that Hell had given
237. A murderer's ghost to upper heaven,
238. While Wilfrid's form had seem'd to glide
239. Like his pale victim by his side.

240. XI.
241. Nor think to village swains alone
242. Are these unearthly terrors known;
243. For not to rank nor sex confined
244. Is this vain ague of the mind:
245. Hearts firm as steel, as marble hard,
246. Gainst faith, and love, and pity barr'd,
247. Have quaked, like aspen leaves in May,
248. Beneath its universal sway.
249. Bertram had listed many a tale
250. Of wonder in his native dale,
251. That in his secret soul retain'd
252. The credence they in childhood gain'd:
253. Nor less his wild adventurous youth
254. Believed in every legend's truth;
255. Learn'd when, beneath the tropic gale,
256. Full swell'd the vessel's steady sail,
257. And the broad Indian moon her light
258. Pour'd on the watch of middle night,
259. When seamen love to hear and tell
260. Of portent, prodigy, and spell:
261. What gales are sold on Lapland's shore,
262. How whistle rash bids tempests roar,
263. Of witch, of mermaid, and of sprite,
264. Of Erick's cap and Elmo's light;
265. Or of that Phantom Ship, whose form
266. Shoots like a meteor through the storm;
267. When the dark scud comes driving hard,
268. And lower'd is every topsail-yard,
269. And canvas, wove in earthly looms,
270. No more to brave the storm presumes!
271. Then, 'mid the war of sea and sky,
272. Top and top-gallant hoisted high,
273. Full spread and crowded every sail,
274. The Demon Frigate braves the gale;
275. And well the doom'd spectators know
276. The harbinger of wreck and woe.

277. XII.
278. Then, too, were told, in stifled tone,
279. Marvels and omens all their own;
280. How, by some desert isle or key,
281. Where Spaniards wrought their cruelty,
282. Or where the savage pirate's mood
283. Repaid it home in deeds of blood,
284. Strange nightly sounds of woe and fear
285. Appall'd the listening Buccaneer,
286. Whose light-armed shallop anchored lay
287. In ambush by the lonely bay.
288. The groan of grief, the shriek of pain,
289. Ring from the moonlight groves of cane;
290. The fierce adventurer's heart they scare,
291. Who wearies memory for a prayer,
292. Curses the road-stead, and with gale
293. Of early morning lifts the sail,
294. To give, in thirst of blood and prey,
295. A legend for another bay.

296. XIII.
297. Thus, as a man, a youth, a child,
298. Train'd in the mystic and the wild,
299. With this on Bertram's soul at times
300. Rush'd a dark feeling of his crimes;
301. Such to his troubled soul their form,
302. As the pale Death-ship to the storm,
303. And such their omen dim and dread,
304. As shrieks and voices of the dead,
305. That pang, whose transitory force
306. Hover'd 'twixt horror and remorse;
307. That pang, perchance, his bosom press'd,
308. As Wilfrid sudden he address'd:
309. 'Wilfrid, this glen is never trod
310. Until the sun rides high abroad;
311. Yet twice have I beheld to-day
312. A Form, that seem'd to dog our way;
313. Twice from my glance it seem'd to flee,
314. And shroud itself by cliff or tree.
315. How think'st thou?-Is our path waylaid?
316. Or hath thy sire my trust betray'd?
317. If so'-Ere, starting from his dream,
318. That turn'd upon a gentler theme,
319. Wilfrid had roused him to reply,
320. Bertram sprung forward, shouting high,
321. 'Whate'er thou art, thou now shalt stand!'
322. And forth he darted, sword in hand.

323. XIV.
324. As bursts the levin in its wrath,
325. He shot him down the sounding path;
326. Rock, wood, and stream, rang wildly out,
327. To his loud step and savage shout.
328. Seems that the object of his race
329. Hath scal'd the cliffs; his frantic chase
330. Sidelong he turns, and now 'tis bent
331. Right up the rock's tall battlement;
332. Straining each sinew to ascend,
333. Foot, hand, and knee, their aid must lend.
334. Wilfrid, all dizzy with dismay,
335. Views, from beneath, his dreadful way:
336. Now to the oak's warp'd roots he clings,
337. Now trusts his weight to ivy strings;
338. Now, like the wild goat, must he dare
339. An unsupported leap in air;
340. Hid in the shrubby rain-course now,
341. You mark him by the crashing bough,
342. And by his corslet's sullen clank,
343. And by the stones spurn'd from the bank,
344. And by the hawk scar'd from her nest,
345. And ravens croaking o'er their guest,
346. Who deem his forfeit limbs shall pay
347. The tribute of his bold essay.

348. XV.
349. See, he emerges!-desperate now
350. All further course-Yon beetling brow,
351. In craggy nakedness sublime,
352. What heart or foot shall dare to climb?
353. It bears no tendril for his clasp,
354. Presents no angle to his grasp:
355. Sole stay his foot may rest upon,
356. Is yon earth-bedded jetting stone.
357. Balanced on such precarious prop,
358. He strains his grasp to reach the top.
359. Just as the dangerous stretch he makes,
360. By heaven, his faithless footstool shakes!
361. Beneath its tottering bulk it bends,
362. It sways,…it loosens,…it descends!
363. And downward holds its headlong way,
364. Crashing o'er rock and copsewood spray.
365. Loud thunders shake the echoing dell!
366. Fell it alone?-alone it fell.
367. Just on the very verge of fate,
368. The hardy Bertram's falling weight
369. He trusted to his sinewy hands,
370. And on the top unharm'd he stands!

371. XVI.
372. Wilfrid a safer path pursued;
373. At intervals where, roughly hew'd,
374. Rude steps ascending from the dell
375. Render'd the cliffs accessible.
376. By circuit slow he thus attain'd
377. The height that Risingham had gain'd,
378. And when he issued from the wood,
379. Before the gate of Mortham stood.
380. 'Twas a fair scene! the sunbeam lay
381. On battled tower and portal gray:
382. And from the glassy slope he sees
383. The Greta flow to meet the Tees;
384. Where, issuing from her darksomne bed,
385. She caught the morning's eastern red,
386. And through the softening vale below
387. Roll'd her bright waves, in rosy glow,
388. All blushing to her bridal bed,
389. Like some shy maid in convent bred;
390. While linnet, lark, and blackbird gay,
391. Sing forth her nuptial roundelay.

392. XVII.
393. 'Twas sweetly sung that roundelay;
394. That summer morn shone blithe and gay;
395. But morning beam, and wild-bird's call,
396. Awaked not Mortham's silent hall.
397. No porter, by the low-brow'd gate,
398. Took in the wonted niche his seat;
399. To the paved court no peasant drew;
400. Waked to their toil no menial crew;
401. The maiden's carol was not heard,
402. As to her morning task she fared:
403. In the void offices around,
404. Rung not a hoof, nor bay'd a hound;
405. Nor eager steed, with shrilling neigh,
406. Accused the lagging groom's delay;
407. Untrinmm'd, undress'd, neglected now,
408. Was alley'd walk and orchard bough;
409. All spoke the master's absent care,
410. All spoke neglect and disrepair.
411. South of the gate, an arrow flight,
412. Two mighty elms their limbs unite,
413. As if a canopy, to spread
414. O'er the lone dwelling of the dead;
415. For their huge bows in arches bent
416. Above a massive monument,
417. Carved o'er in ancient Gothic wise,
418. With many a scutcheon and device:
419. There, spent with toil and sunk in gloom,
420. Bertram stood pondering by the tomb.

421. XVIII.
422. 'It vanish'd, like a flitting ghost!
423. Behind this tomb,' he said, ''twas lost
424. This tomb, where oft I deem'd lies stored
425. Of Mortham's Indian wealth the hoard.
426. Tis true, the aged servants said
427. Here his lamented wife is laid;
428. But weightier reasons may be guess'd
429. For their Lord's strict and stern behest,
430. That none should on his steps intrude,
431. Whene'er he sought this solitude.
432. An ancient mariner I knew,
433. What time I sail'd with Morgan's crew,
434. Who oft, 'mid our carousals, spake
435. Of Raleigh, Forbisher, and Drake;
436. Adventurous hearts! Who barter'd, bold,
437. Their English steel for Spanish gold.
438. Trust not, would his experience say,
439. Captain or comrade with your prey;
440. But seek some charnel, when, at full,
441. The moon gilds skeleton and skull:
442. There dig, and tomb your precious heap;
443. And bid the dead your treasure keep;
444. Sure stewards they, if fitting spell
445. Their service to the task compel.
446. Lacks there such charnel?-kill a slave,
447. Or prisoner, on the treasure-grave;
448. And bid his discontented ghost
449. Stalk nightly on his lonely post.
450. Such was his tale. Its truth, I ween,
451. Is in my morning vision seen.'

452. XIX.
453. Wilfrid, who scorn'd the legend wild,
454. In mingled mirth and pity smiled,
455. Much marvelling that a breast so bold
456. In such fond tale belief should hold;
457. But yet of Bertram sought to know
458. The apparition's form and show.
459. The power within the guilty breast,
460. Oft vanquish'd, never quite suppress'd,
461. That unsubdued and lurking lies
462. To take the felon by surprise,
463. And force him, as by magic spell,
464. In his despite his guilt to tell,
465. That power in Bertram's breast awoke;
466. Scarce conscious he was heard, he spoke;
467. ''Twas Mortham's form, from foot to head!
468. His morion, with the plume of red,
469. His shape, his mien- 'twas Mortham, right
470. As when I slew him in the fight.'
471. 'Thou slay him?-thou?' With conscious start
472. He heard, then mann'd his haughty heart
473. I slew him?-I! I had forgot
474. Thou, stripling, knew'st not of the plot.
475. But it is spoken-nor will I
476. Deed done, or spoken word, deny.
477. I slew him; I! For thankless pride;
478. 'Twas by this hand that Mortham died.'

479. XX.
480. Wilfrid, of gentle hand and heart,
481. Averse to every active part,
482. But most averse to martial broil,
483. From danger shrunk, and turn'd from toil;
484. Yet the meek lover of the lyre
485. Nursed one brave spark of noble fire;
486. Against injustice, fraud, or wrong,
487. His blood beat high, his hand wax'd strong.
488. Not his the nerves that could sustain,
489. Unshaken, danger, toil, and pain;
490. But, when that spark blazed forth to flame,
491. He rose superior to his frame.
492. And now it came, that generous mood;
493. And, in full current of his blood,
494. On Bertram he laid desperate hand,
495. Placed firm his foot, and drew his brand.
496. 'Should every fiend, to whom thou'rt sold,
497. Rise in thine aid, I keep my hold.
498. Arouse there, ho! take spear and sword!
499. Attach the murderer of your Lord!'

500. XXI.
501. A moment, fix'd as by a spell,
502. Stood Bertram-It seem'd miracle,
503. That one so feeble, soft, and tame,
504. Set grasp on warlike Risingham.
505. But when he felt a feeble stroke,
506. The fiend within the ruffian woke!
507. To wrench the sword from Wilfrid's hand,
508. To dash him headlong on the sand,
509. Was but one moment's work,-one more
510. Had drench'd the blade in Wilfrid's gore;
511. But, in the instant it arose,
512. To end his life, his love, his woes,
513. A warlike form, that mark'd the scene,
514. Presents his rapier sheathed between,
515. Parries the fast-descending blow,
516. And steps 'twixt Wilfrid and his foe;
517. Nor then unscabbarded his brand,
518. But, sternly pointing with his hand,
519. With monarch's voice forbade the fight,
520. And motion'd Bertram from his sight.
521. 'Go, and repent,' he said, 'while time
522. Is given thee; add not crime to crime.'

523. XXII.
524. Mute, and uncertain, and amazed,
525. As on a vision Bertram gazed!
526. â€˜Twas Mortham's bearing, bold and high,
527. His sinewy frame, his falcon eye,
528. His look and accent of command,
529. The martial gesture of his hand,
530. His stately form, spare-built and tall,
531. His war-bleach'd locks- 'twas Mortham all.
532. Through Bertram's dizzy brain career
533. A thousand thoughts, and all of fear;
534. His wavering faith received not quite
535. The form he saw as Mortham's sprite,
536. But more he fear'd it, if it stood
537. His lord, in living flesh and blood.
538. What spectre can the charnel send,
539. So dreadful as an injured friend?
540. Then, too, the habit of command,
541. Used by the leader of the band,
542. When Risingham, for many a day,
543. Had march'd and fought beneath his sway,
544. Tamed him-and, with reverted face,
545. Backwards he bore his sullen pace;
546. Oft stopp'd, and oft on Mortham stared,
547. And dark as rated mastiff glared;
548. But when the tramp of steeds was heard,
549. Plunged in the glen, and disappear'd,
550. Nor longer there the Warrior stood,
551. Retiring eastward through the wood;
552. But first to Wilfrid warning gives,
553. 'Tell thou to none that Mortham lives.'

554. XXIII.
555. Still rung these words in Wilfrid's ear,
556. Hinting he knew not what of fear;
557. When nearer came the coursers' tread,
558. And, with his father at their head,
559. Of horsemen arm'd a gallant power
560. Rein'd up their steeds before the tower.
561. 'Whence these pale looks, my son?' he said:
562. 'Where's Bertram?-Why that naked blade?'
563. Wilfrid ambiguously replied,
564. (For Mortham's charge his honour tied,)
565. 'Bertram is gone-the villain's word
566. Avouch'd him murderer of his lord!
567. Even now we fought-but, when your tread
568. Announced you nigh, the felon fled.'
569. In Wycliffe's conscious eye appear
570. A guilty hope, a guilty fear;
571. On his pale brow the dewdrop broke,
572. And his lip quiver'd as he spoke:-

573. XXIV.
574. 'A murderer!-Philip Mortham died
575. Amid the battle's wildest tide.
576. Wilfrid, or Bertram raves, or you!
577. Yet, grant such strange confession true,
578. Pursuit were vain-let him fly farâ€”-
579. Justice must sleep in civil war.'
580. A gallant Youth rode near his side,
581. Brave Rokeby's page, in battle tried;
582. That morn, an embassy of weight
583. He brought to Barnard's castle gate,
584. And followed now in Wycliffe's train,
585. An answer for his lord to gain.
586. His steed, whose arch'd and sable neck
587. An hundred wreaths of foam bedeck,
588. Chafed not against the curb more high
589. Than he at Oswald's cold reply;
590. He bit his lip, implored his saint,
591. (His the old faith)-then burst restraint.

592. XXV.
593. 'Yes! I beheld his bloody fall,
594. By that base traitor's dastard ball,
595. Just when I thought to measure sword,
596. Presumptuous hope! with Mortham's lord.
597. And shall the murderer 'scape, who slew
598. His leader, generous, brave, and true?
599. Escape, while on the dew you trace
600. The marks of his gigantic pace?
601. No! ere the sun that dew shall dry
602. False Risingham shall yield or die.
603. Ring out the castle 'larum bell!
604. Arouse the peasants with the knell!
605. Meantime disperse-ride, gallants, ride!
606. Beset the wood on every side.
607. But if among you one there be,
608. That honours Mortham's memory,
609. Let him dismount and follow me!
610. Else on your crests sit fear and shame,
611. And foul suspicion dog your name!'

612. XXVI.
613. Instant to earth young Redmond sprung;
614. Instant on earth the harness rung
615. Of twenty men of Wycliffe's band,
616. Who waited not their lord's command.
617. Redmond his spurs from buskins drew,
618. His mantle from his shoulders threw,
619. His pistols in his belt he placed,
620. The green-wood gain'd, the footsteps traced,
621. Shouted like huntsmen to his bounds,
622. 'To cover, hark!'-and in he bounds.
623. Scarce heard was Oswald's anxious cry,
624. 'Suspicion! yes-pursue him-fly
625. But venture not, in useless strife,
626. On ruffian desperate of his life,
627. Whoever finds him, shoot him dead!
628. Five hundred nobles for his head!'

629. XXVII.
630. The horsemen gallop'd, to make good
631. Each path that issued from the wood.
632. Loud from the thickets rung the shout
633. Of Redmond and his eager route;
634. With them was Wilfrid, stung with ire,
635. And envying Redmond's martial fire,
636. And emulous of fame.-But where
637. Is Oswald, noble Mortham's heir?
638. He, bound by honour, law, and faith,
639. Avenger of his kinsman's death?
640. Leaning against the elmin tree,
641. With drooping head and slacken'd knee,
642. And clenched teeth, and close-clasp'd hands,
643. In agony of soul he stands!
644. His downcast eye on earth is bent,
645. His soul to every sound is lent;
646. For in each shout that cleaves the air,
647. May ring discovery and despair.

648. XXVIII.
649. What 'vail'd it him, that brightly play'd
650. The morning sun on Mortham's glade?
651. All seems in giddy round to ride,
652. Like objects on a stormy tide,
653. Seen eddying by the moonlight dim,
654. Imperfectly to sink and swim.
655. What 'vail'd it, that tile fair domain,
656. Its battled mansion, hill, and plain,
657. On which the sun so brightly shone,
658. Envied so long, was now his own?
659. The lowest dungeon, in that hour,
660. Of Brackenbury's dismal tower,
661. Had been his choice, could such a doom
662. Have open'd Mortham's bloody tomb!
663. Forced, too, to turn unwilling ear
664. To each surmise of hope or fear,
665. Murmur'd among the rustics round,
666. Who gather'd at the 'larum sound;
667. He dared not turn his head away,
668. E'en to look up to heaven to pray,
669. Or call on hell, in bitter mood,
670. For one sharp death-shot from the wood!

671. XXIX.
672. At length o'erpast that dreadful space,
673. Back straggling came the scatter'd chase;
674. Jaded and weary, horse and man,
675. Return'd the troopers, one by one.
676. Wilfrid, the last, arrived to say,
677. All trace was lost of Bertram's way,
678. Though Redmond still, up Brignall wood,
679. The hopeless quest in vain pursued.
680. 0, fatal doom of human race!
681. What tyrant passions passions chase!
682. Remorse from Oswald's brow is gone,
683. Avarice and pride resume their throne;
684. The pang of instant terror by,
685. They dictate us their slave's reply:

686. XXX.
687. 'Ay-let him range like hasty hound!
688. And if the grim wolf's lair be found,
689. Small is my care how goes the game
690. With Redmond, or with Risingham.
691. Nay, answer not, thou simple boy!
692. Thy fair Matilda, all so coy
693. To thee, is of another mood
694. To that bold youth of Erin's blood.
695. Thy ditties will she freely praise,
696. And pay thy pains with courtly phrase;
697. In a rough path will oft command
698. Accept at least-thy friendly hand;
699. His she avoids, or, urged and pray'd,
700. Unwilling takes his proffer'd aid,
701. While conscious passion plainly speaks
702. In downcast look and blushing cheeks.
703. Whene'er he sings, will she glide nigh,
704. And all her soul is in her eye;
705. Yet doubts she still to tender free
706. The wonted words of courtesy.
707. These are strong signs!-yet wherefore sigh,
708. And wipe, effeminate, thine eye?
709. Thine shall she be, if thou attend
710. The counsels of thy sire and friend.

711. XXXI.
712. 'Scarce wert thou gone, when peep of light
713. Brought genuine news of Marston's fight.
714. Brave Cromwell turn'd the doubtful tide,
715. And conquest bless'd the rightful side;
716. Three thousand cavaliers lie dead,
717. Rupert and that bold Marquis fled;
718. Nobles and knights, so proud of late,
719. Must fine for freedom and estate.
720. Of these, committed to my charge,
721. Is Rokeby, prisoner at large;
722. Redmond, his page, arrived to say
723. He reaches Barnard's towers to-day.
724. Right heavy shall his ransom be,
725. Unless that maid compound with thee!
726. Go to her now-be bold of cheer,
727. While her soul floats â€˜twixt hope and fear;
728. It is the very change of tide,
729. When best the female heart is tried
730. Pride, prejudice, and modesty,
731. Are in the current swept to sea;
732. And the bold swain, who plies his oar,
733. May lightly row his bark to shore.'
