1. I.

2. Eustace, I said, did blithely mark
3. The first notes of the merry lark.
4. The lark sang shrill, the cock he crew,
5. And loudly Marmion's bugles blew,
6. And with their light and lively call,
7. Brought groom and yeoman to the stall.
8. Whistling they came, and free of heart,
9. But soon their mood was changed;
10. Complaint was heard on every part,
11. Of something disarranged.
12. Some clamoured loud for armour lost;
13. Some brawled and wrangled with the host;
14. 'By Becket's bones,' cried one, 'I fear
15. That some false Scot has stol'n my spear!'
16. Young Blount, Lord Marmion's second squire,
17. Found his steed wet with sweat and mire;
18. Although the rated horse-boy sware,
19. Last night he dressed him sleek and fair.
20. While chafed the impatient squire like thunder,
21. Old Hubert shouts, in fear and wonder,
22. 'Help, gentle Blount! help, comrades all!
23. Bevis lies dying in his stall:
24. To Marmion who the plight dare tell,
25. Of the good steed he loves so well?'
26. Gaping for fear and ruth, they saw
27. The charger panting on his straw;
28. Till one who would seem wisest, cried,
29. 'What else but evil could betide,
30. With that cursed Palmer for our guide?
31. Better we had through mire and bush
32. Been lantern-led by Friar Rush.'

33. II.

34. Fitz-Eustace, who the cause but guessed,
35. Nor wholly understood,
36. His comrades' clamorous plaints suppressed;
37. He knew Lord Marmion's mood.
38. Him, ere he issued forth, he sought,
39. And found deep plunged in gloomy thought,
40. And did his tale display
41. Simply, as if he knew of nought
42. To cause such disarray.
43. Lord Marmion gave attention cold,
44. Nor marvelled at the wonders told -
45. Passed them as accidents of course,
46. And bade his clarions sound to horse.

47. III.

48. Young Henry Blount, meanwhile, the cost
49. Had reckoned with their Scottish host;
50. And, as the charge he cast and paid,
51. 'Ill thou deserv'st thy hire,' he said;
52. 'Dost see, thou knave, my horse's plight?
53. Fairies have ridden him all the night,
54. And left him in a foam!
55. I trust that soon a conjuring band,
56. With English cross, and blazing brand,
57. Shall drive the devils from this land,
58. To their infernal home:
59. For in this haunted den, I trow,
60. All night they trampled to and fro.'
61. The laughing host looked on the hire -
62. 'Gramercy, gentle southern squire,
63. And if thou com'st among the rest,
64. With Scottish broadsword to be blest,
65. Sharp be the brand, and sure the blow,
66. And short the pang to undergo.'
67. Here stayed their talk; for Marmion
68. Gave now the signal to set on.
69. The Palmer showing forth the way,
70. They journeyed all the morning day.

71. IV.

72. The greensward way was smooth and good,
73. Through Humbie's and through Saltoun's wood;
74. A forest glade, which, varying still,
75. Here gave a view of dale and hill,
76. There narrower closed, till overhead
77. A vaulted screen the branches made.
78. 'A pleasant path,' Fitz-Eustace said,
79. 'Such as where errant-knights might see
80. Adventures of high chivalry;
81. Might meet some damsel flying fast,
82. With hair unbound, and looks aghast;
83. And smooth and level course were here,
84. In her defence to break a spear.
85. Here, too, are twilight nooks and dells;
86. And oft, in such, the story tells,
87. The damsel kind, from danger freed,
88. Did grateful pay her champion's meed.'
89. He spoke to cheer Lord Marmion's mind;
90. Perchance to show his lore designed;
91. For Eustace much had pored
92. Upon a huge romantic tome,
93. In the hall-window of his home,
94. Imprinted at the antique dome
95. Of Caxton, or De Worde,
96. Therefore he spoke-but spoke in vain,
97. For Marmion answered nought again.

98. V.

99. Now sudden, distant trumpets shrill,
100. In notes prolonged by wood and hill,
101. Were heard to echo far:
102. Each ready archer grasped his bow,
103. But by the flourish soon they know,
104. They breathed no point of war.
105. Yet cautious, as in foeman's land,
106. Lord Marmion's order speeds the band,
107. Some opener ground to gain;
108. And scarce a furlong had they rode,
109. When thinner trees, receding, showed
110. A little woodland plain.
111. Just in that advantageous glade,
112. The halting troop a line had made,
113. As forth from the opposing shade
114. Issued a gallant train.

115. VI.

116. First came the trumpets, at whose clang
117. So late the forest echoes rang;
118. On prancing steeds they forward pressed,
119. With scarlet mantle, azure vest;
120. Each at his trump a banner wore,
121. Which Scotland's royal scutcheon bore:
122. Heralds and pursuivants, by name
123. Bute, Islay, Marchmount, Rothsay, came,
124. In painted tabards, proudly showing
125. Gules, argent, or, and azure glowing,
126. Attendant on a king-at-arms,
127. Whose hand the armorial truncheon held,
128. That feudal strife had often quelled,
129. When wildest its alarms.

130. VII.

131. He was a man of middle age;
132. In aspect manly, grave, and sage,
133. As on king's errand come;
134. But in the glances of his eye,
135. A penetrating, keen, and sly
136. Expression found its home;
137. The flash of that satiric rage,
138. Which, bursting on the early stage,
139. Branded the vices of the age,
140. And broke the keys of Rome.
141. On milk-white palfrey forth he paced;
142. His cap of maintenance was graced
143. With the proud heron-plume.
144. From his steed's shoulder, loin, and breast,
145. Silk housings swept the ground,
146. With Scotland's arms, device, and crest,
147. Embroidered round and round.
148. The double tressure might you see,
149. First by Achaius borne,
150. The thistle and the fleur-de-lis,
151. And gallant unicorn.
152. So bright the king's armorial coat,
153. That scarce the dazzled eye could note,
154. In living colours, blazoned brave,
155. The lion, which his title gave;
156. A train, which well beseemed his state,
157. But all unarmed, around him wait.
158. Still is thy name in high account,
159. And still thy verse has charms,
160. Sir David Lindesay of the Mount,
161. Lord Lion King-at-Arms!

162. VIII.

163. Down from his horse did Marmion spring,
164. Soon as he saw the Lion-King;
165. For well the stately baron knew
166. To him such courtesy was due,
167. Whom royal James himself had crowned,
168. And on his temples placed the round
169. Of Scotland's ancient diadem;
170. And wet his brow with hallowed wine,
171. And on his finger given to shine
172. The emblematic gem.
173. Their mutual greetings duly made,
174. The Lion thus his message said:-
175. 'Though Scotland's king hath deeply swore
176. Ne'er to knit faith with Henry more,
177. And strictly hath forbid resort
178. From England to his royal court;
179. Yet, for he knows Lord Marmion's name,
180. And honours much his warlike fame,
181. My liege hath deemed it shame, and lack
182. Of courtesy, to turn him back:
183. And, by his order, I, your guide,
184. Must lodging fit and fair provide,
185. Till finds King James meet time to see
186. The flower of English chivalry.'

187. IX.

188. Though inly chafed at this delay,
189. Lord Marmion bears it as he may.
190. The Palmer, his mysterious guide,
191. Beholding thus his place supplied,
192. Sought to take leave in vain:
193. Strict was the Lion-King's command,
194. That none, who rode in Marmion's band
195. Should sever from the train:
196. 'England has here enow of spies
197. In Lady Heron's witching eyes:'
198. To Marchmount thus, apart, he said,
199. But fair pretext to Marmion made.
200. The right hand path they now decline,
201. And trace against the stream the Tyne.

202. X.

203. At length up that wild dale they wind,
204. Where Crichtoun Castle crowns the bank;
205. For there the Lion's care assigned
206. A lodging meet for Marmion's rank.
207. That castle rises on the steep
208. Of the green vale of Tyne:
209. And far beneath, where slow they creep,
210. From pool to eddy, dark and deep,
211. Where alders moist, and willows weep,
212. You hear her streams repine.
213. The towers in different ages rose;
214. Their various architecture shows
215. The builders' various hands:
216. A mighty mass, that could oppose,
217. When deadliest hatred fired its foes,
218. The vengeful Douglas bands.

219. XI.

220. Crichtoun! though now thy miry court
221. But pens the lazy steer and sheep,
222. Thy turrets rude and tottered keep,
223. Have been the minstrel's loved resort.
224. Oft have I traced within thy fort,
225. Of mouldering shields the mystic sense,
226. Scutcheons of honour or pretence,
227. Quartered in old armorial sort,
228. Remains of rude magnificence.
229. Nor wholly yet had time defaced
230. Thy lordly gallery fair;
231. Nor yet the stony cord unbraced,
232. Whose twisted knots, with roses laced,
233. Adorn thy ruined stair.
234. Still rises unimpaired below,
235. The courtyard's graceful portico;
236. Above its cornice, row and row
237. Of fair hewn facets richly show
238. Their pointed diamond form,
239. Though there but houseless cattle go
240. To shield them from the storm.
241. And, shuddering, still may we explore,
242. Where oft whilom were captives pent,
243. The darkness of thy massy-more;
244. Or, from thy grass-grown battlement,
245. May trace, in undulating line,
246. The sluggish mazes of the Tyne.

247. XII.

248. Another aspect Crichtoun showed,
249. As through its portal Marmion rode;
250. But yet 'twas melancholy state
251. Received him at the outer gate;
252. For none were in the castle then,
253. But women, boys, or aged men.
254. With eyes scarce dried, the sorrowing dame,
255. To welcome noble Marmion came;
256. Her son, a stripling twelve years old,
257. Proffered the baron's rein to hold;
258. For each man that could draw a sword
259. Had marched that morning with their lord,
260. Earl Adam Hepburn-he who died
261. On Flodden, by his sovereign's side
262. Long may his lady look in vain!
263. She ne'er shall see his gallant train
264. Come sweeping back through Crichtoun Dean.
265. 'Twas a brave race, before the name
266. Of hated Bothwell stained their fame.

267. XIII.

268. And here two days did Marmion rest,
269. With every rite that honour claims,
270. Attended as the king's own guest; -
271. Such the command of royal James,
272. Who marshalled then his land's array,
273. Upon the Borough Moor that lay.
274. Perchance he would not foeman's eye
275. Upon his gathering host should pry,
276. Till full prepared was every band
277. To march against the English land.
278. Here while they dwelt, did Lindesay's wit
279. Oft cheer the baron's moodier fit;
280. And, in his turn, he knew to prize
281. Lord Marmion's powerful mind, and wise -
282. Trained in the lore of Rome and Greece,
283. And policies of war and peace.

284. XIV.

285. It chanced, as fell the second night,
286. That on the battlements they walked,
287. And, by the slowly fading night,
288. Of varying topics talked;
289. And, unaware, the herald-bard
290. Said, Marmion might his toil have spared,
291. In travelling so far;
292. For that a messenger from heaven
293. In vain to James had counsel given
294. Against the English war:
295. And, closer questioned, thus he told
296. A tale, which chronicles of old
297. In Scottish story have enrolled: -

298. XV.

299. SIR DAVID LINDESAY'S TALE.

300. 'Of all the palaces so fair,
301. Built for the royal dwelling,
302. In Scotland far beyond compare,
303. Linlithgow is excelling;
304. And in its park, in jovial June,
305. How sweet the merry linnet's tune,
306. How blithe the blackbird's lay;
307. The wild-buck bells from ferny brake,
308. The coot dives merry on the lake;
309. The saddest heart might pleasure take
310. To see all nature gay.
311. But June is, to our sovereign dear,
312. The heaviest month in all the year:
313. Too well his cause of grief you know,
314. June saw his father's overthrow,
315. Woe to the traitors, who could bring
316. The princely boy against his king!
317. Still in his conscience burns the sting.
318. In offices as strict as Lent,
319. King James's June is ever spent.

320. XVI.

321. 'When last this ruthful .month was come,
322. And in Linlithgow's holy dome
323. The King, as wont, was praying;
324. While, for his royal father's soul,
325. The chanters sung, the bells did toll,
326. The bishop mass was saying -
327. For now the year brought round again
328. The day the luckless king was slain -
329. In Katharine's aisle the monarch knelt,
330. With sackcloth-shirt and iron belt,
331. And eyes with sorrow streaming;
332. Around him, in their stalls of state,
333. The Thistle's knight-companions sate,
334. Their banners o'er them beaming.
335. I too was there, and, sooth to tell,
336. Bedeafened with the jangling knell,
337. Was watching where the sunbeams fell,
338. Through the stained casement gleaming;
339. But, while I marked what next befell,
340. It seemed as I were dreaming.
341. Stepped from the crowd a ghostly wight,
342. In azure gown, with cincture white;
343. His forehead bald, his head was bare,
344. Down hung at length his yellow hair.
345. Now, mock me not, when, good my lord,
346. I pledged to you my knightly word,
347. That, when I saw his placid grace.
348. His simple majesty of face,
349. His solemn bearing, and his pace
350. So stately gliding on,
351. Seemed to me ne'er did limner paint
352. So just an image of the Saint,
353. Who propped the Virgin in her faint -
354. The loved Apostle John!

355. XVII.

356. 'He stepped before the monarch's chair,
357. And stood with rustic plainness there,
358. And little reverence made:
359. Nor head, nor body, bowed nor bent,
360. But on the desk his arm he leant,
361. And words like these he said,
362. In a low voice-but never tone
363. So thrilled through vein, and nerve, and bone:-
364. 'My mother sent me from afar,
365. Sir King, to warn thee not to war -
366. Woe waits on thine array;
367. If war thou wilt, of woman fair,
368. Her witching wiles and wanton snare,
369. James Stuart, doubly warned, beware:
370. God keep thee as he may!'
371. The wondering monarch seemed to seek
372. For answer, and found none;
373. And when he raised his head to speak,
374. The monitor was gone.
375. The marshal and myself had cast
376. To stop him as he outward passed:
377. But, lighter than the whirlwind's blast,
378. He vanished from our eyes,
379. Like sunbeam on the billow cast,
380. That glances but, and dies.'

381. XVIII.

382. While Lindesay told his marvel strange,
383. The twilight was so pale,
384. He marked not Marmion's colour change,
385. While listening to the tale;
386. But, after a suspended pause,
387. The baron spoke:- 'Of Nature's laws
388. So strong I held the force,
389. That never superhuman cause
390. Could e'er control their course;
391. And, three days since, had judged your aim
392. Was but to make your guest your game.
393. But I have seen, since passed the Tweed,
394. What much has changed my sceptic creed,
395. And made me credit aught.' He stayed,
396. And seemed to wish his words unsaid:
397. But, by that strong emotion pressed,
398. Which prompts us to unload our breast,
399. E'en when discovery's pain,
400. To Lindesay did at length unfold
401. The tale his village host had told,
402. At Gifford, to his train.
403. Nought of the Palmer says he there,
404. And nought of Constance, or of Clare:
405. The thoughts which broke his sleep, he seems
406. To mention but as feverish dreams.

407. XIX.

408. 'In vain,' said he, 'to rest I spread
409. My burning limbs, and couched my head:
410. Fantastic thoughts returned;
411. And, by their wild dominion led,
412. My heart within me burned.
413. So sore was the delirious goad,
414. I took my steed, and forth I rode,
415. And, as the moon shone bright and cold,
416. Soon reached the camp upon the wold.
417. The southern entrance I passed through,
418. And halted, and my bugle blew.
419. Methought an answer met my ear -
420. Yet was the blast so low and drear,
421. So hollow, and so faintly blown,
422. It might be echo of my own.

423. XX.

424. 'Thus judging, for a little space
425. I listened, ere I left the place;
426. But scarce could trust my eyes,
427. Nor yet can think they served me true,
428. When sudden in the ring I view,
429. In form distinct of shape and hue,
430. A mounted champion rise.
431. I've fought, Lord-Lion, many a day,
432. In single fight, and mixed affray,
433. And ever, I myself may say,
434. Have borne me as a knight;
435. But when this unexpected foe
436. Seemed starting from the gulf below,
437. I care not though the truth I show,
438. I trembled with affright;
439. And as I placed in rest my spear,
440. My hand so shook for very fear,
441. I scarce could couch it right.

442. XXI.

443. 'Why need my tongue the issue tell?
444. We ran our course-my charger fell;
445. What could he 'gainst the shock of hell?
446. I rolled upon the plain.
447. High o'er my head, with threatening hand,
448. The spectre took his naked brand -
449. Yet did the worst remain:
450. My dazzled eyes I upward cast -
451. Not opening hell itself could blast
452. Their sight, like what I saw!
453. Full on his face the moonbeam strook -
454. A face could never be mistook!
455. I knew the stern vindictive look,
456. And held my breath for awe.
457. I saw the face of one who, fled
458. To foreign climes, has long been dead -
459. I well believe the last;
460. For ne'er, from vizor raised, did stare
461. A human warrior, with a glare
462. So grimly and so ghast.
463. Thrice o'er my head he shook the blade;
464. But when to good Saint George I prayed,
465. The first time e'er I asked his aid,
466. He plunged it in the sheath;
467. And, on his courser mounting light,
468. He seemed to vanish from my sight;
469. The moonbeam drooped, and deepest night
470. Sunk down upon the heath.
471. 'Twere long to tell what cause I have
472. To know his face, that met me there,
473. Called by his hatred from the grave,
474. To cumber upper air;
475. Dead or alive, good cause had he
476. To be my mortal enemy.'

477. XXII.

478. Marvelled Sir David of the Mount;
479. Then, learned in story, 'gan recount
480. Such chance had happed of old,
481. When once, near Norham, there did fight
482. A spectre fell of fiendish might,
483. In likeness of a Scottish knight,
484. With Brian Bulmer bold,
485. And trained him nigh to disallow
486. The aid of his baptismal vow.
487. 'And such a phantom, too, 'tis said,
488. With Highland broadsword, targe, and plaid,
489. And fingers red with gore,
490. Is seen in Rothiemurcus glade,
491. Or where the sable pine-trees shade
492. Dark Tomantoul, and Auchnaslaid,
493. Dromunchty, or Glenmore.
494. And yet whate'er such legends say,
495. Of warlike demon, ghost, or fay,
496. On mountain, moor, or plain,
497. Spotless in faith, in bosom bold,
498. True son of chivalry should hold
499. These midnight terrors vain;
500. For seldom hath such spirit power
501. To harm, save in the evil hour,
502. When guilt we meditate within,
503. Or harbour unrepented sin.'
504. Lord Marmion turned him half aside,
505. And twice to clear his voice he tried,
506. Then pressed Sir David's hand -
507. But nought at length in answer said,
508. And here their farther converse stayed,
509. Each ordering that his band
510. Should bowne them with the rising day,
511. To Scotland's camp to take their way -
512. Such was the King's command.

513. XXIII.

514. Early they took Dunedin's road,
515. And I could trace each step they trode;
516. Hill, brook, nor dell, nor rock, nor stone,
517. Lies on the path to me unknown.
518. Much might it boast of storied lore;
519. But, passing such digression o'er,
520. Suffice it that their route was laid
521. Across the furzy hills of Braid,
522. They passed the glen and scanty rill,
523. And climbed the opposing bank, until
524. They gained the top of Blackford Hill.

525. XXIV.

526. Blackford! on whose uncultured breast,
527. Among the broom, and thorn, and whin,
528. A truant-boy, I sought the nest,
529. Or listed, as I lay at rest,
530. While rose on breezes thin,
531. The murmur of the city crowd,
532. And, from his steeple jangling loud,
533. Saint Giles's mingling din.
534. Now, from the summit to the plain,
535. Waves all the hill with yellow grain
536. And o'er the landscape as I look,
537. Nought do I see unchanged remain,
538. Save the rude cliffs and chiming brook.
539. To me they make a heavy moan,
540. Of early friendships past and gone.

541. XXV.

542. But different far the change has been,
543. Since Marmion, from the crown
544. Of Blackford, saw that martial scene
545. Upon the bent so brown:
546. Thousand pavilions, white as snow,
547. Spread all the Borough Moor below,
548. Upland, and dale, and down:-
549. A thousand, did I say? I ween,
550. Thousands on thousands there were seen,
551. That chequered all the heath between
552. The streamlet and the town;
553. In crossing ranks extending far,
554. Forming a camp irregular;
555. Oft giving way, where still there stood
556. Some relics of the old oak wood,
557. That darkly huge did intervene,
558. And tamed the glaring white with green:
559. In these extended lines there lay
560. A martial kingdom's vast array.

561. XXVI.

562. For from Hebudes, dark with rain,
563. To eastern Lodon's fertile plain,
564. And from the southern Redswire edge,
565. To farthest Rosse's rocky ledge;
566. From west to east, from south to north.
567. Scotland sent all her warriors forth.
568. Marmion might hear the mingled hum
569. Of myriads up the mountain come;
570. The horses' tramp, and tingling clank,
571. Where chiefs reviewed their vassal rank,
572. And charger's shrilling neigh;
573. And see the shifting lines advance
574. While frequent flashed, from shield and lance,
575. The sun's reflected ray.

576. XXVII.

577. Thin curling in the morning air,
578. The wreaths of failing smoke declare,
579. To embers now the brands decayed,
580. Where the night-watch their fires had made.
581. They saw, slow rolling on the plain,
582. Full many a baggage-cart and wain,
583. And dire artillery's clumsy car,
584. By sluggish oxen tugged to war;
585. And there were Borthwick's Sisters Seven,
586. And culverins which France had given.
587. Ill-omened gift! the guns remain
588. The conqueror's spoil on Flodden plain.

589. XXVIII.

590. Nor marked they less, where in the air
591. A thousand streamers flaunted fair;
592. Various in shape, device, and hue,
593. Green, sanguine, purple, red, and blue,
594. Broad, narrow, swallow-tailed, and square,
595. Scroll, pennon, pensil, bandrol, there
596. O'er the pavilions flew.
597. Highest and midmost, was descried
598. The royal banner floating wide;
599. The staff, a pine-tree strong and straight,
600. Pitched deeply in a massive stone -
601. Which still in memory is shown -
602. Yet bent beneath the standard's weight
603. Whene'er the western wind unrolled,
604. With toil, the huge and cumbrous fold,
605. And gave to view the dazzling field,
606. Where, in proud Scotland's royal shield,
607. The ruddy lion ramped in gold.

608. XXIX.

609. Lord Marmion viewed the landscape bright -
610. He viewed it with a chief's delight -
611. Until within him burned his heart
612. And lightning from his eye did part,
613. As on the battle-day;
614. Such glance did falcon never dart,
615. When stooping on his prey.
616. 'Oh! well, Lord Lion, hast thou said,
617. Thy king from warfare to dissuade
618. Were but a vain essay:
619. For, by Saint George, were that host mine,
620. Not power infernal, nor divine.
621. Should once to peace my soul incline,
622. Till I had dimmed their armour's shine
623. In glorious battle-fray!'
624. Answered the bard, of milder mood -
625. 'Fair is the sight-and yet 'twere good
626. That kings would think withal,
627. When peace and wealth their land has blessed,
628. 'Tis better to sit still at rest,
629. Than rise, perchance to fall.'

630. XXX.

631. Still on the spot Lord Marmion stayed,
632. For fairer scene he ne'er surveyed.
633. When sated with the martial show
634. That peopled all the plain below,
635. The wandering eye could o'er it go,
636. And mark the distant city glow
637. With gloomy splendour red;
638. For on the smoke-wreaths, huge and slow,
639. That round her sable turrets flow,
640. The morning beams were shed,
641. And tinged them with a lustre proud,
642. Like that which streaks a thunder-cloud.
643. Such dusky grandeur clothed the height,
644. Where the huge castle holds its state,
645. And all the steep slope down,
646. Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky,
647. Piled deep and massy, close and high,
648. Mine own romantic town!
649. But northward far, with purer blaze,
650. On Ochil mountains fell the rays,
651. And as each heathy top they kissed,
652. It gleamed a purple amethyst.
653. Yonder the shores of Fife you saw;
654. Here Preston Bay and Berwick Law:
655. And, broad between them rolled,
656. The gallant Frith the eye might note,
657. Whose islands on its bosom float,
658. Like emeralds chased in gold.
659. Fitz Eustace' heart felt closely pent;
660. As if to give his rapture vent,
661. The spur he to his charger lent,
662. And raised his bridle hand,
663. And making demivolte in air,
664. Cried, 'Where's the coward that would not dare
665. To fight for such a land!'
666. The Lindesay smiled his joy to see;
667. Nor Marmion's frown repressed his glee.

668. XXXI.

669. Thus while they looked, a flourish proud,
670. Where mingled trump and clarion loud,
671. And fife and kettle-drum,
672. And sackbut deep, and psaltery,
673. And war-pipe with discordant cry,
674. And cymbal clattering to the sky,
675. Making wild music bold and high,
676. Did up the mountain come;
677. The whilst the bells, with distant chime,
678. Merrily tolled the hour of prime,
679. And thus the Lindesay spoke:
680. 'Thus clamour still the war-notes when
681. The King to mass his way has ta'en,
682. Or to St. Katharine's of Sienne,
683. Or chapel of Saint Rocque.
684. To you they speak of martial fame;
685. But me remind of peaceful game,
686. When blither was their cheer,
687. Thrilling in Falkland woods the air,
688. In signal none his steed should spare,
689. But strive which foremost might repair
690. To the downfall of the deer.

691. XXXII.

692. 'Nor less,' he said, 'when looking forth,
693. I view yon empress of the North
694. Sit on her hilly throne;
695. Her palace's imperial bowers,
696. Her castle, proof to hostile powers,
697. Her stately halls and holy towers -
698. Nor less,' he said, 'I moan,
699. To think what woe mischance may bring,
700. And how these merry bells may ring
701. The death-dirge of our gallant king;
702. Or with the 'larum call
703. The burghers forth to watch and ward,
704. 'Gainst Southern sack and fires to guard
705. Dunedin's leaguered wall.
706. But not for my presaging thought,
707. Dream conquest sure, or cheaply bought!
708. Lord Marmion, I say nay:
709. God is the guider of the field,
710. He breaks the champion's spear and shield -
711. But thou thyself shalt say,
712. When joins yon host in deadly stowre,
713. That England's dames must weep in bower,
714. Her monks the death-mass sing;
715. For never saw'st thou such a power
716. Led on by such a king.'
717. And now, down winding to the plain,
718. The barriers of the camp they gain,
719. And there they made a stay.
720. There stays the minstrel, till he fling
721. His hand o'er every Border string,
722. And fit his harp the pomp to sing,
723. Of Scotland's ancient court and king,
724. In the succeeding lay.
