1. Farewell! Farewell! the voice you hear,
2. Has left its last soft tone with you,-
3. Its next must join the seaward cheer,
4. And shout among the shouting crew.

5. The accents which I scarce could form
6. Beneath your frown's controlling check,
7. Must give the word, above the storm,
8. To cut the mast, and clear the wreck.

9. The timid eye I dared not raise,-
10. The hand, that shook when press'd to thine,
11. Must point the guns upon the chase-
12. Must bid the deadly cutlass shine.

13. To all I love, or hope, or fear,-
14. Honour, or own, a long adieu!
15. To all that life has soft and dear,
16. Farewell! save memory of you!
