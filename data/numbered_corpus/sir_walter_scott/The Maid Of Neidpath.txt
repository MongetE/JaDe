1. O lovers’ eyes are sharp to see,
2. And lovers’ ears in hearing;
3. And love, in life’s extremity,
4. Can lend an hour of cheering.
5. Disease had been in Mary’s bower
6. And slow decay from mourning,
7. Though now she sits on Neidpath’s tower
8. To watch her Love’s returning.

9. All sunk and dim her eyes so bright,
10. Her form decay’d by pining,
11. Till through her wasted hand, at night,
12. You saw the taper shining.
13. By fits a sultry hectic hue
14. Across her cheek was flying;
15. By fits so ashy pale she grew
16. Her maidens thought her dying.

17. Yet keenest powers to see and hear
18. Seem’d in her frame residing;
19. Before the watch-dog prick’d his ear
20. She heard her lover’s riding;
21. Ere scarce a distant form was kenn’d
22. She knew and waved to greet him,
23. And o’er the battlement did bend
24. As on the wing to meet him.

25. He came—he pass’d—an heedless gaze
26. As o’er some stranger glancing:
27. Her welcome, spoke in faltering phrase,
28. Lost in his courser’s prancing—
29. The castle-arch, whose hollow tone
30. Returns each whisper spoken,
31. Could scarcely catch the feeble moan
32. Which told her heart was broken.
