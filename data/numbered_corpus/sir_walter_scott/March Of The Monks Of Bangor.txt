1. When the heathen trumpet's clang
2. Round beleaguer'd Chester rang,
3. Veiled nun and friar grey
4. March'd from Bangor's fair Abbaye;
5. High their holy anthem sounds,
6. Cestria's vale the hymn rebounds,
7. Floating down the silvan Dee,
8. O miserere, Domine!
9. On the long procession goes,
10. Glory round their crosses glows,
11. And the Virgin-mother mild
12. In their peaceful banner smiled;
13. Who could think such saintly band
14. Doom'd to feel unhallow'd hand?
15. Such was the Divine decree,
16. O miserere, Domine!
17. Bands that masses only sung,
18. Hands that censers only swung,
19. Met the northern bow and bill,
20. Heard the war-cry wild and shrill:
21. Woe to Brockmael's feeble hand
22. Woe to Olfrid's bloody brand,
23. Woe to Saxon cruelty,
24. O miserere, Domine!
25. Weltering amid warriors slain,
26. Spurn'd by steeds with bloody mane,
27. Slaughter'd down by heathen blade,
28. Bangor's peaceful monks are laid:
29. Word of parting rest unspoke,
30. Mass unsung, and bread unbroke;
31. For their souls for charity,
32. O miserere, Domine!
33. Bangor! o'er the murder wail!
34. Long thy ruins told the tale,
35. Shatter'd towers and broken arch
36. Long recall'd the woeful march:
37. On thy shrine no tapers burn,
38. Never shall thy priests return;
39. The pilgrim sighs and sings for thee,
40. O miserere, Domine!
