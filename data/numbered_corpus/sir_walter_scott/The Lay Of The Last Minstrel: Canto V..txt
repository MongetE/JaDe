1. I
2. Call it not vain;-they do not err,
3. Who say, that when the Poet dies,
4. Mute Nature mourns her worshipper,
5. And celebrates his obsequies:
6. Who say, tall cliff and cavern lone
7. For the departed Bard make moan;
8. That mountains weep in crystal rill;
9. That flowers in tears of balm distill;
10. Through his lov'd groves that breezes sigh,
11. And oaks, in deeper groan, reply;
12. And rivers teach their rushing wave
13. To murmur dirges round his grave

14. II
15. Not that, in sooth, o'er mortal urn
16. Those things inanimate can mourn;
17. But that the stream, the wood, the gale
18. Is vocal with the plaintive wail
19. Of those, who, else forgotten long,
20. Liv'd in the poet's faithful song,
21. And with the poet's parting breath,
22. Whose memory feels a second death.
23. The Maid's pale shade, who wails her lot,
24. That love, true love, should be forgot,
25. From rose and hawthorn shakes the tear
26. Upon the gentle Minstrel's bier:
27. The phantom Knight, his glory fled,
28. Mourns o'er the field he heap'd with dead;
29. Mounts the wild blast that sweeps amain,
30. And shrieks along the battle-plain.
31. The Chief, whose antique crownlet long
32. Still sparkled in the feudal song,
33. Now, from the mountain's misty throne,
34. Sees, in the thanedom once his own,
35. His ashes undistinguish'd lie,
36. His place, his power, his memory die:
37. His groans the lonely caverns fill,
38. His tears of rage impel the rill:
39. All mourn the Minstrel's harp unstrung,
40. Their name unknown, their praise unsung.

41. III
42. Scarcely the hot assault was staid,
43. The terms of truce were scarcely made,
44. When they could spy, from Branksome's towers,
45. The advancing march of martial powers.
46. Thick clouds of dust afar appear'd,
47. And trampling steeds were faintly heard;
48. Bright spears, above the columns dun,
49. Glanced momentary to the sun;
50. And feudal banners fair display'd
51. The bands that moved to Branksome's aid.

52. IV
53. Vails not to tell each hardy clan,
54. From the fair Middle Marches came;
55. The Bloody Heart blaz'd in the van,
56. Announcing Douglas, dreaded name!
57. Vails not to tell what steeds did spurn,
58. Where the Seven Spears of Wedderburne
59. Their men in battle-order set;
60. And Swinton laid the lance in rest,
61. That tamed of yore the sparkling crest
62. Of Clarence's Plantagenet.
63. Nor list I say what hundreds more,
64. From the rich Merse and Lammermore,
65. And Tweed's fair borders to the war,
66. Beneath the crest of Old Dunbar.
67. And Hepburn's mingled banners come,
68. Down the steep mountain glittering far
69. And shouting still, 'A Home! a Home!'

70. V
71. Now squire and knight, from Branksome sent,
72. On many a courteous message went;
73. To every chief and lord they paid
74. Meet thanks for prompt and powerful aid:
75. And told them,-how a truce was made.
76. And how a day of fight was ta'en
77. 'Twixt Musgrave and stout Deloraine;
78. And how the Ladye pray'd them dear,
79. That all would stay the fight to see,
80. And deign, in love and courtesy,
81. To taste of Branksome cheer.
82. Nor, while they bade to feast each Scot,
83. Were England's noble Lords forgot
84. Himself, the hoary Seneschal
85. Rode forth, in seemly terms to call
86. Those gallant foes to Branksome Hall.
87. Accepted Howard, than whom knight
88. Was never dubb'd more bold in fight;
89. Nor, when from war and armor free,
90. More fam'd for stately courtesy:
91. But angry Dacre rather chose
92. In his pavilion to repose.

93. VI
94. Now, noble Dame, perchance you ask
95. How these two hostile armies met?
96. Deeming it were no easy task
97. To keep the truce which here was set;
98. Where martial spirits, all on fire,
99. Breathed only blood and mortal ire.
100. By mutual inroads, mutual blows,
101. By habit, and by nation, foes,
102. They met on Teviot's strand;
103. They met and sate them mingled down,
104. Without a threat, without a frown,
105. As brothers meet in foreign land:
106. The hands the spear that lately grasp'd,
107. Still in the mailed gauntlet clasp'd,
108. Were interchang'd in greeting dear;
109. Visors were raised, and faces shown,
110. And many a friend, to friend made known,
111. Partook of social cheer.
112. Some drove the jolly bowl about;
113. With dice and draughts some chas'd the day;
114. And some, with many a merry shout,
115. In riot revelry, and rout,
116. Pursued the foot-ball play.

117. VII
118. Yet, be it known, had bugles blown,
119. Or sign of war been seen,
120. Those bands so fair together rang'd,
121. Those hands, so frankly interchang'd,
122. Had dyed with gore the green:
123. The merry shout by Teviot-side
124. Had sunk in war-cries wild and wide,
125. And in the groan of death;
126. And whingers, now in friendship bare
127. The social meal to part and share,
128. Had found a bloody sheath.
129. 'Twixt truce and war, such sudden change
130. Was not infrequent, nor held strange,
131. In the old Border-day:
132. But yet on Branksome's towers and town,
133. In peaceful merriment, sunk down
134. The sun's declining ray.

135. VIII
136. The blithsome signs of wassel gay
137. Decay'd not with the dying day:
138. Soon through the lattic'd windows tall
139. Of lofty Branksome's lordly hall,
140. Divided square by shafts of stone,
141. Huge flakes of ruddy lustre shone
142. Nor less the gilded rafters rang
143. With merry harp and beakers' clang:
144. And frequent, on the darkening plain,
145. Loud hollo, whoop, or whistle ran,
146. As bands, their stragglers to regain
147. Give the shrill watchword of their clan;
148. And revellers, o'er their bowls, proclaim
149. Douglas or Dacre's conquering name.

150. IX
151. Less frequent heard, and fainter still
152. At length the various clamors died:
153. And you might hear, from Branksome hill
154. No sound but Teviot's rushing tide;
155. Save when the changing sentinel
156. The challenge of his watch could tell;
157. And save where, through the dark profound,
158. The clanging axe and hammer's sound
159. Rung from the nether lawn;
160. For many a busy hand toil'd there,
161. Strong pales to shape, and beams to square,
162. The lists' dread barriers to prepare
163. Against the morrow's dawn.

164. X
165. Margaret from hall did soon retreat,
166. Despite the Dame's reproving eye;
167. Nor mark'd she as she left her seat,
168. Full many a stifled sigh;
169. For many a noble warrior strove
170. To win the Flower of Teviot's love,
171. And many a bold ally.
172. With throbbing head and anxious heart,
173. All in her lonely bower apart,
174. In broken sleep she lay:
175. Betimes from silken couch she rose
176. While yet the banner'd hosts repose,
177. She view'd the dawning day:
178. Of all the hundreds sunk to rest
179. First woke the loveliest and the best.

180. XI
181. She gaz'd upon the inner court,
182. Which in the tower's tall shadow lay;
183. Where coursers' clang, and stamp, and snort
184. Had rung the livelong yesterday;
185. Now still as death; till stalking slow -
186. The jingling spurs announc'd his tread -
187. A stately warrior pass'd below;
188. But when he rais'd his plumed head -
189. Bless'd Mary! can it be?
190. Secure, as if in Ousenam bowers,
191. He walks through Branksome's hostile towers
192. With fearless step and free.
193. She dar'd not sign, she dar'd not speak -
194. Oh! if one page's slumbers break,
195. His blood the price must pay!
196. Not all the pearls Queen Mary wears
197. Not Margaret's yet more precious tears,
198. Shall buy his life a day.

199. XII
200. Yet was his hazard small; for well
201. You may bethink you of the spell
202. Of that sly urchin page;
203. This to his lord he did impart,
204. And made him seem, by glamour art,
205. A knight from Hermitage.
206. Unchalleng'd thus, the warder's post,
207. The court, unchalleng'd, thus he cross'd,
208. For all the vassalage:
209. But O! what magic's quaint disguise
210. Could blind fair Margaret s azure eyes!
211. She started from her seat;
212. While with surprise and fear she strove,
213. And both could scarcely master love -
214. Lord Henry's at her feet.

215. XIII
216. Oft have I mus'd what purpose bad
217. That foul malicious urchin had
218. To bring this meeting round;
219. For happy love's a heavenly sight,
220. And by a vile malignant sprite
221. In such no joy is found;
222. And oft I've deem'd perchance he thought
223. Their erring passion might have wrought
224. Sorrow, and sin, and shame;
225. And death to Cranstoun's gallant Knight
226. And to the gentle ladye bright
227. Disgrace and loss of fame.
228. But earthly spirit could not tell
229. The heart of them that lov'd so well.
230. True love's the gift which God has given
231. To man alone beneath the heaven:
232. It is not fantasy's hot fire,
233. Whose wishes, soon as granted, fly;
234. It liveth not in fierce desire,
235. With dead desire it doth not die;
236. It is the secret sympathy,
237. The silver link, the silken tie,
238. Which heart to heart, and mind to mind
239. In body and in soul can bind.
240. Now leave we Margaret and her Knight,
241. To tell you of the approaching fight.

242. XIV
243. Their warning blasts the bugles blew,
244. The pipe's shrill port arous'd each clan;
245. In haste, the deadly strife to view,
246. The trooping warriors eager ran:
247. Thick round the lists their lances stood
248. Like blasted pines in Ettric wood;
249. To Branksome many a look they threw,
250. The combatants' approach to view,
251. And bandied many a word of boast
252. About the knight each favor'd most.

253. XV
254. Meantime, full anxious was the Dame;
255. For now arose disputed claim
256. Of who should fight for Deloraine,
257. 'Twixt Harden and 'twixt Thirlestaine
258. They 'gan to reckon kin and rent,
259. And frowning brow on brow was bent;
260. But yet not long the strife-for, lo!
261. Himself, the Knight of Deloraine,
262. Strong, as it seem'd, and free from pain
263. In armor sheath'd from top to toe,
264. Appear'd and crav'd the combat due.
265. The Dame her charm successful knew,
266. And the fierce chiefs their claims withdrew.

267. XVI
268. When for the lists they sought the plain,
269. The stately Ladye's silken rein
270. Did noble Howard hold;
271. Unarmed by her side he walk'd,
272. And much, in courteous phrase, they talk'd
273. Of feats of arms of old.
274. Costly his garb; his Flemish ruff
275. Fell o'er his doublet, shap'd of buff,
276. With satin slash'd and lin'd;
277. Tawny his boot, and gold his spur,
278. His cloak was all of Poland fur,
279. His hose with silver twin'd;
280. His Bilboa blade, by Marchmen felt,
281. Hung in a broad and studded belt;
282. Hence, in rude phrase, the Borderers still
283. Call'd noble Howard, Belted Will.

284. XVII
285. Behind Lord Howard and the Dame,
286. Fair Margaret on her palfrey came,
287. Whose foot-cloth swept the ground:
288. White was her wimple, and her veil,
289. And her loose locks a chaplet pale
290. Of whitest roses bound;
291. The lordly Angus, by her side,
292. In courtesy to cheer her tried;
293. Without his aid, her hand in vain
294. Had strove to guide her broider'd rein.
295. He deem'd she shudder'd at the sight
296. Of warriors met for mortal fight;
297. But cause of terror, all unguess'd,
298. Was fluttering in her gentle breast,
299. When, in their chairs of crimson plac'd,
300. The Dame and she the barriers grac'd.

301. XVIII
302. Prize of the field, the young Buccleuch,
303. An English knight led forth to view;
304. Scarce rued the boy his present plight,
305. So much he long'd to see the fight.
306. Within the lists, in knightly pride,
307. High Home and haughty Dacre ride;
308. Their leading staffs of steel they wield
309. As marshals of the mortal field;
310. While to each knight their care assign'd
311. Like vantage of the sun and wind.
312. Then heralds hoarse did loud proclaim,
313. In King and Queen and Warden's name
314. That none, while lasts the strife,
315. Should dare, by look, or sign, or word,
316. Aid to a champion to afford,
317. On peril of his life;
318. And not a breath the silence broke,
319. Till thus the alternate Heralds spoke:

320. XIX
321. English Herald
322. 'Here standeth Richard of Musgrave,
323. Good knight and true, and freely born,
324. Amends from Deloraine to crave,
325. For foul despiteous scathe and scorn.
326. He sayeth that William of Deloraine
327. Is traitor false by Border laws;
328. This with his sword he will maintain,
329. So help him God, and his good cause!'

330. XX
331. Scottish Herald
332. 'Here standeth William of Deloraine,
333. Good knight and true, of noble strain,
334. Who sayeth that foul treason's stain,
335. Since he bore arms, ne'er soil'd his coat;
336. And that, so help him God above!
337. He will on Musgrave's body prove,
338. He lies most foully in his throat.'

339. Lord Dacre
340. 'Forward, brave champions, to the fight!
341. Sound trumpets!' -

342. Lord Home
343. - 'God defend the right!' -
344. Then, Teviot! how thine echoes rang,
345. When bugle-sound and trumpet-clang
346. Let loose the martial foes,
347. And in mid list, with shield pois'd high,
348. And measur'd step and wary eye,
349. The combatants did close.

350. XXI
351. Ill would it suit your gentle ear,
352. Ye lovely listeners, to hear
353. How to the axe the helms did sound,
354. And blood pour'd down from many a wound;
355. For desperate was the strife and long,
356. And either warrior fierce and strong.
357. But, were each dame a listening knight,
358. I well could tell how warriors fight!
359. For I have seen war's lightning flashing,
360. Seen the claymore with bayonet clashing,
361. Seen through red blood the war-horse dashing,
362. And scorn'd, amid the reeling strife,
363. To yield a step for death or life.

364. XXII
365. 'Tis done, 'tis done! that fatal blow
366. Has stretch d him on the bloody plain;
367. He strives to rise-brave Musgrave, no!
368. Thence never shalt thou rise again!
369. He chokes in blood! some friendly hand
370. Undo the visor's barred band,
371. Unfix the gorget's iron clasp,
372. And give him room for life to gasp!
373. O, bootless aid! haste, holy Friar,
374. Haste, ere the sinner shall expire!
375. Of all his guilt let him be shriven,
376. And smooth his path from earth to heaven!

377. XXIII
378. In haste the holy Friar sped
379. His naked foot was dyed with red
380. As through the lists he ran;
381. Unmindful of the shouts on high,
382. That hail'd the conqueror's victory,
383. He rais'd the dying man;
384. Loose wav'd his silver beard and hair,
385. As o'er him he kneel'd down in prayer;
386. And still the crucifix on high
387. He holds before his darkening eye;
388. And still he bends an anxious ear
389. His faltering penitence to hear;
390. Still props him from the bloody sod,
391. Still, even when soul and body part,
392. Pours ghostly comfort on his heart,
393. And bids him trust in God.
394. Unheard he prays; the death pang's o'er!
395. Richard of Musgrave breathes no more.

396. XXIV
397. As if exhausted in the fight,
398. Or musing o'er the piteous sight,
399. The silent victor stands;
400. His beaver did he not unclasp,
401. Mark'd not the shouts, felt not the grasp
402. Of gratulating hands.
403. When lo! strange cries of wild surprise,
404. Mingled with seeming terror, rise
405. Among the Scottish bands;
406. And all amid the throng'd array,
407. In panic haste gave open way
408. To a half-naked ghastly man
409. Who downward from the castle ran:
410. He cross'd the barriers at a bound,
411. And wild and haggard look'd around,
412. As dizzy, and in pain;
413. And all, upon the armed ground
414. Knew William of Deloraine!
415. Each ladye sprung from seat with speed;
416. Vaulted each marshal from his steed;
417. 'And who art thou,' they cried,
418. 'Who hast this battle fought and won?'
419. His plumed helm was soon undone -
420. 'Cranstoun of Teviot-side!
421. For this fair prize I've fought and won.'
422. And to the Ladye led her son.

423. XXV
424. Full oft the rescued boy she kiss'd,
425. And often press'd him to her breast;
426. For, under all her dauntless show,
427. Her heart had throbb'd at every blow;
428. Yet not Lord Cranstoun deign'd she greet,
429. Though low he kneeled at her feet.
430. Me lists not tell what words were made,
431. What Douglas, Home, and Howard said -
432. For Howard was a generous foe -
433. And how the clan united pray'd
434. The Ladye would the feud forego,
435. And deign to bless the nuptial hour
436. Of Cranstoun's Lord and Teviot's Flower.

437. XXVI
438. She look'd to river, look'd to hill,
439. Thought on the Spirit's prophecy,
440. Then broke her silence stern and still -
441. 'Not you, but Fate, has vanquish'd me;
442. Their influence kindly stars may shower
443. On Teviot's tide and Branksome's tower,
444. For pride is quell'd, and love is free.'
445. She took fair Margaret by the hand,
446. Who, breathless, trembling, scarce might stand;
447. That hand to Cranstoun's lord gave she:
448. 'As I am true to thee and thine,
449. Do thou be true to me and mine!
450. This clasp of love our bond shall be;
451. For this is your betrothing day,
452. And all these noble lords shall stay
453. To grace it with their company.'

454. XXVII
455. All as they left the listed plain
456. Much of the story she did gain
457. How Cranstoun fought with Deloraine
458. And of his page, and of the Book
459. Which from the wounded knight he took;
460. And how he sought her castle high,
461. That morn, by help of gramarye;
462. How, in Sir William's armor dight,
463. Stolen by his page, while slept the knight,
464. He took on him the single fight.
465. But half his tale he left unsaid
466. And linger'd till he join'd the maid.
467. Car'd not the Ladye to betray
468. Her mystic arts in view of day;
469. But well she thought, ere midnight came
470. Of that strange page the pride to tame
471. From his foul hands the Book to save,
472. And send it back to Michael's grave.
473. Needs not to tell each tender word
474. 'Twixt Margaret and twixt Cranstoun s lord;
475. Nor how she told of former woes,
476. And how her bosom fell and rose,
477. While he and Musgrave bandied blows
478. Needs not these lovers' joys to tell:
479. One day, fair maids, you'll know them well.

480. XXVIII
481. William of Deloraine some chance
482. Had waken'd from his deathlike trance;
483. And taught that, in the listed plain
484. Another, in his arms and shield
485. Against fierce Musgrave axe did wield
486. Under the name of Deloraine.
487. Hence to the field unarm'd he ran,
488. And hence his presence scar'd the clan,
489. Who held him for some fleeting wraith
490. And not a man of blood and breath.
491. Not much this new ally he lov'd,
492. Yet, when he saw what hap had prov'd
493. He greeted him right heartilie:
494. He would not waken old debate,
495. For he was void of rancorous hate,
496. Though rude, and scant of courtesy;
497. In raids he spilt but seldom blood,
498. Unless when men-at-arms withstood,
499. Or, as was meet, for deadly feud
500. He ne'er bore grudge for stalwart blow,
501. Ta'en in fair fight from gallant foe:
502. And so 'twas seen of him, e'en now,
503. When on dead Musgrave he look d down;
504. Grief darken'd on his rugged brow,
505. Though half disguised with a frown;
506. And thus, while sorrow bent his head,
507. His foeman's epitaph he made.

508. XXIX
509. 'Now, Richard Musgrave, liest thou here!
510. I ween, my deadly enemy
511. For, if I slew thy brother dear,
512. Thou slew'st a sister's son to me;
513. And when I lay in dungeon dark
514. Of Naworth Castle, long months three,
515. Till ransom'd for a thousand mark,
516. Dark Musgrave, it was 'long of thee.
517. And, Musgrave, could our fight be tried,
518. And thou wert now alive as I,
519. No mortal man should us divide,
520. Till one, or both of us, did die:
521. Yet, rest thee God! for well I know
522. I ne'er shall find a nobler foe.
523. In all the northern counties here,
524. Whose word is Snaffle, spur, and spear,
525. Thou wert the best to follow gear!
526. 'Twas pleasure, as we look'd behind,
527. To see how thou the chase could'st wind,
528. Cheer the dark blood-hound on his way
529. And with the bugle rouse the fray!
530. I'd give the lands of Deloraine
531. Dark Musgrave were alive again.'

532. XXX
533. So mourn'd he, till Lord Dacre's band
534. Were bowning back to Cumberland.
535. They rais'd brave Musgrave from the field,
536. And laid him on his bloody shield;
537. On levell'd lances, four and four,
538. By turns, the noble burden bore.
539. Before, at times, upon the gale,
540. Was heard the Minstrel s plaintive wail;
541. Behind, four priests, in sable stole,
542. Sung requiem for the warrior's soul:
543. Around, the horsemen slowly rode;
544. With trailing pikes the spearmen trode;
545. And thus the gallant knight they bore
546. Through Liddesdale to Leven's shore;
547. Thence to Holme Coltrame's lofty nave,
548. And laid him in his father's grave.
549. The harp's wild notes, though hush'd the song,
550. The mimic march of death prolong;
551. Now seems it far, and now a-near,
552. Now meets, and now eludes the ear;
553. Now seems some mountainside to sweep,
554. Now faintly dies in valley deep;
555. Seems now as if the Minstrel's wail,
556. Now the sad requiem, loads the gale;
557. Last, o'er the warrior's closing grave,
558. Rung the full choir in choral stave.

559. After due pause, they bade him tell,
560. Why he, who touch'd the harp so well,
561. Should thus, with ill-rewarded toil,
562. Wander a poor and thankless soil,
563. When the more generous Southern land
564. Would well requite his skillful hand.

565. The aged Harper howsoe'er
566. His only friend, his harp, was dear,
567. Lik'd not to hear it rank'd so high
568. Above his flowing poesy:
569. Less lik'd he still that scornful jeer
570. Mispris'd the land he lov'd so dear;
571. High was the sound, as thus again
572. The Bard resum'd his minstrel strain.
