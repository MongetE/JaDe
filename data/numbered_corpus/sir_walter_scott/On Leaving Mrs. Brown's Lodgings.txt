1. So goodbye, Mrs. Brown,
2. I am going out of town,
3. Over dale, over down,
4. Where bugs bite not,
5. Where lodgers fight not,
6. Where below your chairmen drink not,
7. Where beside your gutters stink not;
8. But all is fresh and clean and gay,
9. And merry lambkins sport and play,
10. And they toss with rakes uncommonly short hay,
11. Which looks as if it had been sown only the other day,
12. And where oats are twenty-five shillings a boll, they say;
13. But all's one for that, since I must and will away.
