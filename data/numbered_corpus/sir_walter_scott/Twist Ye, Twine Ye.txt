1. Twist ye, twine ye! even so,
2. Mingle shades of joy and woe,
3. Hope, and fear, and peace, and strife,
4. In the thread of human life.

5. While the mystic twist is spinning,
6. And the infant's life beginning,
7. Dimly seen through twilingt bending,
8. Lo, what varied shapes attending!

9. Passions wild, and follies vain,
10. Pleasures soon exchanged for pain;
11. Dount, and jealousy, and fear,
12. In the magic dance appear.

13. Now they wax, and now they dwindle,
14. Whirling with the whirling spindle.
15. Twist ye, twine ye! even so,
16. Mingle human bliss and woe.
