1. Waken, lords and ladies gay,
2. On the mountain dawns the day;
3. All the jolly chase is here
4. With hawk and horse and hunting-spear,
5. Hounds are in their couples yelling,
6. Hawks are whistling, horns are knelling,
7. Merrily, merrily mingle they
8. Waken, lords and ladies gay.

9. Waken, lords and ladies gay,
10. The mist has left the mountain gray;
11. Springlets in the dawn are steaming,
12. Diamonds on the brake are gleaming;
13. And foresters have busy been
14. To track the buck in thicket green;
15. Now we come to chant our lay,
16. Waken, lords and ladies gay.

17. Waken, lords and ladies gay,
18. To the greenwood haste away;
19. We can show you where he lies,
20. Fleet of foot and tall of size;
21. We can show the marks he made
22. When 'gainst the oak his antlers fray'd;
23. You shall see him brought to bay
24. Waken, lords and ladies gay.

25. Louder, louder chant the lay,
26. Waken, lords and ladies gay!
27. Tell them youth and mirth and glee
28. Run a course as well as we;
29. Time, stern huntsman! who can balk,
30. Staunch as hound and fleet as hawk:
31. Think of this, and rise with day,
32. Gentle lords and ladies gay!
