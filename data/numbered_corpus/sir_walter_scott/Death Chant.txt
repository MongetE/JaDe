1. Viewless essence, thin and bare,
2. Well nigh melted into air,
3. Still with fondness hovering near
4. The earthly form thou once didst wear,

5. Pause upon thy pinion's flight;
6. Be thy course to left or right,
7. Be thou doomed to soar or sink,
8. Pause upon the awful brink.

9. To avenge the deed expelling
10. Thee untimely from thy dwelling,
11. Mystic force thou shalt retain
12. O'er the blood and o'er the brain.

13. When the form thou shalt espy
14. That darken'd on thy closing eye,
15. When the footstep thou shalt hear
16. That thrill'd upon thy dying ear,

17. Then strange sympathies shall wake,
18. The flesh shall thrill, the nerves shall quake,
19. The wounds renew their clotter'd flood,
20. And every drop cry blood for blood!
