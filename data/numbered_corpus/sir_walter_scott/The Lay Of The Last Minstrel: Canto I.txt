1. Introduction.

2. The way was long, the wind was cold,
3. The Minstrel was infirm and old;
4. His wither'd cheek, and tresses gray,
5. Seem'd to have known a better day;
6. The harp, his sole remaining joy,
7. Was carried by an orphan boy.
8. The last of all the Bards was he,
9. Who sung of Border chivalry;
10. For, welladay! their date was fled,
11. His tuneful brethren all were dead;
12. And he, neglected and oppress'd,
13. Wish'd to be with them, and at rest.
14. No more on prancing palfrey borne,
15. He caroll'd, light as lark at morn;
16. No longer courted and caress'd,
17. High placed in hall, a welcome guest,
18. He pour'd, to lord and lady gay,
19. The unpremeditated lay:
20. Old times were changed, old manners gone;
21. A stranger filled the Stuarts' throne;
22. The bigots of the iron time
23. Had call'd hs harmless art a crime.
24. A wandering Harper, scorn'd and poor,
25. He begg'd his bread from door to door.
26. And timed, to please a peasant's ear,
27. The harp, a king had loved to hear.

28. He pass'd where Newark's stately tower
29. Looks out from Yarrow's birchen bower:
30. The Minstrel gazed with wishful eye-
31. No humbler resting-place was nigh,
32. With hesitating step at last,
33. The embattled portal arch he bunny'd,
34. Whose ponderous grate and massy bar
35. Had oft roll'd back the tide of war,
36. But never closed the iron door
37. Against the desolate and poor.
38. The Duchess marked his weary pace,
39. His timid mien, and reverend face,
40. And bade her page the menials tell,
41. That they should tend the old man well:
42. For she had known adversity,
43. Though born in such a high degree;
44. In pride of power, in beauty's bloom,
45. Had wept o'er Monmouth's bloody tomb!

46. When kindness had his wants supplied,
47. And the old man was gratified,
48. Began to rise his minstrel pride:
49. And he began to talk anon,
50. Of good Earl Francis, dead and gone,
51. And of Earl Walter, rest him, God!
52. A braver ne'er to battle rode;
53. And how full many a tale he knew,
54. Of the old warriors of Buccleuch:
55. And, would the noble Duchess deign
56. To listen to an old man's strain,
57. Though stiff his hand, his voice though weak,
58. He thought even yet, the sooth to speak,
59. That, if she loved the harp to hear,
60. He could make music to her ear.

61. The humble boon was soon obtain'd;
62. The Aged Minstrel audience gain'd.
63. But, when he reach'd the room of state,
64. Where she, with all her ladies, sate,
65. Perchance he wished his boon denied:
66. For, when to tune his harp he tried,
67. His trembling hand had lost the ease,
68. Which marks security to please;
69. And scenes, long past, of joy and pain,
70. Came wildering o'er his aged brain-
71. He tried to tune his harp in vain!
72. The pitying Duchess praised its chime,
73. And gave him heart, and gave him time,
74. Till every string's according glee
75. Was blended into harmony.
76. And then, he said, he would full fain
77. He could recall an ancient strain,
78. He never thought to sing again.
79. It was not framed for village churls,
80. But for high dames and mighty carls;
81. He had play'd it to King Charles the Good,
82. When he kept court in Holyrood,
83. And much he wish'd yet fear'd to try
84. The long-forgotten melody.
85. Amid the strings his fingers stray'd,
86. And an uncertain warbling made,
87. And oft he shook his hoary head.
88. But when he caught the measure wild,
89. The old man raised his face, and smiled;
90. And lighten'd up his faded eye,
91. With all a poet's ecstasy!
92. In varying cadence, soft or strong,
93. He swept the sounding chords along:
94. The present scene, the future lot,
95. His toils, his wants, were all forgot:
96. Cold diffidence, and age's frost,
97. In the full tide of song were lost;
98. Each blank in faithless memory void,
99. The poet's glowing thought supplied;
100. And while his harp responsive rung,
101. 'Twas thus the Latest Minstrel sung.


102. Canto I.

103. The feast was over in Branksome tower,
104. And the Ladye had gone to her secret bower;
105. Her bower that was guarded by word and by spell,
106. Deadly to hear, and deadly to tell-
107. Jesu Maria, shield us well!
108. No living wight, save the Ladye alone,
109. Had dared to cross the threshold stone.

110. II
111. The tables were drawn, it was idlesse all;
112. Knight and page, and household squire,
113. Loiter'd through the lofty hall,
114. Or crowded round the ample fire:
115. The staghours, weary with the chase,
116. Lay stretch'd upon the rusy foloor
117. And urged, in dreams, the forest race,
118. From Teviot-stone to Eskdale-moor.

119. III
120. Nine-and-twenty knights of fame
121. Hung their shields in Branksome-Hall,
122. Nine-and-twenty squires of name
123. Brought them their steeds to bower from stall;
124. Nine-and-twenty yeomen tall
125. Waited, duteous, on them all;
126. They were all knights of mettle true,
127. Kinsmen to the bold Buccleuch.

128. IV
129. Ten of them were sheathed in steel,
130. With belted sword, and spur on heel:
131. They quitted not their harness bright,
132. Neither by day, nor yet by night:
133. They lay down to rest,
134. With corslet laced,
135. Pillow'd on buckler cold and hard;
136. They carved at the meal
137. With gloves of steel,
138. And they drank the red wine through the helmet barr'd.

139. V
140. Ten squires, ten yeomen, mail-clad men,
141. Waited the beck of the warders ten;
142. Thirty steeds, both fleet and wight,
143. Stood saddled in stable day and night,
144. Barbed with frontlet of steel, I trow,
145. And with Jedwood-axe at saddlebow;
146. A hundred more fed free in stall:-
147. Such was the custom of Branksome-Hall.

148. VI
149. Why do these steeds stand ready dight?
150. Why watch these warriors, arm'd, by night?-
151. They watch, to hear the blood-hound baying?
152. They watch to hear the war-horn braying;
153. To see St. George's red cross streaming,
154. To see the midnight beacon gleaming:
155. They watch, against Southern force and guile,
156. Lest Scroop, or Howard, or Percy's powers,
157. Threaten Branksome's lordly towers,
158. From Warkwork, or Naworth, or merry Carlisle.

159. VII
160. Such is the custom of Branksome-Hall-
161. Many a valiant knight is here;
162. But he, the chieftain of them all,
163. His sword hangs rusting on the wall,
164. Beside his broken spear.
165. Bards long shall tell
166. How Lord Walter fell.
167. When startled burghers fled afar,
168. The furies of the Border war;
169. When the streets of high Dunedin
170. Saw lances gleam and falchion redden,
171. And heard the slogan's deadly yell-
172. Then the Chef of Branksome fell.

173. VIII
174. Can piety the discord heal,
175. Or stanch the death-feud's enmity?
176. Can Christian lore, can patriot zeal,
177. Can love of blessed charity?
178. No! vainly to each holy shrine,
179. In mutual pilgrimage they drew;
180. Implored, in vain, the grace divine
181. For chiefs, their own red falchions slew;
182. While Cessford owns the rule of Carr,
183. While Ettrick boasts the line of Scott,
184. The slaughter'd chiefs, the mortal jar,
185. The havoc of the feudal war,
186. Shall never, never be forgot!

187. IX
188. In sorrow o'er Lord Walter's bier
189. The warlike foresters had bent;
190. And many a flower,and many a tear,
191. Old Teviot's maids and matrons lent:
192. But o'er her warrior's bloody bier
193. The Ladye dropp'd nor flowers nor tear!
194. Vengeance, deep-brooding o'er the slain
195. Had lock'd the source of softer woe;
196. And burning pride, and high disdain,
197. Forbade the rising tear to flow;
198. Until, amid his sorrowing clan,
199. Her son lisp'd from the nurse's knee-
200. 'And if I live to be a man,
201. My father's death revenged shall be!'
202. Then fast the mother's tears did seek
203. To dew the infant's kindling cheek.

204. X
205. All loose her negligent attire,
206. All loose her golden hair,
207. Hung Margaret o'er her slaughter'd sire,
208. And wept in wild despair,
209. But not alone the bitter tear
210. Had filial grief supplied;
211. For hopeless love, and anxious fear,
212. Had lent their mingled tide:
213. Nor in her mother's alter'd eye
214. Dared she to look for sympathy.
215. Her lover, 'gainst her father's clan,
216. With Carr in arms had stood,
217. When Mathouse-burn to Melrose ran,
218. All purple with their blood;
219. And well she knew, her mother dread,
220. Before Lord Cranstoun she should wed,
221. Would see her on her dying bed.

222. XI
223. Of noble race the Ladye came
224. Her father was a clerk of fame,
225. Of Bethune's line of Picardie;
226. He learn'd the art that none may name,
227. In Padua, far beyond the sea.
228. Men said, he changed his mortal frame
229. By feat of magic mystery;
230. For when, in studious mode, he paced
231. St. Andrew's cloister'd hall,
232. His form no darkening shadow traced
233. Upon the sunny wall!

234. XII
235. And of his skill, as bards avow,
236. He taught that Ladye fair,
237. Till to her bidding she could bow
238. The viewless forms of air.
239. And now she sits in secret bower,
240. In old Lord David's western tower,
241. And listens to a heavy sound,
242. That moans the mossy turrets round.
243. Is it the roar of Teviot's tide,
244. That chafes against the scaur's red side?
245. Is it the wind that swings the oaks?
246. Is it the echo from the rocks?
247. What may it be, the heavy sound,
248. That moans old Branksome's turrets round?

249. XIII
250. At the sullen, moaning sound,
251. The ban-dogs bay and howl;
252. And, from the turrets round,
253. Loud whoops the startled owl.
254. In the hall, both squire and knight
255. Swore that a storm was near,
256. And looked forth to view the night,
257. But the night was still and clear!

258. XIV
259. From the sound of Teviot's tide,
260. Chafing with the mountain's side,
261. From the groan of the wind-swung oak,
262. From the sullen echo of the rock,
263. From the voice of the coming storm,
264. The Ladye knew it well!
265. It was the Spirit of the Flood that spoke
266. And he called on the Spirit of the Fell.

267. XV
268. River Spirit
269. 'Sleep'st thou, brother?'-

270. Mountain Spirit
271. -'Brother, nay-
272. On my hills the moon-beams play.
273. From Craik-cross to Skelfhill-pen,
274. By every rill, in every glen,
275. Merry elves their morris pacing,
276. To aerial minstrelry
277. Emerald rings on brown heath tracing,
278. Trip it deft and merrily.
279. Up, and mark their nimble feet!
280. Up, and list their music sweet!'

281. XVI
282. River Spirit
283. 'Tears of an imprisoned maiden
284. Mix with my polluted stream;
285. Margaret of Branksome, sorrow-laden,
286. Mourns beneath the moon's pale beam.
287. Tell me, thou, who view'st the stars,
288. When shall cease these feudal jars?
289. What shall be the maiden's fate?
290. Who shall be the maiden's mate?'

291. XVII
292. Mountain Spirit
293. 'Arthur's slow wain his course doth roll
294. In utter darkness round the pole;
295. The Northern Bear lowers black and grim;
296. Orion's studded belt is dim;
297. Twinkling faint, and distant far,
298. Shimmers through mist each planet star;
299. Ill may I read their high decree!
300. But no kind influence deign they shower
301. On Teviot's tide, and Branksome's tower,
302. Till pride be quell'd, and love be free.'

303. XVIII
304. The unearthly voices ceast,
305. And the heavy sound was still;
306. It died on the river's breast,
307. It died on the side of the hill.
308. But round Lord David's tower
309. The sound still floated near;
310. For it rung in the Ladye's bower,
311. And it rung in the Ladye's ear.
312. She raised her stately head,
313. And her heart throbb'd high with pride:-
314. 'Your mountains shall bend,
315. And your streams ascend,
316. Ere Margaret be our foeman's bride!'

317. XIX
318. The Lady sought the lofty hall,
319. Where many a bold retainer lay,
320. And, with jocund din, among them all,
321. Her son pursued his infant play.
322. A fancied moss-trooper, the boy
323. The truncheon of a spear bestrode,
324. And round the hall, right merrily,
325. In mimic foray rode.
326. Even bearded knights, in arms grown old,
327. Share in his frolic gambols bore,
328. Albeit their hearts of rugged mould,
329. Were stubborn as the steel they wore.
330. For the grey warriors prophesied,
331. How the brave boy, in future war,
332. Should tame the Unicorn's pride,
333. Exalt the Crescent and the Star.

334. XX
335. The Ladye forgot her purpose high,
336. One moment, and no more;
337. One moment gazed with a mother's eye,
338. As she paused at the arched door:
339. Then from amid the armed train,
340. She call'd to her William of Deloraine.

341. XXI
342. A stark moss-trooping Scott was he,
343. As e'er couch'd Border lance by knee;
344. Through Solway sands, through Tarras moss,
345. Blindfold, he knew the paths to cross;
346. By wily turns, by desperate bounds,
347. Had baffled Percy's best blood-hounds;
348. In Eske or Liddell, fords were none,
349. But he would ride them, one by one;
350. Alike to him was time or tide,
351. December's snow, or July's pride;
352. Alike to him was tide or time,
353. Moonless midnight, or matin prime;
354. Steady of heart, and stout of hand,
355. As ever drove prey from Cumberland;
356. Five times outlawed had be been,
357. By England's King, and Scotland's Queen.

358. XXII
359. 'Sir William of Deloraine, good at need,
360. Mount thee on the wightest steed;
361. Spare not to spur, nor stint to ride,
362. Until thou come to fair Tweedside;
363. And in Melrose's holy pile
364. Seek thou the Monk of St. Mary's aisle.
365. Greet the Father well from me;
366. Say that the fated hour is come,
367. And to-night he shall watch with thee,
368. To win the treasure of the tomb.
369. For this will be St. Michael's night,
370. And, though stars be dim, the moon is bright;
371. And the Cross, of bloody red,
372. Will point to the grave of the mighty dead.

373. XXIII
374. 'What he gives thee, see thou keep;
375. Stay not thou for food or sleep:
376. Be it scroll, or be it book,
377. Into it, Knight, thou must not look;
378. If thou readest, thou art lorn!
379. Better hadst thou ne'er been born.'-

380. XXIV
381. 'O swiftly can speed my dapple-grey steed,
382. Which drinks of the Teviot clear;
383. Ere break of day,' the Warrior 'gan say,
384. 'Again will I be here:
385. And safer by none may thy errand be done,
386. Than, noble dame, by me;
387. Letter nor line know I never a one,
388. Wer't my neck-verse at Hairibee.'

389. XXV
390. Soon in his saddle sate he fast,
391. And soon the steep descent he past,
392. Soon cross'd the sounding barbican,
393. And soon the Teviot side he won.
394. Eastward the wooded path he rode,
395. Green hazels o'er his basnet nod;
396. He passed the Peel of Goldiland,
397. And cross'd old Borthwick's roaring strand;
398. Dimly he view'd the Moat-hill's mound,
399. Where Druid shades still flitted round;
400. In Hawick twinkled many a light;
401. Behind him soon they set in night;
402. And soon he spurr'd his courser keen
403. Beneath the tower of Hazeldean.

404. XXVI
405. The clattering hoofs the watchmen mark;-
406. 'Stand ho! thou courier of the dark.'-
407. 'For Branksome, ho!'' the knight rejoin'd,
408. And left the friendly tower behind.
409. He turn'd him now from Teviotside,
410. And, guided by the tinkling rill,
411. Northward the dark ascent did ride,
412. And gained the moor at Horsliehill;
413. Broad on the left before him lay,
414. For many a mile, the Roman way.

415. XXVII
416. A moment now he slack'd his speed,
417. A moment breathed his panting steed;
418. Drew saddle-girth and corslet-band,
419. And loosen'd in the sheath his brand.
420. On Minto-crags the moonbeams glint,
421. Where Barnhill hew'd his bed of flint;
422. Who flung his outlaw'd limbs to rest,
423. Where falcons hang their giddy nest,
424. Mid cliffs, from whence his eagle eye
425. For many a league his prey could spy;
426. Cliffs, doubling, on their echoes borne,
427. The terrors of the robber's horn.
428. Cliffs, which, for many a year,
429. The warbling Doric reed shall hear,
430. When some sad swain shall teach the grove,
431. Ambition is no cure for love!

432. XXVIII
433. Unchallenged, thence pass'd Deloraine,
434. To ancient Riddel's fair domain,
435. Where Aill, from mountains freed,
436. Down from the lakes did raving come;
437. Each wave was creased with tawny foam,
438. Like the mane of a chestnut steed.
439. In vain! no torrent, deep or broad,
440. Might bar the bold moss-trooper's road.

441. XXIX
442. At the first plunge the horse sunk low,
443. And the water broke o'er the saddlebow;
444. Above the flaming tide, I ween,
445. Scarce half the charger's neck was seen;
446. For he was barded from counter to tail,
447. And the rider was armed complete in mail;
448. Never heavier man and horse
449. Stemm'd a midnight torrent's force.
450. The warrior's very plume, I say
451. Was daggled by the dashing spray;
452. Yet, through good heart, and Our Ladye's grace,
453. At length he gain'd the landing place.

454. XXX
455. Now Bowden Moor the march-man won,
456. And sternly shook his plumed head,
457. As glanced his eye o'er Halidon;
458. For on his soul the slaughter red
459. Of that unhallow'd morn arose,
460. When first the Scott and Carr were foes;
461. When royal James beheld the fray,
462. Prize to the victor of the day;
463. When Home and Douglas, in the van,
464. Bore down Buccleuch's retiring clan,
465. Till gallant Cessford's heart-blood dear
466. Reek'd on dark Elliot's Border spear.

467. XXXI
468. In bitter mood he spurred fast,
469. And soon the hated heath was past;
470. And far beneath, in lustre wan,
471. Old Melros' rose, and fair Tweed ran:
472. Like some tall rock with lichens grey,
473. Seem'd dimly huge, the dark Abbaye.
474. When Harwick he pass'd, had curfew rung,
475. Now midnight lauds were in Melrose sung.
476. The sound, upon the fitful gale,
477. In solemn wise did rise and fail,
478. Like that wild harp, whose magic tone
479. Is waken'd by the winds alone.
480. But when Melrose he reach'd, 'twas silence all;
481. He meetly stabled his steed in stall,
482. And sought the convent's lonely wall.
483. Here paused the harp; and with its swell
484. The Master's fire and courage fell;
485. Dejectedly, and low, he bow'd,
486. And, gazing timid on the crowd,
487. He seem'd to seek, in every eye,
488. If they approved his mistrelsy;
489. And, diffident of present praise,
490. Somewhat he spoke of former days,
491. And how old age, and wand'ring long,
492. Had done his hand and harp some wrong.
493. The Duchess, and her daughters fair,
494. And every gentle lady there,
495. Each after each, in due degree,
496. Gave praises to his melody;
497. His hand was true, his voice was clear,
498. And much they long'd the rest to hear.
499. Encouraged thus, the Aged Man,
500. After meet rest, again began.
