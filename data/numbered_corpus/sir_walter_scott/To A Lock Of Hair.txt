1. Thy hue, dear pledge, is pure and bright
2. As in that well - remember'd night
3. When first thy mystic braid was wove,
4. And first my Agnes whisper'd love.

5. Since then how often hast thou prest
6. The torrid zone of this wild breast,
7. Whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell
8. With the first sin that peopled hell;
9. A breast whose blood's a troubled ocean,
10. Each throb the earthquake's wild commotion!
11. O if such clime thou canst endure
12. Yet keep thy hue unstain'd and pure,
13. What conquest o'er each erring thought
14. Of that fierce realm had Agnes wrought!
15. I had not wander'd far and wide
16. With such an angel for my guide;
17. Nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me
18. If she had lived and lived to love me.

19. Not then this world's wild joys had been
20. To me one savage hunting scene,
21. My sole delight the headlong race
22. And frantic hurry of the chase;
23. To start, pursue, and bring to bay,
24. Rush in, drag down, and rend my prey,
25. Then - from the carcass turn away!
26. Mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed,
27. And soothed each wound which pride inflamed: -
28. Yes, God and man might now approve me
29. If thou hadst lived and lived to love me!
