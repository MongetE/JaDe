1. I.
2. When Denmark's raven soar'd on high,
3. Triumphant through Northumbrian sky,
4. Till, hovering near, her fatal croak
5. Bade Reged's Britons dread the yoke,
6. And the broad shadow of her wing
7. Blacken'd each cataract and spring,
8. Where Tees in tumult leaves his source,
9. Thundering o'er Caldron and High-Force;
10. Beneath the shade the Northmen came,
11. Fix'd on each vale a Runic name,
12. Rear'd high their altar's rugged stone,
13. And gave their Gods the land they won.
14. Then, Balder, one bleak garth was thine,
15. And one sweet brooklet's silver line,
16. And Woden's Croft did title gain
17. From the stern Father of the Slain;
18. But to the Monarch of the Mace,
19. That held in fight the foremost place,
20. To Odin's son, and Sifia's spouse,
21. Near Stratforth high they paid their vows,
22. Remember'd Thor's victorious fame,
23. And gave the dell the Thunderer's name.

24. II.
25. Yet Scald or Kemper err'd, I ween,
26. Who gave that soft and quiet scene,
27. With all its varied light and shade,
28. And every little sunny glade,
29. And the blithe brook that strolls along
30. Its pebbled bed with summer song,
31. To the grim God of blood and scar,
32. The grisly King of Northern War.
33. O, better were its banks assign'd
34. To spirits of a gentler kind!
35. For where the thicket-groups recede,
36. And the rath primrose decks the mead,
37. The velvet grass seems carpet meet
38. For the light fairies' lively feet.
39. Yon tufted knoll, with daisies strown,
40. Might make proud Oberon a throne,
41. While, hidden in the thicket nigh,
42. Puck should brood o'er his frolic sly;
43. And where profuse the wood-vetch clings
44. Round ash and elm, in verdant rings,
45. Its pale and azure-pencill'd flower
46. Should canopy Titania's bower.

47. III.
48. Here rise no cliffs the vale to shade;
49. But, skirting every sunny glade,
50. In fair variety of green
51. The woodland lends its sylvan screen.
52. Hoary, yet haughty, frowns the oak,
53. Its boughs by weight of ages broke;
54. And towers erect, in sable spire,
55. The pine-tree scathed by lightning-fire;
56. The drooping ash and birch, between,
57. Hang their fair tresses o'er the green,
58. And all beneath, at random grow
59. Each coppice dwarf of varied show,
60. Or, round the stems profusely twined,
61. Fling summer odours on the wind.
62. Such varied group Urbino's hand
63. Round Him of Tarsus nobly plann'd,
64. What time he bade proud Athens own
65. On Mar's Mount the God Unknown!
66. Then gray Philosophy stood nigh,
67. Though bent by age, in spirit high:
68. There rose the scar-seam'd veteran's spear,
69. There Grecian Beauty bent to hear,
70. While Childhood at her foot was placed,
71. Or clung delighted to her waist.

72. IV.
73. 'And rest we here,' Matilda said,
74. And sat her in the varying shade.
75. 'Chance-met, we well may steal an hour
76. To friendship due from fortune's power.
77. Thou, Wilfrid, ever kind, must lend
78. Thy counsel to thy sister-friend;
79. And, Redmond, thou, at my behest,
80. No farther urge thy desperate quest.
81. For to my care a charge is left,
82. Dangerous to one of aid bereft,
83. Wellnigh an orphan, and alone,
84. Captive her sire, her house o'erthrown.'
85. Wilfrid, with wonted kindness graced,
86. Beside her on the turf she placed;
87. Then paused, with downcast look and eye,
88. Nor bade young Redmond seat him nigh.
89. Her conscious diffidence he saw,
90. Drew backward as in modest awe,
91. And sat a little space removed,
92. Unmark'd to gaze on her he loved.

93. V.
94. Wreathed in its dark-brown rings, her hair
95. Half hid Matilda's forehead fair,
96. Half hid and half reveal'd to view
97. Her full dark eye of hazel hue.
98. The rose, with faint and feeble streak,
99. So slightly tinged the maiden's cheek,
100. That you had said her hue was pale;
101. But if she faced the summer gale,
102. Or spoke, or sung, or quicker moved,
103. Or heard the praise of those she loved,
104. Or when of interest was express'd
105. Aught that waked feeling in her breast,
106. The mantling blood in ready play
107. Rivall'd the blush of rising day.
108. There was a soft and pensive grace,
109. A cast of thought upon her face,
110. That suited well the forehead high,
111. The eyelash dark, and downcast eye;
112. The mild expression spoke a mind
113. In duty firm, composed, resign'd;-
114. â€˜Tis that which Roman art has given,
115. To mark their maiden Queen of Heaven.
116. In hours of sport, that mood gave way
117. To Fancy's light and frolic play;
118. And when the dance, or tale, or song,
119. In harmless mirth sped time along,
120. Full oft her doting sire would call
121. His Maud the merriest of them all.
122. But days of war, and civil crime,
123. Allow'd but ill such festal time,
124. And her soft pensiveness of brow
125. Had deepen'd into sadness now.
126. In Marston field her father ta'en,
127. Her friends dispersed, brave Mortham slain,
128. While every ill her soul foretold,
129. From Oswald's thirst of power and gold,
130. And boding thoughts that she must part
131. With a soft vision of her heart,
132. All lower'd around the lovely maid,
133. To darken her dejection's shade.

134. VI.
135. Who has not heard-while Erin yet
136. Strove 'gainst the Saxon's iron bit
137. Who has not heard how brave O'Neale
138. In English blood imbrued his steel,
139. Against St George's cross blazed high
140. The banners of his Tanistry,
141. To fiery Essex gave the foil,
142. And reign'd a prince on Ulster's soil?
143. But chief arose his victor pride,
144. When that brave Marshal fought and died,
145. And Avon-Duff to ocean bore
146. His billows red with Saxon gore.
147. 'Twas first in that disastrous fight,
148. Rokeby and Mortham proved their might.
149. There had they fallen amongst the rest,
150. But pity touch'd a chieftain's breast;
151. The Tanist he to great O'Neale;
152. He check'd his followers' bloody zeal,
153. To quarter took the kinsmen bold,
154. And bore them to his mountain-hold,
155. Gave them each sylvan joy to know,
156. Slieve-Donard's cliffs and woods could show,
157. Shared with them Erin's festal cheer,
158. Show'd them the chase of wolf and deer,
159. And, when a fitting time was come,
160. Safe and unransom'd sent them home,
161. Loaded with many a gift, to prove
162. A generous foe's respect and love.

163. VII.
164. Years speed away. On Rokeby's head
165. Some touch of early snow was shed;
166. Calm he enjoy'd, by Greta's wave,
167. The peace which James the Peaceful gave,
168. While Mortham, far beyond the main,
169. Waged his fierce wars on Indian Spain.
170. It chanced upon a wintry night,
171. That whiten'd Stanmore's stormy height,
172. The chase was o'er, the stag was kill'd,
173. In Rokeby hall the cups were fill'd,
174. And by the huge stone chimney sate
175. The Knight in hospitable state.
176. Moonless the sky, the hour was late,
177. When a loud summons shook the gate,
178. And sore for entrance and for aid
179. A voice of foreign accent pray'd.
180. The porter answer'd to the call,
181. And instant rush'd into the hall
182. A Man, whose aspect and attire
183. Startled the circle by the fire.

184. VIII.
185. His plaited hair in elf-locks spread
186. Around his bare and matted head;
187. On leg and thigh, close stretch'd and trim,
188. His vesture show'd the sinewy limb;
189. In saffron dyed, a linen vest
190. Was frequent folded round his breast;
191. A mantle long and loose he wore,
192. Shaggy with ice, and stain'd with gore.
193. He clasp'd a burden to his heart,
194. And, resting on a knotted dart,
195. The snow from hair and beard he shook,
196. And round him gazed with wilder'd look.
197. Then up the hall, with staggering pace,
198. He hasten'd by the blaze to place,
199. Half lifeless from the bitter air,
200. His load, a Boy of beauty rare.
201. To Rokeby, next, he louted low,
202. Then stood erect his tale to show,
203. With wild majestic port and tone,
204. Like envoy of some barbarous throne.
205. 'Sir Richard, Lord of Rokeby, hear!
206. Turlough O'Neale salutes thee dear;
207. lie graces thee, and to thy care
208. Young Redmond gives, his grandson fair.
209. He bids thee breed him as thy son,
210. For Turlough's days of joy are done;
211. And other lords have seized his land,
212. And faint and feeble is his hand;
213. And all the glory of Tyrone
214. Is like a morning vapour flown.
215. To bind the duty on thy soul,
216. He bids thee think on Erin's bowl!
217. If any wrong the young O'Neale,
218. He bids thee think of Erin's steel.
219. To Mortham first this charge was due,
220. But, in his absence, honours you.
221. Now is my master's message by,
222. And Ferraught will contented die.'

223. IX.
224. His look grew fix'd, his cheek grew pale,
225. He sunk when he had told his tale;
226. For, hid beneath his mantle wide,
227. A mortal wound was in his side.
228. Vain was all aid-in terror wild,
229. And sorrow, scream'd the orphan Child.
230. Poor Ferraught raised his wistful eyes,
231. And faintly strove to soothe his cries;
232. All reckless of his dying pain,
233. He blest, and blest him o'er again!
234. And kiss'd the little hands outspread,
235. And kiss'd and cross'd the infant head,
236. And, in his native tongue and phrase,
237. Pray'd to each saint to watch his days;
238. Then all his strength together drew,
239. The charge to Rokeby to renew.
240. When half was falter'd from his breast,
241. And half by dying signs express'd,
242. 'Bless the O'Neale!' he faintly said,
243. And thus the faithful spirit fled.

244. X.
245. 'Twas long ere soothing might prevail
246. Upon the Child to end the tale:
247. And then he said, that from his home
248. His grandsire had been forced to roam,
249. Which had not been if Redmond's hand
250. Had but had strength to draw the brand,
251. The brand of Lenaugh More the Red,
252. That hung beside the grey wolf's head.-
253. 'Twas from his broken phrase descried,
254. His foster-father was his guide,
255. Who, in his charge, from Ulster bore
256. Letters, and gifts a goodly store;
257. But ruffians met them in the wood,
258. Ferraught in battle boldly stood,
259. Till wounded and o'erpower'd at length,
260. And stripp'd of all, his failing strength
261. Just bore him here-and then the child
262. Renew'd again his moaning wild.

263. XI.
264. The tear, down childhood's cheek that flows,
265. Is like the dewdrop on the rose;
266. When next the summer breeze comes by,
267. And waves the bush, the flower is dry.
268. Won by their care, the orphan Child
269. Soon on his new protector smiled,
270. With dimpled cheek and eye so fair,
271. Through his thick curls of flaxen hair,
272. But blithest laugh'd that cheek and eye,
273. When Rokeby's little Maid was nigh;
274. Twas his, with elder brother's pride,
275. Matilda's tottering steps to guide;
276. His native lays in Irish tongue,
277. To soothe her infant ear he sung,
278. And primrose twined with daisy fair,
279. To form a chaplet for her hair.
280. By lawn, by grove, by brooklet's strand,
281. The Children still were hand and hand,
282. And good Sir Richard smiling eyed
283. The early knot so kindly tied.

284. XII.
285. But summer months bring wilding shoot
286. From bud to bloom, from bloom to fruit;
287. And years draw on our human span,
288. From child to boy, from boy to man;
289. And soon in Rokeby's woods is seen
290. A gallant boy in hunter's green.
291. He loves to wake the felon boar,
292. In his dark haunt on Greta's shore,
293. And loves, against the deer so dun,
294. To draw the shaft, or lift the gun:
295. Yet more he loves, in autumn prime,
296. The hazel's spreading bows to climb,
297. And down its cluster'd stores to hail,
298. Where young Matilda holds her veil.
299. And she, whose veil receives the shower,
300. Is alter'd too, and knows her power;
301. Assumes a monitress's pride,
302. Her Redmond's dangerous sports to chide;
303. Yet listens still to hear him tell
304. How the grim wild-boar fought and fell,
305. How at his fall the bugle rung,
306. Till rock and greenwood answer flung;
307. Then blesses her, that man can find
308. A pastime of such savage kind!

309. XIII.
310. But Redmond knew to weave his tale
311. So well with praise of wood and dale,
312. And knew so well each point to trace,
313. Gives living interest to the chase,
314. And knew so well o'er all to throw
315. His spirit's wild romantic glow,
316. That, while she blamed, and while she fear'd,
317. She loved each venturous tale she heard.
318. Oft, too, when drifted snow and rain
319. To bower and hall their steps restrain,
320. Together they explor'd the page
321. Of glowing bard or gifted sage;
322. Oft, placed the evening fire beside,
323. The minstrel art alternate tried,
324. While gladsome harp and lively lay
325. Bade winter-night flit fast away:
326. Thus from their childhood blending still
327. Their sport, their study, and their skill,
328. An union of the soul they prove,
329. But must not think that it was love.
330. But though they dared not, envious Fame
331. Soon dared to give that union name;
332. And when so often, side by side,
333. From year to year the pair she eyed,
334. She sometimes blamed the good old Knight,
335. As dull of ear and dim of sight,
336. Sometimes his purpose would declare,
337. That young O'Neale should wed his heir.

338. XIV.
339. The suit of Wilfrid rent disguise
340. And bandage from the lovers' eyes;
341. 'Twas plain that Oswald, for his son,
342. Had Rokeby's favour wellnigh won.
343. Now must they meet with change of cheer,
344. With mutual looks of shame and fear;
345. Now must Matilda stray apart,
346. To school her disobedient heart:
347. And Redmond now alone must rue
348. The love he never can subdue.
349. But factions rose, and Rokeby sware,
350. No rebel's son should wed his heir;
351. And Redmond, nurtured while a child
352. In many a bard's traditions wild,
353. Now sought the lonely wood or stream,
354. To cherish there a happier dream,
355. Of maiden won by sword or lance,
356. As in the regions of romance;
357. And count the heroes of his line,
358. Great Nial of the Pledges Nine,
359. Shane-Dymas wild, and Geraldine,
360. And Connan-more, who vow'd his race
361. Forever to the fight and chase,
362. And cursed him of his lineage born,
363. Should sheathe the sword to reap the corn,
364. Or leave the mountain and the wold,
365. To shroud himself in castled hold.
366. From such examples hope he drew,
367. And brighten'd as the trumpet blew.

368. XV.
369. If brides were won by heart and blade,
370. Redmond had both his cause to aid,
371. And all beside of nurture rare
372. That might beseem a baron's heir.
373. Turlough O'Neale, in Erin's strife,
374. On Rokeby's Lord bestow'd his life,
375. And well did Rokeby's generous Knight
376. Young Redmond for the deed requite.
377. Nor was his liberal care and cost
378. Upon the gallant stripling lost:
379. Seek the North Riding broad and wide,
380. Like Redmond none could steed bestride;
381. From Tynemouth search to Cumberland,
382. Like Redmond none could wield a brand;
383. And then, of humour kind and free,
384. And bearing him to each degree
385. With frank and fearless courtesy,
386. There never youth was form'd to steal
387. Upon the heart like brave O'Neale.

388. XVI.
389. Sir Richard loved him as his son;
390. And when the days of peace were done,
391. And to the gales of war he gave
392. The banner of his sires to wave,
393. Redmond, distinguish'd by his care,
394. He chose that honour'd flag to bear,
395. And named his page, the next degree
396. In that old time to chivalry.
397. In five pitch'd fields he well maintain'd
398. The honour'd place his worth obtain'd,
399. And high was Redmond's youthful name
400. Blazed in the roll of martial fame.
401. Had fortune smiled on Marston fight,
402. The eve had seen him dubb'd a knight;
403. Twice, 'mid the battle's doubtful strife,
404. Of Rokeby's Lord he saved the life,
405. But when he saw him prisoner made,
406. He kiss'd and then resign'd his blade,
407. And yielded him an easy prey
408. To those who led the Knight away;
409. Resolv'd Matilda's sire should prove
410. In prison, as in fight, his love.

411. XVII.
412. When lovers meet in adverse hour,
413. 'Tis like a sun-glimpse through a shower,
414. A watery ray, an instant seen
415. The darkly closing clouds between.
416. As Redmond on the turf reclined,
417. The past and present fill'd his mind:
418. 'It was not thus,' Affection said,
419. 'I dream'd of my return, dear maid!
420. Not thus, when from thy trembling hand,
421. I took the banner and the brand,
422. When round me, as the bugles blew,
423. Their blades three hundred warriors drew,
424. And, while the standard I unroll'd,
425. Clash'd their bright arms, with clamour bold.
426. Where is that banner now?-its pride
427. Lies 'whelm'd in Ouse's sullen tide!
428. Where now these warriors?-in their gore,
429. They cumber Marston's dismal moor!
430. And what avails a useless brand,
431. Held by a captive's shackled hand,
432. That only would his life retain,
433. To aid thy sire to bear his chain!'
434. Thus Redmond to himself apart;
435. Nor lighter was his rival's heart;
436. For Wilfrid, while his generous soul
437. Disdain'd to profit by control,
438. By many a sign could mark too plain,
439. Save with such aid, his hopes were vain.
440. But now Matilda's accents stole
441. On the dark visions of their soul,
442. And bade their mournful musing fly,
443. Like mist before the zephyr's sigh.

444. XVIII.
445. 'I need not to my friends recall,
446. How Mortham shunn'd my father's hall;
447. A man of silence and of woe,
448. Yet ever anxious to bestow
449. On my poor self whate'er could prove
450. A kinsman's confidence and love.
451. My feeble aid could sometimes chase
452. The clouds of sorrow for a space:
453. But oftener, fix'd beyond my power,
454. I mark'd his deep despondence lower.
455. One dismal cause, by all unguess'd,
456. His fearful confidence confess'd;
457. And twice it was my hap to see
458. Examples of that agony,
459. Which for a season can o'erstrain
460. And wreck the structure of the brain.
461. He had the awful power to know
462. The approaching mental overthrow,
463. And while his mind had courage yet
464. To struggle with the dreadful fit,
465. The victim writhed against its throes,
466. Like wretch beneath a murderer's blows.
467. This malady, I well could mark,
468. Sprung from some direful cause and dark;
469. But still he kept its source conceal'd,
470. Till arming for the civil field;
471. Then in my charge he bade me hold
472. A treasure huge of gems and gold,
473. With this disjointed dismal scroll,
474. That tells the secret of his soul,
475. In such wild words as oft betray
476. A mind by anguish forced astray.'

477. XIX. MORTHAM'S HISTORY.
478. 'Matilda! thou last seen me start,
479. As if a dagger thrill'd my heart,
480. When it has happ'd some casual phrase
481. Waked memory of my former days.
482. Believe, that few can backward cast
483. Their thoughts with pleasure on the past;
484. But I!-my youth was rash and vain,
485. And blood and rage my manhood stain,
486. And my gray hairs must now descend
487. To my cold grave without a friend!
488. Even thou, Matilda, wilt disown
489. Thy kinsman, when his guilt is known.
490. And must I lift the bloody veil,
491. That hides my dark and fatal tale!
492. I must-I will-Pale phantom, cease!
493. Leave me one little hour in peace!
494. Thus haunted, think'st thou I have skill
495. Thine own commission to fulfil?
496. Or, while thou point'st with gesture fierce,
497. Thy blighted cheek, thy bloody hearse,
498. How can I paint thee as thou wert,
499. So fair in face, so warm in heart!

500. XX.
501. 'Yes, she was fair!-Matilda, thou
502. Hast a soft sadness on thy brow;
503. But hers was like the sunny glow,
504. That laughs on earth and all below!
505. We wedded secret-there was need
506. Differing in country and in creed;
507. And when to Mortham's tower she came,
508. We mentioned not her race and name,
509. Until thy sire, who fought afar.
510. Should turn him home from foreign war,
511. On whose kind influence we relied
512. To soothe her father's ire and pride.
513. Few months we lived retired, unknown,
514. To all but one dear friend alone,
515. One darling friend-I spare his shame,
516. I will not write the villain's name!
517. My trespasses I might forget,
518. And sue in vengeance for the debt
519. Due by a brother worm to me,
520. Ungrateful to God's clemency,
521. That spared me penitential time,
522. Nor cut me off amid my crime.

523. XXI.
524. 'A kindly smile to all she lent,
525. But on her husband's friend 'twas bent
526. So kind, that from its harmless glee,
527. The wretch misconstrued villany.
528. Repulsed in his presumptuous love,
529. A'vengeful snare the traitor wove.
530. Alone we sat-the flask had flow'd,
531. My blood with heat unwonted glow'd,
532. When through the alley'd walk we spied
533. With hurried step my Edith glide,
534. Cowering beneath the verdant screen,
535. As one unwilling to be seen.
536. Words cannot paint the fiendish smile,
537. That curl'd the traitor's cheek the while!
538. Fiercely I question'd of the cause;
539. He made a cold and artful pause,
540. Then pray'd it might not chafe my mood-
541. 'There was a gallant in the wood!'
542. We had been shooting at the deer;
543. My cross-bow (evil chance!) was near:
544. That ready weapon of my wrath
545. I caught, and, hasting up the path,
546. In the yew grove my wife I found,
547. A stranger's arms her neck had bound!
548. I mark'd his heart-the bow I drew
549. I loosed the shaft- 'twas more than true!
550. I found my Edith's dying charms
551. Lock'd in her murder'd brother's arms!
552. He came in secret to enquire
553. Her state, and reconcile her sire.

554. XXII.
555. 'All fled my rage-the villain first,
556. Whose craft my jealousy had nursed;
557. He sought in far and foreign clime
558. To 'scape the vengeance of his crime.
559. The manner of the slaughter done
560. Was known to few, my guilt to none;
561. Some tale my faithful steward framed
562. I know not what-of shaft mis-aimed;
563. And even from those the act who knew,
564. He hid the hand from which it flew.
565. Untouch'd by human laws I stood,
566. But GoD had heard the cry of blood!
567. There is a blank upon my mind,
568. A fearful vision ill-defined,
569. Of raving till my flesh was torn,
570. Of dungeon-bolts and fetters worn-
571. And when I waked to wo more mild,
572. And question'd of my infant child
573. (Have I not written, that she bare
574. A boy, like summer morning fair?)
575. With looks confused my menials tell
576. That armed men in Mortham dell
577. Beset the nurse's evening way,
578. And bore her, with her charge, away.
579. My faithless friend, and none but he,
580. Could profit by this villany;
581. Him then, I sought, with purpose dread
582. Of treble vengeance on his head!
583. He 'scaped me-but my bosom's wound
584. Some faint relief from wandering found;
585. And over distant land and sea
586. I bore my load of misery.

587. XXIII.
588. ''Twas then that fate my footsteps led
589. Among a daring crew and dread,
590. With whom full oft my hated life
591. I ventured in such desperate strife,
592. That even my fierce associates saw
593. My frantic deeds with doubt and awe.
594. Much then I learn'd, and much can show,
595. Of human guilt and human wo,
596. Yet ne'er have, in my wanderings, known
597. A wretch, whose sorrows match'd my own!
598. It chanced, that after battle fray,
599. Upon the bloody field we lay;
600. The yellow moon her lustre shed
601. Upon the wounded and the dead,
602. While, sense in toil and wassail drown'd,
603. My ruffian comrades slept around,
604. There came a voice-its silver tone
605. Was soft, Matilda, as thine own
606. Ah, wretch!' it said, 'what makest thou here,
607. While unavenged my bloody bier,
608. While unprotected lives mine heir,
609. Without a father's name and care?'

610. XXIV.
611. 'I heard-obey'd-and homeward drew;
612. The fiercest of our desperate crew
613. I brought at time of need to aid
614. My purposed vengeance, long delay'd.
615. But, humble be my thanks to Heaven,
616. That better hopes and thoughts has given,
617. And by our Lord's dear prayer has taught,
618. Mercy by mercy must be bought!
619. Let me in misery rejoice
620. I've seen his face-I've heard his voice
621. I claim'd of him my only child
622. As he disown'd the theft, he smiled
623. That very calm and callous look,
624. That fiendish sneer his visage took,
625. As when he said, in scornful mood,
626. 'There is a gallant in the wood!'
627. I did not slay him as he stood
628. All praise be to my Maker given!
629. Long suffrance is one path to heaven.'

630. XXV.
631. Thus far the woful tale was heard,
632. When something in the thicket stirr'd.
633. Up Redmond sprung; the villain Guy,
634. (For he it was that lurk'd so nigh,)
635. Drew back-he durst not cross his steel
636. A moment's space with brave O'Neale,
637. For all the treasured gold that rests
638. In Mortham's iron-banded chests.
639. Redmond resumed his seat;-he said,
640. Some roe was rustling in the shade.
641. Bertram laugh'd grimly, when he saw
642. His timorous comrade backward draw;
643. 'A trusty mate art thou, to fear
644. A single arm, and aid so near!
645. Yet have I seen thee mark a deer.
646. Give me thy carabine-I'll show
647. An art that thou wilt gladly know,
648. How thou mayst safely quell a foe.'

649. XXVI.
650. On hands and knees fierce Bertram drew
651. The spreading birch and hazels through,
652. Till he had Redmond full in view;
653. The gun he levell'd-Mark like this
654. Was Bertram never known to miss,
655. When fair opposed to aim there sate
656. An object of his mortal hate.
657. That day young Redmond's death had seen,
658. But twice Matilda came between
659. The carabine and Redmond's breast,
660. Just ere the spring his finger press'd.
661. A deadly oath the ruffian swore,
662. But yet his fell design forbore:
663. 'It ne'er,' he mutter'd, 'shall be said,
664. That thus I scath'd thee, haughty maid!'
665. Then moved to seek more open aim,
666. When to his side Guy Denzil came:
667. 'Bertram, forbear!-we are undone
668. Forever, if thou fire the gun.
669. By all the fiends, an armed force
670. Descends the dell, of foot and horse!
671. We perish if they hear a shot
672. Madman! we have a safer plot
673. Nay, friend, be ruled, and bear thee back!
674. Behold, down yonder hollow track,
675. The warlike leader of the band
676. Comes, with his broadsword in his hand.'
677. Bertram look'd up; he saw, he knew
678. That Denzil's fears had counsell'd true,
679. Then cursed his fortune and withdrew,
680. Threaded the woodlands undescried,
681. And gain'd the cave on Greta side.

682. XXVII.
683. They whom dark Bertram, in his wrath,
684. Doom'd to captivity or death,
685. Their thoughts to one sad subject lent,
686. Saw not nor heard the ambushment.
687. Heedless and unconcern'd they sate,
688. While on the very verge of fate;
689. Heedless and unconcern'd remain'd,
690. When Heaven the murderer's arm restrained;
691. As ships drift darkling down the tide,
692. Nor see the shelves o'er which they glide.
693. Uninterrupted thus they heard
694. What Mortham's closing tale declared.
695. He spoke of wealth as of a load,
696. By Fortune on a wretch bestow'd,
697. In bitter mockery of hate,
698. His cureless woes to aggravate;
699. But yet he pray'd Matilda's care
700. Might save that treasure for his heir
701. His Edith's son-for still he raved
702. As confident his life was saved;
703. In frequent vision, he averr'd,
704. He saw his face, his voice he heard,
705. Then argued calm-had murder been,
706. The blood, the corpses, had been seen;
707. Some had pretended, too, to mark
708. On Windermere a stranger bark,
709. Whose crew, with jealous care, yet mild,
710. Guarded a female and a child.
711. While these faint proofs he told and press'd,
712. Hope seem'd to kindle in his breast;
713. Though inconsistent, vague, and vain,
714. It warp'd his judgment, and his brain.

715. XXVIII.
716. These solemn words his story close:
717. 'Heaven witness for me, that I chose
718. My part in this sad civil fight,
719. Moved by no cause but England's right.
720. My country's groans have bid me draw
721. My sword for gospel and for law;
722. These righted, I fling arms aside,
723. And seek my son through Europe wide.
724. My wealth, on which a kinsman nigh
725. Already casts a grasping eye,
726. With thee may unsuspected lie.
727. When of my death Matilda hears,
728. Let her retain her trust three years;
729. If none, from me, the treasure claim,
730. Perish'd is Mortham's race and name.
731. Then let it leave her generous hand,
732. And flow in bounty o'er the land;
733. Soften the wounded prisoner's lot,
734. Rebuild the peasant's ruined cot;
735. So spoils, acquired by fight afar,
736. Shall mitigate domestic war.'

737. XXIX.
738. The generous youths, who well had known
739. Of Mortham's mind the powerful tone,
740. To that high mind, by sorrow swerved,
741. Gave sympathy his woes deserved;
742. But Wilfrid chief, who saw reveal'd
743. Why Mortham wish'd his life conceal'd,
744. In secret, doubtless, to pursue
745. The schemes his wilder'd fancy drew.
746. Thoughtful he heard Matilda tell,
747. That she would share her father's cell,
748. His partner of captivity,
749. Where'er his prison-house should be;
750. Yet grieved to think that Rokeby-hall,
751. Dismantled, and forsook by all,
752. Open to rapine and to stealth,
753. Had now no safeguard for the wealth,
754. Intrusted by her kinsman kind,
755. And for such noble use design'd.
756. 'Was Barnard Castle then her choice,'
757. Wilfrid inquired with hasty voice,
758. 'Since there the victor's laws ordain,
759. Her father must a space remain?'
760. A flutter'd hope his accents shook,
761. A flutter'd joy was in his look
762. Matilda hasten'd to reply,
763. For anger flash'd in Redmond's eye;
764. 'Duty,' she said, with gentle grace,
765. Kind Wilfrid, has no choice of place;
766. Else had I for my sire assign'd
767. Prison less galling to his mind,
768. Than that his wild-wood haunts which sees
769. And hears the murmur of the Tees,
770. Recalling thus, with every glance,
771. What captive's sorrow can enhance;
772. But where those woes are highest, there
773. Needs Rokeby most his daughter's care.'

774. XXX.
775. He felt the kindly check she gave,
776. And stood abash'd-then answer'd grave:
777. I sought thy purpose, noble maid,
778. Thy doubts to clear, thy schemes to aid.
779. I have beneath mine own command,
780. So wills my sire, a gallant band,
781. And well could send some horseman wight
782. To bear the treasure forth by night,
783. And so bestow it as you deem
784. In these ill days may safest seem.'
785. 'Thanks, gentle Wilfrid, thanks,' she said:
786. 'O, be it not one day delay'd!
787. And, more thy sister-friend to aid,
788. Be thou thyself content to hold,
789. In thine own keeping, Mortham's gold,
790. Safest with thee.'-While thus she spoke,
791. Arm'd soldiers on their converse broke,
792. The same of whose approach afraid,
793. The ruffians left their ambuscade.
794. Their chief to Wilfrid bended low,
795. Then look'd around as for a foe.
796. 'What mean'st thou, friend,' young Wycliffe said,
797. Why thus in arms beset the glade?'
798. 'That would I gladly learn from you;
799. For up my squadron as I drew,
800. To exercise our martial game
801. Upon the moor of Barninghame,
802. A stranger told you were waylaid,
803. Surrounded, and to death betray'd.
804. He had a leader's voice, I ween,
805. A falcon glance, a warrior's mien.
806. He bade me bring you instant aid;
807. I doubted not, and I obey'd.'

808. XXXI.
809. Wilfrid changed colour, and, amazed,
810. Turn'd short, and on the speaker gazed;
811. While Redmond every thicket round
812. Track'd earnest as a questing hound,
813. And Denzil's carabine he found;
814. Sure evidence, by which they knew
815. The warning was as kind as true.
816. Wisest it seem'd, with cautious speed
817. To leave the dell. It was agreed,
818. That Redmond, with Matilda fair,
819. And fitting guard, should home repair;
820. At nightfall Wilfrid should attend,
821. With a strong band, his sister-friend,
822. To bear with her from Rokeby's bowers
823. To Barnard Castle's lofty towers,
824. Secret and safe the banded chests,
825. In which the wealth of Mortham rests.
826. This hasty purpose fix'd, they part,
827. Each with a grieved and anxious heart.
