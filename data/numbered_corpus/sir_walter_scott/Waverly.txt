1. Late, when the Autumn evening fell
2. On Mirkwoodâ€“Mere's romantic dell,
3. The lake return'd, in chastenâ€™d gleam,
4. The purple cloud, the golden beam:
5. Reflected in the crystal pool,
6. Headland and bank lay fair and cool;
7. The weather-tinted rock and tower,
8. Each drooping tree, each fairy flower,
9. So true, so soft, the mirror gave,
10. As if there lay beneath the wave,
11. Secure from trouble, toil, and care,
12. A world than earthly world more fair.

13. But distant winds began to wake,
14. And roused the Genius of the Lake!
15. He heard the groaning of the oak,
16. And donn'd at once his sable cloak,
17. As warrior, at the battle-cry,
18. Invests him with his panoply:
19. Then, as the whirlwind nearer pressâ€™d
20. He 'gan to shake his foamy crest
21. O'er furrow'd brow and blacken'd cheek,
22. And bade his surge in thunder speak.
23. In wild and broken eddies whirl'd.
24. Flitted that fond ideal world,
25. And to the shore in tumult tost
26. The realms of fairy bliss were lost.

27. Yet, with a stern delight and strange,
28. I saw the spirit-stirring change,
29. As warr'd the wind with wave and wood,
30. Upon the ruin'd tower I stood,
31. And felt my heart more strongly bound,
32. Responsive to the lofty sound,
33. While, joying in the mighty roar,
34. I mournâ€™d that tranquil scene no more.

35. So, on the idle dreams of youth,
36. Breaks the loud trumpet-call of truth,
37. Bids each fair vision pass away,
38. Like landscape on the lake that lay,
39. As fair, as flitting, and as frail,
40. As that which fled the Autumn gale.-â€”
41. For ever dead to fancy's eye
42. Be each gay form that glided by,
43. While dreams of love and lady's charms
44. Give place to honour and to arms!
