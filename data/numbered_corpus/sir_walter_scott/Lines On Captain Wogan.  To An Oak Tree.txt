1. To an Oak Tree, In the Churchyard of --, In the Highlands of Scotland, Said to Mark the Grave of Captain Wogan, Killed in 1649.


2. Emblem of England's ancient faith,
3. Full proudly may thy branches wave,
4. Where loyalty lies low in death,
5. And valour fills a timeless grave.

6. And thou, brave tenant of the tomb!
7. Repine not if our clime deny,
8. Above thine honoured sod to bloom,
9. The flowerets of a milder sky.

10. These owe their birth to genial May;
11. Beneath a fiercer sun they pine,
12. Before the winter storm decay-
13. And can their worth be type of thine?

14. No! for 'mid storms of Fate opposing,
15. Still higher swelled thy dauntless heart,
16. And, while Despair the scene was closing,
17. Commenced thy brief but brilliant part.

18. Twas then thou sought'st on Albyn's hill,
19. (When England's sons the strife resigned),
20. A rugged race, resisting still,
21. And unsubdued though unrefined.

22. Thy death's hour heard no kindred wail,
23. No holy knell thy requiem rung;
24. Thy mourners were the plaided Gael;
25. Thy dirge the clamorous pibroch sung.

26. Yet who, in Fortune's summer-shine,
27. To waste life's longest term away,
28. Would change that glorious dawn of thine,
29. Though darkened ere its noontide day?

30. Be thine the Tree whose dauntless boughs
31. Brave summer's drought and winter's gloom!
32. Rome bound with oak her patriots' brows,
33. As Albyn shadows Wogan's tomb.
