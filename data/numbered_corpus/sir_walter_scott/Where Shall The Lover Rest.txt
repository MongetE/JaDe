1. Where shall the lover rest
2. Whom the fates sever
3. From the true maiden's breast,
4. Parted for ever?--
5. Where, through groves deep and high,
6. Sounds the fair billow,
7. Where early violets die,
8. Under the willow.

9. Chorus.

10. Soft shall be his pillow.

11. There, through the summer day,
12. Cool streams are laving;
13. There, while the tempests sway,
14. Scarce are boughs waving;
15. There, thy rest shall thou take,
16. Parted for ever,
17. Never again to wake,
18. Never, O never!
19. Chorus.

20. Never, O never!
21. Where shall the traitor rest,
22. He, the deceiver,
23. Who could win maiden's breast,
24. Ruin and leave her?--
25. In the lost battle,
26. Borne down by the flying,
27. Where mingles war's rattle
28. With groans of the dying.,P

29. Chorus.

30. There shall he be lying.

31. Her wing shall the eagle flap
32. O'er the false hearted,
33. His warm blood the wolf shall lap,
34. Ere life be parted,
35. Shame and dishonor sit
36. By his grave ever;
37. Blessing shall hallow it,--
38. Never, O never!
39. Chorus

40. Never, O never!
