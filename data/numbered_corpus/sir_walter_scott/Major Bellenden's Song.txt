1. And what though winter will pinch severe
2. Through locks of grey and a cloak that's old?
3. Yet keep up thy heart, bold cavalier,
4. For a cup of sack shall fence the cold.

5. For time will rust the brightest blade,
6. And years will break the strongest bow;
7. Was ever wight so starkly made,
8. But time and years would overthrow?
