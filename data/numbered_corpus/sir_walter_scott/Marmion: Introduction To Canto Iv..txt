1. An ancient minstrel sagely said,
2. 'Where is the life which late we led?'
3. That motley clown in Arden wood,
4. Whom humorous Jaques with envy viewed,
5. Not even that clown could amplify,
6. On this trite text, so long as I.
7. Eleven years we now may tell,
8. Since we have known each other well;
9. Since, riding side by side, our hand,
10. First drew the voluntary brand;
11. And sure, through many a varied scene,
12. Unkindness never came between.
13. Away these winged years have flown,
14. To join the mass of ages gone;
15. And though deep marked, like all below,
16. With checkered shades of joy and woe;
17. Though thou o'er realms and seas hast ranged,
18. Marked cities lost, and empires changed,
19. While here, at home, my narrower ken
20. Somewhat of manners saw, and men;
21. Though varying wishes, hopes, and fears,
22. Fevered the progress of these years,
23. Yet now, days, weeks, and months but seem
24. The recollection of a dream,
25. So still we glide down to the sea
26. Of fathomless eternity.
27. Even now it scarcely seems a day,
28. Since first I tuned this idle lay;
29. A task so often thrown aside,
30. When leisure graver cares denied,
31. That now, November's dreary gale,
32. Whose voice inspired my opening tale,
33. That same November gale once more
34. Whirls the dry leaves on Yarrow shore.
35. Their vexed boughs streaming to the sky,
36. Once more our naked birches sigh,
37. And Blackhouse heights, and Ettrick Pen,
38. Have donned their wintry shrouds again:
39. And mountain dark, and flooded mead,
40. Bid us forsake the banks of Tweed.
41. Earlier than wont along the sky,
42. Mixed with the rack, the snow mists fly;
43. The shepherd, who in summer sun,
44. Had something of our envy won,
45. As thou with pencil, I with pen,
46. The features traced of hill and glen; -
47. He who, outstretched the livelong day,
48. At ease among the heath-flowers lay,
49. Viewed the light clouds with vacant look,
50. Or slumbered o'er his tattered book,
51. Or idly busied him to guide
52. His angle o'er the lessened tide; -
53. At midnight now, the snowy plain
54. Finds sterner labour for the swain.
55. When red hath set the beamless sun,
56. Through heavy vapours dark and dun;
57. When the tired ploughman, dry and warm,
58. Hears, half-asleep, the rising storm
59. Hurling the hail, and sleeted rain,
60. Against the casement's tinkling pane;
61. The sounds that drive wild deer, and fox,
62. To shelter in the brake and rocks,
63. Are warnings which the shepherd ask
64. To dismal and to dangerous task.
65. Oft he looks forth, and hopes, in vain,
66. The blast may sink in mellowing rain;
67. Till, dark above, and white below,
68. Decided drives the flaky snow,
69. And forth the hardy swain must go.
70. Long, with dejected look and whine,
71. To leave the hearth his dogs repine;
72. Whistling and cheering them to aid,
73. Around his back he wreathes the plaid:
74. His flock he gathers, and he guides,
75. To open downs, and mountain-sides,
76. Where, fiercest though the tempest blow,
77. Least deeply lies the drift below.
78. The blast that whistles o'er the fells,
79. Stiffens his locks to icicles;
80. Oft he looks back, while, streaming far,
81. His cottage window seems a star -
82. Loses its feeble gleam,-and then
83. Turns patient to the blast again,
84. And, facing to the tempest's sweep,
85. Drives through the gloom his lagging sheep.
86. If fails his heart, if his limbs fail,
87. Benumbing death is in the gale:
88. His paths, his landmarks, all unknown,
89. Close to the hut, no more his own,
90. Close to the aid he sought in vain,
91. The morn may find the stiffened swain:
92. The widow sees, at dawning pale,
93. His orphans raise their feeble wail:
94. And, close beside him, in the snow,
95. Poor Yarrow, partner of their woe,
96. Couches upon his master's breast,
97. And licks his cheek to break his rest.
98. Who envies now the shepherd's lot,
99. His healthy fare, his rural cot,
100. His summer couch by greenwood tree,
101. His rustic kirn's loud revelry,
102. His native hill-notes tuned on high,
103. To Marion of the blithesome eye;
104. His crook, his scrip, his oaten reed,
105. And all Arcadia's golden creed?
106. Changes not so with us, my Skene,
107. Of human life the varying scene?
108. Our youthful summer oft we see
109. Dance by on wings of game and glee,
110. While the dark storm reserves its rage,
111. Against the winter of our age:
112. As he, the ancient Chief of Troy,
113. His manhood spent in peace and joy;
114. But Grecian fires, and loud alarms,
115. Called ancient Priam forth to arms.
116. Then happy those, since each must drain
117. His share of pleasure, share of pain,
118. Then happy those, beloved of Heaven,
119. To whom the mingled cup is given;
120. Whose lenient sorrows find relief,
121. Whose joys are chastened by their grief.
122. And such a lot, my Skene, was thine,
123. When thou, of late, wert doomed to twine -
124. Just when thy bridal hour was by -
125. The cypress with the myrtle tie.
126. Just on thy bride her sire had smiled,
127. And blessed the union of his child,
128. When Love must change its joyous cheer,
129. And wipe Affection's filial tear.
130. Nor did the actions next his end,
131. Speak more the father than the friend:
132. Scarce had lamented Forbes paid
133. The tribute to his minstrel's shade;
134. The tale of friendship scarce was told,
135. Ere the narrator's heart was cold -
136. Far may we search before we find
137. A heart so manly and so kind!
138. But not around his honoured urn
139. Shall friends alone and kindred mourn;
140. The thousand eyes his care had dried,
141. Pour at his name a bitter tide;
142. And frequent falls the grateful dew,
143. For benefits the world ne'er knew.
144. If mortal charity dare claim
145. The Almighty's attributed name,
146. Inscribe above his mouldering clay,
147. 'The widow's shield, the orphan's stay.'
148. Nor, though it wake thy sorrow, deem
149. My verse intrudes on this sad theme;
150. For sacred was the pen that wrote,
151. 'Thy father's friend forget thou not:'
152. And grateful title may I plead,
153. For many a kindly word and deed,
154. To bring my tribute to his grave:-
155. 'Tis little-but 'tis all I have.
156. To thee, perchance, this rambling strain
157. Recalls our summer walks again;
158. When, doing naught-and, to speak true,
159. Not anxious to find aught to do -
160. The wild unbounded hills we ranged,
161. While oft our talk its topic changed,
162. And, desultory as our way,
163. Ranged, unconfined, from grave to gay.
164. Even when it flagged, as oft will chance,
165. No effort made to break its trance,
166. We could right pleasantly pursue
167. Our sports in social silence too;
168. Thou gravely labouring to portray
169. The blighted oak's fantastic spray;
170. I spelling o'er, with much delight,
171. The legend of that antique knight,
172. Tirante by name, ycleped the White.
173. At either's feet a trusty squire,
174. Pandour and Camp, with eyes of fire,
175. Jealous, each other's motions viewed,
176. And scarce suppressed their ancient feud.
177. The laverock whistled from the cloud;
178. The stream was lively, but not loud;
179. From the white thorn the Mayflower shed
180. Its dewy fragrance round our head:
181. Not Ariel lived more merrily
182. Under the blossomed bough than we.
183. And blithesome nights, too, have been ours,
184. When winter stript the summer's bowers.
185. Careless we heard, what now I hear,
186. The wild blast sighing deep and drear,
187. When fires were bright, and lamps beamed gay,
188. And ladies tuned the lovely lay;
189. And he was held a laggard soul,
190. Who shunned to quaff the sparkling bowl.
191. Then he, whose absence we deplore,
192. Who breathes the gales of Devon's shore,
193. The longer missed, bewailed the more;
194. And thou, and I, and dear-loved Rae,
195. And one whose name I may not say -
196. For not Mimosa's tender tree
197. Shrinks sooner from the touch than he -
198. In merry chorus well combined,
199. With laughter drowned the whistling wind.
200. Mirth was within; and Care without
201. Might gnaw her nails to hear our shout.
202. Not but amid the buxom scene
203. Some grave discourse might intervene -
204. Of the good horse that bore him best,
205. His shoulder, hoof, and arching crest:
206. For, like mad Tom's, our chiefest care,
207. Was horse to ride, and weapon wear.
208. Such nights we've had; and, though the game
209. Of manhood be more sober tame,
210. And though the field-day, or the drill,
211. Seem less important now-yet still
212. Such may we hope to share again.
213. The sprightly thought inspires my strain!
214. And mark how, like a horseman true,
215. Lord Marmion's march I thus renew.
