1. The toils are pitched, and the stakes are set,
2. Ever sing merrily, merrily;
3. The bows they bend, and the knives they whet,
4. Hunters live so cheerily.

5. It was a stag, a stag of ten,
6. Bearing its branches sturdily;
7. He came silently down the glen,
8. Ever sing hardily, hardily.

9. It was there he met with a wounded doe,
10. She was bleeding deathfully;
11. She warned him of the toils below,
12. O so faithfully, faithfully!

13. He had an eye, and he could heed,
14. Ever sing so warily, warily;
15. He had a foot, and he could speed--
16. Hunters watch so narrowly.
