1. On Ettrick Forest's mountains dun
2. 'Tis blithe to hear the sportsman's gun,
3. And seek the heath-frequenting brood
4. Far through the noonday solitude;
5. By many a cairn and trenched mound,
6. Where chiefs of yore sleep lone and sound,
7. And springs, where grey-hair'd shepherds tell
8. That still the fairies love to dwell.

9. Along the silver streams of Tweed
10. 'Tis blithe the mimic fly to lead,
11. When to the hook the salmon springs,
12. And the line whistles through the rings;
13. The boiling eddy see him try,
14. Then dashing from the current high,
15. Till watchful eye and cautious hand
16. Have led his wasted strength to land.

17. 'Tis blithe along the midnight tide
18. With stalwart arm the boat to guide;
19. On high the dazzling blaze to rear,
20. And heedful plunge the barbed spear:
21. Rock, wood, and scaur, emerging bright,
22. Fling on the stream their ruddy light,
23. And from the bank our band appears
24. Like Genii, arm'd with fiery spears.

25. 'Tis blithe at eve to tell the tale,
26. How we succeed, and how we fail,
27. Whether at Alwyn's lordly meal,
28. Or lowlier board of Ashestiel;
29. While the gay tapers cheerly shine,
30. Bickers the fire, and fhws the wineâ€”
31. Days free from thought, and nights from care,
32. My blessing on the Forest fair!
