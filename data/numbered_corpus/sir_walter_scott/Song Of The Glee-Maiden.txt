1. Yes, thou mayst sigh,
2. And look once more at all around,
3. At stream and bank, and sky and ground.
4. Thy life its final course has found,
5. And thou must die.

6. Yes, lay thee down,
7. And while thy struggling pulses flutter,
8. Bid the grey monk his soul mass mutter,
9. And the deep bell its death tone utter-
10. Thy life is gone.

11. Be not afraid.
12. 'Tis but a pang, and then a thrill,
13. A fever fit, and then a chill,
14. And then an end of human ill,
15. For thou art dead.
