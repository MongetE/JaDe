1. Soft spread the southern sumer night
2. Her veil of darksome blue;
3. Ten thousand stars combined to light
4. The terrace of Saint Cloud.

5. The evening breezes gently sigh'd,
6. Like breath of lover true,
7. Bewailing the deserted pride
8. And wreck of sweet Saint Cloud.

9. The drum's deep roll was heard afar,
10. The bugle wildly blew
11. Good-night to Hulan and Hussar
12. That garrison Saint Cloud.

13. The startled Naiads from the shade
14. With broken urns withdrew
15. And silenced was that proud cascade,
16. The glory of Saint Cloud.

17. We sate upon its steps of stone,
18. Nor could its silence rue
19. When waked, to music of our own,
20. The echoes of Saint Cloud.

21. Slow Seine might hear each lovely note
22. Fall light as summer dew
23. While through the moonless air they float
24. Prolong'd from fair Saint Cloud.

25. And sure a melody more sweet
26. His waters never knew,
27. Though music's self was wont to meet
28. With Princes at Saint Cloud.

29. Nor then, with more delighted ear,
30. The circle round her drew,
31. Than ours, when gather'd round to hear
32. Our songstress at Saint Cloud.

33. Few happy hours poor mortals pass-â€”
34. Then give those hours their due,
35. And rank among the foremost class
36. Our evenings at Saint Cloud.
