1. I.
2. The hunting tribes of air and earth
3. Respect the brethren of their birth;
4. Nature, who loves the claim of kind,
5. Less cruel chase to each assign'd.
6. The falcon, poised on soaring wing,
7. Watches the wild-duck by the spring;
8. The slow-hound wakes the fox's lair;
9. The greyhound presses on the hare;
10. The eagle pounces on the lamb;
11. The wolf devours the fleecy dam:
12. Even tiger fell, and sullen bear,
13. Their likeness and their lineage spare,
14. Man, only, mars kind Nature's plan,
15. And turns the fierce pursuit on man;
16. Plying war's desultory trade,
17. Incursion, flight, and ambuscade,
18. Since Nimrod, Cush's mighty son,
19. At first the bloody game begun.

20. II.
21. The Indian, prowling for his prey,
22. Who hears the settlers track his way,
23. And knows in distant forest far
24. Camp his red brethren of the war;
25. He, when each double and disguise
26. To baffle the pursuit he tries,
27. Low crouching now his head to hide,
28. Where swampy streams through rushes glide
29. Now covering with the wither'd leaves
30. The foot-prints that the dew receives;
31. He, skill'd in every sylvan guile,
32. Knows not, nor tries, such various wile,
33. As Risingham, when on the wind
34. Arose the loud pursuit behind.
35. In Redesdale his youth had heard
36. Each art her wily dalesmen dared,
37. When Rooken-edge, and Redswair high,
38. To bugle rung and bloodhound's cry,
39. Announcing Jedwood-axe and spear,
40. And Lid'sdale riders in the rear;
41. And well his venturous life had proved
42. The lessons that his childhood loved.

43. III.
44. Oft had he shown, in climes afar
45. Each attribute of roving war;
46. The sharpen'd ear, the piercing eye,
47. The quick resolve in danger nigh;
48. The speed, that in the flight or chase,
49. Outstripp'd the Charib's rapid race;
50. The steady brain, the sinewy limb,
51. To leap, to climb, to dive, to swim;
52. The iron frame, inured to bear
53. Each dire inclemency of air,
54. Nor less confirm'd to undergo
55. Fatigue's faint chill, and famine's throe.
56. These arts he proved, his life to save,
57. In peril oft by land and wave,
58. On Arawaca's desert shore,
59. Or where La Plata's billows roar,
60. When oft the sons of vengeful Spain
61. Track'd the marauder's steps in vain.
62. These arts, in Indian warfare tried,
63. Must save him now by Greta's side.

64. IV.
65. â€˜Twas then, in hour of utmost need,
66. He proved his courage, art, and speed.
67. Now slow he stalk'd with stealthy pace,
68. Now started forth in rapid race,
69. Oft doubling back in mazy train,
70. To blind the trace the dews retain;
71. Now clombe the rocks projecting high,
72. To baffle the pursuer's eye;
73. Now sought the stream, whose brawling sound
74. The echo of his footsteps drown'd.
75. But if the forest verge he nears,
76. There trample steeds, and glimmer spears;
77. If deeper down the copse he drew,
78. He heard the rangers' loud halloo,
79. Beating each cover while they came,
80. As if to start the sylvan game.
81. Twas then-like tiger close beset
82. At every pass with toil and net,
83. Counter'd, where'er he turns his glare,
84. By clashing arms and torches' flare,
85. Who meditates, with furious bound,
86. To burst on hunter, horse, and hound,
87. 'Twas then that Bertram's soul arose,
88. Prompting to rush upon his foes:
89. But as that crouching tiger, cow'd
90. By brandish'd steel and shouting crowd,
91. Retreats beneath the jungle's shroud,
92. Bertram suspends his purpose stern,
93. And couches in the brake and fern,
94. Hiding his face, lest foemen spy
95. The sparkle of his swarthy eye.

96. V.
97. Then Bertram might the bearing trace
98. Of the bold youth who led the chase;
99. Who paused to list for every sound,
100. Climb'd every height to look around,
101. Then rushing on with naked sword,
102. Each dingle's bosky depths explored.
103. â€˜Twas Redmond-by the azure eye;
104. â€˜Twas Redmond-by the locks that fly
105. Disorder'd from his glowing cheek;
106. Mien, face, and form, young Redmond speak.
107. A form more active, light, and strong,
108. Ne'er shot the ranks of war along;
109. The modest, yet the manly mien,
110. Might grace the court of maiden queen;
111. A face more fair you well might find,
112. For Redmond's knew the sun and wind,
113. Nor boasted, from their tinge when free,
114. The charm of regularity;
115. But every feature had the power
116. To aid the expression of the hour:
117. Whether gay wit, and humour sly,
118. Danced laughing in his light-blue eye;
119. Or bended brow, and glance of fire,
120. And kindling cheek, spoke Erin's ire;
121. Or soft and sadden'd glances show
122. Her ready sympathy with woe;
123. Or in that wayward mood of mind,
124. When various feelings are combined,
125. When joy and sorrow mingle near,
126. And hope's bright wings are check'd by fear,
127. And rising doubts keep transport down,
128. And anger lends a short-lived frown;
129. In that strange mood which maids approve
130. Even when they dare not call it love;
131. With every change his features play'd,
132. As aspens show the light and shade.

133. VI.
134. Well Risingham young Redmond knew:
135. And much he marvell'd that the crew,
136. Roused to revenge bold Mortham dead,
137. Were by that Mortham's foeman led;
138. For never felt his soul the woe,
139. That wails a generous foeman low,
140. Far less that sense of justice strong,
141. That wreaks a generous foeman's wrong.
142. But small his leisure now to pause;
143. Redmond is first, whate'er the cause:
144. And twice that Redmond came so near
145. Where Bertram couch'd like hunted deer,
146. The very boughs his steps displace,
147. Rustled against the ruffian's face,
148. Who, desperate, twice prepared to start,
149. And plunge his dagger in his heart!
150. But Redmond turn'd a different way,
151. And the bent boughs resumed their sway,
152. And Bertram held it wise, unseen,
153. Deeper to plunge in coppice green.
154. Thus, circled in his coil, the snake,
155. When roving hunters beat the brake,
156. Watches with red and glistening eye,
157. Prepared, if heedless step draw nigh,
158. With forked tongue and venom'd fang
159. Instant to dart the deadly pang;
160. But if the intruders turn aside,
161. Away his coils unfolded glide,
162. And through the deep savannah wind,
163. Some undisturb'd retreat to find.

164. VII.
165. But Bertram, as he backward drew,
166. And heard the loud pursuit renew,
167. And Redmond's hollo on the wind,
168. Oft mutterd in his savage mind
169. 'Redmond O'Neale! were thou and I
170. Alone this day's event to try,
171. With not a second here to see,
172. But the gray cliff and oaken tree,
173. That voice of thine, that shouts so loud,
174. Should ne'er repeat its summons proud!
175. No! nor e'er try its melting power
176. Again in maiden's summer bower.'
177. Eluded, now behind him die,
178. Faint and more faint, each hostile cry;
179. He stands in Scargill wood alone,
180. Nor hears he now a harsher tone
181. Than the hoarse cushat's plaintive cry,
182. Or Greta's sound that murmurs by;
183. And on the dale, so lone and wild,
184. The summer sun in quiet smiled.

185. VIII.
186. He listen'd long with anxious heart,
187. Ear bent to hear, and foot to start,
188. And, while his stretch'd attention glows,
189. Refused his weary frame repose.
190. â€˜Twas silence all-he laid him down,
191. Where purple heath profusely strown,
192. And throatwort with its azure bell,
193. And moss and thyme his cushion swell.
194. There, spent with toil, he listless eyed
195. The course of Greta's playful tide;
196. Beneath, her banks now edding dun,
197. Now brightly gleaming to the sun,
198. As, dancing over rock and stone,
199. In yellow light her currents shone,
200. Matching in hue the favourite gem
201. Of Albin's mountain-diadem.
202. Then, tired to watch the current's play,
203. He turn'd his weary eyes away,
204. To where the bank opposing show'd
205. Its huge, square cliffs through shaggy wood.
206. One, prominent above the rest,
207. Rear'd to the sun its pale gray breast;
208. Around its broken summit grew
209. The hazel rude, and sable yew;
210. A thousand varied lichens dyed
211. Its waste and weather-beaten side,
212. And round its rugged basis lay,
213. By time or thunder rent away,
214. Fragments, that, from its frontlet torn,
215. Were mantled now by verdant thorn.
216. Such was the scene's wild majesty,
217. That fill'd stern Bertram's gazing eye.

218. IX.
219. In sullen mood he lay reclined,
220. Revolving, in his stormy mind,
221. The felon deed, the fruitless guilt,
222. His patron's blood by treason spilt;
223. A crime, it seem'd, so dire and dread,
224. That it had power to wake the dead.
225. Then, pondering on his life betray'd
226. By Oswald's art to Redmond's blade,
227. In treacherous purpose to withhold,
228. So seem'd it, Mortham's promised gold,
229. A deep and full revenge he vow'd
230. On Redmond, forward, fierce, and proud;
231. Revenge on Wilfrid-on his sire
232. Redoubled vengeance, swift and dire!
233. If, in such mood, (as legends say,
234. And well believed that simple day,)
235. The enemy of Man has power
236. To profit by the evil hour,
237. Here stood a wretch, prepared to change
238. His soul's redemption for revenge!
239. But though his vows, with such a fire
240. Of earnest and intense desire
241. For vengeance dark and fell, were made,
242. As well might reach hell's lowest shade,
243. No deeper clouds the grove embrown'd,
244. No nether thunders shook the ground;
245. The demon knew his vassal's heart,
246. And spared temptation's needless art.

247. X.
248. Oft, mingled with the direful theme,
249. Came Mortham's form-Was it a dream?
250. Or had he seen, in vision true,
251. That very Mortham whom he slew?
252. Or had in living flesh appear'd
253. The only man on earth he fear'd?
254. To try the mystic cause intent,
255. His eyes, that on the cliff were bent,
256. Counter'd at once a dazzling glance,
257. Like sunbeam flash'd from sword or lance.
258. At once he started as for fight,
259. But not a foeman was in sight;
260. He heard the cushat's murmur hoarse,
261. He heard the river's sounding course;
262. The solitary woodlands lay,
263. As slumbering in the summer ray.
264. He gazed, like lion roused, around,
265. Then sunk again upon the ground.
266. Twas but, he thought, some fitful beam,
267. Glanced sudden from the sparkling stream;
268. Then plunged him in his gloomy train
269. Of ill-connected thoughts again,
270. Until a voice behind him cried,
271. 'Bertram! well met on Greta side.'

272. XI.
273. Instant his sword was in his hand,
274. As instant sunk the ready brand;
275. Yet, dubious still, opposed he stood
276. To him that issued from the wood:
277. 'Guy Denzil!-is it thou?' he said;
278. 'Do we two meet in Scargill shade!
279. Stand back a space!-thy purpose show,
280. Whether thou comest as friend or foe.
281. Report hath said, that Denzil's name
282. From Rokeby's band was razed with shame.'
283. 'A shame I owe that hot O'Neale,
284. Who told his knight, in peevish zeal,
285. Of my marauding on the clowns
286. Of Calverley and Bradford downs.
287. I reck not. In a war to strive,
288. Where, save the leaders, none can thrive,
289. Suits ill my mood; and better game
290. Awaits us both, if thou'rt the same
291. Unscrupulous, bold Risingham,
292. Who watch'd with me in midnight dark,
293. To snatch a deer from Rokeby-park.
294. How think'st thou?'-'Speak thy purpose out;
295. I love not mystery or doubt.'

296. XII.
297. 'Then, list.-Not far there lurk a crew
298. Of trusty comrades, stanch and true,
299. Glean'd from both factions-Roundheads, freed
300. From cant of sermon and of creed;
301. And Cavaliers, whose souls, like mine,
302. Spurn at the bonds of discipline.
303. Wiser, we judge, by dale and wold,
304. A warfare of our own to hold,
305. Than breathe our last on battle-down,
306. For cloak or surplice, mace or crown.
307. Our schemes are laid, our purpose set,
308. A chief and leader lack we yet.
309. Thou art a wanderer, it is said;
310. For Mortham's death, thy steps waylaid,
311. Thy head at price-so say our spies,
312. Who range the valley in disguise.
313. Join then with us:-though wild debate
314. And wrangling rend our infant state,
315. Each to an equal loath to bow,
316. Will yield to chief renown'd as thou.'

317. XI1I.
318. 'Even now,' thought Bertram, 'passion-stirr'd,
319. I call'd on hell, and hell has heard!
320. What lack I, vengeance to command,
321. But of stanch comrades such a band?
322. This Denzil, vow'd to every evil,
323. Might read a lesson to the devil.
324. Well, be it so! each knave and fool
325. Shall serve as my revenge's tool.'
326. Aloud, 'I take thy proffer, Guy,
327. But tell me where thy comrades lie?'
328. 'Not far from hence,' Guy Denzil said;
329. 'Descend, and cross the river's bed,
330. Where rises yonder cliff so grey.'
331. 'Do thou,' said Bertram, 'lead the way.'
332. Then mutter'd, 'It is best make sure;
333. Guy Denzil's faith was never pure.'
334. He follow'd down the deep descent,
335. Then through the Greta's streams they went;
336. And, when they reach'd the farther shore,
337. They stood the lonely cliff before.

338. XIV.
339. With wonder Bertram heard within
340. The flinty rock a murmur'd din;
341. But when Guy pull'd the wilding spray,
342. And brambles, from its base away,
343. He saw, appearing to the air,
344. A little entrance, low and square,
345. Like opening cell of hermit lone,
346. Dark, winding through the living stone.
347. Here enter'd Denzil, Bertram here;
348. And loud and louder on their ear,
349. As from the bowels of the earth,
350. Resounded shouts of boisterous mirth.
351. Of old, the cavern strait and rude,
352. In slaty rock the peasant hew'd;
353. And Brignall's woods, and Scargill's wave,
354. E'en now, o'er many a sister cave,
355. Where, far within the darksome rift,
356. The wedge and lever ply their thrift.
357. But war had silenced rural trade,
358. And the deserted mine was made
359. The banquet-hall and fortress too,
360. Of Denzil and his desperate crew.
361. There Guilt his anxious revel kept;
362. There, on his sordid pallet, slept
363. Guilt-born Excess, the goblet drain'd
364. Still in his slumbering grasp retain'd;
365. Regret was there, his eye still cast
366. With vain repining on the past;
367. Among the feasters waited near
368. Sorrow, and unrepentant Fear,
369. And Blasphemy, to frenzy driven,
370. With his own crimes reproaching heaven;
371. While Bertram show'd, amid the crew,
372. The Master-Fiend that Milton drew.

373. XV.
374. Hark! the loud revel wakes again,
375. To greet the leader of the train.
376. Behold the group by the pale lamp,
377. That struggles with the earthy damp.
378. By what strange features Vice hath known,
379. To single out and mark her own!
380. Yet some there are, whose brows retain
381. Less deeply stamp'd her brand and stain.
382. See yon pale stripling! when a boy,
383. A mother's pride, a father's joy!
384. Now, 'gainst the vault's rude walls reclined,
385. An early image fills his mind:
386. The cottage, once his sire's, he sees,
387. Embower'd upon the banks of Tees;
388. He views sweet Winston's woodland scene,
389. And shares the dance on Gainford-green.
390. A tear is springing-but the zest
391. Of some wild tale, or brutal jest,
392. Hath to loud laughter stirr'd the rest.
393. On him they call, the aptest mate
394. For jovial song and merry feat:
395. Fast flies his dream-with dauntless air,
396. As one victorious o'er Despair,
397. He bids the ruddy cup go round,
398. Till sense and sorrow both are drown'd;
399. And soon, in merry wassail, he,
400. The life of all their revelry,
401. Peals his loud song!-The muse has found
402. Her blossoms on the wildest ground,
403. Mid noxious weeds at random strew'd,
404. Themselves all profitless and rude.
405. With desperate merriment he sung,
406. The cavern to the chorus rung;
407. Yet mingled with his reckless glee
408. Remorse's bitter agony.

409. XVI.
410. SONG.

411. O, Brignall banks are wild and fair,
412. And Greta woods are green,
413. And you may gather garlands there,
414. Would grace a summer queen.
415. And as I rode by Dalton-hall,
416. Beneath the turrets high,
417. A Maiden on the castle wall
418. Was singing merrily,

419. CHORUS.
420. 'O, Brignall banks are fresh and fair,
421. And Greta woods are green;
422. I'd rather rove with Edmund there,
423. Than reign our English queen.'

424. If, Maiden, thou wouldst wend with me,
425. To leave both tower and town,
426. Thou first must guess what life lead we,
427. That dwell by dale and down.
428. And if thou canst that riddle read,
429. As read full well you may,
430. Then to the greenwood shalt thou speed,
431. As blithe as Queen of May.'

432. CHORUS.
433. Yet sung she, 'Brignall banks are fair,
434. And Greta woods are green;
435. I'd rather rove with Edmund there,
436. Than reign our English queen.

437. XVII.
438. 'I read you, by your bugle-horn,
439. And by your palfrey good,
440. I read you for a Ranger sworn,
441. To keep the king's greenwood.'-
442. 'A ranger, lady, winds his horn,
443. And 'tis at peep of light;
444. His blast is heard at merry morn,
445. And mine at dead of night.'

446. CHORUS.
447. Yet sung she, 'Brignall banks are fair,
448. And Greta woods are gay;
449. I would I were with Edmund there,
450. To reign his Queen of May!

451. 'With burnish'd brand and musketoon,
452. So gallantly you come,
453. I read you for a bold Dragoon,
454. That lists the tuck of drum.'
455. 'I list no more the tuck of drum,
456. No more the trumpet hear;
457. But when the beetle sounds his hum,
458. My comrades take the spear.

459. CHORUS.
460. 'And, O! though Brignall banks be fair,
461. And Greta woods be gay,
462. Yet mickle must the maiden dare,
463. Would reign my Queen of May!

464. XV1II.
465. 'Maiden! a nameless life I lead,
466. A nameless death I'll die;
467. The fiend, whose lantern lights the mead,
468. Were better mate than I!
469. And when I'm with my comrades met,
470. Beneath the reenwood bough,
471. What once we were we all forget,
472. Nor think what we are now.

473. CHORUS.
474. 'Yet Brignall banks are fresh and fair,
475. And Greta woods are green,
476. And you may gather garlands there
477. Would grace a summer queen.'

478. When Edmund ceased his simple song,
479. Was silence on the sullen throng,
480. Till waked some ruder mate their glee
481. With note of coarser minstrelsy.
482. But, far apart, in dark divan,
483. Denzil and Bertram many a plan,
484. Of import foul and fierce, design'd,
485. While still on Bertram's grasping mind
486. The wealth of murder'd Mortham hung;
487. Though half he fear'd his daring tongue,
488. When it should give his wishes birth,
489. Might raise a spectre from the earth!

490. XIX.
491. At length his wondrous tale he told:
492. When, scornful, smiled his comrade bold;
493. For, train'd in license of a court,
494. Religion's self was Denzil's sport;
495. Then judge in what contempt he held
496. The visionary tales of eld!
497. His awe for Bertram scarce repress'd
498. The unbeliever's sneering jest.
499. ''Twere hard,' he said, ' for sage or seer,
500. To spell the subject of your fear;
501. Nor do I boast the art renown'd,
502. Vision and omen to expound.
503. Yet, faith if I must needs afford
504. To spectre watching treasured hoard,
505. As bandog keeps his master's roof,
506. Bidding the plunderer stand aloof,
507. This doubt remains-thy goblin gaunt
508. Hath chosen ill his ghostly haunt;
509. For why his guard on Mortham hold,
510. When Rokeby castle hath the gold
511. Thy patron won on Indian soil,
512. By stealth, by piracy, and spoil?'

513. XX.
514. At this he paused-for angry shame
515. Lower'd on the brow of Risingham.
516. He blush'd to think, that he should seem
517. Assertor of an airy dream,
518. And gave his wrath another theme.
519. 'Denzil,' he says, 'though lowly laid,
520. Wrong not the memory of the dead;
521. For, while he lived, at Mortham's look
522. Thy very soul, Guy Denzil, shook!
523. And when he tax'd thy breach of word
524. To yon fair Rose of Allenford,
525. I saw thee crouch like chasten'd hound,
526. Whose back the huntsman's lash hath found.
527. Nor dare to call his foreign wealth
528. The spoil of piracy or stealth;
529. He won it bravely with his brand,
530. When Spain waged warfare with our land.
531. Mark, too-I brook no idle jeer,
532. Nor couple Bertram's name with fear;
533. Mine is but half the demon's lot,
534. For I believe, but tremble not.
535. Enough of this.-Say, why this hoard
536. Thou deem'st at Rokeby castle stored;
537. Or think'st that Mortham would bestow
538. His treasure with his faction's foe?'

539. XXI.
540. Soon quench'd was Denzil's ill-timed mirth;
541. Rather he would have seen the earth
542. Give to ten thousand spectres birth,
543. Than venture to awake to flame
544. The deadly wrath of Risingham.
545. Submiss he answer'd,-' Mortham's mind,
546. Thou know'st, to joy was ill inclined.
547. In youth, 'tis said, a gallant free,
548. A lusty reveller was he;
549. But since return'd from over sea,
550. A sullen and a silent mood
551. Hath numb'd the current of his blood.
552. Hence he refused each kindly call
553. To Rokeby's hospitable hall,
554. And our stout knight, at dawn of morn
555. Who loved to hear the bugle-horn,
556. Nor less, when eve his oaks embrown'd,
557. To see the ruddy cup go round,
558. Took umbrage that a friend so near
559. Refused to share his chase and cheer;
560. Thus did the kindred barons jar,
561. Ere they divided in the war.
562. Yet, trust me, friend, Matilda fair
563. Of Mortham's wealth is destined heir.'

564. XXII.
565. 'Destined to her! to yon slight maid!
566. The prize my life had wellnigh paid,
567. When 'gainst Laroche, by Cayo's wave,
568. I fought my patron's wealth to save!
569. Denzil, I knew him long, yet ne'er
570. Knew him that joyous cavalier,
571. Whom youthful friends and early fame
572. Call'd soul of gallantry and game.
573. A moody man, he sought our crew,
574. Desperate and dark, whom no one knew;
575. And rose, as men with us must rise,
576. By scorning life and all its ties.
577. On each adventure rash he roved,
578. As danger for itself he loved;
579. On his sad brow nor mirth nor wine
580. Could e'er one wrinkled knot untwine;
581. Ill was the omen if he smiled,
582. For 'twas in peril stern and wild;
583. But when he laugh'd, each luckless mate
584. Might hold our fortune desperate.
585. Foremost he fought in every broil,
586. Then scornful turn'd him from the spoil;
587. Nay, often strove to bar the way
588. Between his comrades and their prey;
589. Preaching, even then, to such as we,
590. Hot with our dear-bought victory,
591. Of mercy and humanity.

592. XXIII.
593. 'I loved him well-His fearless part,
594. His gallant leading, won my heart.
595. And after each victorious fight,
596. 'Twas I that wrangled for his right,
597. Redeem'd his portion of the prey
598. That greedier mates had torn away:
599. In field and storm thrice saved his life,
600. And once amid our comrades' strife.
601. Yes, I have loved thee! Well hath proved
602. My toil, my danger, how I loved!
603. Yet will I mourn no more thy fate,
604. Ingrate in life, in death ingrate.
605. Rise if thou canst!' he look'd around,
606. And sternly stamp'd upon the ground
607. 'Rise, with thy bearing proud and high,
608. Even as this morn it met mine eye,
609. And give me, if thou darest, the lie!'
610. He paused-then, calm and passion-freed,
611. Bade Denzil with his tale proceed.

612. XXIV.
613. 'Bertram, to thee I need not tell,
614. What thou hast cause to wot so well,
615. How Superstition's nets were twined
616. Around the Lord of Mortham's mind;
617. But since he drove thee from his tower,
618. A maid he found in Greta's bower,
619. Whose speech, like David's harp, had sway,
620. To charm his evil fiend away.
621. I know not if her features moved
622. Remembrance of the wife he loved;
623. But he would gaze upon her eye,
624. Till his mood soften'd to a sigh.
625. He, whom no living mortal sought
626. To question of his secret thought,
627. Now every thought and care confess'd
628. To his fair niece's faithful breast;
629. Nor was there aught of rich and rare,
630. In earth, in ocean, or in air,
631. But it must deck Matilda's hair.
632. Her love still bound him unto life;
633. But then awoke the civil strife,
634. And menials bore, by his commands,
635. Three coffers, with their iron bands,
636. From Mortham's vault, at midnight deep,
637. To her lone bower in Rokeby-Keep,
638. Ponderous with gold and plate of pride,
639. His gift, if he in battle died.'

640. XXV.
641. 'Then Denzil, as I guess, lays train,
642. These iron-banded chests to gain;
643. Else, wherefore should he hover here,
644. Where many a peril waits him near,
645. For all his feats of war and peace,
646. For plunder'd boors, and harts of greese?
647. Since through the hamlets as he fared,
648. What hearth has Guy's marauding spared,
649. Or where the chase that hath not rung
650. With Denzil's bow, at midnight strung?'
651. 'I hold my wont-my rangers go,
652. Even now to track a milk-white doe.
653. By Rokeby-hall she takes her lair,
654. In Greta wood she harbours fair,
655. And when my huntsman marks her way,
656. What think'st thou, Bertram, of the prey?
657. Were Rokeby's daughter in our power,
658. We rate her ransom at her dower.'

659. XXVI.
660. 'Tis well!-there's vengeance in the thought,
661. Matilda is by Wilfrid sought;
662. And hot-brain'd Redmond, too, 'tis said,
663. Pays lover's homage to the maid.
664. Bertram she scorn'd-If met by chance,
665. She turn'd from me her shuddering glance,
666. Like a nice dame, that will not brook
667. On what she hates and loathes to look;
668. She told to Mortham she could ne'er
669. Behold me without secret fear,
670. Foreboding evil:-She may rue
671. To find her prophecy fall true!
672. The war has weeded Rokeby's train,
673. Few followers in his halls remain;
674. If thy scheme miss, then, brief and bold,
675. We are enow to storm the hold;
676. Bear off the plunder, and the dame,
677. And leave the castle all in flame.'

678. XXVII.
679. 'Still art thou Valour's venturous son!
680. Yet ponder first the risk to run:
681. The menials of the castle, true,
682. And stubborn to their charge, though few;
683. The wall to scale-the moat to cross-
684. The wicket-grate-the inner fosse.'
685. 'Fool! if we blench for toys like these,
686. On what fair guerdon can we seize?
687. Our hardiest venture, to explore
688. Some wretched peasant's fenceless door,
689. And the best prize we bear away,
690. The earnings of his sordid day.'
691. 'A while thy hasty taunt forbear:
692. In sight of road more sure and fair,
693. Thou wouldst not choose, in blindfold wrath,
694. Or wantonness, a desperate path?
695. List, then;-for vantage or assault,
696. From gilded vane to dungeon-vault,
697. Each pass of Rokeby-house I know:
698. There is one postern, dark and low,
699. That issues at a secret spot,
700. By most neglected or forgot.
701. Now, could a spial of our train
702. On fair pretext admittance gain,
703. That sally-port might be unbarr'd:
704. Then, vain were battlement and ward!'

705. XXVIII.
706. 'Now speak'st thou well:-to me the same,
707. If force or art shall urge the game;
708. Indifferent, if like fox I wind,
709. Or spring like tiger on the hind.
710. But, hark! our merry-men so gay
711. Troll forth another roundelay.'

712. SONG.
713. 'A weary lot is thine, fair maid,
714. A weary lot is thine!
715. To pull the thorn thy brow to braid,
716. And press the rue for wine!
717. A lightsome eye, a soldier's mien,
718. A feather of the blue,
719. A doublet of the Lincoln green,
720. No more of me you knew,
721. My love!
722. No more of me you knew.

723. 'This morn is merry June, I trow,
724. The rose is budding fain;
725. But she shall bloom in winter snow,
726. Ere we two meet again.'
727. He turn'd his charger as he spake,
728. Upon the river shore,
729. He gave his bridle-reins a shake,
730. Said, 'Adieu for evermore,
731. My love!
732. And adieu for evermore.'

733. XXIX.
734. 'What youth is this, your band among,
735. The best for minstrelsy and song?
736. In his wild notes seem aptly met
737. A strain of pleasure and regret.'
738. 'Edmund of Winston is his name;
739. The hamlet sounded with the fane
740. Of early hopes his childhood gave,
741. Now center'd all in Brignall cave
742. I watch him well-his wayward course
743. Shows oft a tincture of remorse.
744. Some early love-shaft grazed his heart,
745. And oft the scar will ache and smart.
746. Yet is he useful;-of the rest,
747. By fits, the darling and the jest,
748. His harp, his story, and his lay,
749. Oft aid the idle hours away:
750. When unemploy'd, each fiery mate
751. Is ripe for mutinous debate.
752. He tuned his strings e'en now-again
753. He wakes them, with a blither strain.'


754. XXX.

755. Song - Allen-a-Dale


756. Allen-a-Dale has no fagot for burning,
757. Allen-a-Dale has no furrow for turning,
758. Allen-a-Dale has no fleece for the spinning,
759. Yet Allen-a-Dale has red gold for the winning.
760. Come, read me my riddle! come, hearken my tale!
761. And tell me the craft of bold Allen-a-Dale.

762. The Baron of Ravensworth prances in pride,
763. And he views his domains upon Arkindale side.
764. The mere for his net, and the land for his game,
765. The chase for the wild, and the park for the tame;
766. Yet the fish of the lake, and the deer of the vale,
767. Are less free to Lord Dacre than Allen-a-Dale!

768. Allen-a-Dale was ne'er belted a knight,
769. Though his spur be as sharp, and his blade be as bright;
770. Allen-a Dale is no baron or lord,
771. Yet twenty tall yeomen will draw at his word;
772. And the best of our nobles his bonnet will vail,
773. Who at Rere-cross on Stanimore meets Allen-aDale.

774. Allen-a-Dale to his wooing is come;
775. The mother, she ask'd of his household and home:
776. 'Though the castle of Richmond stands fair on the hill,
777. My hall,' quoth bold Allen, 'shows gallanter still;
778. 'Tis the blue vault of heaven, with its crescent so pale,
779. And with all its bright spangles!' said Allen-a-Dale.

780. The father was steel, and the mother was stone;
781. They lifted the latch, and they bade him be gone;
782. But loud, on the morrow, their wail and their cry:
783. He had laugh'd on the lass with his bonny black eye,
784. And she fled to the forest to hear a love-tale,
785. And the youth it was told by was Allen-a-Dale!

786. XXXI.
787. 'Thou see'st that, whether sad or gay,
788. Love mingles ever in his lay.
789. But when his boyish wayward fit
790. Is o'er, he hath address and wit;
791. O! 'tis a brain of fire, can ape
792. Each dialect, each various shape.'
793. 'Nay, then, to aid thy project, Guy-
794. Soft! who comes here?'-'My trusty spy.
795. Speak, Hamlin! hast thou lodged our deer?'
796. 'I have-but two fair stags are near.
797. I watch'd her, as she slowly stray'd
798. From Eglistone up Thorsgill glade;
799. But Wilfrid Wycliffe sought her side,
800. And then young Redmond, in his pride,
801. Shot down to meet them on their way:
802. Much, as it seem'd, was theirs to say:
803. There's time to pitch both toil and net,
804. Before their path be homeward set.'
805. A hurried and a whisper'd speech
806. Did Bertram's will to Denzil teach;
807. Who, turning to the robber band,
808. Bade four, the bravest, take the brand.
