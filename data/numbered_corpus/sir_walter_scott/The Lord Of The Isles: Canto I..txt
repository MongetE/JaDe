1. Autumn departs - but still his mantle's fold
2. Rests on the groves of noble Somerville,
3. Beneath a shroud of russet dropp'd with gold,
4. Tweed and his tributaries mingle still;
5. Hoarser the wind, and deeper sounds the rill,
6. Yet lingering notes of silvan music swell,
7. The deep-toned cushat, and the redbreast shrill:
8. And yet some tints of summer splendour tell
9. When the broad sun sinks down on Ettrick's western fell.

10. Autumn departs - from Gala's fields no more
11. Come rural sounds our kindred banks to cheer;
12. Blent with the stream, and gale that wafts it o'er,
13. No more the distant reaper's mirth we hear.
14. The last blithe shout hath died upon our ear,
15. And harvest-home hath hush'd the changing wain,
16. On the waste hill no forms of life appear,
17. Save where, sad laggard of the autumnal train,
18. Some age-struck wanderer gleans few ears of scatter'd grain.

19. Deem'st thou these sadden'd scenes have pleasure still,
20. Lovest thou through Autumn's fading realms to stray,
21. To see the heath-flower wither'd on the hill,
22. To listen to the wood's expiring lay,
23. To note the red leaf shivering on the spray,
24. To mark the last bright tints the mountain stain,
25. On the waste fields to trace the gleaner's way,
26. And moralise on mortal joy and pain? -
27. O! if such scenes thou lovest, scorn not the minstrel strain.

28. No! do not scorn, although its hoarser note
29. Scarce with the cushat's homely song can vie,
30. Though faint its beauties as the tints remote
31. That gleam through mist in autumn's evening sky,
32. And few as leaves that tremble, sear and dry,
33. When wild November hath his bugle wound;
34. Nor mock my toil - a lonely gleaner I,
35. Through fields time-wasted, on and inquest bound,
36. Where happier bards of yore have richer harvest found.

37. So shalt thou list, and haply not unmoved,
38. To a wild tale of Albyn's warrior day;
39. In distant lands, by the rough West reproved,
40. Still live some relics of the ancient lay.
41. For, when on Coolin's hills the lights decay,
42. With such the Seer of Skye the eve beguiles;
43. 'Tis known amid the pathless wastes of Reay,
44. In Harries known, and in Iona's piles,
45. Where rest from mortal coil the Mighty of the Isles.

46. Canto I.
47. I.
48. 'Wake, Maid of Lorn!' the Minstrels sung.-
49. Thy rugged halls, Artornish! rung,
50. And the dark seas, thy towers that lave,
51. Heaved on the beach a softer wave,
52. As 'mid the tuneful choir to keep
53. The diapason of the Deep.
54. Lull'd were the winds of Inninmore,
55. And green Loch-Alline's woodland shore,
56. As if wild woods and waves had pleasure
57. In listing to the lovely measure.
58. And ne'er to symphony more sweet
59. Gave mountain echoes answer meet,
60. Since, met from mainland and from isle,
61. Ross, Arran, Hay, and Argyle,
62. Each minstrel's tributary lay
63. Paid homage to the festal day.
64. Dull and dishonour'd were the bard,
65. Worthless of guerdon and regard,
66. Deaf to the hope of minstrel fame,
67. Or lady's smiles, his noblest aim,
68. Who on that morn's resistless call
69. Where silent in Artornish hall.

70. II.
71. 'Wake, Maid of Lorn!' - 'twas thus they sung,
72. And yet more proud the descant rung,
73. 'Wake, Maid of Lorn! high right is ours,
74. To charm dull sleep from Beauty's bowers;
75. Earth, Ocean, Air, have nought so shy
76. But owns the power of minstrelsy.
77. In Lettermore the timid deer
78. Will pause, the harp's wild chime to hear;
79. Rude Heiskar's seal through surges dark
80. Will long pursue the minstrel's bark;
81. To list his notes, the eagle proud
82. Will poise him on Ben-Cailliach's cloud;
83. Then let not Maiden's ear disdain
84. The summons of the minstrel train,
85. But, while our harps wild music make,
86. Edith of Lorn, awake, awake!

87. III.
88. 'O wake, while Dawn, with dewy shine,
89. Wakes Nature's charms to vie with thine!
90. She bids the mottled thrush rejoice
91. To mate thy melody of voice;
92. The dew that on the violet lies
93. Mocks the dark lustre of thine eyes;
94. But, Edith, wake, and all we see
95. Of sweet and fair shall yield to thee!'-
96. 'She comes not yet,' grey Ferrand cried;
97. 'Brethren, let softer spell be tried,
98. Those notes prolong'd, that soothing theme,
99. Which best may mix with Beauty's dream,
100. And whisper, with their silvery tone,
101. The hope she loves, yet fears to own.'
102. He spoke, and on the harp-strings died
103. The strains of flattery and of pride;
104. More soft, more low, more tender fell
105. The lay of love he bade them tell.

106. IV.
107. 'Wake, Maid of Lorn! the moments fly,
108. Which yet that maiden-name allow;
109. Wake, Maiden, wake! the hour is nigh,
110. When love shall claim a plighted vow.
111. By Fear, thy bosom's fluttering guest,
112. By Hope, that soon shall fears remove,
113. We bid thee break the bonds of rest,
114. And wake thee at the call of Love!

115. 'Wake, Edith, wake! in yonder bay
116. Lies many a galley gaily mann'd,
117. We hear the merry pibrochs play,
118. We see the streamer's silken band.
119. What Chieftain's praise these pibrochs swell,
120. What crest is on these banners wove,
121. The harp, the minstrel, dare not tell -
122. The riddle must be read by Love.'

123. V.
124. Retired her maiden train among,
125. Edith of Lorn received the song,
126. But tamed the minstrel's pride had been
127. That had her cold demeanour seen;
128. For not upon her cheek awoke
129. The glow of pride when Flattery spoke,
130. Nor could their tenderest numbers bring
131. One sigh responsive to the string.
132. As vainly had her maidens vied
133. In skill to deck the princely bride.
134. Her locks, in dark-brown length array'd,
135. Cathleen of Ulne, 'twas thine to braid;
136. Young Eva with meet reverence drew
137. On the light foot with silken shoe,
138. While on the ankle's slender round
139. Those strings of pearl fair Bertha wound,
140. That, bleach'd Lochryan's depths within,
141. Seem'd dusky still on Edith's skin.
142. But Einion, of experience old,
143. Had weightiest task - the mantle's fold
144. In many an artful plait she tied,
145. To show the form it seem'd to hide,
146. Till on the floor descending roll'd
147. Its waves of crimson blent with gold.

148. VI.
149. O! lives there now so cold a maid,
150. Who thus in beauty's pomp array'd,
151. In beauty's proudest pitch of power,
152. And conquest won - the bridal hour -
153. With every charm that wins the heart,
154. By Nature given, enhanced by Art,
155. Could yet the fair reflection view,
156. In the bright mirror pictured true,
157. And not one dimple on her cheek
158. A tell-tale consciousness bespeak?-
159. Lives still such a maid? - Fair damsels, say,
160. For further vouches not my lay,
161. Save that such lived in Britain's isle,
162. When Lorn's bright Edith scorn'd to smile.

163. VII.
164. But Morag, to whose fostering care
165. Proud Lorn had given his daughter fair,
166. Morag, who saw a mother's aid
167. By all a daughter's love repaid,
168. (Strict was that bond - most kind of all -
169. Inviolate in Highland hall)-
170. Grey Morag sate a space apart,
171. In Edith's eyes to read her heart.
172. In vain the attendant's fond appeal
173. To Morag's skill, to Morag's zeal;
174. She mark'd her child receive their care,
175. Cold as the image sculptured fair,
176. (Form of some sainted patroness,)
177. Which cloister'd maids combine to dress;
178. She mark'd - and knew her nursling's heart
179. In the vain pomp took little part.
180. Wistful a while she gazed - then press'd
181. The maiden to her anxious breast
182. In finish'd loveliness - and led
183. To where a turret's airy head,
184. Slender and steep, and battled round,
185. O'erlook'd, dark Mull! thy mighty Sound,
186. Where thwarting tides, with mingled roar,
187. Part thy swarth hills from Morven's shore.

188. VIII.
189. 'Daughter,' she said, 'these seas behold,
190. Round twice a hundred islands roll'd,
191. From Hirt, that hears their northern roar,
192. Or mainland turn, where many a tower
193. Owns thy bold brother's feudal power,
194. Each on its own dark cape reclined,
195. And listening to its own wild wind,
196. From where Mingarry, sternly placed,
197. O'erawes the woodland and the waste,
198. To where Dunstaffnage hears the raging
199. Of Connal with his rocks engaging.
200. Think'st thou, amid this ample round,
201. A single brow but thine has frown'd,
202. To sadden this auspicious morn,
203. That bids the daughter of high Lorn
204. Impledge her spousal faith to wed
205. The heir of mighty Somerled?
206. Ronald, from many a hero sprung,
207. The fair, the valiant, and the young,
208. Lord of the Isles, whose lofty name
209. A thousand bards have given to fame,
210. The mate of monarchs, and allied
211. On equal terms with England's pride.-
212. From Chieftain's tower to bondsman's cot,
213. Who hears the tale, and triumphs not?
214. The damsel dons her best attire,
215. The shepherd lights his beltane fire,
216. Joy! joy! each warder's horn hath sung,
217. Joy! joy! each matin bell hath rung;
218. The holy priest says grateful mass,
219. Loud shouts each hardy galla-glass,
220. No mountain den holds outcast boor,
221. Of heart so dull, of soul so poor,
222. But he hath flung his task aside,
223. And claim'd this morn for holy-tide;
224. Yet, empress of this joyful day,
225. Edith is sad while all are gay.'-

226. IX.
227. Proud Edith's soul came to her eye,
228. Resentment check'd the struggling sigh.
229. Her hurrying hand indignant dried
230. The burning tears of injured pride -
231. 'Morag, forbear! or lend thy praise
232. To swell yon hireling harpers' lays;
233. Make to yon maids thy boast of power,
234. That they may waste a wondering hour,
235. Telling of banners proudly borne,
236. Of pealing bell and bugle horn,
237. Or, theme more dear, of robes of price,
238. Crownlets and gauds of rare device.
239. But thou, experienced as thou art,
240. Think'st thou with these to cheat the heart,
241. That, bound in strong affection's chain,
242. No! sum thine Edith's wretched lot
243. In these brief words - He loves her not!

244. X.
245. 'Debate it not - too long I strove
246. To call his cold observance love,
247. All blinded by the league that styled
248. Edith of Lorn, - while yet a child,
249. She tripp'd the heath by Morag's side, -
250. The brave Lord Ronald's destined bride.
251. Ere yet I saw him, while afar
252. His broadsword blazed in Scotland's war,
253. Train'd to believe our fates the same,
254. My bosom throbb'd when Ronald's name
255. Came gracing fame's heroic tale,
256. Like perfume on the summer gale.
257. What pilgrim sought our halls, nor told
258. Of Ronald's deeds in battle bold;
259. Who touch'd the harp to heroes' praise;
260. But his achievements swell'd the lays?
261. Even Morag - not a tale of fame
262. Was hers but closed with Ronald's name.
263. He came! and all that had been told
264. Of his high worth seem'd poor and cold,
265. Tame, lifeless, void of energy,
266. Unjust to Ronald and to me!

267. XI.
268. 'Since then, what thought had Edith's heart,
269. And gave not plighted love its part! -
270. And what requital? cold delay -
271. Excuse that shunn'd the spousal day.-
272. It dawns, and Ronald is not here!-
273. Hunts he Bentella's nimble deer,
274. Or loiters he in secret dell
275. To bid some lighter love farewell,
276. And swear, that though he may not scorn
277. A daughter of the House of Lorn,
278. Yet, when these formal rites are o'er,
279. Again they meet, to part no more?'

280. XII.
281. -'Hush, daughter, hush! thy doubts remove
282. More nobly think of Ronald's love.
283. Look, where beneath the castle grey
284. His fleet unmoor from Aros bay!
285. See'st not each galley's topmast bend,
286. As on the yards the sails ascend?
287. Hiding the dark-blue land they rise,
288. Like the white clouds on April skies;
289. The shouting vassals man the oars,
290. Behind them sink Mull's mountain shores,
291. Onward their merry course they keep,
292. Through whistling breeze and foaming deep.
293. And mark the headmost, seaward cast,
294. Stoop to the freshening gale her mast,
295. As if she veil'd its banner'd pride,
296. To greet afar her Prince's bride!
297. Thy Ronald comes, and while in speed
298. His galley mates the flying steed,
299. He chides her sloth!' - Fair Edith sigh'd,
300. Blush'd, sadly smiled, and thus replied: -

301. XIII.
302. 'Sweet thought, but vain! - No, Morag! mark,
303. Type of his course, yon lonely bark,
304. That oft hath shifted helm and sail,
305. To win its way against the gale.
306. Since peep of morn, my vacant eyes
307. Have view'd by fits the course she tries;
308. Now, though the darkening scud comes on,
309. And dawn's fair promises be gone,
310. And though the weary crew may see
311. Our sheltering haven on their lea,
312. Still closer to the rising wind
313. They strive her shivering sail to bind,
314. Still nearer to the shelves' dread verge
315. At every tack her course they urge,
316. As if they fear'd Artornish more
317. Than adverse winds and breakers' roar.'

318. XIV.
319. Sooth spoke the Maid. - Amid the tide
320. The skiff she mark'd lay tossing sore,
321. And shifted oft her stooping side,
322. In weary tack from shore to shore.
323. Yet on her destined course no more
324. She gain'd, or forward way,
325. Than what a minstrel may compare
326. To the poor meed which peasants share,
327. Who toil the livelong day;
328. And such the risk her pilot braves,
329. That oft, before she wore,
330. Her boltsprit kiss'd the broken waves,
331. Where in white foam the ocean raves
332. Upon the shelving shore.
333. Yet, to their destined purpose true,
334. Undaunted toil'd her hardy crew,
335. Nor look'd where shelter lay,
336. Nor for Artornish Castle drew,
337. Nor steer'd for Aros bay.

338. XV.
339. Thus while they strove with wind and seas,
340. Borne onward by the willing breeze,
341. Lord Ronald's fleet swept by,
342. Stream'd with silk, and trick'd with gold,
343. Mann'd with the noble and the bold
344. Of island chivalry.
345. Around their prows the ocean roars,
346. And chafes beneath their thousand oars,
347. Yet bears them on their way:
348. So chafes the war-horse in his might,
349. That fieldward bears some valiant knight,
350. Champs, till both bit and boss are white,
351. But, foaming, must obey.
352. On each gay deck they might behold
353. Lances of steel and crests of gold,
354. And hauberks with their burnish'd fold,
355. That shimmer'd fair and free;
356. And each proud galley, as she pass'd,
357. To the wild cadence of the blast
358. Gave wilder minstrelsy.
359. Full many a shrill triumphant note
360. Saline and Scallastle bade float
361. Their misty shores around;
362. And Morven's echoes answer'd well,
363. And Duart heard the distant swell
364. Come down the darksome Sound.

365. XVI.
366. So bore they on with mirth and pride,
367. And if that labouring bark they spied,
368. 'Twas with such idle eye
369. As nobles cast on lowly boor,
370. When, toiling in his task obscure,
371. They pass him careless by.
372. Let them sweep on with heedless eyes!
373. But, had they known what mighty prize
374. In that frail vessel lay,
375. The famish'd wolf, that prowls the wold,
376. Had scatheless pass'd the unguarded fold,
377. Ere, drifting by these galleyes bold,
378. Unchallenged were her way!
379. And thou, Lord Ronald, sweep thou on,
380. With mirth, and pride, and minstrel tone!
381. But hadst thou known who sail'd so nigh,
382. Far other glance were in thine eye!
383. Far other flush were on thy brow,
384. That, shaded by the bonnet, now
385. Assumes but ill the blithesome cheer
386. Of bridegroom when the bride is near!

387. XVII.
388. Yes, sweep they on! - We will not leave,
389. For them that triumph, those who grieve,
390. With that armada gay
391. Be laughter loud and jocund shout,
392. And bards to cheer the wassail rout,
393. With tale, and romance, and lay;
394. And of wild mirth each clamorous art,
395. Which, if it cannot cheer the heart,
396. May stupefy and stun its smart,
397. For one loud busy day.
398. Yes, sweep they on! - But with that skiff
399. Abides the minstrel tale,
400. Where there was dread of surge and cliff,
401. Labour that strain'd each sinew stiff,
402. And one sad Maiden's wail.

403. XVIII.
404. All day with fruitless strife they toil'd,
405. With eve the ebbing currents boil'd
406. More fierce from straight and lake;
407. And midway through the channel met
408. Conflicting tides that foam and fret,
409. And high their mingled billows jet,
410. As spears, that, in the battle set,
411. Spring upward as they break.
412. Then, too, the lights of eve were past,
413. And louder sung the western blast
414. On rocks of Inninmore;
415. Rent was the sail, and strain'd the mast,
416. And many a leak was gaping fast,
417. And the pale steersman stood aghast,
418. And gave the conflict o'er.

419. XIX.
420. 'Twas then that One, whose lofty look
421. Nor labour dull'd nor terror shook,
422. Thus to the Leader spoke:-
423. 'Brother, how hopest thou to abide
424. The fury of this wilder'd tide,
425. Or how avoid the rock's rude side,
426. Until the day has broke?
427. Didst thou not mark the vessel reel,
428. With quivering planks, and groaning keel,
429. At the last billow's shock?
430. Yet how of better counsel tell,
431. Though here thou see'st poor Isabel
432. Half dead with want and fear;
433. For look on sea, or look on land,
434. Or yon dark sky, on every hand
435. Despair and death are near.
436. For her alone I grieve - on me
437. Danger sits light, by land and sea,
438. I follow where thou wilt;
439. Either to bide the tempest's lour,
440. Or went to yon unfriendly tower,
441. Or rush amid their naval power,
442. With war-cry wake their wassail-hour,
443. And die with hand on hilt.'-

444. XX.
445. That elder Leader's calm reply
446. In steady voice was given,
447. 'In man's most dark extremity
448. Oft succour dawns from Heaven.
449. Edward, trim thou the shatter'd sail,
450. The helm be mine, and down the gate
451. Let our free course be driven;
452. So shall we 'scape the western bay,
453. The hostile fleet, the unequal fray,
454. So safely hold our vessel's way
455. Beneath the Castle wall;
456. For if a hope of safety rest,
457. 'Tis on the sacred name of guest,
458. Who seeks for shelter, storm-distress'd,
459. Within a chieftain's hall.
460. If not - it best beseems our worth,
461. Our name, our right, our lofty birth,
462. By noble hands to fall.'

463. XXI.
464. The helm, to his strong arm consign'd,
465. Gave the reef'd sail to meet the wind,
466. And on her alter'd way,
467. Fierce bonding, forward sprung the ship,
468. Like greyhound starting from the slip
469. To seize his flying prey.
470. Awaked before the rushing prow,
471. The mimic fires of ocean glow,
472. Those lightnings of the wave;
473. Wild sparkles crest the broken tides,
474. And, flashing round, the vessel's sides
475. With elvish lustre lave,
476. While, far behind, their livid light
477. To the dark billows of the night
478. A gloomy splendour gave,
479. It seems as if old Ocean shakes
480. From his dark brow the lucid flakes
481. In envious pageantry,
482. To match the meteor-light that streaks
483. Grim Hecla's midnight sky.

484. XXII.
485. Nor lack'd they steadier light to keep
486. Their course upon the darken'd deep;-
487. Artornish, on her frowning steep
488. 'Twixt cloud and ocean hung,
489. Glanced with a thousand lights of glee,
490. And landward far, and far to sea,
491. Her festal radiance flung.
492. By that blithe beacon-light they steer'd,
493. Whose lustre mingled well
494. With the pale beam that now appear'd,
495. As the cold moon her head uprear'd
496. Above the eastern fell.

497. XXIII.
498. Thus guided, on their course they bore,
499. Until they near'd the mainland shore,
500. When frequent on the hollow blast
501. Wild shouts of merriment were cast,
502. And wind and wave and sea-birds' cry
503. With wassail sounds in concert vie,
504. Like funeral shrieks with revelry,
505. Or like the battle-shout
506. By peasants heard from cliffs on high,
507. When Triumph, Rage, and Agony,
508. Madden the fight and rout.
509. Now nearer yet, through mist and storm
510. Dimly arose the Castle's form,
511. And deepen'd shadow made,
512. Far lengthen'd on the main below,
513. Where, dancing in reflected glow,
514. A hundred torches play'd,
515. Spangling the wave with lights as vain
516. As pleasures in this vale of pain,
517. That dazzle as they fade.

518. XXIV.
519. Beneath the Castle's sheltering lee,
520. They staid their course in quiet sea.
521. Hewn in the rock, a passage there
522. Sought the dark fortress by a stair,
523. So strait, so high, so steep,
524. With peasant's staff on valiant hand
525. Might well the dizzy path have mann'd,
526. 'Gainst hundreds arm'd with spear and brand,
527. And plunged them in the deep.
528. His bugle then the helmsman wound;
529. Loud answered every echo round,
530. From turret, rock, and bay,
531. The postern's hinges crash and groan,
532. And soon the Warder's cresset shone
533. On those rude steps of slippery stone,
534. To light the upward way.
535. 'Thrice welcome, holy Sire!' he said;
536. 'Full long the spousal train have staid,
537. And, vex'd at thy delay,
538. Fear'd lest, amidst these wildering seas,
539. The darksome night and freshening breeze
540. Had driven thy bark astray.'-

541. XXV.
542. 'Warder,' the younger stranger said,
543. 'Thine erring guess some mirth had made
544. In mirthful hour; but nights like these,
545. When the rough winds wake western seas,
546. Brook not of glee. We crave some aid
547. And needful shelter for this maid
548. Until the break of day;
549. For, to ourselves, the deck's rude plank
550. That's breath'd upon by May.
551. And for our storm-toss'd skiff we seek
552. Short shelter in this leeward creek,
553. Prompt when the dawn the east shall streak
554. Again to bear away.'-
555. Answered the Warder, 'In what name
556. Assert ye hospitable claim?
557. Whence come, or whither bound?
558. Hath Erin seen your parting sails,
559. Or come ye on Norweyan gales?
560. And seek ye England's fertile vales,
561. Or Scotland's mountain ground?'-

562. XXVI.
563. 'Warriors - for other title none
564. For some brief space we list to own,
565. Bound by a vow - warriors are we;
566. In strife by land and storm by sea,
567. We have been known to fame;
568. And these brief words have import dear,
569. When sounded in a noble ear,
570. To harbour safe, and friendly cheer,
571. That gives us rightful claim.
572. Grant us the trivial boon we seek,
573. And we in other realms will speak
574. Fair of your courtesy;
575. Deny - and be your niggard Hold
576. Scorn'd by the noble and the bold,
577. Shunn'd by the pilgrim on the wold,
578. And wanderer on the lea!'-

579. XXVII.
580. 'Bold stranger, no - 'gainst claim like thine,
581. No bolt revolves by hand of mine,
582. Though urged in tone that more express'd
583. A monarch than a suppliant guest.
584. Be what ye will, Artornish Hall
585. On this glad eve is free to all.
586. Though ye had drawn a hostile sword
587. 'Gainst our ally, great England's Lord,
588. Or mail upon your shoulders borne,
589. To battle with the Lord of Lorn,
590. Or, outlaw'd, dwelt by greenwood tree
591. With the fierce Knight of Ellerslie,
592. Or aided even the murderous strife,
593. When Comyn fell beneath the knife
594. Of that fell homicide The Bruce,
595. This night had been a term of truce.-
596. Ho, vassals! give these guests your care,
597. And show the narrow postern stair.'

598. XXVIII.
599. To land these two bold brethren leapt,
600. (The weary crew their vessel kept),
601. And, lighted by the torches' flare,
602. That seaward flung their smoky glare,
603. The younger knight that maiden bare
604. Half lifeless up the rock;
605. On his strong shoulder lean'd her head,
606. And down her long dark tresses shed,
607. As the wild vine in tendrils spread,
608. Droops from the mountain oak.
609. Him follow'd close that elder Lord,
610. And in his hand a sheathed sword,
611. Such as few arms could wield;
612. But when he boun'd him to such task,
613. Well could it cleave the strongest casque,
614. And rend the surest shield.

615. XXIX.
616. The raised portcullis' arch they pass,
617. The wicket with its bars of brass,
618. The entrance long and low,
619. Flank'd at each turn by loop-holes strait,
620. Where bowmen might in ambush wait,
621. (If force or fraud should burst the gate),
622. To gall an entering foe.
623. But every jealous post of ward
624. Was now defenceless and unbarr'd,
625. And all the passage free
626. To one low-brow'd and vaulted room,
627. Where squire and yeoman, page and groom,
628. Plied their loud revelry.

629. XXX.
630. And 'Rest ye here,' the Warder bade,
631. 'Till to our Lord your suit is said.-
632. And, comrades, gaze not on the maid,
633. And on these men who ask our aid,
634. As if ye ne'er had seen
635. A damsel tired of midnight bark,
636. Or wanderers of a moulding stark,
637. And bearing martial mien.'
638. But not for Eachin's reproof
639. Would page or vassal stand aloof,
640. But crowded on to stare,
641. As men of courtesy untaught,
642. Till fiery Edward roughly caught,
643. From one, the foremost there,
644. His chequer'd plaid, and in its shroud,
645. Involved his sister fair.
646. His brother, as the clansman bent
647. His sullen brow in discontent,
648. Made brief and stern excuse;-
649. 'Vassal, were thine the cloak of pall
650. That decks thy lord in bridal hall,
651. 'Twere honour'd by her use.'

652. XXXI.
653. Proud was his tone, but calm; his eye
654. Had that compelling dignity,
655. His mien that bearing haught and high,
656. Which common spirits fear;
657. Need nor word nor signal more,
658. Nod, wink, and laughter, all were o'er;
659. Upon each other back they bore,
660. And gazed like startled deer.
661. But now appear'd the Seneschal,
662. Commission'd by his lord to call
663. The strangers to the Baron's hall,
664. Where feasted fair and free
665. That Island Prince is nuptial tide,
666. With Edith there his lovely bride,
667. And her bold brother by her side,
668. And many a chief, the flower and pride
669. Of Western land and sea.

670. Here pause we, gentles, for a space;
671. And, if our tale hath won your grace,
672. Grant us brief patience, and again
673. We will renew the minstrel strain.
