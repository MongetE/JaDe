1. Farewell to Northmaven,
2. Grey Hillswicke, farewell!
3. The storms on thy haven,
4. The storms on thy fell -
5. To each breeze that can vary
6. The mood of thy main,
7. And to thee, bonny Mary!
8. We meet not again!

9. Farewell the wild ferry,
10. Which Hacon could brave,
11. When the peaks of the Skerry
12. Where white in the wave.
13. There's a maid may look over
14. These wild waves in vain,-
15. For the skiff of her lover-
16. He comes not again!

17. The vows thou hast broke,
18. On the wild currents fling them;
19. On the quicksand and rock
20. Let the mermaidens sing them.
21. New sweetness they'll give her
22. Bewildering strain;
23. But there's one who will never
24. Believe them again.

25. O were there an island,
26. Though ever so wild,
27. Where woman could smile, and
28. No man be beguiled -
29. Too tempting a snare
30. To poor mortals were given;
31. And the hope would fix there,
32. That should anchor in heaven.
