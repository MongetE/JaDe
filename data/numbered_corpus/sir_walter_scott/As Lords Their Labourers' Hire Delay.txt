1. As lords their labourers' hire delay,
2. Fate quits our toil with hopes to come,
3. Which, if far short of present pay,
4. Still, owns a debt and names a sum.

5. Quit not the pledge, frail sufferer, then,
6. Although a distant date be given;
7. Despair is treason towards man,
8. And blasphemy to Heaven.
