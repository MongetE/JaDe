1. hush thee, my babie, thy sire was a knight,
2. Thy mother a lady, both lovely and bright;
3. The woods and the glens, from the towers which we see,
4. They all are belonging, dear babie, to thee.
5. O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo,
6. O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo.
7. O fear not the bugle, though loudly it blows,
8. It calls but the warders that guard thy repose;
9. Their bows would be bended, their blades would be red,
10. Ere the step of a foeman drew near to thy bed.
11. O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo,
12. O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo.
13. O hush thee, my babie, the time soon will come
14. When thy sleep shall be broken by trumpet and drum;
15. Then hush thee, my darling, take rest while you may,
16. For strife comes with manhood, and waking with day.
17. O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo,
18. O ho ro, i ri ri, cadul gu lo.
