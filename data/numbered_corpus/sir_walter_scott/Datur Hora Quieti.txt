1. The sun upon the lake is low,
2. The wild birds hush their song,
3. The hills have evening's deepest glow,
4. Yet Leonard tarries long.
5. Now all whom varied toil and care
6. From home and love divide,
7. In the calm sunset may repair
8. Each to the loved one's side.

9. The noble dame, on turret high,
10. Who waits her gallant knight,
11. Looks to the western beam to spy
12. The flash of armour bright.
13. The village maid, with hand on brow
14. The level ray to shade,
15. Upon the footpath watches now
16. For Colin's darkening plaid.

17. Now to their mates the wild swans row,
18. By day they swam apart,
19. And to the thicket wanders slow
20. The hind beside the hart.
21. The woodlark at his partner's side
22. Twitters his closing song -
23. All meet whom day and care divide,
24. But Leonard tarries long!
