1. I
2. Sweet Teviot! on thy silver tide
3. The glaring bale-fires blaze no more;
4. No longer steel-clad warrior ride
5. Along thy wild and willow'd shore
6. Where'er thou wind'st, by dale or hill
7. All, all is peaceful, all is still,
8. As if thy waves, since Time was born
9. Since first they roll'd upon the Tweed,
10. Had only heard the shepherd's reed,
11. Nor started at the bugle-horn.

12. II
13. Unlike the tide of human time,
14. Which, though it change in ceaseless flow
15. Retains each grief, retains each crime
16. Its earliest course was doom'd to know;
17. And, darker as it downward bears,
18. Is stain'd with past and present tears
19. Low as that tide has ebb'd with me,
20. It still reflects to Memory's eye
21. The hour my brave, my only boy
22. Fell by the side of great Dundee.
23. Why, when the volleying musket play'd
24. Against the bloody Highland blade,
25. Why was not I beside him laid!
26. Enough, he died the death of fame;
27. Enough, he died with conquering Graeme.

28. III
29. Now over Border dale and fell
30. Full wide and far was terror spread;
31. For pathless marsh, and mountain cell,
32. The peasant left his lowly shed.
33. The frighten'd flocks and herds were pent
34. Beneath the peel's rude battlement;
35. And maids and matrons dropp'd the tear,
36. While ready warriors seiz'd the spear.
37. From Branksome's towers, the watchman's eye
38. Dun wreaths of distant smoke can spy,
39. Which, curling in the rising sun,
40. Show'd southern ravage was begun.

41. IV
42. Now loud the heedful gate-ward cried-
43. 'Prepare ye all for blows and blood!
44. Watt Tinlinn, from the Liddel-side
45. Comes wading through the flood.
46. Full oft the Tynedale snatchers knock
47. At his lone gate, and prove the lock;
48. It was but last St. Barnabright
49. They sieg'd him a whole summer night,
50. But fled at morning; well they knew
51. In vain he never twang'd the yew.
52. Right sharp has been the evening shower
53. That drove him from his Liddel tower;
54. And, by my faith,' the gate-ward said,
55. 'I think 'twill prove a Warden-Raid.'

56. V
57. While thus he spoke, the bold yeoman
58. Enter'd the echoing barbican.
59. He led a small and shaggy nag,
60. That through a bog, from hag to hag,
61. Could bound like any Billhope stag.
62. It bore his wife and children twain;
63. A half-clothed serf was all their train;
64. His wife, stout, ruddy, and dark-brow'd,
65. Of silver brooch and bracelet proud,
66. Laugh'd to her friends among the crowd.
67. He was of stature passing tall,
68. But sparely form'd, and lean withal
69. A batter'd morion on his brow;
70. A leather jack, as fence enow
71. On his broad shoulders loosely hung;
72. A border axe behind was slung;
73. His spear, six Scottish ells in length,
74. Seem'd newly dyed with gore
75. His shafts and bow, of wondrous strength,
76. His hardy partner bore.

77. VI
78. Thus to the Ladye did Tinlinn show
79. The tidings of the English foe:
80. 'Belted Will Howard is marching here,
81. And hot Lord Dacre, with many a spear,
82. And all the German hackbut men,
83. Who have long lain at Askerten:
84. They cross'd the Liddel at curfew hour,
85. And burn'd my little lonely tower:
86. The fiend receive their souls therefore!
87. It had not been burnt this year and more.
88. Barn-yard and dwelling, blazing bright,
89. Serv'd to guide me on my flight;
90. But I was chas'd the livelong night.
91. Black John of Akeshaw and Fergus Graeme
92. Fast upon my traces came,
93. Until I turn'd at Priesthaugh Scrogg,
94. And shot their horses in the bog,
95. Slew Fergus with my lance outright
96. I had him long at high despite-
97. He drove my cows last Fastern's night.'

98. VII
99. Now weary scouts from Liddesdale,
100. Fast hurrying in, confirm'd the tale;
101. As far as they could judge by ken,
102. Three hours would bring to Teviot's strand
103. Three thousand armed Englishmen;
104. Meanwhile, full many a warlike band,
105. From Teviot, Aill, and Ettrick shade,
106. Came in, their Chief's defence to aid.
107. There was saddling and mounting in haste,
108. There was pricking o'er moor and lea;
109. He that was last at the trysting-place
110. Was but lightly held of his gay ladye.

111. VIII
112. From fair St. Mary's silver wave,
113. From dreary Gamescleugh's dusky height,
114. His ready lances Thirlestane brave
115. Array'd beneath a banner bright.
116. The treasured fleur-de-luce he claims
117. To wreathe his shield, since royal James,
118. Encamp'd by Fala's mossy wave,
119. The proud distinction grateful gave,
120. For faith 'mid feudal jars;
121. What time, save Thirlestane alone,
122. Of Scotland's stubborn barons none
123. Would march to southern wars;
124. And hence, in fair remembrance worn,
125. Yon sheaf of spears his crest has borne
126. Hence his high motto shines reveal'd -
127. ' Ready, aye ready' for the field.

128. IX
129. An aged Knight, to danger steel'd,
130. With manyaa moss-trooper came on;
131. And azure in a golden field,
132. The stars and crescent graced his shield,
133. Without the bend of Murdieston.
134. Wide lay his lands round Oakwood tower
135. And wide round haunted Castle-Ower;
136. High over Borthwick's mountain flood
137. His wood-embosom'd mansion stood;
138. In the dark glen, so deep below,
139. The herds of plunder'd England low -
140. His bold retainers' daily food,
141. And bought with danger, blows, and blood.
142. Marauding chief! his sole delight
143. The moonlight raid, the morning fight;
144. Not even the Flower of Yarrow's charms,
145. In youth, might tame his rage for arms
146. And still, in age, he spurn'd at rest,
147. And still his brows the helmet press'd,
148. Albeit the blanched locks below
149. Were white as Dinlay's spotless snow;
150. Five stately warriors drew the sword
151. Before their father's band;
152. A braver knight than Harden's lord
153. Ne'er belted on a brand.

154. X
155. Scotts of Eskdale, a stalwart band,
156. Came trooping down the Todshaw-hill;
157. By the sword they won their land,
158. And by the sword they hold it still.
159. Hearken, Ladye, to the tale,
160. How thy sires won fair Eskdale.
161. Earl Morton was lord of that valley fair;
162. The Beattisons were his vassals there.
163. The Earl was gentle, and mild of mood;
164. The vassals vere warlike, and fierce, and rude;
165. High of heart, and haughty of word,
166. Little they reck'd of a tame liege lord.
167. The Earl into fair Eskdale came,
168. Homage and seignory to claim:
169. Of Gilbert the Galliard a heriot he sought,
170. Saying, 'Give thy best steed, as a vassal ought.'
171. 'Dear to me is my bonny white steed,
172. Oft has he help d me at pinch of need;
173. Lord and Earl though thou be, I trow
174. I can rein Bucksfoot better than thou.'
175. Word on word gave fuel to fire,
176. Till so highly blazed the Beattison's ire,
177. But that the Earl the flight had ta'en,
178. The vassals there their lord had slain.
179. Sore he plied both whip and spur,
180. As he urged his steed through Eskdale muir;
181. And it fell down a weary weight,
182. Just on the threshold of Branksome gate.

183. XI
184. The Earl was a wrathful man to see,
185. Full fain avenged would he be.
186. In haste to Branksome's Lord he spoke,
187. Saying-'Take these traitors to thy yoke;
188. For a cast of hawks, and a purse of gold,
189. All Eskdale I'll sell thee, to have and hold:
190. Beshrew thy heart, of the Beattisons' clan
191. If thou leavest on Eske a landed man;
192. But spare Woodkerrick's lands alone,
193. For he lent me his horse to escape upon.'
194. A glad man then was Branksome bold,
195. Down he flung him the purse of gold;
196. To Eskdale soon he spurr'd amain,
197. And with him five hundred riders has ta'en
198. He left his merrymen in the mist of the hill
199. And bade them hold them close and still;
200. And alone he wended to the plain,
201. To meet with the Galliard and all his train.
202. To Gilbert the Galliard thus he said
203. 'Know thou me for thy liege-lord and head;
204. Deal not with me as with Morton tame,
205. For Scotts play best at the roughest game.
206. Give me in peace my heriot due,
207. Thy bonny white steed, or thou shalt rue.
208. If my horn I three times wind,
209. Eskdale shall long have the sound in mind.'

210. XII
211. Loudly the Beattison laugh'd in scorn;
212. 'Little care we for thy winded horn.
213. Ne'er shall it be the Galliard's lot
214. To yield his steed to a haughty Scott.
215. Wend thou to Branksome back on foot
216. With rusty spur and miry boot.'
217. He blew his bugle so loud and hoarse
218. That the dun deer started at fair Craikcross;
219. He blew again so loud and clear,
220. Through the grey mountain-mist there did lances appear;
221. And the third blast rang with such a din
222. That the echoes answer'd from Pentoun-linn
223. And all his riders came lightly in.
224. Then had you seen a gallant shock
225. When saddles were emptied and lances broke!
226. For each scornful word the Galliard had said
227. A Beattison on the field was laid.
228. His own good sword the chieftain drew,
229. And he bore the Galliard through and through;
230. Where the Beattisons' blood mix'dwith the rill,
231. The Galliard's-Haugh men call it still,
232. The Scotts have scatter'd the Beattison clan
233. In Eskdale they left but one landed man
234. The valley of Eske, from the mouth to the source
235. Was lost and won for that bonny white horse.

236. XIII
237. Whitslade the Hawk, and Headshaw came
238. And warriors more than I may name;
239. From Yarrow-cleugh to Hindhaugh-swair,
240. From Woodhouselie to Chesterglen,
241. Troop'd man and horse, and bow and spear;
242. Their gathering word was Bellenden.
243. And better hearts o'er Border sod
244. To siege or rescue never rode.
245. The Ladye mark'd the aids come in,
246. And high her heart of pride arose:
247. She bade her youthful son attend,
248. That he might know his father's friend,
249. And learn to face his foes.
250. 'The boy is ripe to look on war;
251. I saw him draw a cross-bow stiff,
252. And his true arrow struck afar
253. The raven s nest upon the cliff;
254. The red cross on a southern breast
255. Is broader than the raven s nest:
256. Thou, Whitslade, shalt teach him his weapon to wield,
257. And o'er him hold his father's shield.'

258. XIV
259. Well may you think the wily page
260. Car'd not to face the Ladye sage.
261. He counterfeited childish fear
262. And shriekd, and shed full many tear,
263. And moan'd and plain'd in manner wild.
264. The attendants to the Ladye told
265. Some fairy, sure, had chang'd the child,
266. That wont to be so free and bold.
267. Then wrathful was the noble dame;
268. She blush'd blood-red for very shame:
269. 'Hence! ere the clan his faintness view;
270. Hence with the weakling to Buccleuch!
271. Watt Tinlinn, thou shalt be his guide
272. To Rangleburn s lonely side.
273. Sure some fell fiend has cursed our line
274. That coward should e'er be son of mine!'

275. XV
276. A heavy task Watt Tinlinn had,
277. To guide the counterfeited lad.
278. Soon as the palfrey felt the wight
279. Of that ill-omen'd elfish freight,
280. He bolted, sprung, and rear'd amain,
281. Nor heeded bit nor curb, nor rein.
282. It cost Watt Tinlinn mickle toil
283. To drive him but a Scottish mile;
284. But as a shallow brook they cross'd,
285. The elf, amid the running stream,
286. His figure chang'd, like form in dream,
287. And fled, and shouted, 'Lost! lost! lost!'
288. Full fast the urchin ran and laugh'd,
289. But faster still a cloth-yard shaft
290. Whistled from startled Tinlinn's yew
291. And pierc'd his shoulder through and through.
292. Although the imp might not be slain,
293. And though the wound soon heal'd again
294. Yet, as he ran, he yell'd for pain;
295. And Wat of Tinlinn, much aghast,
296. Rode back to Branksome fiery fast.

297. XVI
298. Soon on the hill's steep verge he stood,
299. That looks o'er Branksome's towers and wood;
300. And martial murmurs, from below,
301. Proclaim'd the approaching southern foe.
302. Through the dark wood, in mingled tone,
303. Were Border pipes and bugles blown;
304. The coursers' neighing he could ken,
305. A measured tread of marching men;
306. While broke at times the solemn hum
307. The Almayn's sullen kettle-drum;
308. And banners tall of crimson sheen
309. Above the copse appear;
310. And, glistening through the hawthorns green,
311. Shine helm, and shield, and spear.

312. XVII
313. Light forayers, first, to view the ground,
314. Spurr'd their fleet coursers loosely round;
315. Behind, in close array, and fast,
316. The Kendal archers, all in green,
317. Obedient to the bugle blast,
318. Advancing from the wood were seen.
319. To back and guard the archer band,
320. Lord Dacre's bill-men were at hand:
321. A hardy race on Irthing bred,
322. With kirtles white, and crosses red,
323. Array'd beneath the banner tall,
324. That stream'd o'er Acre's conquer'd wall;
325. And minstrels, as they march'd in order,
326. Play'd 'Noble Lord Dacre, he dwells on the Border.'

327. XVIII
328. Behind the English bill and bow,
329. The mercenaries, firm and slow,
330. Moved on to fight, in dark array,
331. By Conrad led of Wolfenstein,
332. Who brought the band from distant Rhine,
333. And sold their blood for foreign pay.
334. The camp their home, their law the sword,
335. They knew no country, own'd no lord :
336. They were not arm'd like England's sons,
337. But bore the levin-darting guns;
338. Buff coats, all frounc'd and 'broider'd o'er,
339. And morsing-horns and scarfs they wore;
340. Each better knee was bared, to aid
341. The warriors in the escalade;
342. All as they march'd, in rugged tongue,
343. Songs of Teutonic feuds they sung.

344. XIX
345. But louder still the clamour grew,
346. And louder still the minstrels blew,
347. When fom beneath the greenwood tree,
348. Rode forth Lord Howard's chivalry;
349. His men-at-arms, with glaive and spear,
350. Brought up the battle's glittenng rear.
351. There many a youthful knight, full keen
352. To gain his spurs, in arms was seen;
353. With favor in his crest, or glove,
354. Memorial of his ladye-love.
355. So rode they forth in fair array,
356. Till full their lengthen'd lines display;
357. Then call'd a halt, and made a stand,
358. And cried 'St. George for merry England!'

359. XX
360. Now every English eye intent
361. On Branksome's armed towers was bent;
362. So near they were, that they might know
363. The straining harsh of each cross-bow;
364. On battlement and bartizan
365. Gleam'd axe, and spear, and partisan;
366. Falcon and culver, on each tower,
367. Stood prompt their deadly hail to shower;
368. And flashing armor frequent broke
369. From eddying whirls of sable smoke,
370. Where upon tower and turret-head,
371. The seething pitch and molten lead
372. Reek'd, like a witch's caldron red.
373. While yet they gaze, the bridges fall,
374. The wicket opes, and from the wall
375. Rides forth the hoary Seneschal.

376. XXI
377. Armed he rode, all save the head,
378. His white beard o'er his breast-plate spread;
379. Unbroke by age, erect his seat,
380. He rul'd his eager courser's gait;
381. Forc'd him, with chasten'd fire to prance,
382. And, high curvetting, slow advance;
383. In sign of truce, his better hand
384. Display'd a peeled willow wand;
385. His squire, attending in the rear,
386. Bore high a gauntlet on a spear.
387. When they espied him riding out,
388. Lord Howard and Lord Dacre stout
389. Sped to the front of their array,
390. To hear what this old knight should say.

391. XXII
392. 'Ye English warden lords, of you
393. Demands the Ladye of Buccleuch
394. Why, 'gainst the truce of Border tide,
395. In hostile guise ye dare to ride,
396. With Kendal bow, and Gilsland brand,
397. And all yon mercenary band,
398. Upon the bounds of fair Scotland?
399. My Ladye redes you swith return;
400. And, if but one poor straw you burn
401. Or do our towers so much molest
402. As scare one swallow from her nest,
403. St. Mary! but we'll light a brand
404. Shall warm your hearths in Cumberland.'

405. XXIII
406. A wrathful man was Dacre's lord,
407. But calmer Howard took the word:
408. 'May 't please thy Dame, Sir Seneschal,
409. To seek the castle's outward wall,
410. Our pursuivant-at-arms shall show
411. Both why we came, and when we go.'
412. The message sped, the noble Dame
413. To the wall's outward circle came;
414. Each chief around lean'd on his spear
415. To see the pursuivant appear.
416. All in Lord Howard's livery dress'd,
417. The lion argent deck-d his breast;
418. He led a boy of blooming hue-
419. O sight to meet a mother's view!
420. It was the heir of great Buccleuch
421. Obeisance meet the herald made,
422. And thus his master's will he said:

423. XXIV
424. 'It irks, high Dame, my noble Lords,
425. 'Gainst ladye fair to draw their swords;
426. But yet they may not tamely see,
427. All through the Western Wardenry,
428. Your law-contemning kinsmen ride,
429. And burn and spoil the Border-side;
430. And ill beseems your rank and birth
431. To make your towers a flemens-firth
432. We claim from thee William of Deloraine
433. That he may suffer march-treason pain.
434. It was but last St. Cuthbert's even
435. He bunny'd to Stapleton on Leven,
436. Harried the lands of Richard Musgrave,
437. And slew his brother by dint of glaive.
438. Then, since a lone and widow'd Dame
439. These restless riders may not tame,
440. Either receive within thy towers
441. Two hundred of my master's powers,
442. Or straight they sound their warrison,
443. And storm and spoil thy garrison:
444. And this fair boy, to London led,
445. Shall good King Edward's page be bred.'

446. XXV
447. He ceased-and loud the boy did cry,
448. And stretch'd his little arms on high;
449. Implor'd for aid each well-known face,
450. And strove to seek the Dame's embrace.
451. A moment chang'd that Ladye's cheer,
452. Gush'd to her eye the unbidden tear;
453. She gaz'd upon the leaders round,
454. And dark and sad each warrior frown'd;
455. Then, deep within her sobbing breast
456. She lock'd the struggling sigh to rest;
457. Unalter'd and collected stood,
458. And thus replied in dauntless mood:

459. XXVI
460. 'Say to your Lords of high emprize,
461. Who war on women and on boys,
462. That either William of Deloraine
463. Will cleanse him by oath of march-treason stain
464. Or else he will the combat take
465. 'Gainst Musgrave, for his honor's sake.
466. No knight in Cumberland so good,
467. But William may count with him kin and blood.
468. Knighthood he took of Douglas' sword,
469. When English blood swell'd Ancram's ford;
470. And but Lord Dacre's steed was wight,
471. And bare him ably in the flight,
472. Himself had seen him dubb'd a knight.
473. For the young heir of Branksome's line,
474. God be his aid, and God be mine;
475. Through me no friend shall meet his doom;
476. Here, while I live, no foe finds room.
477. Then, if thy Lords their purpose urge
478. Take our defiance loud and high;
479. Our slogan is their lyke-wake dirge,
480. Our moat the grave where they shall lie.'

481. XXVII
482. Proud she look'd round, applause to claim-
483. Then lighten'd Thirlestane's eye of flame
484. His bugle Wat of Harden blew;
485. Pensils and pennons wide were flung,
486. To heaven the Border slogan rung,
487. 'St. Mary for the young Buccleuch!'
488. The English war-cry answer'd wide,
489. And forward bent each southern spear;
490. Each Kendal archer made a stride,
491. And drew the bowstring to his ear;
492. Each minstrel's war-note loud was blown;
493. But, ere a grey-goose shaft had flown
494. A horseman gallop'd from the rear.

495. XXVIII
496. 'Ah! noble Lords!' he breathless said,
497. 'What treason has your march betray'd ?
498. What make you here, from aid so far,
499. Before you walls, around you war?
500. Your foemen triumph in the thought
501. That in the toils the lion's caught.
502. Already on dark Ruberslaw
503. The Douglas holds his weapon-schaw;
504. The lances, waving in his train,
505. Clothe the dun heath like autumn grain;
506. And on the Liddel's northern strand,
507. To bar retreat to Cumberland,
508. Lord Maxwell ranks his merry-men good,
509. Beneath the eagle and the rood;
510. And Jedwood, Eske, and Teviotdale,
511. Have to proud Angus come;
512. And all the Merse and Lauderdale
513. Have risen with haughty Home.
514. An exile from Northumberland,
515. In Liddesdale I've wander'd long;
516. But still my heart was with merry England,
517. And cannot brook my country's wrong;
518. And hard I've spurr'd all night, to show
519. The mustering of the coming foe.'

520. XXIX
521. 'And let them come!' fierce Dacre cried;
522. 'For soon yon crest, my father's pride,
523. That swept the shores of Judah's sea,
524. And wav'd in gales of Galilee,
525. From Branksome's highest towers display'd,
526. Shall mock the rescue's lingering aid!-
527. Level each harquebuss on row;
528. Draw, merry archers, draw the bow;
529. Up, bill-men, to the walls, and cry,
530. Dacre for England, win or die!'

531. XXX
532. 'Yet hear,' quoth Howard, 'calmly hear
533. Nor deem my words the words of fear:
534. For who, in field or foray slack,
535. Saw the blanche lion e'er fall back?
536. But thus to risk our Border flower
537. In strife against a kingdom's power,
538. Ten thousand Scots 'gainst thousands three,
539. Certes, were desperate policy.
540. Nay, take the terms the Ladye made,
541. Ere conscious of the advancing aid:
542. Let Musgrave meet fierce Deloraine
543. In single fight, and, if he gain,
544. He gains for us; but if he's cross'd,
545. 'Tis but a single warrior lost:
546. The rest retreating as they came,
547. Avoid defeat, and death, and shame.'

548. XXXI
549. Ill could the haughty Dacre brook
550. His brother Warden's sage rebuke;
551. And yet his forward step he stay'd,
552. And slow and sullenly obey'd.
553. But ne'er again the Border side
554. Did these two lords in friendship ride;
555. And this slight discontent, men say,
556. Cost blood upon another day.

557. XXXII
558. The pursuivant-at-arms again
559. Before the castle took his stand;
560. His trumpet call'd, with parleying strain
561. The leaders of the Scottish band;
562. And he defied in Musgrave's right,
563. Stout Deloraine to single fight;
564. A gauntlet at their feet he laid,
565. And thus the terms of fight he said:
566. 'If in the lists good Musgrave's sword
567. Vanquish the Knight of Deloraine,
568. Your youthful chieftain, Branksome's Lord
569. Shall hostage for his clan remain:
570. If Deloraine foil good Musgrave,
571. The boy his liberty shall have.
572. Howe'er it falls the English band,
573. Unharming Scots, by Scots unharm'd,
574. In peaceful march, like men unarm'd,
575. Shall straight retreat to Cumberland.'

576. XXXIII
577. Unconscious of the near relief
578. The proffer pleased each Scottish chief,
579. Though much the Ladye sage gainsay'd;
580. For though their hearts were brave and true,
581. From Jedwood's recent sack they knew
582. How tardy was the Regent's aid:
583. And you may guess the noble Dame
584. Durst not the secret prescience own,
585. Sprung from the art she might not name,
586. By which the coming help was known.
587. Clos'd was the compact, and agreed
588. That lists should be enclos'd with speed,
589. Beneath the castle, on a lawn:
590. They fix'd the morrow for the strife,
591. On foot, with Scottish axe and knife,
592. At the fourth hour from peep of dawn;
593. When Deloraine, from sickness freed,
594. Or else a champion in his stead,
595. Should for himself and chieftain stand
596. Against stout Musgrave, hand to hand.

597. XIV
598. I know right well, that, in their lay,
599. Full many minstrels sing and say,
600. Such combat should be made on horse,
601. On foaming steed, in full career,
602. With brand to aid, when as the spear
603. Should shiver in the course:
604. But he, the jovial Harper, taught
605. Me, yet a youth, how it was fought,
606. In guise which now I say;
607. He knew each ordinance and clause
608. Of Black Lord Archibald s battle-laws,
609. In the old Douglas' day.
610. He brook'd not, he, that scoffing tongue
611. Should tax his minstrelsy with wrong,
612. Or call his song untrue:
613. For this, when they the goblet plied,
614. And such rude taunt had chaf'd his pride,
615. The Bard of Reull he slew.
616. On Teviot's side, in fight they stood,
617. And tuneful hands were stain'd with blood;
618. Where still the thorn's white branches wave,
619. Memorial o'er his rival's grave.

620. XXXV
621. Why should I tell the rigid doom
622. That dragg'd my master to his tomb;
623. How Ousenam's maidens tore their hair
624. Wept till their eyes were dead and dim
625. And wrung their hands for love of him
626. Who died at Jedwood Air?
627. He died!-his scholars, one by one,
628. To the cold silent grave are gone;
629. And I, alas! survive alone,
630. To muse o'er rivalries of yore,
631. And grieve that I shall hear no more
632. The strains, with envy heard before;
633. For, with my minstrel brethren fled,
634. My jealousy of song is dead.
635. He paused: the listening dames again
636. Applaud the hoary Minstrel's strain.
637. With many a word of kindly cheer,
638. In pity half, and half sincere,
639. Marvell'd the Duchess how so well
640. His legendary song could tell
641. Of ancient deeds, so long forgot;
642. Of feuds, whose memory was not;
643. Of forests, now laid waste and bare;
644. Of towers, which harbor now the hare;
645. Of manners, long since chang'd and gone;
646. Of chiefs, who under their grey stone
647. So long had slept, that fickle Fame
648. Had blotted from her rolls their name,
649. And twin'd round some new minion's head
650. The fading wreath for which they bled;
651. In sooth,'twas strange, this old man's verse
652. Could call them from their marble hearse.

653. The Harper smil'd, well-pleas'd; for ne'er
654. Was flattery lost on poet's ear:
655. A simple race! they waste their toil
656. For the vain tribute of a smile;
657. E'en when in age their flame expires,
658. Her dulcet breath can fan its fires:
659. Their drooping fancy wakes at praise,
660. And strives to trim the short-liv'd blaze.

661. Smil'd then, well pleas'd, the aged man
662. And thus his tale continued ran.
