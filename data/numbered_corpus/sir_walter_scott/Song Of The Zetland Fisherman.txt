1. Farewell, merry maidens, to song, and to laugh,
2. For the brave lads of Westra are bound to the Haaf;
3. And we must have labour, and hunger, and pain,
4. Ere we dance with the maids of Dunrossness again.

5. For now, in our trim boats of Noroway deal,
6. We must dance on the waves, with the porpoise and seal
7. The breeze it shall pipe, so it pipe not too high,
8. And the gull be our songstress whene'er she flits by.

9. Sing on, my brave bird, while we follow, like thee,
10. By bank, shoal, and quicksand, the swarms of the sea;
11. And when twenty-score fishes are straining our line,
12. Sing louder, brave bird, for their spoils shall be thine.

13. We'll sing while we bait, and we'll sing while we haul
14. For the deeps of the Haaf have enough for us all:
15. There is torsk for the gentle, and skate for the carle,
16. And there's wealth for bold Magnus, the son of the earl.

17. Huzza! my brave comrades, give way for the Haaf,
18. We shall sooner come back to the dance and the laugh;
19. For life without mirth is a lamp without oil;
20. Then, mirth and long life to the bold Magnus Troil!
