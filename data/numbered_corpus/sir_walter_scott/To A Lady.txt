1. Take these flowers which, purple waving,
2. On the ruin'd rampart grew,
3. Where, the sons of freedom braving,
4. Rome's imperial standards flew.

5. Warriors from the breach of danger
6. Pluck no longer laurels there;
7. They but yield the passing stranger
8. Wild-flower wreaths the Beauty's hair.
