1. There is mist on the mountain, and night on the vale,
2. But more dark is the sleep of the sons of the Gael.
3. A stranger commanded â€”- it sunk on the land,
4. It has frozen each heart, and benumb'd every hand!

5. The dirk and the target lie sordid with dust,
6. The bloodless claymore is but redden'd with rust;
7. On the hill or the glen if a gun should appear,
8. It is only to war with the heath-cock or deer.

9. The deeds of our sires if our bards should rehearse,
10. Let a blush or a blow be the meed of their verse!
11. Be mute every string, and be hush'd every tone,
12. That shall bid us remember the fame that is flown.

13. But the dark hours of night and of slumber are past,
14. The morn on our mountains is dawning at last;
15. Glenaladale's peaks are illumined with the rays,
16. And the streams of Glenfinnan leap bright in the blaze.

17. O high-minded Moray! the exiled! the dear!
18. In the blush of the dawning the Standard uprear!
19. Wide, wide on the winds of the north let it fly,
20. Like the sunâ€™s latest flash when the tempest is nigh!

21. Ye sons of the strong, when that dawning shall break,
22. Need the harp of the aged remind you to wake?
23. That dawn never beam'd on your forefathers' eye,
24. But it roused each high chieftain to vanquish or die.

25. O, sprung from the Kings who in Islay kept state,
26. Proud chiefs of Clan Ranald, Glengarry, and Sleat!
27. Combine like three streams from one mountain of snow,
28. And resistless in union rush down on the foe!

29. True son of Sir Evan, undaunted Lochiel,
30. Place thy targe on thy shoulder and burnish thy steel!
31. Rough Keppoch, give breath to thy bugle's bold swell,
32. Till far Coryarrick resound to the knell!

33. Stern son of Lord Kenneth, high chief of Kintail,
34. Let the stag in thy standard bound wild in the gale!
35. May the race of Clan Gillean, the fearless and free,
36. Remember Glenlivat, Harlaw, and Dundee!

37. Let the clan of grey Fingon, whose offspring has given
38. Such heroes to earth and such martyrs to heaven,
39. Unite with the race of renown'd Rorri More,
40. To launch the long galley and stretch to the oar.

41. How Macâ€“Shimei will joy when their chief shall display
42. The yew-crested bonnet o'er tresses of grey!
43. How the race of wrong'd Alpine and murderâ€™d Glencoe
44. Shall shout for revenge when they pour on the foe!

45. Ye sons of brown Dermid, who slew the wild boar,
46. Resume the pure faith of the great Callumâ€“More!
47. MacNeil of the islands, and Moy of the Lake,
48. For honour, for freedom, for vengeance awake!

49. Awake on your hills, on your islands awake,
50. Brave sons of the mountain, the frith, and the lake!
51. 'Tis the bugle -â€” but not for the chase is the call;
52. 'Tis the pibrochâ€™s shrill summons - but not to the hall.

53. 'Tis the summons of heroes for conquest or death,
54. When the banners are blazing on mountain and heath:
55. They call to the dirk, the claymore, and the targe,
56. To the march and the muster, the line and the charge.

57. Be the brand of each chieftain like Fin's in his ire!
58. May the blood through his veins flow like currents of fire!
59. Burst the base foreign yoke as your sires did of yore,
60. Or die like your sires, and endure it no more!
