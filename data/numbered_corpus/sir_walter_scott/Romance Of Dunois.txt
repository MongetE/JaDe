1. It was Dunois, the young and brave, was bound for Palestine,
2. But first he made his orisons before Saint Mary's shrine:
3. 'And grant, immortal Queen of Heaven,' was still the Soldierâ€™s prayer;
4. 'That I may prove the bravest knight, and love the fairest fair.'

5. His oath of honour on the shrine he graved it with his sword,
6. And followed to the Holy Land the banner of his Lord;
7. Where, faithful to his noble vow, his war-cry filled the air,
8. 'Be honoured aye the bravest knight, beloved the fairest fair.'

9. They owed the conquest to his arm, and then his Liegeâ€“Lord said,
10. 'The heart that has for honour beat by bliss must be repaid.-â€”
11. My daughter Isabel and thou shall be a wedded pair,
12. For thou art bravest of the brave, she fairest of the fair.'

13. And then they bound the holy knot before Saint Mary's shrine,
14. That makes a paradise on earth, if hearts and hands combine;
15. And every lord and lady bright that were in chapel there
16. Cried, 'Honoured be the bravest knight, beloved the fairest fair!'
