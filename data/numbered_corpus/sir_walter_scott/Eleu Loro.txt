1. Where shall the lover rest
2. Whom the fates sever
3. From his true maiden’s breast
4. Parted for ever?
5. Where, through groves deep and high
6. Sounds the far billow,
7. Where early violets die
8. Under the willow.
9. Eleu loro
10. Soft shall be his pillow.

11. There through the summer day
12. Cool streams are laving:
13. There, while the tempests sway,
14. Scarce are boughs waving;
15. There thy rest shalt thou take,
16. Parted for ever,
17. Never again to wake
18. Never, O never!Eleu loro
19. Never, O never!
20. Where shall the traitor rest,
21. He, the deceiver,
22. Who could win maiden’s breast,
23. Ruin, and leave her?
24. In the lost battle,
25. Borne down by the flying,
26. Where mingles war’s rattle
27. With groans of the dying;
28. Eleu loro
29. There shall he be lying.

30. Her wing shall the eagle flap
31. O’er the falsehearted;
32. His warm blood the wolf shall lap
33. Ere life be parted.
34. Shame and dishonour sit
35. By his grave ever;
36. Blessing shall hallow it
37. Never, O never!Eleu loro
38. Never, O never!
