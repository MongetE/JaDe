1. I.
2. Red glows the forge in Striguil's bounds,
3. And hammers din, and anvil sounds,
4. And armourers, with iron toil,
5. Barb many a steed for battle's broil,
6. Foul fall the hand which bends the steel
7. Around the courser's thundering heel,
8. That e'er shall dint a sable wound
9. On fair Glamorgan's velvet ground!

10. II.
11. From Chepstow's towers, ere dawn of morn,
12. Was heard afar the bugle-horn;
13. And forth, in banded pomp and pride,
14. Stout Clare and fiery Neville ride,
15. They swore, their banners broad should gleam,
16. In crimson light, on Rymny's stream;
17. They vowed, Caerphili's sod should feel
18. The Norman charger's spurning heel.

19. III.
20. And sooth they swore - the sun arose,
21. And Rymny's wave with crimson glows;
22. For Clare's red banner, floating wide,
23. Roll'd down the stream to Severn's tide!
24. And sooth they vow'd - the trampled green
25. Show'd where hot Neville's charge had been:
26. In every sable hoof-tramp stood
27. A Norman horseman's curdling blood!

28. IV.
29. Old Chepstow's brides may curse the toil,
30. That arm'd stout Clare for Cambrian broil;
31. Their orphans long the art may rue,
32. For Neville's war-horse forged the shoe.
33. No more the stamp of armed steed
34. Shall dint Glamorgan's velvet mead;
35. Nor trace be there, in early spring,
36. Save of the Fairies' emerald ring.
