1. Gone, I say and walk from church,
2. refusing the stiff procession to the grave,
3. letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.
4. It is June.  I am tired of being brave.

5. We drive to the Cape.  I cultivate
6. myself where the sun gutters from the sky,
7. where the sea swings in like an iron gate
8. and we touch.  In another country people die.

9. My darling, the wind falls in like stones
10. from the whitehearted water and when we touch
11. we enter touch entirely.  No one's alone.
12. Men kill for this, or for as much.

13. And what of the dead?  They lie without shoes
14. in the stone boats.  They are more like stone
15. than the sea would be if it stopped.  They refuse
16. to be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone.
