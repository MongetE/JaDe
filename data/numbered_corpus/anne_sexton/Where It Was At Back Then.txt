1. Husband,
2. last night I dreamt
3. they cut off your hands and feet.
4. Husband,
5. you whispered to me,
6. Now we are both incomplete.

7. Husband,
8. I held all four
9. in my arms like sons and daughters.
10. Husband,
11. I bent slowly down
12. and washed them in magical waters.

13. Husband,
14. I placed each one
15. where it belonged on you.
16. 'A miracle,'
17. you said and we laughed
18. the laugh of the well-to-do.
