1. Inside many of us
2. is a small old man
3. who wants to get out.
4. No bigger than a two-year-old
5. whom you'd call lamb chop
6. yet this one is old and malformed.
7. His head is okay
8. but the rest of him wasn't Sanforized?
9. He is a monster of despair.
10. He is all decay.
11. He speaks up as tiny as an earphone
12. with Truman's asexual voice:
13. I am your dwarf.
14. I am the enemy within.
15. I am the boss of your dreams.
16. No. I am not the law in your mind,
17. the grandfather of watchfulness.
18. I am the law of your members,
19. the kindred of blackness and impulse.
20. See. Your hand shakes.
21. It is not palsy or booze.
22. It is your Doppelganger
23. trying to get out.
24. Beware . . . Beware . . .

25. There once was a miller
26. with a daughter as lovely as a grape.
27. He told the king that she could
28. spin gold out of common straw.
29. The king summoned the girl
30. and locked her in a room full of straw
31. and told her to spin it into gold
32. or she would die like a criminal.
33. Poor grape with no one to pick.
34. Luscious and round and sleek.
35. Poor thing.
36. To die and never see Brooklyn.

37. She wept,
38. of course, huge aquamarine tears.
39. The door opened and in popped a dwarf.
40. He was as ugly as a wart.
41. Little thing, what are you? she cried.
42. With his tiny no-sex voice he replied:
43. I am a dwarf.
44. I have been exhibited on Bond Street
45. and no child will ever call me Papa.
46. I have no private life.
47. If I'm in my cups the whole town knows by breakfast
48. and no child will ever call me Papa
49. I am eighteen inches high.
50. I am no bigger than a partridge.
51. I am your evil eye
52. and no child will ever call me Papa.
53. Stop this Papa foolishness,
54. she cried. Can you perhaps
55. spin straw into gold?
56. Yes indeed, he said,
57. that I can do.
58. He spun the straw into gold
59. and she gave him her necklace
60. as a small reward.
61. When the king saw what she had done
62. he put her in a bigger room of straw
63. and threatened death once more.
64. Again she cried.
65. Again the dwarf came.
66. Again he spun the straw into gold.
67. She gave him her ring
68. as a small reward.
69. The king put her in an even bigger room
70. but this time he promised
71. to marry her if she succeeded.
72. Again she cried.
73. Again the dwarf came.
74. But she had nothing to give him.
75. Without a reward the dwarf would not spin.
76. He was on the scent of something bigger.
77. He was a regular bird dog.
78. Give me your first-born
79. and I will spin.
80. She thought: Piffle!
81. He is a silly little man.
82. And so she agreed.
83. So he did the trick.
84. Gold as good as Fort Knox.

85. The king married her
86. and within a year
87. a son was born.
88. He was like most new babies,
89. as ugly as an artichoke
90. but the queen thought him in pearl.
91. She gave him her dumb lactation,
92. delicate, trembling, hidden,
93. warm, etc.
94. And then the dwarf appeared
95. to claim his prize.
96. Indeed! I have become a papa!
97. cried the little man.
98. She offered him all the kingdom
99. but he wanted only this -
100. a living thing
101. to call his own.
102. And being mortal
103. who can blame him?
104. The queen cried two pails of sea water.
105. She was as persistent
106. as a Jehovah's Witness.
107. And the dwarf took pity.
108. He said: I will give you
109. three days to guess my name
110. and if you cannot do it
111. I will collect your child.
112. The queen sent messengers
113. throughout the land to find names
114. of the most unusual sort.
115. When he appeared the next day
116. she asked: Melchior?
117. Balthazar?
118. But each time the dwarf replied:
119. No! No! That's not my name.
120. The next day she asked:
121. Spindleshanks? Spiderlegs?
122. But it was still no-no.
123. On the third day the messenger
124. came back with a strange story.
125. He told her:
126. As I came around the corner of the wood
127. where the fox says good night to the hare
128. I saw a little house with a fire
129. burning in front of it.
130. Around that fire a ridiculous little man
131. was leaping on one leg and singing:
132. Today I bake.
133. Tomorrow I brew my beer.
134. The next day the queen's only child will be mine.
135. Not even the census taker knows
136. that Rumpelstiltskin is my name . . .
137. The queen was delighted.
138. She had the name!
139. Her breath blew bubbles.

140. When the dwarf returned
141. she called out:
142. Is your name by any chance Rumpelstiltskin?
143. He cried: The devil told you that!
144. He stamped his right foot into the ground
145. and sank in up to his waist.
146. Then he tore himself in two.
147. Somewhat like a split broiler.
148. He laid his two sides down on the floor,
149. one part soft as a woman,
150. one part a barbed hook,
151. one part papa,
152. one part Doppelganger.
