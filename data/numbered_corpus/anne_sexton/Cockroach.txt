1. Roach, foulest of creatures,
2. who attacks with yellow teeth
3. and an army of cousins big as shoes,
4. you are lumps of coal that are mechanized
5. and when I turn on the light you scuttle
6. into the corners and there is this hiss upon the land.
7. Yet I know you are only the common angel
8. turned into, by way of enchantment, the ugliest.
9. Your uncle was made into an apple.
10. Your aunt was made into a Siamese cat,
11. all the rest were made into butterflies
12. but because you lied to God outrightly-
13. told him that all things on earth were in order-
14. He turned his wrath upon you and said,
15. I will make you the most loathsome,
16. I will make you into God's lie,
17. and never will a little girl fondle you
18. or hold your dark wings cupped in her palm.

19. But that was not true. Once in New Orleans
20. with a group of students a roach fled across
21. the floor and I shrieked and she picked it up
22. in her hands and held it from my fear for one hour.
23. And held it like a diamond ring that should not escape.
24. These days even the devil is getting overturned
25. and held up to the light like a glass of water.
