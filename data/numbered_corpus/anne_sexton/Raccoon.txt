1. Coon, why did you come to this dance
2. with a mask on? Why not the tin man
3. and his rainbow girl? Why not Racine,
4. his hair marcelled down to his chest?
5. Why not come as a stomach digesting
6. its worms? Why you little fellow
7. with your ears at attention and your
8. nose poking up like a microphone?
9. You whig emblem, you woman chaser,
10. who do you dance over the wide lawn tonight
11. clanging the garbage pail like great silver bells?
