1. My business is words. Words are like labels,
2. or coins, or better, like swarming bees.
3. I confess I am only broken by the sources of things;
4. as if words were counted like dead bees in the attic,
5. unbuckled from their yellow eyes and their dry wings.
6. I must always forget how one word is able to pick
7. out another, to manner another, until I have got
8. something I might have saidâ€¦
9. but did not.
10. Your business is watching my words. But I
11. admit nothing. I work with my best, for instance,
12. when I can write my praise for a nickel machine,
13. that one night in Nevada: telling how the magic jackpot
14. came clacking three bells out, over the lucky screen.
15. But if you should say this is something it is not,
16. then I grow weak, remembering how my hands felt funny
17. and ridiculous and crowded with all
18. the believing money.
