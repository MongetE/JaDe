1. This is the key to it.
2. This is the key to everything.
3. Preciously.

4. I am worse than the gamekeeper's children
5. picking for dust and bread.
6. Here I am drumming up perfume.

7. Let me go down on your carpet,
8. your straw mattress - whatever's at hand
9. because the child in me is dying, dying.

10. It is not that I am cattle to be eaten.
11. It is not that I am some sort of street.
12. But your hands found me like an architect.

13. Jugful of milk! It was yours years ago
14. when I lived in the valley of my bones,
15. bones dumb in the swamp. Little playthings.

16. A xylophone maybe with skin
17. stretched over it awkwardly.
18. Only later did it become something real.

19. Later I measured my size against movie stars.
20. I didn't measure up. Something between
21. my shoulders was there. But never enough.

22. Sure, there was a meadow,
23. but no yound men singing the truth.
24. Nothing to tell truth by.

25. Ignorant of men I lay next to my sisters
26. and rising out of the ashes I cried
27. my sex will be transfixed!

28. Now I am your mother, your daughter, your brand new thing - a snail, a nest.
29. I am alive when your fingers are.

30. I wear silk - the cover to uncover -
31. because silk is what I want you to think of.
32. But I dislike the cloth. It is too stern.

33. So tell me anything but track me like a climber
34. for here is the eye, here is the jewel,
35. here is the excitement the nipple learns.

36. I am unbalanced - but I am not mad with snow.
37. I am mad the way young girls are mad,
38. with an offering, an offeringâ€¦

39. I burn the way money burns.
