1. It is snowing and death bugs me
2. as stubborn as insomnia.
3. The fierce bubbles of chalk,
4. the little white lesions
5. settle on the street outside.
6. It is snowing and the ninety
7. year old woman who was combing
8. out her long white wraith hair
9. is gone, embalmed even now,
10. even tonight her arms are smooth
11. muskets at her side and nothing
12. issues from her but her last word - 'Oh.' Surprised by death.

13. It is snowing. Paper spots
14. are falling from the punch.
15. Hello? Mrs. Death is here!
16. She suffers according to the digits
17. of my hate. I hear the filaments
18. of alabaster. I would lie down
19. with them and lift my madness
20. off like a wig. I would lie
21. outside in a room of wool
22. and let the snow cover me.
23. Paris white or flake white
24. or argentine, all in the washbasin
25. of my mouth, calling, 'Oh.'
26. I am empty. I am witless.
27. Death is here. There is no
28. other settlement. Snow!
29. See the mark, the pock, the pock!

30. Meanwhile you pour tea
31. with your handsome gentle hands.
32. Then you deliberately take your
33. forefinger and point it at my temple,
34. saying, 'You suicide bitch!
35. I'd like to take a corkscrew
36. and screw out all your brains
37. and you'd never be back ever.'
38. And I close my eyes over the steaming
39. tea and see God opening His teeth.
40. 'Oh.' He says.
41. I see the child in me writing, 'Oh.'
42. Oh, my dear, not why.
