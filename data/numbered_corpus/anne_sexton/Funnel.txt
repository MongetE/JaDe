1. The family story tells, and it was told true,
2. of my great-grandfather who begat eight
3. genius children and bought twelve almost-new
4. grand pianos. He left a considerable estate
5. when he died. The children honored their
6. separate arts; two became moderately famous,
7. three married and fattened their delicate share
8. of wealth and brilliance. The sixth one was
9. a concert pianist. She had a notable career
10. and wore cropped hair and walked like a man,
11. or so I heard when prying a childhood car
12. into the hushed talk of the straight Maine clan.
13. One died a pinafore child, she stays her five
14. years forever. And here is one that wrote-
15. I sort his odd books and wonder his once alive
16. words and scratch out my short marginal notes
17. and finger my accounts.
18. back from that great-grandfather I have come
19. to tidy a country graveyard for his sake,
20. to chat with the custodian under a yearly sun
21. and touch a ghost sound where it lies awake.
22. I like best to think of that Bunyan man
23. slapping his thighs and trading the yankee sale
24. for one dozen grand pianos. it fit his plan
25. of culture to do it big. On this same scale
26. he built seven arking houses and they still stand.
27. One, five stories up, straight up like a square
28. box, still dominates its coastal edge of land.
29. It is rented cheap in the summer musted air
30. to sneaker-footed families who pad through
31. its rooms and sometimes finger the yellow keys
32. of an old piano that wheezes bells of mildew.
33. Like a shoe factory amid the spruce trees
34. it squats; flat roof and rows of windows spying
35. through the mist. Where those eight children danced
36. their starfished summers, the thirty-six pines sighing,
37. that bearded man walked giant steps and chanced
38. his gifts in numbers.
39. Back from that great-grandfather I have come
40. to puzzle a bending gravestone for his sake,
41. to question this diminishing and feed a minimum
42. of children their careful slice of suburban cake.
