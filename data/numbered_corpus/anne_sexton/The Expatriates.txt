1. My dear, it was a moment
2. to clutch for a moment
3. so that you may believe in it
4. and believing is the act of love, I think,
5. even in the telling, wherever it went.

6. In the false New England forest
7. where the misplanted Norwegian trees
8. refused to root, their thick synthetic
9. roots barging out of the dirt to work on the air,
10. we held hands and walked on our knees.
11. Actually, there was no one there.

12. For fourty years this experimental
13. woodland grew, shaft by shaft in perfect rows
14. where its stub branches held and its spokes fell.
15. It was a place of parallel trees, their lives
16. filed out in exile where we walked too alien to know
17. our sameness and how our sameness survives.

18. Outside of us the village cars followed
19. the white line we had carefully walked
20. two nights before toward our single beds.
21. We lay halfway up an ugly hill and if we fell
22. it was here in the woods where the woods were caught
23. in their dying and you held me well.

24. And now I must dream the forest whole
25. and your sweet hands, not once as frozen
26. as those stopped trees, nor ruled, nor pale,
27. nor leaving mine. Today in my house, I see
28. our house, its pillars a dim basement of men
29. holding up their foreign ground for you and me.

30. My dear, it was a time,
31. butchered from time
32. that we must tell of quickly
33. before we lose the sound of our own
34. mouths calling mine, mine, mine.
