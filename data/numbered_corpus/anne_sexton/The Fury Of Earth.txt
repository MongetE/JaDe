1. The day of fire is coming, the thrush,
2. will fly ablaze like a little sky rocket,
3. the beetle will sink like a giant bulldozer,
4. and at the breaking of the morning the houses
5. will turn into oil and will in their tides
6. of fire be a becoming and an ending, a red fan.
7. What then, man in your easy chair,
8. of the anointment of the sick,
9. of the New Jerusalem?
10. You will have to polish up the stars
11. with Bab-o and find a new God
12. as the earth empties out
13. into the gnarled hands of the old redeemer.
