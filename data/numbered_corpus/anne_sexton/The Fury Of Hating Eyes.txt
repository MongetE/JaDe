1. I would like to bury
2. all the hating eyes
3. under the sand somewhere off
4. the North Atlantic and suffocate
5. them with the awful sand
6. and put all their colors to sleep
7. in that soft smother.
8. Take the brown eyes of my father,
9. those gun shots, those mean muds.
10. Bury them.
11. Take the blue eyes of my mother,
12. naked as the sea,
13. waiting to pull you down
14. where there is no air, no God.
15. Bury them.
16. Take the black eyes of my love,
17. coal eyes like a cruel hog,
18. wanting to whip you and laugh.
19. Bury them.
20. Take the hating eyes of martyrs,
21. presidents, bus collectors,
22. bank managers, soldiers.
23. Bury them.
24. Take my eyes, half blind
25. and falling into the air.
26. Bury them.
27. Take your eyes.
28. I come to the center,
29. where a shark looks up at death
30. and thinks of my heart
31. and squeeze it like a doughnut.
32. They'd like to take my eyes
33. and poke a hatpin through
34. their pupils. Not just to bury
35. but to stab. As for your eyes,
36. I fold up in front of them
37. in a baby ball and you send
38. them to the State Asylum.
39. Look! Look! Both those
40. mice are watching you
41. from behind the kind bars.
