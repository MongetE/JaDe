1. They sit in a row
2. outside the kindergarten,
3. black, red, brown, all
4. with those brass buckles.
5. Remember when you couldn't
6. buckle your own
7. overshoe
8. or tie your own
9. overshoe
10. or tie your own shoe
11. or cut your own meat
12. and the tears
13. running down like mud
14. because you fell off your
15. tricycle?
16. Remember, big fish,
17. when you couldn't swim
18. and simply slipped under
19. like a stone frog?
20. The world wasn't
21. yours.
22. It belonged to
23. the big people.
24. Under your bed
25. sat the wolf
26. and he made a shadow
27. when cars passed by
28. at night.
29. They made you give up
30. your nightlight
31. and your teddy
32. and your thumb.
33. Oh overshoes,
34. don't you
35. remember me,
36. pushing you up and down
37. in the winter snow?
38. Oh thumb,
39. I want a drink,
40. it is dark,
41. where are the big people,
42. when will I get there,
43. taking giant steps
44. all day,
45. each day
46. and thinking
47. nothing of it?
