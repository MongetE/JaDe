1. You, Doctor Martin, walk
2. from breakfast to madness. Late August,
3. I speed through the antiseptic tunnel
4. where the moving dead still talk
5. of pushing their bones against the thrust
6. of cure. And I am queen of this summer hotel
7. or the laughing bee on a stalk

8. of death. We stand in broken
9. lines and wait while they unlock
10. the doors and count us at the frozen gates
11. of dinner. The shibboleth is spoken
12. and we move to gravy in our smock
13. of smiles. We chew in rows, our plates
14. scratch and whine like chalk

15. in school. There are no knives
16. for cutting your throat. I make
17. moccasins all morning. At first my hands
18. kept empty, unraveled for the lives
19. they used to work. Now I learn to take
20. them back, each angry finger that demands
21. I mend what another will break

22. tomorrow. Of course, I love you;
23. you lean above the plastic sky,
24. god of our block, prince of all the foxes.
25. The breaking crowns are new
26. that Jack wore.
27. Your third eye
28. moves among us and lights the separate boxes
29. where we sleep or cry.

30. What large children we are
31. here. All over I grow most tall
32. in the best ward. Your business is people,
33. you call at the madhouse, an oracular
34. eye in our nest. Out in the hall
35. the intercom pages you. You twist in the pull
36. of the foxy children who fall

37. like floods of life in frost.
38. And we are magic talking to itself,
39. noisy and alone. I am queen of all my sins
40. forgotten. Am I still lost?
41. Once I was beautiful. Now I am myself,
42. counting this row and that row of moccasins
43. waiting on the silent shelf.
