1. They work with herbs
2. and penicillin
3. They work with gentleness
4. and the scalpel.
5. They dig out the cancer,
6. close an incision
7. and say a prayer
8. to the poverty of the skin.
9. They are not Gods
10. though they would like to be;
11. they are only a human
12. trying to fix up a human.
13. Many humans die.
14. They die like the tender,
15. palpitating berries
16. in November.
17. But all along the doctors remember:
18. First do no harm.
19. They would kiss if it would heal.
20. It would not heal.

21. If the doctors cure
22. then the sun sees it.
23. If the doctors kill
24. then the earth hides it.
25. The doctors should fear arrogance
26. more than cardiac arrest.
27. If they are too proud,
28. and some are,
29. then they leave home on horseback
30. but God returns them on foot.
