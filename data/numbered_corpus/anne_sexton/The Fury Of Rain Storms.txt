1. The rain drums down like red ants,
2. each bouncing off my window.
3. The ants are in great pain
4. and they cry out as they hit
5. as if their little legs were only
6. stitched on and their heads pasted.
7. And oh they bring to mind the grave,
8. so humble, so willing to be beat upon
9. with its awful lettering and
10. the body lying underneath
11. without an umbrella.
12. Depression is boring, I think
13. and I would do better to make
14. some soup and light up the cave.
