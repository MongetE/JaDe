1. Surely I will be disquieted
2. by the hospital, that body zone-
3. bodies wrapped in elastic bands,
4. bodies cased in wood or used like telephones,
5. bodies crucified up onto their crutches,
6. bodies wearing rubber bags between their legs,
7. bodies vomiting up their juice like detergent, Here in this house
8. there are other bodies.
9. Whenever I see a six-year-old
10. swimming in our aqua pool
11. a voice inside me says what can't be told...
12. Ha, someday you'll be old and withered
13. and tubes will be in your nose
14. drinking up your dinner.
15. Someday you'll go backward. You'll close
16. up like a shoebox and you'll be cursed
17. as you push into death feet first.

18. Here in the hospital, I say,
19. that is not my body, not my body.
20. I am not here for the doctors
21. to read like a recipe.
22. No. I am a daisy girl
23. blowing in the wind like a piece of sun.
24. On ward 7 there are daisies, all butter and pearl
25. but beside a blind man who can only
26. eat up the petals and count to ten.
27. The nurses skip rope around him and shiver
28. as his eyes wiggle like mercury and then
29. they dance from patient to patient to patient
30. throwing up little paper medicine cups and playing
31. catch with vials of dope as they wait for new accidents.
32. Bodies made of synthetics. Bodies swaddled like dolls
33. whom I visit and cajole and all they do is hum
34. like computers doing up our taxes, dollar by dollar.
35. Each body is in its bunker. The surgeon applies his gum.
36. Each body is fitted quickly into its ice-cream pack
37. and then stitched up again for the long voyage
38. back.
