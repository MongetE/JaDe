1. When man,
2. enters woman,
3. like the surf biting the shore,
4. again and again,
5. and the woman opens her mouth with pleasure
6. and her teeth gleam
7. like the alphabet,
8. Logos appears milking a star,
9. and the man
10. inside of woman
11. ties a knot
12. so that they will
13. never again be separate
14. and the woman
15. climbs into a flower
16. and swallows its stem
17. and Logos appears
18. and unleashes their rivers.

19. This man,
20. this woman
21. with their double hunger,
22. have tried to reach through
23. the curtain of God
24. and briefly they have,
25. though God
26. in His perversity
27. unties the knot.
