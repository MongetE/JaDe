1. One day He
2. tipped His top hat
3. and walked
4. out of the room,
5. ending the argument.
6. He stomped off
7. saying:
8. 'I don't give guarantees'.
9. I was left
10. quite alone
11. using up the darkness.
12. I rolled up
13. my sweater,
14. up into a ball,
15. and took it
16. to bed with me,
17. a kind of stand-in
18. for God,
19. what washerwoman
20. who walks out
21. when you're clean
22. but not ironed.
23. When I woke up
24. the sweater
25. had turned to
26. bricks of gold.
27. I'd won the world
28. but like a
29. forsaken explorer,
30. I'd lost
31. my map.
