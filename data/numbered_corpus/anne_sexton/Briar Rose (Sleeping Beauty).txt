1. Consider
2. a girl who keeps slipping off,
3. arms limp as old carrots,
4. into the hypnotist's trance,
5. into a spirit world
6. speaking with the gift of tongues.
7. She is stuck in the time machine,
8. suddenly two years old sucking her thumb,
9. as inward as a snail,
10. learning to talk again.
11. She's on a voyage.
12. She is swimming further and further back,
13. up like a salmon,
14. struggling into her mother's pocketbook.
15. Little doll child,
16. come here to Papa.
17. Sit on my knee.
18. I have kisses for the back of your neck.
19. A penny for your thoughts, Princess.
20. I will hunt them like an emerald.

21. Come be my snooky
22. and I will give you a root.
23. That kind of voyage,
24. rank as a honeysuckle.
25. Once
26. a king had a christening
27. for his daughter Briar Rose
28. and because he had only twelve gold plates
29. he asked only twelve fairies
30. to the grand event.
31. The thirteenth fairy,
32. her fingers as long and thing as straws,
33. her eyes burnt by cigarettes,
34. her uterus an empty teacup,
35. arrived with an evil gift.
36. She made this prophecy:
37. The princess shall prick herself
38. on a spinning wheel in her fifteenth year
39. and then fall down dead.
40. Kaputt!
41. The court fell silent.
42. The king looked like Munch's Scream
43. Fairies' prophecies,
44. in times like those,
45. held water.
46. However the twelfth fairy
47. had a certain kind of eraser
48. and thus she mitigated the curse
49. changing that death
50. into a hundred-year sleep.

51. The king ordered every spinning wheel
52. exterminated and exorcised.
53. Briar Rose grew to be a goddess
54. and each night the king
55. bit the hem of her gown
56. to keep her safe.
57. He fastened the moon up
58. with a safety pin
59. to give her perpetual light
60. He forced every male in the court
61. to scour his tongue with Bab-o
62. lest they poison the air she dwelt in.
63. Thus she dwelt in his odor.
64. Rank as honeysuckle.

65. On her fifteenth birthday
66. she pricked her finger
67. on a charred spinning wheel
68. and the clocks stopped.
69. Yes indeed. She went to sleep.
70. The king and queen went to sleep,
71. the courtiers, the flies on the wall.
72. The fire in the hearth grew still
73. and the roast meat stopped crackling.
74. The trees turned into metal
75. and the dog became china.
76. They all lay in a trance,
77. each a catatonic
78. stuck in a time machine.
79. Even the frogs were zombies.
80. Only a bunch of briar roses grew
81. forming a great wall of tacks
82. around the castle.
83. Many princes
84. tried to get through the brambles
85. for they had heard much of Briar Rose
86. but they had not scoured their tongues
87. so they were held by the thorns
88. and thus were crucified.
89. In due time
90. a hundred years passed
91. and a prince got through.
92. The briars parted as if for Moses
93. and the prince found the tableau intact.
94. He kissed Briar Rose
95. and she woke up crying:
96. Daddy! Daddy!
97. Presto! She's out of prison!
98. She married the prince
99. and all went well
100. except for the fear -
101. the fear of sleep.

102. Briar Rose
103. was an insomniac...
104. She could not nap
105. or lie in sleep
106. without the court chemist
107. mixing her some knock-out drops
108. and never in the prince's presence.
109. If if is to come, she said,
110. sleep must take me unawares
111. while I am laughing or dancing
112. so that I do not know that brutal place
113. where I lie down with cattle prods,
114. the hole in my cheek open.
115. Further, I must not dream
116. for when I do I see the table set
117. and a faltering crone at my place,
118. her eyes burnt by cigarettes
119. as she eats betrayal like a slice of meat.

120. I must not sleep
121. for while I'm asleep I'm ninety
122. and think I'm dying.
123. Death rattles in my throat
124. like a marble.
125. I wear tubes like earrings.
126. I lie as still as a bar of iron.
127. You can stick a needle
128. through my kneecap and I won't flinch.
129. I'm all shot up with Novocain.
130. This trance girl
131. is yours to do with.
132. You could lay her in a grave,
133. an awful package,
134. and shovel dirt on her face
135. and she'd never call back: Hello there!
136. But if you kissed her on the mouth
137. her eyes would spring open
138. and she'd call out: Daddy! Daddy!
139. Presto!
140. She's out of prison.

141. There was a theft.
142. That much I am told.
143. I was abandoned.
144. That much I know.
145. I was forced backward.
146. I was forced forward.
147. I was passed hand to hand
148. like a bowl of fruit.
149. Each night I am nailed into place
150. and forget who I am.
151. Daddy?
152. That's another kind of prison.
153. It's not the prince at all,
154. but my father
155. drunkeningly bends over my bed,
156. circling the abyss like a shark,
157. my father thick upon me
158. like some sleeping jellyfish.
159. What voyage is this, little girl?
160. This coming out of prison?
161. God help -
162. this life after death?
