1. This is the desk I sit at
2. and this is the desk where I love you too much
3. and this is the typewriter that sits before me
4. where yesterday only your body sat before me
5. with its shoulders gathered in like a Greek chorus,
6. with its tongue like a king making up rules as he goes,
7. with its tongue quite openly like a cat lapping milk,
8. with its tongue - both of us coiled in its slippery life.
9. That was yesterday, that day.
10. That was the day of your tongue,
11. your tongue that came from your lips,
12. two openers, half animals, half birds
13. caught in the doorway of your heart.
14. That was the day I followed the king's rules,
15. passing by your red veins and your blue veins,
16. my hands down the backbone, down quick like a firepole,
17. hands between legs where you display your inner knowledge,
18. where diamond mines are buried and come forth to bury,
19. come forth more sudden than some reconstructed city.
20. It is complete within seconds, that monument.
21. The blood runs underground yet brings forth a tower.
22. A multitude should gather for such an edifice.
23. For a miracle one stands in line and throws confetti.
24. Surely The Press is here looking for headlines.
25. Surely someone should carry a banner on the sidewalk.
26. If a bridge is constructed doesn't the mayor cut a ribbon?
27. If a phenomenon arrives shouldn't the Magi come bearing gifts?
28. Yesterday was the day I bore gifts for your gift
29. and came from the valley to meet you on the pavement.
30. That was yesterday, that day.
31. That was the day of your face,
32. your face after love, close to the pillow, a lullaby.
33. Half asleep beside me letting the old fashioned rocker stop,
34. our breath became one, became a child-breath together,
35. while my fingers drew little o's on your shut eyes,
36. while my fingers drew little smiles on your mouth,
37. while I drew I LOVE YOU on your chest and its drummer
38. and whispered, 'Wake up!' and you mumbled in your sleep,
39. 'Sh. We're driving to Cape Cod. We're heading for the Bourne
40. Bridge. We're circling the Bourne Circle.' Bourne!
41. Then I knew you in your dream and prayed of our time
42. that I would be pierced and you would take root in me
43. and that I might bring forth your born, might bear
44. the you or the ghost of you in my little household.
45. Yesterday I did not want to be borrowed
46. but this is the typewriter that sits before me
47. and love is where yesterday is at.
