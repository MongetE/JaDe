1. I am the only actor.
2. It is difficult for one woman
3. to act out a whole play.
4. The play is my life,
5. my solo act.
6. My running after the hands
7. and never catching up.
8. (The hands are out of sight -
9. that is, offstage.)
10. All I am doing onstage is running,
11. running to keep up,
12. but never making it.

13. Suddenly I stop running.
14. (This moves the plot along a bit.)
15. I give speeches, hundreds,
16. all prayers, all soliloquies.
17. I say absurd things like:
18. egss must not quarrel with stones
19. or, keep your broken arm inside your sleeve
20. or, I am standing upright
21. but my shadow is crooked.
22. And such and such.
23. Many boos. Many boos.

24. Despite that I go on to the last lines:
25. To be without God is to be a snake
26. who wants to swallow an elephant.
27. The curtain falls.
28. The audience rushes out.
29. It was a bad performance.
30. That’s because I’m the only actor
31. and there are few humans whose lives
32. will make an interesting play.
33. Don’t you agree?
