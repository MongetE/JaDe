1. Because there was no other place
2. to flee to,
3. I came back to the scene of the disordered senses,
4. came back last night at midnight,
5. arriving in the thick June night
6. without luggage or defenses,
7. giving up my car keys and my cash,
8. keeping only a pack of Salem cigarettes
9. the way a child holds on to a toy.
10. I signed myself in where a stranger
11. puts the inked-in X's—
12. for this is a mental hospital,
13. not a child's game.

14. Today an intern knocks my knees,
15. testing for reflexes.
16. Once I would have winked and begged for dope.
17. Today I am terribly patient.
18. Today crows play black-jack
19. on the stethoscope.

20. Everyone has left me
21. except my muse,
22. that good nurse.
23. She stays in my hand,
24. a mild white mouse.

25. The curtains, lazy and delicate,
26. billow and flutter and drop
27. like the Victorian skirts
28. of my two maiden aunts
29. who kept an antique shop.

30. Hornets have been sent.
31. They cluster like floral arrangements on the screen.
32. Hornets, dragging their thin stingers,
33. hover outside, all knowing,
34. hissing: the hornet knows.
35. I heard it as a child
36. but what was it that he meant?
37. The hornet knows!
38. What happened to Jack and Doc and Reggy?
39. Who remembers what lurks in the heart of man?
40. What did The Green Hornet mean, he knows?
41. Or have I got it wrong?
42. Is it The Shadow who had seen
43. me from my bedside radio?

44. Now it's Dinn, Dinn, Dinn!
45. while the ladies in the next room argue
46. and pick their teeth.
47. Upstairs a girl curls like a snail;
48. in another room someone tries to eat a shoe;
49. meanwhile an adolescent pads up and down
50. the hall in his white tennis socks.
51. A new doctor makes rounds
52. advertising tranquilizers, insulin, or shock
53. to the uninitiated.

54. Six years of such small preoccupations!
55. Six years of shuttling in and out of this place!
56. O my hunger! My hunger!
57. I could have gone around the world twice
58. or had new children - all boys.
59. It was a long trip with little days in it
60. and no new places.

61. In here,
62. it's the same old crowd,
63. the same ruined scene.
64. The alcoholic arrives with his gold clubs.
65. The suicide arrives with extra pills sewn
66. into the lining of her dress.
67. The permanent guests have done nothing new.
68. Their faces are still small
69. like babies with jaundice.

70. Meanwhile,
71. they carried out my mother,
72. wrapped like somebody's doll, in sheets,
73. bandaged her jaw and stuffed up her holes.
74. My father, too. He went out on the rotten blood
75. he used up on other women in the Middle West.
76. He went out, a cured old alcoholic
77. on crooked feet and useless hands.
78. He went out calling for his father
79. who died all by himself long ago -
80. that fat banker who got locked up,
81. his genes suspended like dollars,
82. wrapped up in his secret,
83. tied up securely in a straitjacket.

84. But you, my doctor, my enthusiast,
85. were better than Christ;
86. you promised me another world
87. to tell me who
88. I was.

89. I spent most of my time,
90. a stranger,
91. damned and in trance—that little hut,
92. that naked blue-veined place,
93. my eyes shut on the confusing office,
94. eyes circling into my childhood,
95. eyes newly cut.
96. Years of hints
97. strung out—a serialized case history—
98. thirty-three years of the same dull incest
99. that sustained us both.
100. You, my bachelor analyst,
101. who sat on Marlborough Street,
102. sharing your office with your mother
103. and giving up cigarettes each New Year,
104. were the new God,
105. the manager of the Gideon Bible.

106. I was your third-grader
107. with a blue star on my forehead.
108. In trance I could be any age,
109. voice, gesture—all turned backward
110. like a drugstore clock.
111. Awake, I memorized dreams.
112. Dreams came into the ring
113. like third string fighters,
114. each one a bad bet
115. who might win
116. because there was no other.

117. I stared at them,
118. concentrating on the abyss
119. the way one looks down into a rock quarry,
120. uncountable miles down,
121. my hands swinging down like hooks
122. to pull dreams up out of their cage.
123. O my hunger! My hunger!

124. Once, outside your office,
125. I collapsed in the old-fashioned swoon
126. between the illegally parked cars.
127. I threw myself down,
128. pretending dead for eight hours.
129. I thought I had died
130. into a snowstorm.
131. Above my head
132. chains cracked along like teeth
133. digging their way through the snowy street.
134. I lay there
135. like an overcoat
136. that someone had thrown away.
137. You carried me back in,
138. awkwardly, tenderly,
139. with help of the red-haired secretary
140. who was built like a lifeguard.
141. My shoes,
142. I remember,
143. were lost in the snowbank
144. as if I planned never to walk again.

145. That was the winter
146. that my mother died,
147. half mad on morphine,
148. blown up, at last,
149. like a pregnant pig.
150. I was her dreamy evil eye.
151. In fact,
152. I carried a knife in my pocketbook—
153. my husband's good L. L. Bean hunting knife.
154. I wasn't sure if I should slash a tire
155. or scrape the guts out of some dream.

156. You taught me
157. to believe in dreams;
158. thus I was the dredger.
159. I held them like an old woman with arthritic fingers,
160. carefully straining the water out—
161. sweet dark playthings,
162. and above all, mysterious
163. until they grew mournful and weak.
164. O my hunger! My hunger!
165. I was the one
166. who opened the warm eyelid
167. like a surgeon
168. and brought forth young girls
169. to grunt like fish.

170. I told you,
171. I said—
172. but I was lying—
173. that the knife was for my mother . . .
174. and then I delivered her.

175. The curtains flutter out
176. and slump against the bars.
177. They are my two thin ladies
178. named Blanche and Rose.
179. The grounds outside
180. are pruned like an estate at Newport.
181. Far off, in the field,
182. something yellow grows.

183. Was it last month or last year
184. that the ambulance ran like a hearse
185. with its siren blowing on suicide—
186. Dinn, dinn, dinn!—
187. a noon whistle that kept insisting on life
188. all the way through the traffic lights?

189. I have come back
190. but disorder is not what it was.
191. I have lost the trick of it!
192. The innocence of it!
193. That fellow-patient in his stovepipe hat
194. with his fiery joke, his manic smile—
195. even he seems blurred, small and pale.
196. I have come back,
197. recommitted,
198. fastened to the wall like a bathroom plunger,
199. held like a prisoner
200. who was so poor
201. he fell in love with jail.

202. I stand at this old window
203. complaining of the soup,
204. examining the grounds,
205. allowing myself the wasted life.
206. Soon I will raise my face for a white flag,
207. and when God enters the fort,
208. I won't spit or gag on his finger.
209. I will eat it like a white flower.
210. Is this the old trick, the wasting away,
211. the skull that waits for its dose
212. of electric power?

213. This is madness
214. but a kind of hunger.
215. What good are my questions
216. in this hierarchy of death
217. where the earth and the stones go
218. Dinn! Dinn! Dinn!
219. It is hardly a feast.
220. It is my stomach that makes me suffer.

221. Turn, my hungers!
222. For once make a deliberate decision.
223. There are brains that rot here
224. like black bananas.
225. Hearts have grown as flat as dinner plates.

226. Anne, Anne,
227. flee on your donkey,
228. flee this sad hotel,
229. ride out on some hairy beast,
230. gallop backward pressing
231. your buttocks to his withers,
232. sit to his clumsy gait somehow.
233. Ride out
234. any old way you please!
235. In this place everyone talks to his own mouth.
236. That's what it means to be crazy.
237. Those I loved best died of it—
238. the fool's disease.
