1. 1. DREAMS

2. I was an ice baby.
3. I turned to sky blue.
4. My tears became two glass beads.
5. My mouth stiffened into a dumb howl.
6. They say it was a dream
7. but I remember that hardening.

8. My sister at six
9. dreamt nightly of my death:
10. 'The baby turned to ice.
11. Someone put her in the refrigerator
12. and she turned as hard as a Popsicle.'

13. I remember the stink of the liverwurst.
14. How I was put on a platter and laid
15. between the mayonnaise and the bacon.
16. The rhythm of the refrigerator
17. had been disturbed.
18. The milk bottle hissed like a snake.
19. The tomatoes vomited up their stomachs.
20. The caviar turned to lave.
21. The pimentos kissed like cupids.
22. I moved like a lobster,
23. slower and slower.
24. The air was tiny.
25. The air would not do.
26. *
27. I was at the dogs' party.
28. I was their bone.
29. I had been laid out in their kennel
30. like a fresh turkey.

31. This was my sister's dream
32. but I remember that quartering;
33. I remember the sickbed smell
34. of the sawdust floor, the pink eyes,
35. the pink tongues and the teeth, those nails.
36. I had been carried out like Moses
37. and hidden by the paws
38. of ten Boston bull terriers,
39. ten angry bulls
40. jumping like enormous roaches.
41. At first I was lapped,
42. rough as sandpaper.
43. I became very clean.
44. Then my arm was missing.
45. I was coming apart.
46. They loved me until
47. I was gone.

48. 2. THE DY-DEE DOLL

49. My Dy-dee doll
50. died twice.
51. Once when I snapped
52. her head off
53. and let if float in the toilet
54. and once under the sun lamp
55. trying to get warm
56. she melted.
57. She was a gloom,
58. her face embracing
59. her little bent arms.
60. She died in all her rubber wisdom.

61. 3. SEVEN TIMES

62. I died seven times
63. in seven ways
64. letting death give me a sign,
65. letting death place his mark on my forehead,
66. crossed over, crossed over

67. And death took root in that sleep.
68. In that sleep I held an ice baby
69. and I rocked it
70. and was rocked by it.
71. Oh Madonna, hold me.
72. I am a small handful.

73. 4.MADONNA

74. My mother died
75. unrocked, unrocked.
76. Weeks at her deathbed
77. seeing her thrust herself against the metal bars,
78. thrashing like a fish on the hook
79. and me low at her high stage,
80. letting the priestess dance alone,
81. wanting to place my head in her lap
82. or even take her in my arms somehow
83. and fondle her twisted gray hair.
84. But her rocking horse was pain
85. with vomit steaming from her mouth.
86. Her belly was big with another child,
87. cancer's baby, big as a football.
88. I could not soothe.
89. With every hump and crack
90. there was less Madonna
91. until that strange labor took her.
92. Then the room was bankrupt.
93. That was the end of her paying.

94. 5. MAX

95. Max and I
96. two immoderate sisters,
97. two immoderate writers,
98. two burdeners,
99. made a pact.
100. To beat death down with a stick.
101. To take over.
102. To build our death like carpenters.
103. When she had a broken back,
104. each night we built her sleep.
105. Talking on the hot line
106. until her eyes pulled down like shades.
107. And we agreed in those long hushed phone calls
108. that when the moment comes
109. we'll talk turkey,
110. we'll shoot words straight from the hip,
111. we'll play it as it lays.
112. Yes,
113. when death comes with its hood
114. we won't be polite.

115. 6. BABY

116. Death,
117. you lie in my arms like a cherub,
118. as heavy as bread dough.
119. Your milky wings are as still as plastic.
120. Hair soft as music.
121. Hair the color of a harp.
122. And eyes made of glass,
123. as brittle as crystal.
124. Each time I rock you
125. I think you will break.
126. I rock. I rock.
127. Glass eye, ice eye,
128. primordial eye,
129. lava eye,
130. pin eye,
131. break eye,
132. how you stare back!

133. Like the gaze if small children
134. you know all about me.
135. You have worn my underwear.
136. You have read my newspaper.
137. You have seen my father whip me.
138. You have seen my stroke my father's whip.

139. I rock. I rock.
140. We plunge back and forth
141. comforting each other.
142. We are stone.
143. We are carved, a piet√†
144. that swings.
145. Outside, the world is a chilly army.
146. Outside, the sea is brought to its knees.
147. Outside, Pakistan is swallowed in a mouthful.

148. I rock. I rock.
149. You are my stone child
150. with still eyes like marbles.
151. There is a death baby
152. for each of us.
153. We own him.
154. His smell is our smell.
155. Beware. Beware.
156. There is a tenderness.
157. There is a love
158. for this dumb traveler
159. waiting in his pink covers.
160. Someday,
161. heavy with cancer or disaster
162. I will look up at Max
163. and say: It is time.
164. Hand me the death baby
165. and there will be
166. that final rocking.
