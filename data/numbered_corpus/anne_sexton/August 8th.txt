1. Listen here. I've never played it safe
2. in spite of what the critics say.
3. Ask my imaginary brother, that waif,
4. that childhood best friend who comes to play
5. dress-up and stick-up and jacks and Pick-Up-Sticks,
6. bike downtown, stick out tongues at the Catholics.

7. Or form a Piss Club where we all go
8. in the bushes and peek at each other's sex.
9. Pop-gunning the street lights like crows.
10. Not knowing what to do with funny Kotex
11. so wearing it in our school shoes. Friend, friend,
12. spooking my lonely hours you were there, but pretend.
