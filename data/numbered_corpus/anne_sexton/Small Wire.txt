1. My faith
2. is a great weight
3. hung on a small wire,
4. as doth the spider
5. hang her baby on a thin web,
6. as doth the vine,
7. twiggy and wooden,
8. hold up grapes
9. like eyeballs,
10. as many angels
11. dance on the head of a pin.

12. God does not need
13. too much wire to keep Him there,
14. just a thin vein,
15. with blood pushing back and forth in it,
16. and some love.
17. As it has been said:
18. Love and a cough
19. cannot be concealed.
20. Even a small cough.
21. Even a small love.
22. So if you have only a thin wire,
23. God does not mind.
24. He will enter your hands
25. as easily as ten cents used to
26. bring forth a Coke.
