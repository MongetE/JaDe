1. This singing
2. is a kind of dying,
3. a kind of birth,
4. a votive candle.
5. I have a dream-mother
6. who sings with her guitar,
7. nursing the bedroom
8. with a moonlight and beautiful olives.
9. A flute came too,
10. joining the five strings,
11. a God finger over the holes.
12. I knew a beautiful woman once
13. who sang with her fingertips
14. and her eyes were brown
15. like small birds.
16. At the cup of her breasts
17. I drew wine.
18. At the mound of her legs
19. I drew figs.
20. She sang for my thirst,
21. mysterious songs of God
22. that would have laid an army down.
23. It was as if a morning-glory
24. had bloomed in her throat
25. and all that blue
26. and small pollen
27. ate into my heart
28. violent and religious.
