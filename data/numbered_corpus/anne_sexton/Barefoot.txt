1. Loving me with my shoes off
2. means loving my long brown legs,
3. sweet dears, as good as spoons;
4. and my feet, those two children
5. let out to play naked. Intricate nubs,
6. my toes. No longer bound.
7. And what's more, see toenails and
8. all ten stages, root by root.
9. All spirited and wild, this little
10. piggy went to market and this little piggy
11. stayed. Long brown legs and long brown toes.
12. Further up, my darling, the woman
13. is calling her secrets, little houses,
14. little tongues that tell you.

15. There is no one else but us
16. in this house on the land spit.
17. The sea wears a bell in its navel.
18. And I'm your barefoot wench for a
19. whole week. Do you care for salami?
20. No. You'd rather not have a scotch?
21. No. You don't really drink. You do
22. drink me. The gulls kill fish,
23. crying out like three-year-olds.
24. The surf's a narcotic, calling out,
25. I am, I am, I am
26. all night long. Barefoot,
27. I drum up and down your back.
28. In the morning I run from door to door
29. of the cabin playing chase me.
30. Now you grab me by the ankles.
31. Now you work your way up the legs
32. and come to pierce me at my hunger mark
