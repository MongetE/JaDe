1. In his tenth July some instinct
2. taught him to arm the waiting wave,
3. a giant where its mouth hung open.
4. He rode on the lip that buoyed him there
5. and buckled him under. The beach was strung
6. with children paddling their ages in,
7. under the glare od noon chipping
8. its light out. He stood up, anonymous
9. and straight among them, between
10. their sand pails and nursery crafts.
11. The breakers cartwheeled in and over
12. to puddle their toes and test their perfect
13. skin. He was my brother, my small
14. Johnny brother, almost ten. We flopped
15. down upon a towel to grind the sand
16. under us and watched the Atlantic sea
17. move fire, like night sparklers;
18. and lost our weight in the festival
19. season. He dreamed, he said, to be
20. a man designed like a balanced wave…
21. how someday he would wait, giant
22. and straight.
23. Johnny, your dream moves summers
24. inside my mind.
25. He was tall and twenty that July,
26. but there was no balance to help;
27. only the shells came straight and even.
28. This was the first beach of assault;
29. the odor of death hung in the air
30. like rotting potatoes, the junkyard
31. of landing craft waited open and rusting.
32. The bodies were strung out as if they were
33. still reaching for each other, where they lay
34. to blacken, to burst through their perfect
35. skin. And Johnny Pole was one of them.
36. He gave in like a small wave, a sudden
37. hole in his belly and the years all gone
38. where the Pacific noon chipped its light out.
39. Like a bean bag, outflung, head loose
40. and anonymous, he lay. Did the sea move fire
41. for its battle season? Does he lie there
42. forever, where his rifle waits, giant
43. and straight?…I think you die again
44. and live again,
45. Johnny, each summer that moves inside
46. my mind.
