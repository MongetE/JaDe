1. Not that it was beautiful,
2. but that, in the end, there was
3. a certain sense of order there;
4. something worth learning
5. in that narrow diary of my mind,
6. in the commonplaces of the asylum
7. where the cracked mirror
8. or my own selfish death
9. outstared me.
10. And if I tried
11. to give you something else,
12. something outside of myself,
13. you would not know
14. that the worst of anyone
15. can be, finally,
16. an accident of hope.
17. I tapped my own head;
18. it was a glass, an inverted bowl.
19. It is a small thing
20. to rage in your own bowl.
21. At first it was private.
22. Then it was more than myself;
23. it was you, or your house
24. or your kitchen.
25. And if you turn away
26. because there is no lesson here
27. I will hold my awkward bowl,
28. with all its cracked stars shining
29. like a complicated lie,
30. and fasten a new skin around it
31. as if I were dressing an orange
32. or a strange sun.
33. Not that it was beautiful,
34. but that I found some order there.
35. There ought to be something special
36. for someone
37. in this kind of hope.
38. This is something I would never find
39. in a lovelier place, my dear,
40. although your fear is anyone's fear,
41. like an invisible veil between us allâ€¦
42. and sometimes in private,
43. my kitchen, your kitchen,
44. my face, your face.
