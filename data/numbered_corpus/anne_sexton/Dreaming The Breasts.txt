1. Mother,
2. strange goddess face
3. above my milk home,
4. that delicate asylum,
5. I ate you up.
6. All my need took
7. you down like a meal.

8. What you gave
9. I remember in a dream:
10. the freckled arms binding me,
11. the laugh somewhere over my woolly hat,
12. the blood fingers tying my shoe,
13. the breasts hanging like two bats
14. and then darting at me,
15. bending me down.

16. The breasts I knew at midnight
17. beat like the sea in me now.
18. Mother, I put bees in my mouth
19. to keep from eating
20. yet it did no good.
21. In the end they cut off your breasts
22. and milk poured from them
23. into the surgeon's hand
24. and he embraced them.
25. I took them from him
26. and planted them.

27. I have put a padlock
28. on you, Mother, dear dead human,
29. so that your great bells,
30. those dear white ponies,
31. can go galloping, galloping,
32. wherever you are.
