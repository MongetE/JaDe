1. 'You speak to me of narcissism but I reply that it is
2. a matter of my life' - Artaud

3. 'At this time let me somehow bequeath all the leftovers
4. to my daughters and their daughters' - Anonymous

5. Better,
6. despite the worms talking to
7. the mare’s hoof in the field;
8. better,
9. despite the season of young girls
10. dropping their blood;
11. better somehow
12. to drop myself quickly
13. into an old room.
14. Better (someone said)
15. not to be born
16. and far better
17. not to be born twice
18. at thirteen
19. where the boardinghouse,
20. each year a bedroom,
21. caught fire.

22. Dear friend,
23. I will have to sink with hundreds of others
24. on a dumbwaiter into hell.
25. I will be a light thing.
26. I will enter death
27. like someone’s lost optical lens.
28. Life is half enlarged.
29. The fish and owls are fierce today.
30. Life tilts backward and forward.
31. Even the wasps cannot find my eyes.

32. Yes,
33. eyes that were immediate once.
34. Eyes that have been truly awake,
35. eyes that told the whole story—
36. poor dumb animals.
37. Eyes that were pierced,
38. little nail heads,
39. light blue gunshots.

40. And once with
41. a mouth like a cup,
42. clay colored or blood colored,
43. open like the breakwater
44. for the lost ocean
45. and open like the noose
46. for the first head.

47. Once upon a time
48. my hunger was for Jesus.
49. O my hunger! My hunger!
50. Before he grew old
51. he rode calmly into Jerusalem
52. in search of death.

53. This time
54. I certainly
55. do not ask for understanding
56. and yet I hope everyone else
57. will turn their heads when an unrehearsed fish jumps
58. on the surface of Echo Lake;
59. when moonlight,
60. its bass note turned up loud,
61. hurts some building in Boston,
62. when the truly beautiful lie together.
63. I think of this, surely,
64. and would think of it far longer
65. if I were not… if I were not
66. at that old fire.

67. I could admit
68. that I am only a coward
69. crying me me me
70. and not mention the little gnats, the moths,
71. forced by circumstance
72. to suck on the electric bulb.
73. But surely you know that everyone has a death,
74. his own death,
75. waiting for him.
76. So I will go now
77. without old age or disease,
78. wildly but accurately,
79. knowing my best route,
80. carried by that toy donkey I rode all these years,
81. never asking, “Where are we going?”
82. We were riding (if I’d only known)
83. to this.

84. Dear friend,
85. please do not think
86. that I visualize guitars playing
87. or my father arching his bone.
88. I do not even expect my mother’s mouth.
89. I know that I have died before—
90. once in November, once in June.
91. How strange to choose June again,
92. so concrete with its green breasts and bellies.
93. Of course guitars will not play!
94. The snakes will certainly not notice.
95. New York City will not mind.
96. At night the bats will beat on the trees,
97. knowing it all,
98. seeing what they sensed all day.
