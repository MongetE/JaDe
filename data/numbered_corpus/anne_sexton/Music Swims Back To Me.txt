1. Wait Mister. Which way is home?
2. They turned the light out
3. and the dark is moving in the corner.
4. There are no sign posts in this room,
5. four ladies, over eighty,
6. in diapers every one of them.
7. La la la, Oh music swims back to me
8. and I can feel the tune they played
9. the night they left me
10. in this private institution on a hill.

11. Imagine it. A radio playing
12. and everyone here was crazy.
13. I liked it and danced in a circle.
14. Music pours over the sense
15. and in a funny way
16. music sees more than I.
17. I mean it remembers better;
18. remembers the first night here.
19. It was the strangled cold of November;
20. even the stars were strapped in the sky
21. and that moon too bright
22. forking through the bars to stick me
23. with a singing in the head.
24. I have forgotten all the rest.

25. They lock me in this chair at eight a.m.
26. and there are no signs to tell the way,
27. just the radio beating to itself
28. and the song that remembers
29. more than I. Oh, la la la,
30. this music swims back to me.
31. The night I came I danced a circle
32. and was not afraid.
33. Mister?
