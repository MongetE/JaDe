1. I was wrapped in black
2. fur and white fur and
3. you undid me and then
4. you placed me in gold light
5. and then you crowned me,
6. while snow fell outside
7. the door in diagonal darts.
8. While a ten-inch snow
9. came down like stars
10. in small calcium fragments,
11. we were in our own bodies
12. (that room that will bury us)
13. and you were in my body
14. (that room that will outlive us)
15. and at first I rubbed your
16. feet dry with a towel
17. because I was your slave
18. and then you called me princess.
19. Princess!

20. Oh then
21. I stood up in my gold skin
22. and I beat down the psalms
23. and I beat down the clothes
24. and you undid the bridle
25. and you undid the reins
26. and I undid the buttons,
27. the bones, the confusions,
28. the New England postcards,
29. the January ten o'clock night,
30. and we rose up like wheat,
31. acre after acre of gold,
32. and we harvested,
33. we harvested.
