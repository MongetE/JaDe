1. I am in a crate, the crate that was ours,
2. full of white shirts and salad greens,
3. the icebox knocking at our delectable knocks,
4. and I wore movies in my eyes,
5. and you wore eggs in your tunnel,
6. and we played sheets, sheets, sheets
7. all day, even in the bathtub like lunatics.
8. But today I set the bed afire
9. and smoke is filling the room,
10. it is getting hot enough for the walls to melt,
11. and the icebox, a gluey white tooth.

12. I have on a mask in order to write my last words,
13. and they are just for you, and I will place them
14. in the icebox saved for vodka and tomatoes,
15. and perhaps they will last.
16. The dog will not. Her spots will fall off.
17. The old letters will melt into a black bee.
18. The night gowns are already shredding
19. into paper, the yellow, the red, the purple.
20. The bed - well, the sheets have turned to gold -
21. hard, hard gold, and the mattress
22. is being kissed into a stone.

23. As for me, my dearest Foxxy,
24. my poems to you may or may not reach the icebox
25. and its hopeful eternity,
26. for isn't yours enough?
27. The one where you name
28. my name right out in P.R.?
29. If my toes weren't yielding to pitch
30. I'd tell the whole story -
31. not just the sheet story
32. but the belly-button story,
33. the pried-eyelid story,
34. the whiskey-sour-of-the-nipple story -
35. and shovel back our love where it belonged.

36. Despite my asbestos gloves,
37. the cough is filling me with black and a red powder seeps through my
38. veins,
39. our little crate goes down so publicly
40. and without meaning it, you see, meaning a solo act,
41. a cremation of the love,
42. but instead we seem to be going down right in the middle of a Russian
43. street,
44. the flames making the sound of
45. the horse being beaten and beaten,
46. the whip is adoring its human triumph
47. while the flies wait, blow by blow,
48. straight from United Fruit, Inc.
