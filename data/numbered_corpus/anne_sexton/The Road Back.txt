1. The car is heavy with children
2. tugged back from summer,
3. swept out of their laughing beach,
4. swept out while a persistent rumour
5. tells them nothing ends.
6. Today we fret and pull
7. on wheels, ignore our regular loss
8. of time, count cows and others
9. while the sun moves over
10. like an old albatross
11. we must not count nor kill.
12. There is no word for time.
13. Today we will
14. not think to number another summer
15. or watch its white bird into the ground.
16. Today, all cars,
17. all fathers, all mothers, all
18. children and lovers will
19. have to forget
20. about that thing in the sky,
21. going around
22. like a persistent rumor
23. that will get us yet.
