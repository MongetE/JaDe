1. I am surprised to see
2. that the ocean is still going on.
3. Now I am going back
4. and I have ripped my hand
5. from your hand as I said I would
6. and I have made it this far
7. as I said I would
8. and I am on the top deck now
9. holding my wallet, my cigarettes
10. and my car keys
11. at 2 o'clock on a Tuesday
12. in August of 1960.
13. Dearest,
14. although everything has happened,
15. nothing has happened.
16. The sea is very old.
17. the sea is the face of Mary,
18. without miracles or rage
19. or unusual hope,
20. grown rough and wrinkled
21. with incurable age.
22. Still,
23. I have eyes,
24. These are my eyes:
25. the orange letters that spell
26. ORIENT on the life preserver
27. that hangs by my knees;
28. the cement lifeboat that wears
29. its dirty canvas coat;
30. the faded sign that sits on its shelf
31. saying KEEP OFF.
32. Oh, alright, I say,
33. I'll save myself.
34. Over my right shoulder
35. I see four arms
36. who sit like a bridge club,
37. their faces poked out
38. from under their habits,
39. as good as good babies who
40. have sunk into their carriages.
41. Without discrimination
42. the wind pulls the skirts
43. of their arms.
44. Almost undressed,
45. I see what remains:
46. that holy wrist,
47. that ankle,
48. that chain.
49. Oh God,
50. although I am very sad,
51. could you please
52. let these four nuns
53. loosen their leather boots
54. and their wooden chairs
55. to rise out
56. over this greasy deck,
57. out over this iron rail,
58. nodding their pink heads to one side,
59. flying four abreast
60. in the old-fashioned side stroke;
61. each mouth open and round,
62. breathing together
63. as fish do,
64. singing without sound.
65. Dearest,
66. see how my dark girls sally forth,
67. over the passing lighthouse of Plum Gut,
68. its shell as rusty
69. as a camp dish,
70. as fragile as a pagoda
71. on a stone;
72. out over the little lighthouse
73. that warns me of drowning winds
74. that rub over its blind bottom
75. and its blue cover;
76. winds that will take the toes
77. and the ears of the rider
78. or the lover.
79. There go my dark girls,
80. their dresses puff
81. in the leeward air.
82. Oh, they are lighter than flying dogs
83. or the breath of dolphins;
84. each mouth opens gratefully,
85. wider than a milk cup.
86. My dark girls sing for this.
87. They are going up.
88. See them rise
89. on black wings, drinking
90. the sky, without smiles
91. or hands
92. or shoes.
93. They call back to us
94. from the gauzy edge of paradise,

95. good news, good news.
