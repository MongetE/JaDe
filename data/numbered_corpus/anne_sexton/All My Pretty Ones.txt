1. Father, this year's jinx rides us apart
2. where you followed our mother to her cold slumber;
3. a second shock boiling its stone to your heart,
4. leaving me here to shuffle and disencumber
5. you from the residence you could not afford:
6. a gold key, your half of a woolen mill,
7. twenty suits from Dunne's, an English Ford,
8. the love and legal verbiage of another will,
9. boxes of pictures of people I do not know.
10. I touch their cardboard faces. They must go.

11. But the eyes, as thick as wood in this album,
12. hold me. I stop here, where a small boy
13. waits in a ruffled dress for someone to comeâ€¦
14. for this soldier who holds his bugle like a toy
15. or for this velvet lady who cannot smile.
16. Is this your father's father, this Commodore
17. in a mailman suit? My father, time meanwhile
18. has made it unimportant who you are looking for.
19. I'll never know what these faces are all about.
20. I lock them into their book and throw them out.

21. This is the yellow scrapbook that you began
22. the year I was born; as crackling now and wrinkly
23. as tobacco leaves: clippings where Hoover outran
24. the Democrats, wiggling his dry finger at me
25. and Prohibition; news where the Hindenburg went
26. down and recent years where you went flush
27. on war. This year, solvent but sick, you meant
28. to marry that pretty widow in a one-month rush.
29. But before you had that second chance, I cried
30. on your fat shoulder. Three days later you died.

31. These are the snapshots of marriage, stopped in places.
32. Side by side at the rail toward Nassau now;
33. here, with the winner's cup at the speedboat races,
34. here, in tails at the Cotillion, you take a bow,


35. here, by our kennel of dogs with their pink eyes,
36. running like show-bred pigs in their chain-link pen;
37. here, at the horseshow where my sister wins a prize;
38. Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator,
39. my first lost keeper, to love or look at later.


40. I hold a five-year diary that my mother kept
41. for three years, telling all she does not say
42. of your alcoholic tendency. You overslept,
43. she writes. My God, father, each Christmas Day
44. with your blood, will I drink down your glass
45. of wine? The diary of your hurly-burly years
46. goes to my shelf to wait for my age to pass.
47. Only in this hoarded span will love persevere.
48. Whether you are pretty or not, I outlive you,
49. bend down my strange face to yours and forgive you.
