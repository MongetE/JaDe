1. The end of the affair is always death.
2. She's my workshop. Slippery eye,
3. out of the tribe of myself my breath
4. finds you gone. I horrify
5. those who stand by. I am fed.
6. At night, alone, I marry the bed.Finger to finger, now she's mine.
7. She's not too far. She's my encounter.
8. I beat her like a bell. I recline
9. in the bower where you used to mount her.
10. You borrowed me on the flowered spread.
11. At night, alone, I marry the bed.Take for instance this night, my love,
12. that every single couple puts together
13. with a joint overturning, beneath, above,
14. the abundant two on sponge and feather,
15. kneeling and pushing, head to head.
16. At night, alone, I marry the bed.I break out of my body this way,
17. an annoying miracle. Could I
18. put the dream market on display?
19. I am spread out. I crucify.
20. My little plum is what you said.
21. At night, alone, I marry the bed.Then my black-eyed rival came.
22. The lady of water, rising on the beach,
23. a piano at her fingertips, shame
24. on her lips and a flute's speech.
25. And I was the knock-kneed broom instead.
26. At night, alone, I marry the bed.She took you the way a women takes
27. a bargain dress off the rack
28. and I broke the way a stone breaks.
29. I give back your books and fishing tack.
30. Today's paper says that you are wed.
31. At night, alone, I marry the bed.The boys and girls are one tonight.
32. They unbutton blouses. They unzip flies.
33. They take off shoes. They turn off the light.
34. The glimmering creatures are full of lies.
35. They are eating each other. They are overfed.
36. At night, alone, I marry the bed.
