1. I live in my wooden legs and O
2. my green green hands.Too late
3. to wish I had not run from you, Apollo,
4. blood moves still in my bark bound veins.
5. I, who ran nymph foot to foot in flight,
6. have only this late desire to arm the trees
7. I lie within. The measure that I have lost
8. silks my pulse. Each century the trickeries
9. of need pain me everywhere.
10. Frost taps my skin and I stay glossed
11. in honor for you are gone in time. The air
12. rings for you, for that astonishing rite
13. of my breathing tent undone within your light.
14. I only know how untimely lust has tossed
15. flesh at the wind forever and moved my fears
16. toward the intimate Rome of myth we crossed.
17. I am a fist of my unease
18. as I spill toward the stars in the empty years.
19. I build the air with the crown of honor; it keys
20. my out of time and luckless appetite.
21. You gave me honor too soon, Apollo.
22. There is no one left who understands
23. how I wait
24. here in my wooden legs and O
25. my green green hands.
