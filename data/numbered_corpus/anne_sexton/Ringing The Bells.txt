1. And this is the way they ring
2. the bells in Bedlam
3. and this is the bell-lady
4. who comes each Tuesday morning
5. to give us a music lesson
6. and because the attendants make you go
7. and because we mind by instinct,
8. like bees caught in the wrong hive,
9. we are the circle of crazy ladies
10. who sit in the lounge of the mental house
11. and smile at the smiling woman
12. who passes us each a bell,
13. who points at my hand
14. that holds my bell, E flat,
15. and this is the gray dress next to me
16. who grumbles as if it were special
17. to be old, to be old,
18. and this is the small hunched squirrel girl
19. on the other side of me
20. who picks at the hairs over her lip,
21. who picks at the hairs over her lip all day,
22. and this is how the bells really sound,
23. as untroubled and clean
24. as a workable kitchen,
25. and this is always my bell responding
26. to my hand that responds to the lady
27. who points at me, E flat;
28. and although we are not better for it,
29. they tell you to go. And you do.
