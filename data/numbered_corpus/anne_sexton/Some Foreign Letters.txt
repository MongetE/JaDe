1. I knew you forever and you were always old,
2. soft white lady of my heart. Surely you would scold
3. me for sitting up late, reading your letters,
4. as if these foreign postmarks were meant for me.
5. You posted them first in London, wearing furs
6. and a new dress in the winter of eighteen-ninety.
7. I read how London is dull on Lord Mayor's Day,
8. where you guided past groups of robbers, the sad holes
9. of Whitechapel, clutching your pocketbook, on the way
10. to Jack the Ripper dissecting his famous bones.
11. This Wednesday in Berlin, you say, you will
12. go to a bazaar at Bismarck's house. And I
13. see you as a young girl in a good world still,
14. writing three generations before mine. I try
15. to reach into your page and breathe it backâ€¦
16. but life is a trick, life is a kitten in a sack.
17. This is the sack of time your death vacates.
18. How distant your are on your nickel-plated skates
19. in the skating park in Berlin, gliding past
20. me with your Count, while a military band
21. plays a Strauss waltz. I loved you last,
22. a pleated old lady with a crooked hand.
23. Once you read Lohengrin and every goose
24. hung high while you practiced castle life
25. in Hanover. Tonight your letters reduce
26. history to a guess. The count had a wife.
27. You were the old maid aunt who lived with us.
28. Tonight I read how the winter howled around
29. the towers of Schloss Schwobber, how the tedious
30. language grew in your jaw, how you loved the sound
31. of the music of the rats tapping on the stone
32. floors. When you were mine you wore an earphone.
33. This is Wednesday, May 9th, near Lucerne,
34. Switzerland, sixty-nine years ago. I learn
35. your first climb up Mount San Salvatore;
36. this is the rocky path, the hole in your shoes,
37. the yankee girl, the iron interior
38. of her sweet body. You let the Count choose
39. your next climb. You went together, armed
40. with alpine stocks, with ham sandwiches
41. and seltzer wasser. You were not alarmed
42. by the thick woods of briars and bushes,
43. nor the rugged cliff, nor the first vertigo
44. up over Lake Lucerne. The Count sweated
45. with his coat off as you waded through top snow.
46. He held your hand and kissed you. You rattled
47. down on the train to catch a steam boat for home;
48. or other postmarks: Paris, verona, Rome.
49. This is Italy. You learn its mother tongue.
50. I read how you walked on the Palatine among
51. the ruins of the palace of the Caesars;
52. alone in the Roman autumn, alone since July.
53. When you were mine they wrapped you out of here
54. with your best hat over your face. I cried
55. because I was seventeen. I am older now.
56. I read how your student ticket admitted you
57. into the private chapel of the Vatican and how
58. you cheered with the others, as we used to do
59. on the fourth of July. One Wednesday in November
60. you watched a balloon, painted like a silver abll,
61. float up over the Forum, up over the lost emperors,
62. to shiver its little modern cage in an occasional
63. breeze. You worked your New England conscience out
64. beside artisans, chestnut vendors and the devout.
65. Tonight I will learn to love you twice;
66. learn your first days, your mid-Victorian face.
67. Tonight I will speak up and interrupt
68. your letters, warning you that wars are coming,
69. that the Count will die, that you will accept
70. your America back to live like a prim thing
71. on the farm in Maine. I tell you, you will come
72. here, to the suburbs of Boston, to see the blue-nose
73. world go drunk each night, to see the handsome
74. children jitterbug, to feel your left ear close
75. one Friday at Symphony. And I tell you,
76. you will tip your boot feet out of that hall,
77. rocking from its sour sound, out onto
78. the crowded street, letting your spectacles fall
79. and your hair net tangle as you stop passers-by
80. to mumble your guilty love while your ears die.
