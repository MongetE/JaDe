1. Someone is dead.
2. Even the trees know it,
3. those poor old dancers who come on lewdly,
4. all pea-green scarfs and spine pole.
5. I think…
6. I think I could have stopped it,
7. if I'd been as firm as a nurse
8. or noticed the neck of the driver
9. as he cheated the crosstown lights;
10. or later in the evening,
11. if I'd held my napkin over my mouth.
12. I think I could…
13. if I'd been different, or wise, or calm,
14. I think I could have charmed the table,
15. the stained dish or the hand of the dealer.
16. But it's done.
17. It's all used up.
18. There's no doubt about the trees
19. spreading their thin feet into the dry grass.
20. A Canada goose rides up,
21. spread out like a gray suede shirt,
22. honking his nose into the March wind.
23. In the entryway a cat breathes calmly
24. into her watery blue fur.
25. The supper dishes are over and the sun
26. unaccustomed to anything else
27. goes an the way down.
