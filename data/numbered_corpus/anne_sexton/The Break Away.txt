1. Your daisies have come
2. on the day of my divorce:
3. the courtroom a cement box,
4. a gas chamber for the infectious Jew in me
5. and a perhaps land, a possibly promised land
6. for the Jew in me,
7. but still a betrayal room for the till-death-do-usâ€”
8. and yet a death, as in the unlocking of scissors
9. that makes the now separate parts useless,
10. even to cut each other up as we did yearly
11. under the crayoned-in sun.
12. The courtroom keeps squashing our lives as they break
13. into two cans ready for recycling,
14. flattened tin humans
15. and a tin law,
16. even for my twenty-five years of hanging on
17. by my teeth as I once saw at Ringling Brothers.
18. The gray room:
19. Judge, lawyer, witness
20. and me and invisible Skeezix,
21. and all the other torn
22. enduring the bewilderments
23. of their division.

24. Your daisies have come
25. on the day of my divorce.
26. They arrive like round yellow fish,
27. sucking with love at the coral of our love.
28. Yet they wait,
29. in their short time,
30. like little utero half-borns,
31. half killed, thin and bone soft.
32. They breathe the air that stands
33. for twenty-five illicit days,
34. the sun crawling inside the sheets,
35. the moon spinning like a tornado
36. in the washbowl,
37. and we orchestrated them both,
38. calling ourselves TWO CAMP DIRECTORS.
39. There was a song, our song on your cassette,
40. that played over and over
41. and baptised the prodigals.
42. It spoke the unspeakable,
43. as the rain will on an attic roof,
44. letting the animal join its soul
45. as we kneeled before a miracle-
46. forgetting its knife.

47. The daisies confer
48. in the old-married kitchen
49. papered with blue and green chefs
50. who call out pies, cookies, yummy,
51. at the charcoal and cigarette smoke
52. they wear like a yellowy salve.
53. The daisies absorb it all-
54. the twenty-five-year-old sanctioned love
55. (If one could call such handfuls of fists
56. and immobile arms that!)
57. and on this day my world rips itself up
58. while the country unfastens along
59. with its perjuring king and his court.
60. It unfastens into an abortion of belief,
61. as in me-
62. the legal rift-
63. as on might do with the daisies
64. but does not
65. for they stand for a love
66. undergoihng open heart surgery
67. that might take
68. if one prayed tough enough.
69. And yet I demand,
70. even in prayer,
71. that I am not a thief,
72. a mugger of need,
73. and that your heart survive
74. on its own,
75. belonging only to itself,
76. whole, entirely whole,
77. and workable
78. in its dark cavern under your ribs.

79. I pray it will know truth,
80. if truth catches in its cup
81. and yet I pray, as a child would,
82. that the surgery take.

83. I dream it is taking.
84. Next I dream the love is swallowing itself.
85. Next I dream the love is made of glass,
86. glass coming through the telephone
87. that is breaking slowly,
88. day by day, into my ear.
89. Next I dream that I put on the love
90. like a lifejacket and we float,
91. jacket and I,
92. we bounce on that priest-blue.
93. We are as light as a cat's ear
94. and it is safe,
95. safe far too long!
96. And I awaken quickly and go to the opposite window
97. and peer down at the moon in the pond
98. and know that beauty has walked over my head,
99. into this bedroom and out,
100. flowing out through the window screen,
101. dropping deep into the water
102. to hide.

103. I will observe the daisies
104. fade and dry up
105. wuntil they become flour,
106. snowing themselves onto the table
107. beside the drone of the refrigerator,
108. beside the radio playing Frankie
109. (as often as FM will allow)
110. snowing lightly, a tremor sinking from the ceiling-
111. as twenty-five years split from my side
112. like a growth that I sliced off like a melanoma.

113. It is six P.M. as I water these tiny weeds
114. and their little half-life,
115. their numbered days
116. that raged like a secret radio,
117. recalling love that I picked up innocently,
118. yet guiltily,
119. as my five-year-old daughter
120. picked gum off the sidewalk
121. and it became suddenly an elastic miracle.

122. For me it was love found
123. like a diamond
124. where carrots grow-
125. the glint of diamond on a plane wing,
126. meaning: DANGER! THICK ICE!
127. but the good crunch of that orange,
128. the diamond, the carrot,
129. both with four million years of resurrecting dirt,
130. and the love,
131. although Adam did not know the word,
132. the love of Adam
133. obeying his sudden gift.

134. You, who sought me for nine years,
135. in stories made up in front of your naked mirror
136. or walking through rooms of fog women,
137. you trying to forget the mother
138. who built guilt with the lumber of a locked door
139. as she sobbed her soured mild and fed you loss
140. through the keyhole,
141. you who wrote out your own birth
142. and built it with your own poems,
143. your own lumber, your own keyhole,
144. into the trunk and leaves of your manhood,
145. you, who fell into my words, years
146. before you fell into me (the other,
147. both the Camp Director and the camper),
148. you who baited your hook with wide-awake dreams,
149. and calls and letters and once a luncheon,
150. and twice a reading by me for you.
151. But I wouldn't!

152. Yet this year,
153. yanking off all past years,
154. I took the bait
155. and was pulled upward, upward,
156. into the sky and was held by the sun-
157. the quick wonder of its yellow lap-
158. and became a woman who learned her own shin
159. and dug into her soul and found it full,
160. and you became a man who learned his won skin
161. and dug into his manhood, his humanhood
162. and found you were as real as a baker
163. or a seer
164. and we became a home,
165. up into the elbows of each other's soul,
166. without knowing-
167. an invisible purchase-
168. that inhabits our house forever.

169. We were
170. blessed by the House-Die
171. by the altar of the color T.V.
172. and somehow managed to make a tiny marriage,
173. a tiny marriage
174. called belief,
175. as in the child's belief in the tooth fairy,
176. so close to absolute,
177. so daft within a year or two.
178. The daisies have come
179. for the last time.
180. And I who have,
181. each year of my life,
182. spoken to the tooth fairy,
183. believing in her,
184. even when I was her,
185. am helpless to stop your daisies from dying,
186. although your voice cries into the telephone:
187. Marry me! Marry me!
188. and my voice speaks onto these keys tonight:
189. The love is in dark trouble!
190. The love is starting to die,
191. right now-
192. we are in the process of it.
193. The empty process of it.

194. I see two deaths,
195. and the two men plod toward the mortuary of my heart,
196. and though I willed one away in court today
197. and I whisper dreams and birthdays into the other,
198. they both die like waves breaking over me
199. and I am drowning a little,
200. but always swimming
201. among the pillows and stones of the breakwater.
202. And though your daisies are an unwanted death,
203. I wade through the smell of their cancer
204. and recognize the prognosis,
205. its cartful of loss-

206. I say now,
207. you gave what you could.
208. It was quite a ferris wheel to spin on!
209. and the dead city of my marriage
210. seems less important
211. than the fact that the daisies came weekly,
212. over and over,
213. likes kisses that can't stop themselves.

214. There sit two deaths on November 5th, 1973.
215. Let one be forgotten-
216. Bury it! Wall it up!
217. But let me not forget the man
218. of my child-like flowers
219. though he sinks into the fog of Lake Superior,
220. he remains, his fingers the marvel
221. of fourth of July sparklers,
222. his furious ice cream cones of licking,
223. remains to cool my forehead with a washcloth
224. when I sweat into the bathtub of his being.

225. For the rest that is left:
226. name it gentle,
227. as gentle as radishes inhabiting
228. their short life in the earth,
229. name it gentle,
230. gentle as old friends waving so long at the window,
231. or in the drive,
232. name it gentle as maple wings singing
233. themselves upon the pond outside,
234. as sensuous as the mother-yellow in the pond,
235. that night that it was ours,
236. when our bodies floated and bumped
237. in moon water and the cicadas
238. called out like tongues.

239. Let such as this
240. be resurrected in all men
241. whenever they mold their days and nights
242. as when for twenty-five days and nights you molded mine
243. and planted the seed that dives into my God
244. and will do so forever
245. no matter how often I sweep the floor.
