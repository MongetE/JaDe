1. You said the anger would come back
2. just as the love did.

3. I have a black look I do not
4. like. It is a mask I try on.
5. I migrate toward it and its frog
6. sits on my lips and defecates.
7. It is old. It is also a pauper.
8. I have tried to keep it on a diet.
9. I give it no unction.

10. There is a good look that I wear
11. like a blood clot. I have
12. sewn it over my left breast.
13. I have made a vocation of it.
14. Lust has taken plant in it
15. and I have placed you and your
16. child at its milk tip.

17. Oh the blackness is murderous
18. and the milk tip is brimming
19. and each machine is working
20. and I will kiss you when
21. I cut up one dozen new men
22. and you will die somewhat,
23. again and again.
