1. You are the roast beef I have purchased
2. and I stuff you with my very own onion.

3. You are a boat I have rented by the hour
4. and I steer you with my rage until you run aground.

5. You are a glass that I have paid to shatter
6. and I swallow the pieces down with my spit.

7. You are the grate I warm my trembling hands on,
8. searing the flesh until it's nice and juicy.

9. You stink like my Mama under your bra
10. and I vomit into your hand like a jackpot
11. its cold hard quarters.
