1. Slim inquirer, while the old fathers sleep
2. you are reworking their soil, you have
3. a grocery store there down under the earth
4. and it is well stocked with broken wine bottles,
5. old cigars, old door knobs and earth,
6. that great brown flour that you kiss each day.
7. There are dark stars in the cool evening and
8. you fondle them like killer birds' beaks.
9. But what I want to know is why when small boys
10. dig you up for curiosity and cut you in half
11. why each half lives and crawls away as if whole.
12. Have you no beginning and end? Which heart is
13. the real one? Which eye the seer? Why
14. is it in the infinite plan that you would
15. be severed and rise from the dead like a gargoyle
16. with two heads?
