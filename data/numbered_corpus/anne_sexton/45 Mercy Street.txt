1. In my dream,
2. drilling into the marrow
3. of my entire bone,
4. my real dream,
5. I'm walking up and down Beacon Hill
6. searching for a street sign -
7. namely MERCY STREET.
8. Not there.

9. I try the Back Bay.
10. Not there.
11. Not there.
12. And yet I know the number.
13. 45 Mercy Street.
14. I know the stained-glass window
15. of the foyer,
16. the three flights of the house
17. with its parquet floors.
18. I know the furniture and
19. mother, grandmother, great-grandmother,
20. the servants.
21. I know the cupboard of Spode
22. the boat of ice, solid silver,
23. where the butter sits in neat squares
24. like strange giant's teeth
25. on the big mahogany table.
26. I know it well.
27. Not there.

28. Where did you go?
29. 45 Mercy Street,
30. with great-grandmother
31. kneeling in her whale-bone corset
32. and praying gently but fiercely
33. to the wash basin,
34. at five A.M.
35. at noon
36. dozing in her wiggy rocker,
37. grandfather taking a nap in the pantry,
38. grandmother pushing the bell for the downstairs maid,
39. and Nana rocking Mother with an oversized flower
40. on her forehead to cover the curl
41. of when she was good and when she was...
42. And where she was begat
43. and in a generation
44. the third she will beget,
45. me,
46. with the stranger's seed blooming
47. into the flower called Horrid.

48. I walk in a yellow dress
49. and a white pocketbook stuffed with cigarettes,
50. enough pills, my wallet, my keys,
51. and being twenty-eight, or is it forty-five?
52. I walk. I walk.
53. I hold matches at street signs
54. for it is dark,
55. as dark as the leathery dead
56. and I have lost my green Ford,
57. my house in the suburbs,
58. two little kids
59. sucked up like pollen by the bee in me
60. and a husband
61. who has wiped off his eyes
62. in order not to see my inside out
63. and I am walking and looking
64. and this is no dream
65. just my oily life
66. where the people are alibis
67. and the street is unfindable for an
68. entire lifetime.

69. Pull the shades down -
70. I don't care!
71. Bolt the door, mercy,
72. erase the number,
73. rip down the street sign,
74. what can it matter,
75. what can it matter to this cheapskate
76. who wants to own the past
77. that went out on a dead ship
78. and left me only with paper?

79. Not there.

80. I open my pocketbook,
81. as women do,
82. and fish swim back and forth
83. between the dollars and the lipstick.
84. I pick them out,
85. one by one
86. and throw them at the street signs,
87. and shoot my pocketbook
88. into the Charles River.
89. Next I pull the dream off
90. and slam into the cement wall
91. of the clumsy calendar
92. I live in,
93. my life,
94. and its hauled up
95. notebooks.
