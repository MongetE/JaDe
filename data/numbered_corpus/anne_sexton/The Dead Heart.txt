5. It is not a turtle
6. hiding in its little green shell.
7. It is not a stone
8. to pick up and put under your black wing.

17. shrinks, priests, lovers, children, husbands,
18. friends and all the lot.
19. An expensive thing it was to keep going.
20. It gave back too.
21. Don’t deny it!
22. I half wonder if April would bring it back to life?
23. A tulip? The first bud?

26. How did it die?
27. I called it EVIL.
28. I said to it, your poems stink like vomit.
29. I didn’t stay to hear the last sentence.
30. It died on the word EVIL.
31. It did it with my tongue.
32. The tongue, the Chinese say,
33. is like a sharp knife:
34. it kills
35. without drawing blood.
