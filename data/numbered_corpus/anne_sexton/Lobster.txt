1. A shoe with legs,
2. a stone dropped from heaven,
3. he does his mournful work alone,
4. he is the old prospector for golf,
5. with secret dreams of God-heads and fish heads.
6. Until suddenly a cradle fastens round him
7. and his is trapped as the U.S.A. sleeps.
8. Somewhere far off a woman lights a cigarette;
9. somewhere far off a car goes over a bridge;
10. somewhere far off a bank is held up.
11. This is the world the lobster knows not of.
12. He is the old hunting dog of the sea
13. who in the morning will rise from it
14. and be undrowned
15. and they will take his perfect green body
16. and paint it red.
