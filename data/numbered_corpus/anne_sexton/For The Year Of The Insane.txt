1. A prayer

2. O Mary, fragile mother,
3. hear me, hear me now
4. although I do not know your words.
5. The black rosary with its silver Christ
6. lies unblessed in my hand
7. for I am the unbeliever.
8. Each bead is round and hard between my fingers,
9. a small black angel.
10. O Mary, permit me this grace,
11. this crossing over,
12. although I am ugly,
13. submerged in my own past
14. and my own madness.
15. Although there are chairs
16. I lie on the floor.
17. Only my hands are alive,
18. touching beads.
19. Word for word, I stumble.
20. A beginner, I feel your mouth touch mine.

21. I count beads as waves,
22. hammering in upon me.
23. I am ill at their numbers,
24. sick, sick in the summer heat
25. and the window above me
26. is my only listener, my awkward being.
27. She is a large taker, a soother.
28. The giver of breath
29. she murmurs,
30. exhaling her wide lung like an enormous fish.

31. Closer and closer
32. comes the hour of my death
33. as I rearrange my face, grow back,
34. grow undeveloped and straight-haired.
35. All this is death.
36. In the mind there is a thin alley called death
37. and I move through it as
38. through water.
39. My body is useless.
40. It lies, curled like a dog on the carpet.
41. It has given up.
42. There are no words here except the half-learned,
43. the Hail Mary and the full of grace.
44. Now I have entered the year without words.
45. I note the queer entrance and the exact voltage.
46. Without words they exist.
47. Without words on my touch bread
48. and be handed bread
49. and make no sound.

50. O Mary, tender physician,
51. come with powders and herbs
52. for I am in the center.
53. It is very small and the air is gray
54. as in a steam house.
55. I am handed wine as a child is handed milk.
56. It is presented in a delicate glass
57. with a round bowl and a thin lip.
58. The wine itself is pitch-colored, musty and secret.
59. The glass rises in its own toward my mouth
60. and I notice this and understand this
61. only because it has happened.

62. I have this fear of coughing
63. but I do not speak,
64. a fear of rain, a fear of the horseman
65. who comes riding into my mouth.
66. The glass tilts in on its own
67. and I amon fire.
68. I see two thin streaks burn down my chin.
69. I see myself as one would see another.
70. I have been cut int two.

71. O Mary, open your eyelids.
72. I am in the domain of silence,
73. the kingdom of the crazy and the sleeper.
74. There is blood here.
75. and I haven't eaten it.
76. O mother of the womb,
77. did I come for blood alone?
78. O little mother,
79. I am in my own mind.
80. I am locked in the wrong house.
