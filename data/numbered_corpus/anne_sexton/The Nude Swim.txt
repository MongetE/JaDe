1. On the southwest side of Capri
2. we found a little unknown grotto
3. where no people were and we
4. entered it completely
5. and let our bodies lose all
6. their loneliness.

7. All the fish in us
8. had escaped for a minute.
9. The real fish did not mind.
10. We did not disturb their personal life.
11. We calmly trailed over them
12. and under them, shedding
13. air bubbles, little white
14. balloons that drifted up
15. into the sun by the boat
16. where the Italian boatman slept
17. with his hat over his face.

18. Water so clear you could
19. read a book through it.
20. Water so buoyant you could
21. float on your elbow.
22. I lay on it as on a divan.
23. I lay on it just like
24. Matisse's Red Odalisque.
25. Water was my strange flower,
26. one must picture a woman
27. without a toga or a scarf
28. on a couch as deep as a tomb.

29. The walls of that grotto
30. were everycolor blue and
31. you said, 'Look! Your eyes
32. are seacolor. Look! Your eyes
33. are skycolor.' And my eyes
34. shut down as if they were
35. suddenly ashamed.
