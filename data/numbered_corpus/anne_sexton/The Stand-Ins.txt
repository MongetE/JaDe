1. In the dream
2. the swastika is neon
3. and flashes like a strobe light
4. into my eyes, all colors,
5. all vibrations
6. and I see the killer in him
7. and he turns on an oven,
8. an oven, an oven, an oven,
9. and on a pie plate he sticks
10. in my Yellow Star
11. and then
12. then when it is ready for servingâ€”
13. this dream goes off into the wings
14. and on stage The Cross appears,
15. with Jesus sticking to it
16. and He is breathing
17. and breathing
18. and He is breathing
19. and breathing
20. and then He speaks,
21. a kind of whisper,
22. and says . . .
23. This is the start.
24. This is the end.
25. This is a light.
26. This is a start.
27. I woke.
28. I did not know the hour,
29. an hour of night like thick scum
30. but I considered the dreams,
31. the two: Swastika, Crucifix,
32. and said: Oh well,
33. it doesn't belong to me,
34. if a cigar can be a cigar
35. then a dream can be a dream.
36. Right?
37. Right?
38. And went back to sleep
39. and another start.
