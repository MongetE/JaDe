1. We are America.
2. We are the coffin fillers.
3. We are the grocers of death.
4. We pack them in crates like cauliflowers.

5. The bomb opens like a shoebox.
6. And the child?
7. The child is certainly not yawning.
8. And the woman?
9. The woman is bathing her heart.
10. It has been torn out of her
11. and as a last act
12. she is rinsing it off in the river.
13. This is the death market.

14. America,
15. where are your credentials?
