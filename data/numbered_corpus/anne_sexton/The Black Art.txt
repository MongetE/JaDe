1. A woman who writes feels too much,
2. those trances and portents!
3. As if cycles and children and islands
4. weren't enough; as if mourners and gossips
5. and vegetables were never enough.
6. She thinks she can warn the stars.
7. A writer is essentially a spy.
8. Dear love, I am that girl.

9. A man who writes knows too much,
10. such spells and fetiches!
11. As if erections and congresses and products
12. weren't enough; as if machines and galleons
13. and wars were never enough.
14. With used furniture he makes a tree.
15. A writer is essentially a crook.
16. Dear love, you are that man.

17. Never loving ourselves,
18. hating even our shoes and our hats,
19. we love each other, precious, precious.
20. Our hands are light blue and gentle.
21. Our eyes are full of terrible confessions.
22. But when we marry,
23. the children leave in disgust.
24. There is too much food and no one left over
25. to eat up all the weird abundance.
