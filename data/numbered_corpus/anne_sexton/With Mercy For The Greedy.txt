1. for my friend Ruth, who urges me to make an appointment for the Sacrament of Confesson

2. Concerning your letter in which you ask
3. me to call a priest and in which you ask
4. me to wear The Cross that you enclose;
5. your own cross,
6. your dog-bitten cross,
7. no larger than a thumb,
8. small and wooden, no thorns, this rose -

9. I pray to its shadow,
10. that gray place
11. where it lies on your letterâ€¦ deep, deep.
12. I detest my sins and I try to believe
13. in The Cross. I touch its tender hips, its dark jawed face,
14. its solid neck, its brown sleep.

15. True. There is
16. a beautiful Jesus.
17. He is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef.
18. How desperately he wanted to pull his arms in!
19. How desperately I touch his vertical and horizontal axes!
20. But I can't. Need is not quite belief.

21. All morning long
22. I have worn
23. your cross, hung with package string around my throat.
24. It tapped me lightly as a child's heart might,
25. tapping secondhand, softly waiting to be born.
26. Ruth, I cherish the letter you wrote.

27. My friend, my friend, I was born
28. doing reference work in sin, and born
29. confessing it. This is what poems are:
30. with mercy
31. for the greedy,
32. they are the tongue's wrangle,
33. the world's pottage, the rat's star.
