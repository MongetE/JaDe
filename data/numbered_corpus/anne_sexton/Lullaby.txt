1. It is a summer evening.
2. The yellow moths sag
3. against the locked screens
4. and the faded curtains
5. suck over the window sills
6. and from another building
7. a goat calls in his dreams.
8. This is the TV parlor
9. in the best ward at Bedlam.
10. The night nurse is passing
11. out the evening pills.
12. She walks on two erasers,
13. padding by us one by one.

14. My sleeping pill is white.
15. It is a splendid pearl;
16. it floats me out of myself,
17. my stung skin as alien
18. as a loose bolt of cloth.
19. I will ignore the bed.
20. I am linen on a shelf.
21. Let the others moan in secret;
22. let each lost butterfly
23. go home. Old woolen head,
24. take me like a yellow moth
25. while the goat calls hush-a-bye.
