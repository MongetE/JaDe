1. Let the flowers make a journey
2. on Monday so that I can see
3. ten daisies in a blue vase
4. with perhaps one red ant
5. crawling to the gold center.
6. A bit of the field on my table,
7. close to the worms
8. who struggle blinding,
9. moving deep into their slime,
10. moving deep into God's abdomen,
11. moving like oil through water,
12. sliding through the good brown.
13. The daisies grow wild
14. like popcorn.
15. They are God's promise to the field.
16. How happy I am, daisies, to love you.
17. How happy you are to be loved
18. and found magical, like a secret
19. from the sluggish field.
20. If all the world picked daisies
21. wars would end, the common cold would stop,
22. unemployment would end, the monetary market
23. would hold steady and no money would float.
24. Listen world.
25. if you'd just take the time to pick
26. the white flowers, the penny heart,
27. all would be well.
28. They are so unexpected.
29. They are as good as salt.
30. If someone had brought them
31. to van Gogh's room daily
32. his ear would have stayed on.
33. I would like to think that no one would die anymore
34. if we all believed in daisies
35. but the worms know better, don't they?
36. They slide into the ear of a corpse
37. and listen to his great sigh.
