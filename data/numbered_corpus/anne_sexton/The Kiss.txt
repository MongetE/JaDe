1. My mouth blooms like a cut.
2. I've been wronged all year, tedious
3. nights, nothing but rough elbows in them
4. and delicate boxes of Kleenex calling crybaby
5. crybaby, you fool!

6. Before today my body was useless.
7. Now it's tearing at its square corners.
8. It's tearing old Mary's garments off, knot by knot
9. and see - Now it's shot full of these electric bolts.
10. Zing! A resurrection!

11. Once it was a boat, quite wooden
12. and with no business, no salt water under it
13. and in need of some paint. It was no more
14. than a group of boards. But you hoisted her, rigged her.
15. She's been elected.

16. My nerves are turned on. I hear them like
17. musical instruments. Where there was silence
18. the drums, the strings are incurably playing. You did this.
19. Pure genius at work. Darling, the composer has stepped
20. into fire.
