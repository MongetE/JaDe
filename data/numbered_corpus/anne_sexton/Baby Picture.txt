1. It's in the heart of the grape
2. where that smile lies.
3. It's in the good-bye-bow in the hair
4. where that smile lies.
5. It's in the clerical collar of the dress
6. where that smile lies.
7. What smile?
8. The smile of my seventh year,
9. caught here in the painted photograph.

10. It's peeling now, age has got it,
11. a kind of cancer of the background
12. and also in the assorted features.
13. It's like a rotten flag
14. or a vegetable from the refrigerator,
15. pocked with mold.
16. I am aging without sound,
17. into darkness, darkness.

18. Anne,
19. who are you?

20. I open the vein
21. and my blood rings like roller skates.
22. I open the mouth
23. and my teeth are an angry army.
24. I open the eyes
25. and they go sick like dogs
26. with what they have seen.
27. I open the hair
28. and it falls apart like dust balls.
29. I open the dress
30. and I see a child bent on a toilet seat.
31. I crouch there, sitting dumbly
32. pushing the enemas out like ice cream,
33. letting the whole brown world
34. turn into sweets.

35. Anne,
36. who are you?

37. Merely a kid keeping alive.
