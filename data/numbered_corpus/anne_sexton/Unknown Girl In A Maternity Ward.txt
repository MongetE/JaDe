1. Child, the current of your breath is six days long.
2. You lie, a small knuckle on my white bed;
3. lie, fisted like a snail, so small and strong
4. at my breast. Your lips are animals; you are fed
5. with love. At first hunger is not wrong.
6. The nurses nod their caps; you are shepherded
7. down starch halls with the other unnested throng
8. in wheeling baskets. You tip like a cup; your head
9. moving to my touch. You sense the way we belong.
10. But this is an institution bed.
11. You will not know me very long.

12. The doctors are enamel. They want to know
13. the facts. They guess about the man who left me,
14. some pendulum soul, going the way men go
15. and leave you full of child. But our case history
16. stays blank. All I did was let you grow.
17. Now we are here for all the ward to see.
18. They thought I was strange, although
19. I never spoke a word. I burst empty of you,
20. letting you see how the air is so.
21. The doctors chart the riddle they ask of me
22. and I turn my head away. I do not know.

23. Yours is the only face I recognize.
24. Bone at my bone, you drink my answers in.
25. Six times a day I prize
26. your need, the animals of your lips, your skin
27. growing warm and plump. I see your eyes
28. lifting their tents. They are blue stones, they begin
29. to outgrow their moss. You blink in surprise
30. and I wonder what you can see, my funny kin,
31. as you trouble my silence. I am a shelter of lies.
32. Should I learn to speak again, or hopeless in
33. such sanity will I touch some face I recognize?

34. Down the hall the baskets start back. My arms
35. fit you like a sleeve, they hold
36. catkins of your willows, the wild bee farms
37. of your nerves, each muscle and fold
38. of your first days. Your old man's face disarms
39. the nurses. But the doctors return to scold
40. me. I speak. It is you my silence harms.
41. I should have known; I should have told
42. them something to write down. My voice alarms
43. my throat. 'Name of father-none.' I hold
44. you and name you bastard in my arms.

45. And now that's that. There is nothing more
46. that I can say or lose.
47. Others have traded life before
48. and could not speak. I tighten to refuse
49. your owling eyes, my fragile visitor.
50. I touch your cheeks, like flowers. You bruise
51. against me. We unlearn. I am a shore
52. rocking off you. You break from me. I choose
53. your only way, my small inheritor
54. and hand you off, trembling the selves we lose.
55. Go child, who is my sin and nothing more.
