1. Many a miner has gone
2. into the deep pit
3. to receive the dust of a kiss,
4. an ore-cell.
5. He has gone with his lamp
6. full of mole eyes
7. deep deep and has brought forth
8. Jesus at Gethsemane.
9. Body of moss, body of glass,
10. body of peat, how sharp
11. you lie, emerald as heavy
12. as a golf course, ruby as dark
13. as an afterbirth,
14. diamond as white as sun
15. on the sea, coal, dark mother,
16. brood mother, let the sea birds
17. bring you into our lives
18. as from a distant island,
19. heavy as death.
