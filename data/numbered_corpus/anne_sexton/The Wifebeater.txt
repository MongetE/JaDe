1. There will be mud on the carpet tonight
2. and blood in the gravy as well.
3. The wifebeater is out,
4. the childbeater is out
5. eating soil and drinking bullets from a cup.
6. He strides back and forth
7. in front of my study window
8. chewing little red pieces of my heart.
9. His eyes flash like a birthday cake
10. and he makes bread out of rock.
11. Yesterday he was walking
12. like a man in the world.
13. He was upright and conservative
14. but somehow evasive, somehow contagious.
15. Yesterday he built me a country
16. and laid out a shadow where I could sleep
17. but today a coffin for the madonna and child,
18. today two women in baby clothes will be hamburg.
19. With a tongue like a razor he will kiss,
20. the mother, the child,
21. and we three will color the stars black
22. in memory of his mother
23. who kept him chained to the food tree
24. or turned him on and off like a water faucet
25. and made women through all these hazy years
26. the enemy with a heart of lies.
27. Tonight all the red dogs lie down in fear
28. and the wife and daughter knit into each other
29. until they are killed.
