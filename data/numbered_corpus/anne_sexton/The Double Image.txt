1. 1.

2. I am thirty this November.
3. You are still small, in your fourth year.
4. We stand watching the yellow leaves go queer,
5. flapping in the winter rain.
6. falling flat and washed. And I remember
7. mostly the three autumns you did not live here.
8. They said I'd never get you back again.
9. I tell you what you'll never really know:
10. all the medical hypothesis
11. that explained my brain will never be as true as these
12. struck leaves letting go.

13. I, who chose two times
14. to kill myself, had said your nickname
15. the mewling mouths when you first came;
16. until a fever rattled
17. in your throat and I moved like a pantomine
18. above your head. Ugly angels spoke to me. The blame,
19. I heard them say, was mine. They tattled
20. like green witches in my head, letting doom
21. leak like a broken faucet;
22. as if doom had flooded my belly and filled your bassinet,
23. an old debt I must assume.

24. Death was simpler than I'd thought.
25. The day life made you well and whole
26. I let the witches take away my guilty soul.
27. I pretended I was dead
28. until the white men pumped the poison out,
29. putting me armless and washed through the rigamarole
30. of talking boxes and the electric bed.
31. I laughed to see the private iron in that hotel.
32. Today the yellow leaves
33. go queer. You ask me where they go I say today believed
34. in itself, or else it fell.

35. Today, my small child, Joyce,
36. love your self's self where it lives.
37. There is no special God to refer to; or if there is,
38. why did I let you grow
39. in another place. You did not know my voice
40. when I came back to call. All the superlatives
41. of tomorrow's white tree and mistletoe
42. will not help you know the holidays you had to miss.
43. The time I did not love
44. myself, I visited your shoveled walks; you held my glove.
45. There was new snow after this.

46. 2.

47. They sent me letters with news
48. of you and I made moccasins that I would never use.
49. When I grew well enough to tolerate
50. myself, I lived with my mother, the witches said.
51. But I didn't leave. I had my portrait
52. done instead.

53. Part way back from Bedlam
54. I came to my mother's house in Gloucester,
55. Massachusetts. And this is how I came
56. to catch at her; and this is how I lost her.
57. I cannot forgive your suicide, my mother said.
58. And she never could. She had my portrait
59. done instead.

60. I lived like an angry guest,
61. like a partly mended thing, an outgrown child.
62. I remember my mother did her best.
63. She took me to Boston and had my hair restyled.
64. Your smile is like your mother's, the artist said.
65. I didn't seem to care. I had my portrait
66. done instead.

67. There was a church where I grew up
68. with its white cupboards where they locked us up,
69. row by row, like puritans or shipmates
70. singing together. My father passed the plate.
71. Too late to be forgiven now, the witches said.
72. I wasn't exactly forgiven. They had my portrait
73. done instead.

74. 3.

75. All that summer sprinklers arched
76. over the seaside grass.
77. We talked of drought
78. while the salt-parched
79. field grew sweet again. To help time pass
80. I tried to mow the lawn
81. and in the morning I had my portrait done,
82. holding my smile in place, till it grew formal.
83. Once I mailed you a picture of a rabbit
84. and a postcard of Motif number one,
85. as if it were normal
86. to be a mother and be gone.

87. They hung my portrait in the chill
88. north light, matching
89. me to keep me well.
90. Only my mother grew ill.
91. She turned from me, as if death were catching,
92. as if death transferred,
93. as if my dying had eaten inside of her.
94. That August you were two, by I timed my days with doubt.
95. On the first of September she looked at me
96. and said I gave her cancer.
97. They carved her sweet hills out
98. and still I couldn't answer.

99. 4.

100. That winter she came
101. part way back
102. from her sterile suite
103. of doctors, the seasick
104. cruise of the X-ray,
105. the cells' arithmetic
106. gone wild. Surgery incomplete,
107. the fat arm, the prognosis poor, I heard
108. them say.

109. During the sea blizzards
110. she had here
111. own portrait painted.
112. A cave of mirror
113. placed on the south wall;
114. matching smile, matching contour.
115. And you resembled me; unacquainted
116. with my face, you wore it. But you were mine
117. after all.

118. I wintered in Boston,
119. childless bride,
120. nothing sweet to spare
121. with witches at my side.
122. I missed your babyhood,
123. tried a second suicide,
124. tried the sealed hotel a second year.
125. On April Fool you fooled me. We laughed and this
126. was good.

127. 5.

128. I checked out for the last time
129. on the first of May;
130. graduate of the mental cases,
131. with my analysts's okay,
132. my complete book of rhymes,
133. my typewriter and my suitcases.

134. All that summer I learned life
135. back into my own
136. seven rooms, visited the swan boats,
137. the market, answered the phone,
138. served cocktails as a wife
139. should, made love among my petticoats

140. and August tan. And you came each
141. weekend. But I lie.
142. You seldom came. I just pretended
143. you, small piglet, butterfly
144. girl with jelly bean cheeks,
145. disobedient three, my splendid

146. stranger. And I had to learn
147. why I would rather
148. die than love, how your innocence
149. would hurt and how I gather
150. guilt like a young intern
151. his symptons, his certain evidence.

152. That October day we went
153. to Gloucester the red hills
154. reminded me of the dry red fur fox
155. coat I played in as a child; stock still
156. like a bear or a tent,
157. like a great cave laughing or a red fur fox.

158. We drove past the hatchery,
159. the hut that sells bait,
160. past Pigeon Cove, past the Yacht Club, past Squall's
161. Hill, to the house that waits
162. still, on the top of the sea,
163. and two portraits hung on the opposite walls.

164. 6.

165. In north light, my smile is held in place,
166. the shadow marks my bone.
167. What could I have been dreaming as I sat there,
168. all of me waiting in the eyes, the zone
169. of the smile, the young face,
170. the foxes' snare.

171. In south light, her smile is held in place,
172. her cheeks wilting like a dry
173. orchid; my mocking mirror, my overthrown
174. love, my first image. She eyes me from that face
175. that stony head of death
176. I had outgrown.

177. The artist caught us at the turning;
178. we smiled in our canvas home
179. before we chose our foreknown separate ways.
180. The dry redfur fox coat was made for burning.
181. I rot on the wall, my own
182. Dorian Gray.

183. And this was the cave of the mirror,
184. that double woman who stares
185. at herself, as if she were petrified
186. in time - two ladies sitting in umber chairs.
187. You kissed your grandmother
188. and she cried.

189. 7.

190. I could not get you back
191. except for weekends. You came
192. each time, clutching the picture of a rabbit
193. that I had sent you. For the last time I unpack
194. your things. We touch from habit.
195. The first visit you asked my name.
196. Now you will stay for good. I will forget
197. how we bumped away from each other like marionettes
198. on strings. It wasn't the same
199. as love, letting weekends contain
200. us. You scrape your knee. You learn my name,
201. wobbling up the sidewalk, calling and crying.
202. You can call me mother and I remember my mother again,
203. somewhere in greater Boston, dying.

204. I remember we named you Joyce
205. so we could call you Joy.
206. You came like an awkward guest
207. that first time, all wrapped and moist
208. and strange at my heavy breast.
209. I needed you. I didn't want a boy,
210. only a girl, a small milky mouse
211. of a girl, already loved, already loud in the house
212. of herself. We named you Joy.
213. I, who was never quite sure
214. about being a girl, needed another
215. life, another image to remind me.
216. And this was my worst guilt; you could not cure
217. or soothe it. I made you to find me.
