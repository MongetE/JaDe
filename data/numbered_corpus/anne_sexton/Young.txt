1. A thousand doors ago
2. when I was a lonely kid
3. in a big house with four
4. garages and it was summer
5. as long as I could remember,
6. I lay on the lawn at night,
7. clover wrinkling over me,
8. the wise stars bedding over me,
9. my mother's window a funnel
10. of yellow heat running out,
11. my father's window, half shut,
12. an eye where sleepers pass,
13. and the boards of the house
14. were smooth and white as wax
15. and probably a million leaves
16. sailed on their strange stalks
17. as the crickets ticked together
18. and I, in my brand new body,
19. which was not a woman's yet,
20. told the stars my questions
21. and thought God could really see
22. the heat and the painted light,
23. elbows, knees, dreams, goodnight.
