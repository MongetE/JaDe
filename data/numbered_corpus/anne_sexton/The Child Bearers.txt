1. Jean, death comes close to us all,
2. flapping its awful wings at us
3. and the gluey wings crawl up our nose.
4. Our children tremble in their teen-age cribs,
5. whirling off on a thumb or a motorcycle,
6. mine pushed into gnawing a stilbestrol cancer
7. I passed on like hemophilia,
8. or yours in the seventh grade, with her spleen
9. smacked in by the balance beam.
10. And we, mothers, crumpled, and flyspotted
11. with bringing them this far
12. can do nothing now but pray.

13. Let us put your three children
14. and my two children,
15. ages ranging from eleven to twenty-one,
16. and send them in a large air net up to God,
17. with many stamps, real air mail,
18. and huge signs attached:
19. SPECIAL HANDLING.
20. DO NOT STAPLE, FOLD OR MUTILATE!
21. And perhaps He will notice
22. and pass a psalm over them
23. for keeping safe for a whole,
24. for a whole God-damned life-span.

25. And not even a muddled angel will
26. peek down at us in our foxhole.
27. And He will not have time
28. to send down an eyedropper of prayer for us,
29. the mothering thing of us,
30. as we drip into the soup
31. and drown
32. in the worry festering inside us,
33. lest our children
34. go so fast
35. they go.
