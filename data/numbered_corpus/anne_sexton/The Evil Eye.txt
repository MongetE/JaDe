1. It comes oozing
2. out of flowers at night,
3. it comes out of the rain
4. if a snake looks skyward,
5. it comes out of chairs and tables
6. if you don't point at them and say their names.
7. It comes into your mouth while you sleep,
8. pressing in like a washcloth.
9. Beware. Beware.

10. If you meet a cross-eyed person
11. you must plunge into the grass,
12. alongside the chilly ants,
13. fish through the green fingernails
14. and come up with the four-leaf clover
15. or your blood with congeal
16. like cold gravy.

17. If you run across a horseshoe,
18. passerby,
19. stop, take your hands out of your pockets
20. and count the nails
21. as you count your children
22. or your money.
23. Otherwise a sand flea will crawl in your ear
24. and fly into your brain
25. and the only way you'll keep from going mad
26. is to be hit with a hammer every hour.

27. If a hunchback is in the elevator with you
28. don't turn away,
29. immediately touch his hump
30. for his child will be born from his back tomorrow
31. and if he promptly bites the baby's nails off
32. (so it won't become a thief)
33. that child will be holy
34. and you, simple bird that you are,
35. may go on flying.

36. When you knock on wood,
37. and you do,
38. you knock on the Cross
39. and Jesus gives you a fragment of His body
40. and breaks an egg in your toilet,
41. giving up one life
42. for one life.
