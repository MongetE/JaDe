1. If you danced from midnight
2. to six A.M. who would understand?

3. The runaway boy
4. who chucks it all
5. to live on the Boston Common
6. on speed and saltines,
7. pissing in the duck pond,
8. rapping with the street priest,
9. trading talk like blows,
10. another missing person,
11. would understand.

12. The paralytic's wife
13. who takes her love to town,
14. sitting on the bar stool,
15. downing stingers and peanuts,
16. singing 'That ole Ace down in the hole,'
17. would understand.

18. The passengers
19. from Boston to Paris
20. watching the movie with dawn
21. coming up like statues of honey,
22. having partaken of champagne and steak
23. while the world turned like a toy globe,
24. those murderers of the nightgown
25. would understand.

26. The amnesiac
27. who tunes into a new neighborhood,
28. having misplaced the past,
29. having thrown out someone else's
30. credit cards and monogrammed watch,
31. would understand.

32. The drunken poet
33. (a genius by daylight)
34. who places long-distance calls
35. at three A.M. and then lets you sit
36. holding the phone while he vomits
37. (he calls it 'The Night of the Long Knives')
38. getting his kicks out of the death call,
39. would understand.

40. The insomniac
41. listening to his heart
42. thumping like a June bug,
43. listening on his transistor
44. to Long John Nebel arguing from New York,
45. lying on his bed like a stone table,
46. would understand.

47. The night nurse
48. with her eyes slit like Venetian blinds,
49. she of the tubes and the plasma,
50. listening to the heart monitor,
51. the death cricket bleeping,
52. she who calls you 'we'
53. and keeps vigil like a ballistic missile,
54. would understand.

55. Once
56. this king had twelve daughters,
57. each more beautiful than the other.
58. They slept together, bed by bed
59. in a kind of girls' dormitory.
60. At night the king locked and bolted the door
61. . How could they possibly escape?
62. Yet each morning their shoes
63. were danced to pieces.
64. Each was as worn as an old jockstrap.
65. The king sent out a proclamation
66. that anyone who could discover
67. where the princesses did their dancing
68. could take his pick of the litter.
69. However there was a catch.
70. If he failed, he would pay with his life.
71. Well, so it goes.

72. Many princes tried,
73. each sitting outside the dormitory,
74. the door ajar so he could observe
75. what enchantment came over the shoes.
76. But each time the twelve dancing princesses
77. gave the snoopy man a Mickey Finn
78. and so he was beheaded.
79. Poof! Like a basketball.

80. It so happened that a poor soldier
81. heard about these strange goings on
82. and decided to give it a try.
83. On his way to the castle
84. he met an old old woman.
85. Age, for a change, was of some use.
86. She wasn't stuffed in a nursing home.
87. She told him not to drink a drop of wine
88. and gave him a cloak that would make
89. him invisible when the right time came.
90. And thus he sat outside the dorm.
91. The oldest princess brought him some wine
92. but he fastened a sponge beneath his chin,
93. looking the opposite of Andy Gump.
94. The sponge soaked up the wine,
95. and thus he stayed awake.
96. He feigned sleep however
97. and the princesses sprang out of their beds
98. and fussed around like a Miss America Contest.
99. Then the eldest went to her bed
100. and knocked upon it and it sank into the earth.
101. They descended down the opening
102. one after the other. They crafty soldier
103. put on his invisible cloak and followed.
104. Yikes, said the youngest daughter,
105. something just stepped on my dress.
106. But the oldest thought it just a nail.

107. Next stood an avenue of trees,
108. each leaf make of sterling silver.
109. The soldier took a leaf for proof.
110. The youngest heard the branch break
111. and said, Oof! Who goes there?
112. But the oldest said, Those are
113. the royal trumpets playing triumphantly.
114. The next trees were made of diamonds.
115. He took one that flickered like Tinkerbell
116. and the youngest said: Wait up! He is here!
117. But the oldest said: Trumpets, my dear.

118. Next they came to a lake where lay
119. twelve boats with twelve enchanted princes
120. waiting to row them to the underground castle.
121. The soldier sat in the youngest's boat
122. and the boat was as heavy as if an icebox
123. had been added but the prince did not suspect.

124. Next came the ball where the shoes did duty.
125. The princesses danced like taxi girls at Roseland
126. as if those tickets would run right out.
127. They were painted in kisses with their secret hair
128. and though the soldier drank from their cups
129. they drank down their youth with nary a thought.

130. Cruets of champagne and cups full of rubies.
131. They danced until morning and the sun came up
132. naked and angry and so they returned
133. by the same strange route. The soldier
134. went forward through the dormitory and into
135. his waiting chair to feign his druggy sleep.
136. That morning the soldier, his eyes fiery
137. like blood in a wound, his purpose brutal
138. as if facing a battle, hurried with his answer
139. as if to the Sphinx. The shoes! The shoes!
140. The soldier told. He brought forth
141. the silver leaf, the diamond the size of a plum.

142. He had won. The dancing shoes would dance
143. no more. The princesses were torn from
144. their night life like a baby from its pacifier.
145. Because he was old he picked the eldest.
146. At the wedding the princesses averted their eyes
147. and sagged like old sweatshirts.
148. Now the runaways would run no more and never
149. again would their hair be tangled into diamonds,
150. never again their shoes worn down to a laugh,
151. never the bed falling down into purgatory
152. to let them climb in after
153. with their Lucifer kicking.
