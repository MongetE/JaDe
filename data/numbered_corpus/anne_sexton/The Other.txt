1. Under my bowels, yellow with smoke,
2. it waits.
3. Under my eyes, those milk bunnies,
4. it waits.
5. It is waiting.
6. It is waiting.
7. Mr. Doppelganger. My brother. My spouse.
8. Mr. Doppelganger. My enemy. My lover.
9. When truth comes spilling out like peas
10. it hangs up the phone.
11. When the child is soothed and resting on the breast
12. it is my other who swallows Lysol.
13. When someone kisses someone or flushes the toilet
14. it is my other who sits in a ball and cries.
15. My other beats a tin drum in my heart.
16. My other hangs up laundry as I try to sleep.
17. My other cries and cries and cries
18. when I put on a cocktail dress.
19. It cries when I prick a potato.
20. It cries when I kiss someone hello.
21. It cries and cries and cries
22. until I put on a painted mask
23. and leer at Jesus in His passion.
24. Then it giggles.
25. It is a thumbscrew.
26. Its hatred makes it clairvoyant.
27. I can only sign over everything,
28. the house, the dog, the ladders, the jewels,
29. the soul, the family tree, the mailbox.

30. Then I can sleep.

31. Maybe.
