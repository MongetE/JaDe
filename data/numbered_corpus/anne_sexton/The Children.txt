1. The children are all crying in their pens
2. and the surf carries their cries away.
3. They are old men who have seen too much,
4. their mouths are full of dirty clothes,
5. the tongues poverty, tears like puss.
6. The surf pushes their cries back.
7. Listen.
8. They are bewitched.
9. They are writing down their life
10. on the wings of an elf
11. who then dissolves.
12. They are writing down their life
13. on a century fallen to ruin.
14. They are writing down their life
15. on the bomb of an alien God.
16. I am too.
17. We must get help.
18. The children are dying in their pens.
19. Their bodies are crumbling.
20. Their tongues are twisting backwards.
21. There is a certain ritual to it.
22. There is a dance they do in their pens.
23. Their mouths are immense.
24. They are swallowing monster hearts.
25. So is my mouth.

26. Listen.
27. We must all stop dying in the little ways,
28. in the craters of hate,
29. in the potholes of indifference-
30. a murder in the temple.
31. The place I live in
32. is a maze
33. and I keep seeking
34. the exit or the home.
35. Yet if I could listen
36. to the bulldog courage of those children
37. and turn inward into the plague of my soul
38. with more eyes than the stars
39. I could melt the darkness-
40. as suddenly as that time
41. when an awful headache goes away
42. or someone puts out the fire-
43. and stop the darkness and its amputations
44. and find the real McCoy
45. in the private holiness
46. of my hands.
