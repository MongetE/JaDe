1. Sleeping in fever, I am unfair
2. to know just who you are:
3. hung up like a pig on exhibit,
4. the delicate wrists,
5. the beard drooling blood and vinegar;
6. hooked to your own weight,
7. jolting toward death under your nameplate.

8. Everyone in this crowd needs a bath.
9. I am dressed in rags.
10. The mother wears blue.
11. You grind your teeth
12. and with each new breath
13. your jaws gape and your diaper sags.
14. I am not to blame
15. for all this. I do not know your name.

16. Skinny man, you are somebody's fault.
17. You ride on dark poles -
18. a wooden bird that a trader built
19. for some fool who felt
20. that he could make the flight. Now you roll
21. in your sleep, seasick
22. on your own breathing, poor old convict.
