1. Live or die, but don't poison everythingâ€¦

2. Well, death's been here
3. for a long time -
4. it has a hell of a lot
5. to do with hell
6. and suspicion of the eye
7. and the religious objects
8. and how I mourned them
9. when they were made obscene
10. by my dwarf-heart's doodle.
11. The chief ingredient
12. is mutilation.
13. And mud, day after day,
14. mud like a ritual,
15. and the baby on the platter,
16. cooked but still human,
17. cooked also with little maggots,
18. sewn onto it maybe by somebody's mother,
19. the damn bitch!

20. Even so,
21. I kept right on going on,
22. a sort of human statement,
23. lugging myself as if
24. I were a sawed-off body
25. in the trunk, the steamer trunk.
26. This became perjury of the soul.
27. It became an outright lie
28. and even though I dressed the body
29. it was still naked, still killed.
30. It was caught
31. in the first place at birth,
32. like a fish.
33. But I play it, dressed it up,
34. dressed it up like somebody's doll.

35. Is life something you play?
36. And all the time wanting to get rid of it?
37. And further, everyone yelling at you
38. to shut up. And no wonder!
39. People don't like to be told
40. that you're sick
41. and then be forced
42. to watch
43. you
44. come
45. down with the hammer.

46. Today life opened inside me like an egg
47. and there inside
48. after considerable digging
49. I found the answer.
50. What a bargain!
51. There was the sun,
52. her yolk moving feverishly,
53. tumbling her prize -
54. and you realize she does this daily!
55. I'd known she was a purifier
56. but I hadn't thought
57. she was solid,
58. hadn't known she was an answer.
59. God! It's a dream,
60. lovers sprouting in the yard
61. like celery stalks
62. and better,
63. a husband straight as a redwood,
64. two daughters, two sea urchings,
65. picking roses off my hackles.
66. If I'm on fire they dance around it
67. and cook marshmallows.
68. And if I'm ice
69. they simply skate on me
70. in little ballet costumes.

71. Here,
72. all along,
73. thinking I was a killer,
74. anointing myself daily
75. with my little poisons.
76. But no.
77. I'm an empress.
78. I wear an apron.
79. My typewriter writes.
80. It didn't break the way it warned.
81. Even crazy, I'm as nice
82. as a chocolate bar.
83. Even with the witches' gymnastics
84. they trust my incalculable city,
85. my corruptible bed.

86. O dearest three,
87. I make a soft reply.
88. The witch comes on
89. and you paint her pink.
90. I come with kisses in my hood
91. and the sun, the smart one,
92. rolling in my arms.
93. So I say Live
94. and turn my shadow three times round
95. to feed our puppies as they come,
96. the eight Dalmatians we didn't drown,
97. despite the warnings: The abort! The destroy!
98. Despite the pails of water that waited,
99. to drown them, to pull them down like stones,
100. they came, each one headfirst, blowing bubbles the color of cataract-blue
101. and fumbling for the tiny tits.
102. Just last week, eight Dalmatians,
103. 3/4 of a lb., lined up like cord wood
104. each
105. like a
106. birch tree.
107. I promise to love more if they come,
108. because in spite of cruelty
109. and the stuffed railroad cars for the ovens,
110. I am not what I expected. Not an Eichmann.
111. The poison just didn't take.
112. So I won't hang around in my hospital shift,
113. repeating The Black Mass and all of it.
114. I say Live, Live because of the sun,
115. the dream, the excitable gift.
