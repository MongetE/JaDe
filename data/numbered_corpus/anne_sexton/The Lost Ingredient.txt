1. Almost yesterday, those gentle ladies stole
2. to their baths in Atlantic Cuty, for the lost
3. rites of the first sea of the first salt
4. running from a faucet. I have heard they sat
5. for hours in briny tubs, patting hotel towels
6. sweetly over shivered skin, smelling the stale
7. harbor of a lost ocean, praying at last
8. for impossible loves, or new skin, or still
9. another child. And since this was the style,
10. I don't suppose they knew what they had lost.

11. Almost yesterday, pushing West, I lost
12. ten Utah driving minutes, stopped to steal
13. past postcard vendors, crossed the hot slit
14. of macadam to touch the marvelous loosed
15. bobbing of The Salt Lake, to honor and assault
16. it in its proof, to wash away some slight
17. need for Maine's coast. Later the funny salt
18. itched in my pores and stung like bees or sleet.
19. I rinsed it off on Reno and hurried to steal
20. a better proof at tables where I always lost.

21. Today is made of yesterday, each time I steal
22. toward rites I do not know, waiting for the lost
23. ingredient, as if salt or money or even lust
24. would keep us calm and prove us whole at last.
