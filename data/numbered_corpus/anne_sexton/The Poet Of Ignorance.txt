1. Perhaps the earth is floating,
2. I do not know.
3. Perhaps the stars are little paper cutups
4. made by some giant scissors,
5. I do not know.
6. Perhaps the moon is a frozen tear,
7. I do not know.
8. Perhaps God is only a deep voice
9. heard by the deaf,
10. I do not know.

11. Perhaps I am no one.
12. True, I have a body
13. and I cannot escape from it.
14. I would like to fly out of my head,
15. but that is out of the question.
16. It is written on the tablet of destiny
17. that I am stuck here in this human form.
18. That being the case
19. I would like to call attention to my problem.

20. There is an animal inside me,
21. clutiching fast to my heart,
22. a huge carb.
23. The doctors of Boston
24. have thrown up their hands.
25. They have tried scalpels,
26. needles, poison gasses adn the like.
27. The crab remains.
28. It is a great weight.
29. I try to forget it, go about my business,
30. cook the broccoli, open the shut books,
31. brush my teeth and tie my shoes.
32. I have tried prayer
33. but as I pray the crab grips harder
34. and the pain enlarges.

35. I had a dream once,
36. perhaps it was a dream,
37. that the crab was my ignorance of God.
38. But who am I to believe in dreams?
