2. It doesn't butter me up.

3. You say my heart is sick unto.
4. You ought to have more respect!

5. you with the goo on the suction cup.
6. You with your wires and electrodes

7. fastened at my ankle and wrist,
8. sucking up the biological breast.

10. playing like the stock market up and down.

12. and I will make a gold crown for my molar.

13. I will take a slug if you please
14. and make myself a perfectly good appendix.

15. Give me a fingernail for an eyeglass.
16. The world was milky all along.

17. I will take an iron and press out
18. my slipped disk until it is flat.

26. I have only a gimmick called magic fingers.

27. Let me dilate like a bad debt.
28. Here is a sponge. I can squeeze it myself.

29. O heart, tobacco red heart,
30. beat like a rock guitar.

31. I am at the ship's prow.
32. I am no longer the suicide

33. with her raft and paddle.
34. Herr Doktor! I'll no longer die

35. to spite you, you wallowing
36. seasick grounded man.
