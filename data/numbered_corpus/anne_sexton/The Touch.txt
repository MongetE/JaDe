1. For months my hand was sealed off
2. in a tin box. Nothing was there but the subway railings.
3. Perhaps it is bruised, I thought,
4. and that is why they have locked it up.
5. You could tell time by this, I thought,
6. like a clock, by its five knuckles
7. and the thin underground veins.
8. It lay there like an unconscious woman
9. fed by tubes she knew not of.

10. The hand had collapse,
11. a small wood pigeon
12. that had gone into seclusion.
13. I turned it over and the palm was old,
14. its lines traced like fine needlepoint
15. and stitched up into fingers.
16. It was fat and soft and blind in places.
17. Nothing but vulnerable.

18. And all this is metaphor.
19. An ordinary hand - just lonely
20. for something to touch
21. that touches back.
22. The dog won't do it.
23. Her tail wags in the swamp for a frog.
24. I'm no better than a case of dog food.
25. She owns her own hunger.
26. My sisters won't do it.
27. They live in school except for buttons
28. and tears running down like lemonade.
29. My father won't do it.
30. He comes in the house and even at night
31. he lives in a machine made by my mother
32. and well oiled by his job, his job.

33. The trouble is
34. that I'd let my gestures freeze.
35. The trouble was not
36. in the kitchen or the tulips
37. but only in my head, my head.

38. Then all this became history.
39. Your hand found mine.
40. Life rushed to my fingers like a blood clot.
41. Oh, my carpenter,
42. the fingers are rebuilt.
43. They dance with yours.
44. They dance in the attic and in Vienna.
45. My hand is alive all over America.
46. Not even death will stop it,
47. death shedding her blood.
48. Nothing will stop it, for this is the kingdom
49. and the kingdom come.
