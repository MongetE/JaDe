1. In Memoriam

2. What's missing is the eyeballs
3. in each of us, but it doesn't matter
4. because you've got the bucks, the bucks, the bucks.
5. You let me touch them, fondle the green faces
6. lick at their numbers and it lets you be
7. my "Daddy!" "Daddy!" and though I fought all alone
8. with molesters and crooks, I knew your money
9. would save me, your courage, your "I've had
10. considerable experience as a soldierâ€¦
11. fighting to win millions for myself, it's true.
12. But I did win," and me praying for "our men out there"
13. just made it okay to be an orphan whose blood was no one's,
14. whose curls were hung up on a wire machine and electrified,
15. while you built and unbuilt intrigues called nations,
16. and did in the bad ones, always, always,
17. and always came at my perils, the black Christs of childhood,
18. always came when my heart stood naked in the street
19. and they threw apples at it or twelve-day-old-dead-fish.

20. "Daddy!" "Daddy," we all won that war,
21. when you sang me the money songs
22. Annie, Annie you sang
23. and I knew you drove a pure gold car
24. and put diamonds in you coke
25. for the crunchy sound, the adorable sound
26. and the moon too was in your portfolio,
27. as well as the ocean with its sleepy dead.
28. And I was always brave, wasn't I?
29. I never bled?
30. I never saw a man expose himself.
31. No. No.
32. I never saw a drunkard in his blubber.
33. I never let lightning go in one car and out the other.
34. And all the men out there were never to come.
35. Never, like a deluge, to swim over my breasts
36. and lay their lamps in my insides.
37. No. No.
38. Just me and my "Daddy"
39. and his tempestuous bucks
40. rolling in them like corn flakes
41. and only the bad ones died.

42. But I died yesterday,
43. "Daddy," I died,
44. swallowing the Nazi-Jap animal
45. and it won't get out
46. it keeps knocking at my eyes,
47. my big orphan eyes,
48. kicking! Until eyeballs pop out
49. and even my dog puts up his four feet
50. and lets go
51. of his military secret
52. with his big red tongue
53. flying up and down
54. like yours should have

55. as we board our velvet train.
