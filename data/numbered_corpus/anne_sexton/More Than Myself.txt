1. Not that it was beautiful,
2. but that, in the end, there was
3. a certain sense of order there;
4. something worth learning
5. in that narrow diary of my mind,
6. in the commonplaces of the asylum
7. where the cracked mirror
8. or my own selfish death
9. outstared me . . .
10. I tapped my own head;
11. it was glass, an inverted bowl.
12. It's small thing
13. to rage inside your own bowl.
14. At first it was private.
15. Then it was more than myself.
