1. A young man is afraid of his demon and puts his hand
2. over the demon's mouth sometimes...- D. H. Lawrence

3. I mentioned my demon to a friend
4. and the friend swam in oil and came forth to me
5. greasy and cryptic
6. and said,
7. 'I'm thinking of taking him out of hock.
8. I pawned him years ago.'

9. Who would buy?
10. The pawned demon,
11. Yellowing with forgetfulness
12. and hand at his throat?
13. Take him out of hock, my friend,
14. but beware of the grief
15. that will fly into your mouth like a bird.

16. My demon,
17. too often undressed,
18. too often a crucifix I bring forth,
19. too often a dead daisy I give water to
20. too often the child I give birth to
21. and then abort, nameless, nameless...
22. earthless.

23. Oh demon within,
24. I am afraid and seldom put my hand up
25. to my mouth and stitch it up
26. covering you, smothering you
27. from the public voyeury eyes
28. of my typewriter keys.
29. If I should pawn you,
30. what bullion would they give for you,
31. what pennies, swimming in their copper kisses
32. what bird on its way to perishing?

33. No.
34. No.
35. I accept you,
36. you come with the dead who people my dreams,
37. who walk all over my desk
38. (as in Mother, cancer blossoming on her
39. Best & Co. tits-
40. waltzing with her tissue paper ghost)
41. the dead, who give sweets to the diabetic in me,
42. who give bolts to the seizure of roses
43. that sometimes fly in and out of me.
44. Yes.
45. Yes.
46. I accept you, demon.
47. I will not cover your mouth.
48. If it be man I love, apple laden and foul
49. or if it be woman I love, sick unto her blood
50. and its sugary gasses and tumbling branches.

51. Demon come forth,
52. even if it be God I call forth
53. standing like a carrion,
54. wanting to eat me,
55. starting at the lips and tongue.
56. And me wanting to glide into His spoils,
57. I take bread and wine,
58. and the demon farts and giggles,
59. at my letting God out of my mouth
60. anonymous woman
61. at the anonymous altar.
