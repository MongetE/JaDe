1. When I was a child
2. there was an old woman in our neighborhood whom we called The Witch.
3. All day she peered from her second story
4. window
5. from behind the wrinkled curtains
6. and sometimes she would open the window
7. and yell: Get out of my life!
8. She had hair like kelp
9. and a voice like a boulder.

10. I think of her sometimes now
11. and wonder if I am becoming her.
12. My shoes turn up like a jester's.
13. Clumps of my hair, as I write this,
14. curl up individually like toes.
15. I am shoveling the children out,
16. scoop after scoop.
17. Only my books anoint me,
18. and a few friends,
19. those who reach into my veins.
20. Maybe I am becoming a hermit,
21. opening the door for only
22. a few special animals?
23. Maybe my skull is too crowded
24. and it has no opening through which
25. to feed it soup?
26. Maybe I have plugged up my sockets
27. to keep the gods in?
28. Maybe, although my heart
29. is a kitten of butter,
30. I am blowing it up like a zeppelin.
31. Yes. It is the witch's life,
32. climbing the primordial climb,
33. a dream within a dream,
34. then sitting here
35. holding a basket of fire.
