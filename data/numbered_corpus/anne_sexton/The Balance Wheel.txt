1. Where I waved at the sky
2. And waited your love through a February sleep,
3. I saw birds swinging in, watched them multiply
4. Into a tree, weaving on a branch, cradling a keep
5. In the arms of April sprung from the south to occupy
6. This slow lap of land, like cogs of some balance wheel.
7. I saw them build the air, with that motion birds feel.

8. Where I wave at the sky
9. And understand love, knowing our August heat,
10. I see birds pulling past the dim frosted thigh
11. Of Autumn, unlatched from the nest, and wing-beat
12. For the south, making their high dots across the sky,
13. Like beauty spots marking a still perfect cheek.
14. I see them bend the air, slipping away, for what birds seek.
