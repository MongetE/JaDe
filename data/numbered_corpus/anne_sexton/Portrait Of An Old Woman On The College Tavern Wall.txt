1. Oh down at the tavern
2. the children are singing
3. around their round table
4. and around me still.
5. Did you hear what it said?

6. I only said
7. how there is a pewter urn
8. pinned to the tavern wall,
9. as old as old is able
10. to be and be there still.
11. I said, the poets are tere
12. I hear them singing and lying
13. around their round table
14. and around me still.
15. Across the room is a wreath
16. made of a corpse's hair,
17. framed in glass on the wall,
18. as old as old is able
19. to be and be remembered still.
20. Did you hear what it said?

21. I only said
22. how I want to be there and I
23. would sing my songs with the liars
24. and my lies with all the singers.
25. And I would, and I would but
26. it's my hair in the hair wreath,
27. my cup pinned to the tavern wall,
28. my dusty face they sing beneath.
29. Poets are sitting in my kitchen.
30. Why do these poets lie?
31. Why do children get children and
32. Did you hear what it said?

33. I only said
34. how I want to be there,
35. Oh, down at the tavern
36. where the prophets are singing
37. around their round table
38. until they are still.
