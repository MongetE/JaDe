1. It is half winter, half spring,
2. and Barbara and I are standing
3. confronting the ocean.
4. Its mouth is open very wide,
5. and it has dug up its green,
6. throwing it, throwing it at the shore.
7. You say it is angry.
8. I say it is like a kicked Madonna.
9. Its womb collapses, drunk with its fever.
10. We breathe in its fury.

11. I, the inlander,
12. am here with you for just a small space.
13. I am almost afraid,
14. so long gone from the sea.
15. I have seen her smooth as a cheek.
16. I have seen her easy,
17. doing her business,
18. lapping in.
19. I have seen her rolling her hoops of blue.
20. I have seen her tear the land off.
21. I have seen her drown me twice,
22. and yet not take me.
23. You tell me that as the green drains backward
24. it covers Britain,
25. but have you never stood on that shore
26. and seen it cover you?

27. We have come to worship,
28. the tongues of the surf are prayers,
29. and we vow,
30. the unspeakable vow.
31. Both silently.
32. Both differently.
33. I wish to enter her like a dream,
34. leaving my roots here on the beach
35. like a pan of knives.
36. And my past to unravel, with its knots and snarls,
37. and walk into ocean,
38. letting it explode over me
39. and outward, where I would drink the moon
40. and my clothes would slip away,
41. and I would sink into the great mother arms
42. I never had,
43. except here where the abyss
44. throws itself on the sand
45. blow by blow,
46. over and over,
47. and we stand on the shore
48. loving its pulse
49. as it swallows the stars,
50. and has since it all began
51. and will continue into oblivion,
52. past our knowing
53. and the wild toppling green that enters us today,
54. for a small time
55. in half winter, half spring.
