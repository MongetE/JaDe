1. Come friend,
2. I have an old story to tell you—

3. Listen.
4. Sit down beside me and listen.
5. My face is red with sorrow
6. and my breasts are made of straw.
7. I sit in the ladder-back chair
8. in a corner of the polished stage.
9. I have forgiven all the old actors for dying.
10. A new one comes on with the same lines,
11. like large white growths, in his mouth.
12. The dancers come on from the wings,
13. perfectly mated.

14. I look up. The ceiling is pearly.
15. My thighs press, knotting in their treasure.
16. Upstage the bride falls in satin to the floor.
17. Beside her the tall hero in a red wool robe
18. stirs the fire with his ivory cane.
19. The string quartet plays for itself,
20. gently, gently, sleeves and waxy bows.
21. The legs of the dancers leap and catch.
22. I myself have little stiff legs,
23. my back is as straight as a book
24. and how I came to this place—
25. the little feverish roses,
26. the islands of olives and radishes,
27. the blissful pastimes of the parlor—
28. I'll never know.
