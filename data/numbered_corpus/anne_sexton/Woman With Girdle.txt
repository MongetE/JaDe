1. Your midriff sags toward your knees;
2. your breast lie down in air,
3. their nipples as uninvolved
4. as warm starfish.
5. You stand in your elastic case,
6. still not giving up the new-born
7. and the old-born cycle.
8. Moving, you roll down the garment,
9. down that pink snapper and hoarder,
10. as your belly, soft as pudding,
11. slops into the empty space;
12. down, over the surgeon's careful mark,
13. down over hips, those head cushions
14. and mouth cushions,
15. slow motion like a rolling pin,
16. over crisp hairs, that amazing field
17. that hides your genius from your patron;
18. over thighs, thick as young pigs,
19. over knees like saucers,
20. over calves, polished as leather,
21. down toward the feet.
22. You pause for a moment,
23. tying your ankles into knots.
24. Now you rise,
25. a city from the sea,
26. born long before Alexandria was,
27. straighway from God you have come
28. into your redeeming skin.
