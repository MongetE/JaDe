1. Frau Doktor,
2. Mama Brundig,
3. take out your contacts,
4. remove your wig.
5. I write for you.
6. I entertain.
7. But frogs come out
8. of the sky like rain.

9. Frogs arrive
10. With an ugly fury.
11. You are my judge.
12. You are my jury.

13. My guilts are what
14. we catalogue.
15. I’ll take a knife
16. and chop up frog.

17. Frog has not nerves.
18. Frog is as old as a cockroach.
19. Frog is my father’s genitals.
20. Frog is a malformed doorknob.
21. Frog is a soft bag of green.

22. The moon will not have him.
23. The sun wants to shut off
24. like a light bulb.
25. At the sight of him
26. the stone washes itself in a tub.
27. The crow thinks he’s an apple
28. and drops a worm in.
29. At the feel of frog
30. the touch-me-nots explode
31. like electric slugs.
32. Slime will have him.
33. Slime has made him a house.

34. Mr. Poison
35. is at my bed.
36. He wants my sausage.
37. He wants my bread.

38. Mama Brundig,
39. he wants my beer.
40. He wants my Christ
41. for a souvenir.

42. Frog has boil disease
43. and a bellyful of parasites.
44. He says: Kiss me. Kiss me.
45. And the ground soils itself.

46. Why
47. should a certain
48. quite adorable princess
49. be walking in her garden
50. at such a time
51. and toss her golden ball
52. up like a bubble
53. and drop it into the well?
54. It was ordained.
55. Just as the fates deal out
56. the plague with a tarot card.
57. Just as the Supreme Being drills
58. holes in our skulls to let
59. the Boston Symphony through.

60. But I digress.
61. A loss has taken place.
62. The ball has sunk like a cast-iron pot
63. into the bottom of the well.

64. Lost, she said,
65. my moon, my butter calf,
66. my yellow moth, my Hindu hare.
67. Obviously it was more than a ball.
68. Balls such as these are not
69. for sale in Au Bon Marché.
70. I took the moon, she said,
71. between my teeth
72. and now it is gone
73. and I am lost forever.
74. A thief had robbed by day.

75. Suddenly the well grew
76. thick and boiling
77. and a frog appeared.
78. His eyes bulged like two peas
79. and his body was trussed into place.
80. Do not be afraid, Princess,
81. he said, I am not a vagabond,
82. a cattle farmer, a shepherd,
83. a doorkeeper, a postman
84. or a laborer.
85. I come to you as a tradesman.
86. I have something to sell.
87. Your ball, he said,
88. for just three things.
89. Let me eat from your plate.
90. Let me drink from your cup.
91. Let me sleep in your bed.
92. She thought, Old Waddler,
93. those three you will never do,
94. but she made the promises
95. with hopes for her ball once more.
96. He brought it up in his mouth
97. like a tricky old dog
98. and she ran back to the castle
99. leaving the frog quite alone.

100. That evening at dinner time
101. a knock was heard on the castle door
102. and a voice demanded:
103. King’s youngest daughter,
104. let me in. You promised;
105. now open to me.
106. I have left the skunk cabbage
107. and the eels to live with you.
108. The kind then heard her promise
109. and forced her to comply.

110. The frog first sat on her lap.
111. He was as awful as an undertaker.
112. Next he was at her plate
113. looking over her bacon
114. and calves’ liver.
115. We will eat in tandem,
116. he said gleefully.
117. Her fork trembled
118. as if a small machine
119. had entered her.
120. He sat upon the liver
121. and partook like a gourmet.
122. The princess choked
123. as if she were eating a puppy.
124. From her cup he drank.
125. It wasn’t exactly hygienic.
126. From her cup she drank
127. as if it were Socrates’ hemlock.

128. Next came the bed.
129. The silky royal bed.
130. Ah! The penultimate hour!
131. There was the pillow
132. with the princess breathing
133. and there was the sinuous frog
134. riding up and down beside her.
135. I have been lost in a river
136. of shut doors, he said,
137. and I have made my way over
138. the wet stones to live with you.
139. She woke up aghast.
140. I suffer for birds and fireflies
141. but not frogs, she said,
142. and threw him across the room.
143. Kaboom!

144. Like a genie coming out of a samovar,
145. a handsome prince arose in the
146. corner of her bedroom.
147. He had kind eyes and hands
148. and was a friend of sorrow.
149. Thus they were married.
150. After all he had compromised her.

151. He hired a night watchman
152. so that no one could enter the chamber
153. and he had the well
154. boarded over so that
155. never again would she lose her ball,
156. that moon, that Krishna hair,
157. that blind poppy, that innocent globe,
158. that madonna womb.
