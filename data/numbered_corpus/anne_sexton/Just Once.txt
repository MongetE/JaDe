1. Just once I knew what life was for.
2. In Boston, quite suddenly, I understood;
3. walked there along the Charles River,
4. watched the lights copying themselves,
5. all neoned and strobe-hearted, opening
6. their mouths as wide as opera singers;
7. counted the stars, my little campaigners,
8. my scar daisies, and knew that I walked my love
9. on the night green side of it and cried
10. my heart to the eastbound cars and cried
11. my heart to the westbound cars and took
12. my truth across a small humped bridge
13. and hurried my truth, the charm of it, home
14. and hoarded these constants into morning
15. only to find them gone.
