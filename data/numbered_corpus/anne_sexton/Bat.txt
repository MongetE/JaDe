1. His awful skin
2. stretched out by some tradesman
3. is like my skin, here between my fingers,
4. a kind of webbing, a kind of frog.
5. Surely when first born my face was this tiny
6. and before I was born surely I could fly.
7. Not well, mind you, only a veil of skin
8. from my arms to my waist.
9. I flew at night, too. Not to be seen
10. for if I were I'd be taken down.
11. In August perhaps as the trees rose to the stars
12. I have flown from leaf to leaf in the thick dark.
13. If you had caught me with your flashlight
14. you would have seen a pink corpse with wings,
15. out, out, from her mother's belly, all furry
16. and hoarse skimming over the houses, the armies.
17. That's why the dogs of your house sniff me.
18. They know I'm something to be caught
19. somewhere in the cemetery hanging upside down
20. like a misshapen udder.
