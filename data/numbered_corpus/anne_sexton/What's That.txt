1. Before it came inside
2. I had watched it from my kitchen window,
3. watched it swell like a new balloon,
4. watched it slump and then divide,
5. like something I know I know -
6. a broken pear or two halves of the moon,
7. or round white plates floating nowhere
8. or fat hands waving in the summer air
9. until they fold together like a fist or a knee.
10. After that it came to my door. Now it lives here.
11. And of course: it is a soft sound, soft as a seal's ear
12. that was caught between a shape and a shape and then returned to me.
13. You know how parents call
14. from sweet beaches anywhere,
15. come in come in
16. ,
17. and how you sank under water to put out
18. the sound, or how one of them touched in the hall
19. at night: the rustle and the skin
20. you couldn't know, but heard, the stout
21. slap of tides and the dog snoring. It's here
22. now, caught back from time in my adult year -
23. the image we did forget: the cranking shells on our feet
24. or the swing of the spoon in soup. It is real
25. as splinters stuck in your ear. The noise we steal
26. is half a bell. And outside cars whisk by on the suburban street
27. and are there and are true.
28. What else is this, this intricate shape of air?
29. calling me, calling you.
