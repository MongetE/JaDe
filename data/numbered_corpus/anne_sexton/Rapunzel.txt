1. A woman
2. who loves a woman
3. is forever young.
4. The mentor
5. and the student
6. feed off each other.
7. Many a girl
8. had an old aunt
9. who locked her in the study
10. to keep the boys away.
11. They would play rummy
12. or lie on the couch
13. and touch and touch.
14. Old breast against young breast…
15. Let your dress fall down your shoulder,
16. come touch a copy of you
17. for I am at the mercy of rain,
18. for I have left the three Christs of Ypsilanti
19. for I have left the long naps of Ann Arbor
20. and the church spires have turned to stumps.
21. The sea bangs into my cloister
22. for the politicians are dying,
23. and dying so hold me, my young dear,
24. hold me…
25. The yellow rose will turn to cinder
26. and New York City will fall in
27. before we are done so hold me,
28. my young dear, hold me.
29. Put your pale arms around my neck.
30. Let me hold your heart like a flower
31. lest it bloom and collapse.
32. Give me your skin
33. as sheer as a cobweb,
34. let me open it up
35. and listen in and scoop out the dark.
36. Give me your nether lips
37. all puffy with their art
38. and I will give you angel fire in return.
39. We are two clouds
40. glistening in the bottle glass.
41. We are two birds
42. washing in the same mirror.
43. We were fair game
44. but we have kept out of the cesspool.
45. We are strong.
46. We are the good ones.
47. Do not discover us
48. for we lie together all in green
49. like pond weeds.
50. Hold me, my young dear, hold me.
51. They touch their delicate watches
52. one at a time.
53. They dance to the lute
54. two at a time.
55. They are as tender as bog moss.
56. They play mother-me-do
57. all day.
58. A woman
59. who loves a woman
60. is forever young.
61. Once there was a witch's garden
62. more beautiful than Eve's
63. with carrots growing like little fish,
64. with many tomatoes rich as frogs,
65. onions as ingrown as hearts,
66. the squash singing like a dolphin
67. and one patch given over wholly to magic -
68. rampion, a kind of salad root
69. a kind of harebell more potent than penicillin,
70. growing leaf by leaf, skin by skin.
71. as rapt and as fluid as Isadoran Duncan.
72. However the witch's garden was kept locked
73. and each day a woman who was with child
74. looked upon the rampion wildly,
75. fancying that she would die
76. if she could not have it.
77. Her husband feared for her welfare
78. and thus climbed into the garden
79. to fetch the life-giving tubers.
80. Ah ha, cried the witch,
81. whose proper name was Mother Gothel,
82. you are a thief and now you will die.
83. However they made a trade,
84. typical enough in those times.
85. He promised his child to Mother Gothel
86. so of course when it was born
87. she took the child away with her.
88. She gave the child the name Rapunzel,
89. another name for the life-giving rampion.
90. Because Rapunzel was a beautiful girl
91. Mother Gothel treasured her beyond all things.
92. As she grew older Mother Gothel thought:
93. None but I will ever see her or touch her.
94. She locked her in a tow without a door
95. or a staircase. It had only a high window.
96. When the witch wanted to enter she cried'
97. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.
98. Rapunzel's hair fell to the ground like a rainbow.
99. It was as strong as a dandelion
100. and as strong as a dog leash.
101. Hand over hand she shinnied up
102. the hair like a sailor
103. and there in the stone-cold room,
104. as cold as a museum,
105. Mother Gothel cried:
106. Hold me, my young dear, hold me,
107. and thus they played mother-me-do.
108. Years later a prince came by
109. and heard Rapunzel singing her loneliness.
110. That song pierced his heart like a valentine
111. but he could find no way to get to her.
112. Like a chameleon he hid himself among the trees
113. and watched the witch ascend the swinging hair.
114. The next day he himself called out:
115. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair,
116. and thus they met and he declared his love.
117. What is this beast, she thought,
118. with muscles on his arms
119. like a bag of snakes?
120. What is this moss on his legs?
121. What prickly plant grows on his cheeks?
122. What is this voice as deep as a dog?
123. Yet he dazzled her with his answers.
124. Yet he dazzled her with his dancing stick.
125. They lay together upon the yellowy threads,
126. swimming through them
127. like minnows through kelp
128. and they sang out benedictions like the Pope.
129. Each day he brought her a skein of silk
130. to fashion a ladder so they could both escape.
131. But Mother Gothel discovered the plot
132. and cut off Rapunzel's hair to her ears
133. and took her into the forest to repent.
134. When the prince came the witch fastened
135. the hair to a hook and let it down.
136. When he saw Rapunzel had been banished
137. he flung himself out of the tower, a side of beef.
138. He was blinded by thorns that prickled him like tacks.
139. As blind as Oedipus he wandered for years
140. until he heard a song that pierced his heart
141. like that long-ago valentine.
142. As he kissed Rapunzel her tears fell on his eyes
143. and in the manner of such cure-alls
144. his sight was suddenly restored.
145. They lived happily as you might expect
146. proving that mother-me-do
147. can be outgrown,
148. just as the fish on Friday,
149. just as a tricycle.
150. The world, some say,
151. is made up of couples.
152. A rose must have a stem.
153. As for Mother Gothel,
154. her heart shrank to the size of a pin,
155. never again to say: Hold me, my young dear,
156. hold me,
157. and only as she dreamed of the yellow hair
158. did moonlight sift into her mouth.
