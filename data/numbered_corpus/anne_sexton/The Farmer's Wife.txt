1. From the hodge porridge
2. of their country lust,
3. their local life in Illinois,
4. where all their acres look
5. like a sprouting broom factory,
6. they name just en years now
7. that she has been his habit;
8. as again tonight he'll say
9. honey bunch let's go
10. and she will not say how there
11. must be more to living
12. than this brief bright bridge
13. of the raucous bed or even
14. the slow braille touch of him
15. like a heavy god grown light,
16. that old pantomime of love
17. that she wants although
18. it leaves her still alone,
19. built back again at last,
20. mind's apart from him, living
21. her own self in her own words
22. and hating the sweat of the house
23. they keep when they finally lie
24. each in separate dreams
25. and then how she watches him,
26. still strong in the blowzy bag
27. of his usual sleep while
28. her young years bungle past
29. their same marriage bed
30. and she wishes him cripple, or poet,
31. or even lonely, or sometimes,
32. better, my lover, dead.
