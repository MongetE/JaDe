1. And I solemnly swear
2. on the chill of secrecy
3. that I know you not, this room never,
4. the swollen dress I wear,
5. nor the anonymous spoons that free me,
6. nor this calendar nor the pulse we pare and cover.

7. For all these present,
8. before that wandering ghost,
9. that yellow moth of my summer bed,
10. I say: this small event
11. is not. So I prepare, am dosed
12. in ether and will not cry what stays unsaid.

13. I was brown with August,
14. the clapping waves at my thighs
15. and a storm riding into the cove. We swam
16. while the others beached and burst
17. for their boarded huts, their hale cries
18. shouting back to us and the hollow slam
19. of the dory against the float.
20. Black arms of thunder strapped
21. upon us, squalled out, we breathed in rain
22. and stroked past the boat.
23. We thrashed for shore as if we were trapped
24. in green and that suddenly inadequate stain

25. of lightning belling around
26. our skin. Bodies in air
27. we raced for the empty lobsterman-shack.
28. It was yellow inside, the sound
29. of the underwing of the sun. I swear,
30. I most solemnly swear, on all the bric-a-brac

31. of summer loves, I know
32. you not.
