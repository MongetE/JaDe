1. Be careful of words,
2. even the miraculous ones.
3. For the miraculous we do our best,
4. sometimes they swarm like insects
5. and leave not a sting but a kiss.
6. They can be as good as fingers.
7. They can be as trusty as the rock
8. you stick your bottom on.
9. But they can be both daisies and bruises.
10. Yet I am in love with words.
11. They are doves falling out of the ceiling.
12. They are six holy oranges sitting in my lap.
13. They are the trees, the legs of summer,
14. and the sun, its passionate face.
15. Yet often they fail me.
16. I have so much I want to say,
17. so many stories, images, proverbs, etc.
18. But the words aren't good enough,
19. the wrong ones kiss me.
20. Sometimes I fly like an eagle
21. but with the wings of a wren.
22. But I try to take care
23. and be gentle to them.
24. Words and eggs must be handled with care.
25. Once broken they are impossible
26. things to repair.
