6. It was only important
7. to smile and hold still,
8. to lie down beside him
9. and to rest awhile,
10. to be folded up together
11. as if we were silk,
12. to sink from the eyes of mother
13. and not to talk.
14. The black room took us
15. like a cave or a mouth
16. or an indoor belly.
17. I held my breath
18. and daddy was there,
19. his thumbs, his fat skull,
20. his teeth, his hair growing
21. like a field or a shawl.
22. I lay by the moss
23. of his skin until
24. it grew strange. My sisters
25. will never know that I fall
26. out of myself and pretend
27. that Allah will not see
28. how I hold my daddy
29. like an old stone tree.
