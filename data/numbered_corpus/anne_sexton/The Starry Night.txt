1. That does not keep me from having a terrible need of - shall I say the word - religion. Then I go out at night to paint the stars.
2. - Vincent Van Gogh in a letter to his brother

3. The town does not exist
4. except where one black-haired tree slips
5. up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.
6. The town is silent. The night boils with eleven stars.
7. Oh starry night! This is how
8. I want to die.

9. It moves. They are all alive.
10. Even the moon bulges in its orange irons
11. to push children, like a god, from its eye.
12. The old unseen serpent swallows up the stars.
13. Oh starry starry night! This is how
14. I want to die:

15. into that rushing beast of the night,
16. sucked up by that great dragon, to split
17. from my life with no flag,
18. no belly,
19. no cry.
