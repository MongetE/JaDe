2. eating his toes,
3. I know that much.

5. pressing an empty Coca-Cola can against
6. his starving bloated stomac,
7. I know that much.

12. I know that it is all
13. a matter of hands.
14. Out of the mournful sweetness of touching
15. comes love
16. like breakfast.
17. Out of the many houses come the hands
18. before the abandonment of the city,
19. out of hte bars and shops,

21. I've been abandoned out here
22. under the dry stars
23. with no shoes, no belt
24. and I've called Rescue Inc. -
25. that old-fashioned hot line -
26. no voice.
27. Left to my own lips, touch them,
28. my own nostrils, shoulders, breasts,
29. navel, stomach, mound,kneebone, ankle,
30. touch them.

34. when your hands are cut off
35. and no one answers the phone.
