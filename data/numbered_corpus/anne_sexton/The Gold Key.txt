1. The speaker in this case
2. is a middle-aged witch, me-
3. tangled on my two great arms,
4. my face in a book
5. and my mouth wide,
6. ready to tell you a story or two.
7. I have come to remind you,
8. all of you:
9. Alice, Samuel, Kurt, Eleanor,
10. Jane, Brian, Maryel,
11. all of you draw near.
12. Alice,
13. at fifty-six do you remember?
14. Do you remember when you
15. were read to as a child?
16. Samuel,
17. at twenty-two have you forgotten?
18. Forgotten the ten P.M. dreams
19. where the wicked king
20. went up in smoke?
21. Are you comatose?
22. Are you undersea?
23. Attention,
24. my dears,
25. let me present to you this boy.
26. He is sixteen and he wants some answers.
27. He is each of us.
28. I mean you.
29. I mean me.
30. It is not enough to read Hesse
31. and drink clam chowder
32. we must have the answers.
33. The boy has found a gold key
34. and he is looking for what it will open.
35. This boy!
36. Upon finding a string
37. he would look for a harp.
38. Therefore he holds the key tightly.
39. Its secrets whimper
40. like a dog in heat.
41. He turns the key.
42. Presto!
43. It opens this book of odd tales
44. which transform the Brothers Grimm.
45. Transform?
46. As if an enlarged paper clip
47. could be a piece of sculpture.
48. (And it could.)
