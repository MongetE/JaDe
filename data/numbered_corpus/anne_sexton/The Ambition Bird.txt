1. So it has come to this
2. insomnia at 3:15 A.M.,
3. the clock tolling its engine

4. like a frog following
5. a sundial yet having an electric
6. seizure at the quarter hour.

7. The business of words keeps me awake.
8. I am drinking cocoa,
9. that warm brown mama.

10. I would like a simple life
11. yet all night I am laying
12. poems away in a long box.

13. It is my immortality box,
14. my lay-away plan,
15. my coffin.

16. All night dark wings
17. flopping in my heart.
18. Each an ambition bird.

19. The bird wants to be dropped
20. from a high place like Tallahatchie Bridge.

21. He wants to light a kitchen match
22. and immolate himself.

23. He wants to fly into the hand of Michelangelo
24. anc dome out painted on a ceiling.

25. He wants to pierce the hornet’s nest
26. and come out with a long godhead.

27. He wants to take bread and wine
28. and bring forth a man happily floating in the Caribbean.

29. He wants to be pressed out like a key
30. so he can unlock the Magi.

31. He wants to take leave among strangers
32. passing out bits of his heart like hors d’oeuvres.

33. He wants to die changing his clothes
34. and bolt for the sun like a diamond.

35. He wants, I want.
36. Dear God, wouldn’t it be
37. good enough to just drink cocoa?

38. I must get a new bird
39. and a new immortality box.
40. There is folly enough inside this one.
