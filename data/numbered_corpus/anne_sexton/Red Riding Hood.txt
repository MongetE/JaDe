1. Many are the deceivers:
2. The suburban matron,
3. proper in the supermarket,
4. list in hand so she won't suddenly fly,
5. buying her Duz and Chuck Wagon dog food,
6. meanwhile ascending from earth,
7. letting her stomach fill up with helium,
8. letting her arms go loose as kite tails,
9. getting ready to meet her lover
10. a mile down Apple Crest Road
11. in the Congregational Church parking lot.
12. Two seemingly respectable women
13. come up to an old Jenny
14. and show her an envelope
15. full of money
16. and promise to share the booty
17. if she'll give them ten thou
18. as an act of faith.
19. Her life savings are under the mattress
20. covered with rust stains
21. and counting.
22. They are as wrinkled as prunes
23. but negotiable.
24. The two women take the money and disappear.
25. Where is the moral?
26. Not all knives are for
27. stabbing the exposed belly.
28. Rock climbs on rock
29. and it only makes a seashore.
30. Old Jenny has lost her belief in mattresses
31. and now she has no wastebasket in which
32. to keep her youth.
33. The standup comic
34. on the 'Tonight' show
35. who imitates the Vice President
36. and cracks up Johnny Carson
37. and delays sleep for millions
38. of bedfellows watching between their feet,
39. slits his wrist the next morning
40. in the Algonquin's old-fashioned bathroom,
41. the razor in his hand like a toothbrush,
42. wall as anonymous as a urinal,
43. the shower curtain his slack rubberman audience,
44. and then the slash
45. as simple as opening as a letter
46. and the warm blood breaking out like a rose
47. upon the bathtub with its claw and ball feet.
48. And I. I too.
49. Quite collected at cocktail parties,
50. meanwhile in my head
51. I'm undergoing open-heart surgery.
52. The heart, poor fellow,
53. pounding on his little tin drum
54. with a faint death beat,
55. The heart, that eyeless beetle,
56. running panicked through his maze,
57. never stopping one foot after the other
58. one hour after the other
59. until he gags on an apple
60. and it's all over.
61. And I. I too again.
62. I built a summer house on Cape Ann.
63. A simple A-frame and this too was
64. a deception - nothing haunts a new house.
65. When I moved in with a bathing suit and tea bags
66. the ocean rumbled like a train backing up
67. and at each window secrets came in
68. like gas. My mother, that departed soul,
69. sat in my Eames chair and reproached me
70. for losing her keys to the old cottage.
71. Even in the electric kitchen there was
72. the smell of a journey. The ocean
73. was seeping through its frontiers
74. and laying me out on its wet rails.
75. The bed was stale with my childhood
76. and I could not move to another city
77. where the worthy make a new life.
78. Long ago
79. there was a strange deception:
80. a wolf dressed in frills,
81. a kind of transvestite.
82. But I get ahead of my story.
83. In the beginning
84. there was just little Red Riding Hood,
85. so called because her grandmother
86. made her a red cape and she was never without it.
87. It was her Linus blanket, besides
88. it was red, as red as the Swiss flag,
89. yes it was red, as red as chicken blood,
90. But more than she loved her riding hood
91. she loved her grandmother who lived
92. far from the city in the big wood.
93. This one day her mother gave her
94. a basket of wine and cake
95. to take to her grandmother
96. because she was ill.
97. Wine and cake?
98. Where's the aspirin? The penicillin?
99. Where's the fruit juice?
100. Peter Rabbit got chamomile tea.
101. But wine and cake it was.
102. On her way in the big wood
103. Red Riding Hood met the wolf.
104. Good day, Mr. Wolf, she said,
105. thinking him no more dangerous
106. than a streetcar or a panhandler.
107. He asked where she was going
108. and she obligingly told him
109. There among the roots and trunks
110. with the mushrooms pulsing inside the moss
111. he planned how to eat them both,
112. the grandmother an old carrot
113. and the child a shy budkin
114. in a red red hood.
115. He bade her to look at the bloodroot,
116. the small bunchberry and the dogtooth
117. and pick some for her grandmother.
118. And this she did.
119. Meanwhile he scampered off
120. to Grandmother's house and ate her up
121. as quick as a slap.
122. Then he put on her nightdress and cap
123. and snuggled down in to bed.
124. A deceptive fellow.
125. Red Riding hood
126. knocked on the door and entered
127. with her flowers, her cake, her wine.
128. Grandmother looked strange,
129. a dark and hairy disease it seemed.
130. Oh Grandmother, what big ears you have,
131. ears, eyes, hands and then the teeth.
132. The better to eat you with my dear.
133. So the wolf gobbled Red Riding Hood down
134. like a gumdrop. Now he was fat.
135. He appeared to be in his ninth month
136. and Red Riding Hood and her grandmother
137. rode like two Jonahs up and down with
138. his every breath. One pigeon. One partridge.
139. He was fast asleep,
140. dreaming in his cap and gown,
141. wolfless.
142. Along came a huntsman who heard
143. the loud contented snores
144. and knew that was no grandmother.
145. He opened the door and said,
146. So it's you, old sinner.
147. He raised his gun to shoot him
148. when it occurred to him that maybe
149. the wolf had eaten up the old lady.
150. So he took a knife and began cutting open
151. the sleeping wolf, a kind of caesarian section.
152. It was a carnal knife that let
153. Red Riding Hood out like a poppy,
154. quite alive from the kingdom of the belly.
155. And grandmother too
156. still waiting for cakes and wine.
157. The wolf, they decided, was too mean
158. to be simply shot so they filled his belly
159. with large stones and sewed him up.
160. He was as heavy as a cemetery
161. and when he woke up and tried to run off
162. he fell over dead. Killed by his own weight.
163. Many a deception ends on such a note.
164. The huntsman and the grandmother and Red Riding Hood
165. sat down by his corpse and had a meal of wine and cake.
166. Those two remembering
167. nothing naked and brutal
168. from that little death,
169. that little birth,
170. from their going down
171. and their lifting up.
