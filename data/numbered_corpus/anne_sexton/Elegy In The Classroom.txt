1. In the thin classroom, where your face
2. was noble and your words were all things,
3. I find this boily creature in your place;

4. find you disarranged, squatting on the window sill,
5. irrefutably placed up there,
6. like a hunk of some big frog
7. watching us through the V
8. of your woolen legs.

9. Even so, I must admire your skill.
10. You are so gracefully insane.
11. We fidget in our plain chairs
12. and pretend to catalogue
13. our facts for your burly sorcery

14. or ignore your fat blind eyes
15. or the prince you ate yesterday
16. who was wise, wise, wise.
