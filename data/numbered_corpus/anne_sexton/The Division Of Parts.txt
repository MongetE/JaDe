1. 1.
2. Mother, my Mary Gray,
3. once resident of Gloucester
4. and Essex County,
5. a photostat of your will
6. arrived in the mail today.
7. This is the division of money.
8. I am one third
9. of your daughters counting my bounty
10. or I am a queen alone
11. in the parlor still,
12. eating the bread and honey.
13. It is Good Friday.
14. Black birds pick at my window sill.
15. Your coat in my closet,
16. your bright stones on my hand,
17. the gaudy fur animals
18. I do not know how to use,
19. settle on me like a debt.
20. A week ago, while the hard March gales
21. beat on your house,
22. we sorted your things: obstacles
23. of letters, family silver,
24. eyeglasses and shoes.
25. Like some unseasoned Christmas, its scales
26. rigged and reset,
27. I bundled out gifts I did not choose.
28. Now the houts of The Cross
29. rewind. In Boston, the devout
30. work their cold knees
31. toward that sweet martyrdom
32. that Christ planned. My timely loss
33. is too customary to note; and yet
34. I planned to suffer
35. and I cannot. It does not please
36. my yankee bones to watch
37. where the dying is done
38. in its usly hours. Black birds peck
39. at my window glass
40. and Easter will take its ragged son.
41. The clutter of worship
42. that you taught me, Mary Gray,
43. is old. I imitate
44. a memory of belief
45. that I do not own. I trip
46. on your death and jesus, my stranger
47. floats up over
48. my Christian home, wearing his straight
49. thorn tree. I have cast my lot
50. and am one third thief
51. of you. Time, that rearranger
52. of estates, equips
53. me with your garments, but not with grief.

54. 2.
55. This winter when
56. cancer began its ugliness
57. I grieved with you each day
58. for three months
59. and found you in your private nook
60. of the medicinal palace
61. for New England Women
62. and never once
63. forgot how long it took.
64. I read to you
65. from The New Yorker, ate suppers
66. you wouldn't eat, fussed
67. with your flowers,
68. joked with your nurses, as if I
69. were the balm among lepers,
70. as if I could undo
71. a life in hours
72. if I never said goodbye.
73. But you turned old,
74. all your fifty-eight years sliding
75. like masks from your skull;
76. and at the end
77. I packed your nightgowns in suitcases,
78. paid the nurses, came riding
79. home as if I'd been told
80. I could pretend
81. people live in places.

82. 3.
83. Since then I have pretended ease,
84. loved with the trickeries of need, but not enough
85. to shed my daughterhood
86. or sweeten him as a man.
87. I drink the five o' clock martinis
88. and poke at this dry page like a rough
89. goat. Fool! I fumble my lost childhood
90. for a mother and lounge in sad stuff
91. with love to catch and catch as catch can.
92. And Christ still waits. I have tried
93. to exorcise the memory of each event
94. and remain still, a mixed child,
95. heavy with cloths of you.
96. Sweet witch, you are my worried guide.
97. Such dangerous angels walk through Lent.
98. Their walls creak Anne! Convert! Convert!
99. My desk moves. Its cavr murmurs Boo
100. and I am taken and beguiled.
101. Or wrong. For all the way I've come
102. I'll have to go again. Instead, I must convert
103. to love as reasonable
104. as Latin, as sold as earthenware:
105. an equilibrium
106. I never knew. And Lent will keep its hurt
107. for someone else. Christ knows enough
108. staunch guys have hitched him in trouble.
109. thinking his sticks were badges to wear.

110. 4.
111. Spring rusts on its skinny branch
112. and last summer's lawn
113. is soggy and brown.
114. Yesterday is just a number.
115. All of its winters avalanche
116. out of sight. What was, is gone.
117. Mother, last night I slept
118. in your Bonwit Teller nightgown.
119. Divided, you climbed into my head.
120. There in my jabbering dream
121. I heard my own angry cries
122. and I cursed you, Dame
123. keep out of my slumber.
124. My good Dame, you are dead.
125. And Mother, three stones
126. slipped from your glittering eyes.
127. Now it's Friday's noon
128. and I would still curse
129. you with my rhyming words
130. and bring you flapping back, old love,
131. old circus knitting, god-in-her-moon,
132. all fairest in my lang syne verse,
133. the gauzy bride among the children,
134. the fancy amid the absurd
135. and awkward, that horn for hounds
136. that skipper homeward, that museum
137. keeper of stiff starfish, that blaze
138. within the pilgrim woman,
139. a clown mender, a dove's
140. cheek among the stones,
141. my Lady of first words,
142. this is the division of ways.
143. And now, while Christ stays
144. fastened to his Crucifix
145. so that love may praise
146. his sacrifice
147. and not the grotesque metaphor,
148. you come, a brave ghost, to fix
149. in my mind without praise
150. or paradise
151. to make me your inheritor.
