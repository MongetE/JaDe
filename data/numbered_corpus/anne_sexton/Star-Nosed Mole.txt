1. Mole, angel-dog of the pit,
2. digging six miles a night,
3. what's up with you in your sooty suit,
4. where's your kitchen at?
5. I find you at the edge of our pond,
6. drowned, numb drainer of weeds,
7. insects floating in your belly,
8. grubs like little fetuses bobbing
9. and your dear face with its fifth hand,
10. doesn't it know it's the end of the war?
11. It's all over, no need to go deep into ponds,
12. no fires, no cripples left.
13. Mole dog,
14. I wish your mother would wake you up
15. and you wouldn't lie there like the Pieta
16. wearing your cross on your nose.
