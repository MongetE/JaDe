1. I am torn in two
2. but I will conquer myself.
3. I will dig up the pride.
4. I will take scissors
5. and cut out the beggar.
6. I will take a crowbar
7. and pry out the broken
8. pieces of God in me.
9. Just like a jigsaw puzzle,
10. I will put Him together again
11. with the patience of a chess player.

12. How many pieces?

13. It feels like thousands,
14. God dressed up like a whore
15. in a slime of green algae.
16. God dressed up like an old man
17. staggering out of His shoes.
18. God dressed up like a child,
19. all naked,
20. even without skin,
21. soft as an avocado when you peel it.
22. And others, others, others.

23. But I will conquer them all
24. and build a whole nation of God
25. in me - but united,
26. build a new soul,
27. dress it with skin
28. and then put on my shirt
29. and sing an anthem,
30. a song of myself.
