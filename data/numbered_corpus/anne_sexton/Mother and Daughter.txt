1. Linda, you are leaving 
2. your old body now, 
3. It lies flat, an old butterfly, 
4. all arm, all leg, all wing, 
5. loose as an old dress. 
6. I reach out toward it but 
7. my fingers turn to cankers 
8. and I am motherwarm and used, 
9. just as your childhood is used. 
10. Question you about this 
11. and you hold up pearls. 
12. Question you about this 
13. and you pass by armies. 
14. Question you about this — 
15. you with your big clock going, 
16. its hands wider than jackstraws — 
17. and you'll sew up a continent. 
18. Now that you are eighteen 
19. I give you my booty, my spoils, 
20. my Mother & Co. and my ailments. 
21. Question you about this 
22. and you'll not know the answer — 
23. the muzzle at the oxygen, 
24. the tubes, the pathways, 
25. the war and the war's vomit. 
26. Keep on, keep on, keep on, 
27. carrying keepsakes to the boys, 
28. carrying powders to the boys, 
29. carrying, my Linda, blood to 
30. the bloodletter. 
31. Linda, you are leaving 
32. your old body now. 
33. You've picked my pocket clean 
34. and you've racked up all my 
35. poker chips and left me empty 
36. and, as the river between us 
37. narrows, you do calisthenics, 
38. that womanly leggy semaphore. 
39. Question you about this 
40. and you will sew me a shroud 
41. and hold up Monday's broiler 
42. and thumb out the chicken gut. 
43. Question you about this 
44. and you will see my death 
45. drooling at these gray lips 
46. while you, my burglar, will eat 
47. fruit and pass the time of day.
