1. 'Do you like me?'
2. I asked the blue blazer.
3. No answer.
4. Silence bounced out of his books.
5. Silence fell off his tongue
6. and sat between us
7. and clogged my throat.
8. It slaughtered my trust.
9. It tore cigarettes out of my mouth.
10. We exchanged blind words,
11. and I did not cry,
12. and I did not beg,
13. blackness lunged in my heart,
14. and something that had been good,
15. a sort of kindly oxygen,
16. turned into a gas oven.
17. Do you like me?
18. How absurd!
19. What's a question like that?
20. What's a silence like that?
21. And what am I hanging around for,
22. riddled with what his silence said?
