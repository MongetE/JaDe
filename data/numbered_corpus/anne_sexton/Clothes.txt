1. Put on a clean shirt
2. before you die, some Russian said.
3. Nothing with drool, please,
4. no egg spots, no blood,
5. no sweat, no sperm.
6. You want me clean, God,
7. so I'll try to comply.

8. The hat I was married in,
9. will it do?
10. White, broad, fake flowers in a tiny array.
11. It's old-fashioned, as stylish as a bedbug,
12. but is suits to die in something nostalgic.

13. And I'll take
14. my painting shirt
15. washed over and over of course
16. spotted with every yellow kitchen I've painted.
17. God, you don't mind if I bring all my kitchens?
18. They hold the family laughter and the soup.

19. For a bra
20. (need we mention it?) ,
21. the padded black one that my lover demeaned
22. when I took it off.
23. He said, 'Where'd it all go? '

24. And I'll take
25. the maternity skirt of my ninth month,
26. a window for the love-belly
27. that let each baby pop out like and apple,
28. the water breaking in the restaurant,
29. making a noisy house I'd like to die in.

30. For underpants I'll pick white cotton,
31. the briefs of my childhood,
32. for it was my mother's dictum
33. that nice girls wore only white cotton.
34. If my mother had lived to see it
35. she would have put a WANTED sign up in the post office
36. for the black, the red, the blue I've worn.
37. Still, it would be perfectly fine with me
38. to die like a nice girl
39. smelling of Clorox and Duz.
40. Being sixteen-in-the-pants
41. I would die full of questions.
