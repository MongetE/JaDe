1. Who is he?
2. A railroad track toward hell?
3. Breaking like a stick of furniture?
4. The hope that suddenly overflows the cesspool?
5. The love that goes down the drain like spit?
6. The love that said forever, forever
7. and then runs you over like a truck?
8. Are you a prayer that floats into a radio advertisement?
9. Despair,
10. I don't like you very well.
11. You don't suit my clothes or my cigarettes.
12. Why do you locate here
13. as large as a tank,
14. aiming at one half of a lifetime?
15. Couldn't you just go float into a tree
16. instead of locating here at my roots,
17. forcing me out of the life I've led
18. when it's been my belly so long?

19. All right!
20. I'll take you along on the trip
21. where for so many years
22. my arms have been speechless
