1. Today the circus poster
2. is scabbing off the concrete wall
3. and the children have forgotten
4. if they knew at all.
5. Father, do you remember?
6. Only the sound remains,
7. the distant thump of the good elephants,
8. the voice of the ancient lions
9. and how the bells
10. trembled for the flying man.
11. I, laughing,
12. lifted to your high shoulder
13. or small at the rough legs of strangers,
14. was not afraid.
15. You held my hand
16. and were instant to explain
17. the three rings of danger.

18. Oh see the naughty clown
19. and the wild parade
20. while love love
21. love grew rings around me.
22. this was the sound where it began;
23. our breath pounding up to see
24. the flying man breast out
25. across the boarded sky
26. and climb the air.
27. I remember the color of music
28. and how forever
29. all the trembling bells of you
30. were mine.
