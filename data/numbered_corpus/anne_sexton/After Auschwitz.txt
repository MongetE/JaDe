1. Anger,
2. as black as a hook,
3. overtakes me.
4. Each day,
5. each Nazi
6. took, at 8: 00 A.M., a baby
7. and sauteed him for breakfast
8. in his frying pan.

9. And death looks on with a casual eye
10. and picks at the dirt under his fingernail.

11. Man is evil,
12. I say aloud.
13. Man is a flower
14. that should be burnt,
15. I say aloud.
16. Man
17. is a bird full of mud,
18. I say aloud.

19. And death looks on with a casual eye
20. and scratches his anus.

21. Man with his small pink toes,
22. with his miraculous fingers
23. is not a temple
24. but an outhouse,
25. I say aloud.
26. Let man never again raise his teacup.
27. Let man never again write a book.
28. Let man never again put on his shoe.
29. Let man never again raise his eyes,
30. on a soft July night.
31. Never. Never. Never. Never. Never.
32. I say those things aloud.

33. I beg the Lord not to hear.
