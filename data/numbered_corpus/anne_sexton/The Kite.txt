1. Here, in front of the summer hotel
2. the beach waits like an altar.
3. We are lying on a cloth of sand
4. while the Atlantic noon stains
5. the world in light.
6. It was much the same
7. five years ago. I remember
8. how Ezio Pinza was flying a kite
9. for the children. None of us noticed
10. it then. The pleated lady
11. was still a nest of her knitting.
12. Four pouchy fellows kept their policy
13. of gin and tonic while trading some money.
14. The parasol girls slept, sun-sitting
15. their lovely years. No one thought
16. how precious it was, or even how funny
17. the festival seemed, square rigged in the air.
18. The air was a season they had bought,
19. like the cloth of sand.
20. I've been waiting
21. on this private stretch of summer land,
22. counting these five years and wondering why.
23. I mean, it was different that time
24. with Ezio Pinza flying a kite.
25. Maybe, after all, he knew something more
26. and was right.
