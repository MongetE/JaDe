1. Everything here is yellow and green.
2. Listen to its throat, its earthskin,
3. the bone dry voices of the peepers
4. as they throb like advertisements.
5. The small animals of the woods
6. are carrying their deathmasks
7. into a narrow winter cave.
8. The scarecrow has plucked out
9. his two eyes like diamonds
10. and walked into the village.
11. The general and the postman
12. have taken off their packs.
13. This has all happened before
14. but nothing here is obsolete.
15. Everything here is possible.

16. Because of this
17. perhaps a young girl has laid down
18. her winter clothes and has casually
19. placed herself upon a tree limb
20. that hangs over a pool in the river.
21. She has been poured out onto the limb,
22. low above the houses of the fishes
23. as they swim in and out of her reflection
24. and up and down the stairs of her legs.
25. Her body carries clouds all the way home.
26. She is overlooking her watery face
27. in the river where blind men
28. come to bathe at midday.

29. Because of this
30. the ground, that winter nightmare,
31. has cured its sores and burst
32. with green birds and vitamins.
33. Because of this
34. the trees turn in their trenches
35. and hold up little rain cups
36. by their slender fingers.
37. Because of this
38. a woman stands by her stove
39. singing and cooking flowers.
40. Everything here is yellow and green.

41. Surely spring will allow
42. a girl without a stitch on
43. to turn softly in her sunlight
44. and not be afraid of her bed.
45. She has already counted seven
46. blossoms in her green green mirror.
47. Two rivers combine beneath her.
48. The face of the child wrinkles.
49. in the water and is gone forever.
50. The woman is all that can be seen
51. in her animal loveliness.
52. Her cherished and obstinate skin
53. lies deeply under the watery tree.
54. Everything is altogether possible
55. and the blind men can also see.
