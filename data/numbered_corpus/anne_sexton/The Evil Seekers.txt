1. We are born with luck
2. which is to say with gold in our mouth.
3. As new and smooth as a grape,
4. as pure as a pond in Alaska,
5. as good as the stem of a green bean-
6. we are born and that ought to be enough,
7. we ought to be able to carry on from that
8. but one must learn about evil,
9. learn what is subhuman,
10. learn how the blood pops out like a scream,
11. one must see the night
12. before one can realize the day,
13. one must listen hard to the animal within,
14. one must walk like a sleepwalker
15. on the edge of a roof,
16. one must throw some part of her body
17. into the devil's mouth.
18. Odd stuff, you'd say.
19. But I'd say
20. you must die a little,
21. have a book of matches go off in your hand,
22. see your best friend copying your exam,
23. visit an Indian reservation and see
24. their plastic feathers,
25. the dead dream.
26. One must be a prisoner just once to hear
27. the lock twist into his gut.
28. After all that
29. one is free to grasp at the trees, the stones,
30. the sky, the birds that make sense out of air.
31. But even in a telephone booth
32. evil can seep out of the receiver
33. and we must cover it with a mattress,
34. and then tear it from its roots
35. and bury it,
36. bury it.
