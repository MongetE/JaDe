1. I dance in circles holding
2. the moth of the marriage,
3. thin, sticky, fluttering
4. its skirts, its webs.
5. The moth oozing a tear,
6. or is it a drop of urine?
7. The moth, grinning like a pear,
8. or is it teeth
9. clamping the iron maiden shut?

10. The moth,
11. who is my mother,
12. who is my father,
13. who was my lover,
14. floats airily out of my hands
15. and I dance slower,
16. pulling off the fat diamond engagement ring,
17. pulling off the elopement wedding ring,
18. and holding them, clicking them
19. in thumb and forefinger,
20. the indent of twenty-five years,
21. like a tiny rip of a tiny earthquake.
22. Underneath the soil lies the violence,
23. the shift, the crack of continents,
24. the anger,
25. and above only a cut,
26. a half-inch space to stick a pencil in.

27. The finger is scared
28. but it keeps its long numb place.
29. And I keep dancing,
30. a sort of waltz,
31. clicking the two rings,
32. all of a life at its last cough,
33. as I swim through the air of the kitchen,
34. and the same radio plays its songs
35. and I make a small path through them
36. with my bare finger and my funny feet,
37. doing the undoing dance,
38. on April 14th, 1973,
39. letting my history rip itself off me
40. and stepping into
41. something unknown
42. and transparent,
43. but all ten fingers stretched outward,
44. flesh extended as metal
45. waiting for a magnet.
