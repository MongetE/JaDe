1. 'Too many things are occurring for even a big heart to hold.' - From an essay by W. B. Yeats

2. Big heart,
3. wide as a watermelon,
4. but wise as birth,
5. there is so much abundance
6. in the people I have:
7. Max, Lois, Joe, Louise,
8. Joan, Marie, Dawn,
9. Arlene, Father Dunne,
10. and all in their short lives
11. give to me repeatedly,
12. in the way the sea
13. places its many fingers on the shore,
14. again and again
15. and they know me,
16. they help me unravel,
17. they listen with ears made of conch shells,
18. they speak back with the wine of the best region.
19. They are my staff.
20. They comfort me.

21. They hear how
22. the artery of my soul has been severed
23. and soul is spurting out upon them,
24. bleeding on them,
25. messing up their clothes,
26. dirtying their shoes.
27. And God is filling me,
28. though there are times of doubt
29. as hollow as the Grand Canyon,
30. still God is filling me.
31. He is giving me the thoughts of dogs,
32. the spider in its intricate web,
33. the sun
34. in all its amazement,
35. and a slain ram
36. that is the glory,
37. the mystery of great cost,
38. and my heart,
39. which is very big,
40. I promise it is very large,
41. a monster of sorts,
42. takes it all inâ€”
43. all in comes the fury of love.
