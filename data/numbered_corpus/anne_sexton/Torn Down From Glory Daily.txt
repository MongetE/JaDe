1. All day we watched the gulls
2. striking the top of the sky
3. and riding the blown roller coaster.
4. Up there
5. godding the whole blue world
6. and shrieking at a snip of land.
7. Now, like children,
8. we climb down humps of rock
9. with a bag of dinner rolls,
10. left over,
11. and spread them gently on stone,
12. leaving six crusts for an early king.
13. A single watcher comes hawking in,
14. rides the current round its hunger
15. and hangs
16. carved in silk
17. until it throbs up suddenly,
18. out, and one inch over water;
19. to come again
20. smoothing over the slap tide.
21. To come bringing its flock, like a city
22. of wings that fall from the air.
23. They wait, each like a wooden decoy
24. or soft like a pigeon or
25. a sweet snug duck:
26. until one moves, moves that dart-beak
27. breaking over. It has the bread.
28. The world is full of them,
29. a world of beasts
30. thrusting for one rock.
31. Just four scoop out the bread
32. and go swinging over Gloucester
33. to the top of the sky.
34. Oh see how
35. they cushion their fishy bellies
36. with a brother's crumb.
