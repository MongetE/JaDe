1. Busy, with an idea for a code, I write
2. signals hurrying from left to right,
3. or right to left, by obscure routes,
4. for my own reasons; taking a word like writes
5. down tiers of tries until its secret rites
6. make sense; or until, suddenly, RATS
7. can amazingly and funnily become STAR
8. and right to left that small star
9. is mine, for my own liking, to stare
10. its five lucky pins inside out, to store
11. forever kindly, as if it were a star
12. I touched and a miracle I really wrote.
