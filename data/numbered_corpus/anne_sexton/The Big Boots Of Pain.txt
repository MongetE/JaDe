1. There can be certain potions
2. needled in the clock
3. for the body’s fall from grace,
4. to untorture and to plead for.
5. These I have known
6. and would sell all my furniture
7. and books and assorted goods
8. to avoid, and more, more.

9. But the other pain
10. I would sell my life to avoid
11. the pain that begins in the crib
12. with its bars or perhaps
13. with your first breath
14. when the planets drill
15. your future into you
16. for better of worse
17. as you marry life
18. and the love that gets doled out
19. or doesn’t.

20. I find now, swallowing one teaspoon
21. of pain, that it drops downward
22. to the past where it mixes
23. with last year’s cupful
24. and downward into a decade’s quart
25. and downward into a lifetime’s ocean.
26. I alternate treading water
27. and deadman’s float.

28. The teaspoon ought to be hearable
29. if it didn’t mix into the reruns
30. and thus enlarge into what it is not,
31. a sea pest’s sting turning promptly
32. into the shark’s neat biting off
33. of a leg because the soul
34. wears a magnifying glass.
35. Kicking the heart
36. with pain’s big boots running up and down
37. the intestines like a motorcycle racer.

38. Yet one does get out of bed
39. and start over, plunge into the day
40. and put on a hopeful look
41. and does not allow fear to build a wall
42. between you and an old friend
43. or a new friend and reach out your hand,
44. shutting down the thought that
45. an axe may cut it off unexpectedly.
46. One learns not to blab about all this
47. except to yourself or the typewriter keys
48. who tell no one until they get brave
49. and crawl off onto the printed page.

50. I’m getting bored with it,
51. I tell the typewriter,
52. this constantly walking around
53. in wet shoes and then, surprise!
54. Somehow DECEASED keeps getting
55. stamped in red over the word HOPE.
56. And I who keep falling thankfully
57. into each new pillow of belief,
58. finding my Mercy Street,
59. kissing it and tenderly gift-wrapping my love,
60. am beginning to wonder just what
61. the planets had in mind on November 9th, 1928.
62. The pillows are ripped away,
63. the hand guillotined,
64. dog shit thrown into the middle of a laugh,
65. a hornets’ nest building into the hi-fi speaker
66. and leaving me in silence,
67. where, without music,
68. I become a cracked orphan.

69. Well,
70. one gets out of bed
71. and the planets don’t always hiss
72. or muck up the day, each day.
73. As for the pain and its multiplying teaspoon,
74. perhaps it is a medicine
75. that will cure the soul
76. of its greed for love
77. next Thursday.
