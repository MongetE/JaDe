1. A born salesman,
2. my father made all his dough
3. by selling wool to Fieldcrest, Woolrich and Faribo.

4. A born talker,
5. he could sell one hundred wet-down bales
6. of that white stuff. He could clock the miles and the sales

7. and make it pay.
8. At home each sentence he would utter
9. had first pleased the buyer who'd paid him off in butter.

10. Each word
11. had been tried over and over, at any rate,
12. on the man who was sold by the man who filled my plate.

13. My father hovered
14. over the Yorkshire pudding and the beef:
15. a peddler, a hawker, a merchant and an Indian chief.

16. Roosevelt! Willkie! and war!
17. How suddenly gauche I was
18. with my old-maid heart and my funny teenage applause.

19. Each night at home
20. my father was in love with maps
21. while the radio fought its battles with Nazis and Japs.

22. Except when he hid
23. in his bedroom on a three-day drunk,
24. he typed out complex itineraries, packed his trunk,

25. his matched luggage
26. and pocketed a confirmed reservation,
27. his heart already pushing over the red routes of the nation.

28. I sit at my desk
29. each night with no place to go,
30. opening thee wrinkled maps of Milwaukee and Buffalo,

31. the whole U.S.,
32. its cemeteries, its arbitrary time zones,
33. through routes like small veins, capitals like small stones.

34. He died on the road,
35. his heart pushed from neck to back,
36. his white hanky signaling from the window of the Cadillac.

37. My husband,
38. as blue-eyed as a picture book, sells wool:
39. boxes of card waste, laps and rovings he can pull

40. to the thread
41. and say Leicester, Rambouillet, Merino,
42. a half-blood, it's greasy and thick, yellow as old snow.

43. And when you drive off, my darling,
44. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! It's one for my dame,
45. your sample cases branded with my father's name,

46. your itinerary open,
47. its tolls ticking and greedy,
48. its highways built up like new loves, raw and speedy.
