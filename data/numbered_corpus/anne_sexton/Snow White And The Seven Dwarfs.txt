1. No matter what life you lead
2. the virgin is a lovely number:
3. cheeks as fragile as cigarette paper,
4. arms and legs made of Limoges,
5. lips like Vin Du Rh√¥ne,
6. rolling her china-blue doll eyes
7. open and shut.
8. Open to say,
9. Good Day Mama,
10. and shut for the thrust
11. of the unicorn.
12. She is unsoiled.
13. She is as white as a bonefish.

14. Once there was a lovely virgin
15. called Snow White.
16. Say she was thirteen.
17. Her stepmother,
18. a beauty in her own right,
19. though eaten, of course, by age,
20. would hear of no beauty surpassing her own.
21. Beauty is a simple passion,
22. but, oh my friends, in the end
23. you will dance the fire dance in iron shoes.
24. The stepmother had a mirror to which she referred-
25. something like the weather forecast-
26. a mirror that proclaimed
27. the one beauty of the land.
28. She would ask,
29. Looking glass upon the wall,
30. who is fairest of us all?
31. And the mirror would reply,
32. You are the fairest of us all.
33. Pride pumped in her like poison.

34. Suddenly one day the mirror replied,
35. Queen, you are full fair, 'tis true,
36. but Snow White is fairer than you.
37. Until that moment Snow White
38. had been no more important
39. than a dust mouse under the bed.
40. But now the queen saw brown spots on her hand
41. and four whiskers over her lip
42. so she condemned Snow White
43. to be hacked to death.
44. Bring me her heart, she said to the hunter,
45. and I will salt it and eat it.
46. The hunter, however, let his prisoner go
47. and brought a boar's heart back to the castle.
48. The queen chewed it up like a cube steak.
49. Now I am fairest, she said,
50. lapping her slim white fingers.

51. Snow White walked in the wildwood
52. for weeks and weeks.
53. At each turn there were twenty doorways
54. and at each stood a hungry wolf,
55. his tongue lolling out like a worm.
56. The birds called out lewdly,
57. talking like pink parrots,
58. and the snakes hung down in loops,
59. each a noose for her sweet white neck.
60. On the seventh week
61. she came to the seventh mountain
62. and there she found the dwarf house.
63. It was as droll as a honeymoon cottage
64. and completely equipped with
65. seven beds, seven chairs, seven forks
66. and seven chamber pots.
67. Snow White ate seven chicken livers
68. and lay down, at last, to sleep.

69. The dwarfs, those little hot dogs,
70. walked three times around Snow White,
71. the sleeping virgin.  They were wise
72. and wattled like small czars.
73. Yes.  It's a good omen,
74. they said, and will bring us luck.
75. They stood on tiptoes to watch
76. Snow White wake up.  She told them
77. about the mirror and the killer-queen
78. and they asked her to stay and keep house.
79. Beware of your stepmother,
80. they said.
81. Soon she will know you are here.
82. While we are away in the mines
83. during the day, you must not
84. open the door.

85. Looking glass upon the wall...
86. The mirror told
87. and so the queen dressed herself in rags
88. and went out like a peddler to trap Snow White.
89. She went across seven mountains.
90. She came to the dwarf house
91. and Snow White opened the door
92. and bought a bit of lacing.
93. The queen fastened it tightly
94. around her bodice,
95. as tight as an Ace bandage,
96. so tight that Snow White swooned.
97. She lay on the floor, a plucked daisy.
98. When the dwarfs came home they undid the lace
99. and she revived miraculously.
100. She was as full of life as soda pop.
101. Beware of your stepmother,
102. they said.
103. She will try once more.

104. Looking glass upon the wall...
105. Once more the mirror told
106. and once more the queen dressed in rags
107. and once more Snow White opened the door.
108. This time she bought a poison comb,
109. a curved eight-inch scorpion,
110. and put it in her hair and swooned again.
111. The dwarfs returned and took out the comb
112. and she revived miraculously.
113. She opened her eyes as wide as Orphan Annie.
114. Beware, beware, they said,
115. but the mirror told,
116. the queen came,
117. Snow White, the dumb bunny,
118. opened the door
119. and she bit into a poison apple
120. and fell down for the final time.
121. When the dwarfs returned
122. they undid her bodice,
123. they looked for a comb,
124. but it did no good.
125. Though they washed her with wine
126. and rubbed her with butter
127. it was to no avail.
128. She lay as still as a gold piece.

129. The seven dwarfs could not bring themselves
130. to bury her in the black ground
131. so they made a glass coffin
132. and set it upon the seventh mountain
133. so that all who passed by
134. could peek in upon her beauty.
135. A prince came one June day
136. and would not budge.
137. He stayed so long his hair turned green
138. and still he would not leave.
139. The dwarfs took pity upon him
140. and gave him the glass Snow White-
141. its doll's eyes shut forever-
142. to keep in his far-off castle.
143. As the prince's men carried the coffin
144. they stumbled and dropped it
145. and the chunk of apple flew out
146. of her throat and she woke up miraculously.

147. And thus Snow White became the prince's bride.
148. The wicked queen was invited to the wedding feast
149. and when she arrived there were
150. red-hot iron shoes,
151. in the manner of red-hot roller skates,
152. clamped upon her feet.
153. First your toes will smoke
154. and then your heels will turn black
155. and you will fry upward like a frog,
156. she was told.
157. And so she danced until she was dead,
158. a subterranean figure,
159. her tongue flicking in and out
160. like a gas jet.
161. Meanwhile Snow White held court,
162. rolling her china-blue doll eyes open and shut
163. and sometimes referring to her mirror
164. as women do.
