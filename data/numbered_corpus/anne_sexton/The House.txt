1. In dreams
2. the same bad dream goes on.
3. Like some gigantic German toy
4. the house has been rebuilt
5. upon its kelly-green lawn.
6. The same dreadful set,
7. the same family of orange and pink faces
8. carved and dressed up like puppets
9. who wait for their jaws to open and shut.
10. Nineteen forty-two,
11. nineteen forty-three,
12. nineteen forty-four…
13. it's all the same. We're at war.
14. They've rationed the gas for all three cars.
15. The Lincoln Continental breathes in its stall,
16. a hopped up greyhound waiting to be sprung.
17. The Irish boy
18. who dated her
19. (lace curtain Irish, her mother said)
20. urges her through the lead-colored garages
21. to feel the patent-leather fenders
22. and peek at the mileage.
23. All that money!
24. and kisses too.
25. Kisses that stick in the mouth
26. like the vinegar candy she used to pull
27. with her buttery fingers, pull
28. until it was white like a dog's bone,
29. white, thick and impossible to chew.
30. Father,
31. an exact likeness,
32. his face bloated and pink
33. with black market scotch,
34. sits out his monthly bender
35. in his custom-made pajamas
36. and shouts, his tongue as quick as galloping horses,
37. shouts into the long distance telephone call.
38. His mouth is as wide as his kiss.
39. Mother,
40. with just the right gesture,
41. kicks her shoes off,
42. but is made all wrong,
43. impossibly frumpy as she sits there
44. in her alabaster dressing room
45. sorting her diamonds like a bank teller
46. to see if they add up.
47. The maid
48. as thin as a pencil stick,
49. holds dinner as usual,
50. rubs her angry knuckles over the porcelain sink
51. and grumbles at the gun-shy bird dog.
52. She knows something is going on.
53. She pricks a baked potato.
54. The aunt,
55. older than all the crooked women
56. in
57. The Brothers Grimm,

58. leans by a gooseneck lamp in her second floor suite,
59. turns up her earphone to eavesdrop
60. and continues to knit,
61. her needles working like kitchen shears
62. and her breasts blown out like two
63. pincushions.
64. The houseboy,
65. a quick-eyed Filipino,
66. slinks by like a Japanese spy
67. from French Provincial room
68. to French Provincial room,
69. emptying the ash trays and plumping up
70. the down upholstery.
71. His jacket shines, old shiny black,
72. a wise undertaker.
73. The milkman walks in his cartoon
74. every other day in the snoozy dawn,
75. rattling his bottles like a piggy bank.
76. And gardeners come, six at a time,
77. pulling petunias and hairy angel bells
78. up through the mulch.
79. This one again, made vaguely and cruelly,
80. one eye green and one eye blue,
81. has the only major walk-on so far,
82. has walked from her afternoon date
83. past the waiting baked potatoes,
84. past the flashing back of the Japanese spy,
85. up the cotton batten stairs,
86. past the clicking and unclicking of the earphones,
87. turns here at the hall
88. by the diamonds that she'll never earn
89. and the bender that she kissed last night
90. among thick set stars, the floating bed
91. and the strange white key…
92. up like a skein of yarn,
93. up another flight into the penthouse,
94. to slam the door on all the years
95. she'll have to live through…
96. the sailor who she won't with,
97. the boys who will walk on
98. from Andover, Exeter and St. Marks,
99. the boys who will walk off with pale unlined faces,
100. to slam the door on all the days she'll stay the same
101. and never ask why and never think who to ask,
102. to slam the door and rip off her orange blouse.

103. Father, father, I wish I were dead.

104. At thirty-five
105. she'll dream she's dead
106. or else she'll dream she's back.
107. All day long the house sits
108. larger than Russia
109. gleaming like a cured hide in the sun.
110. All day long the machine waits: rooms,
111. stairs, carpets, furniture, people -
112. those people who stand at the open windows like objects
113. waiting to topple.
