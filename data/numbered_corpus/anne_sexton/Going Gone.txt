1. Over stone walls and barns,
2. miles from the black-eyed Susans,
3. over circus tents and moon rockets
4. you are going, going.
5. You who have inhabited me
6. in the deepest and most broken place,
7. are going, going.
8. An old woman calls up to you
9. from her deathbed deep in sores,
10. asking, 'What do you keep of her?'
11. She is the crone in the fables.
12. She is the fool at the supper
13. and you, sir, are the traveler.
14. Although you are in a hurry
15. you stop to open a small basket
16. and under layers of petticoats
17. you show her the tiger-striped eyes
18. that you have lately plucked,
19. you show her specialty, the lips,
20. those two small bundles,
21. you show her the two hands
22. that grip her fiercely,
23. one being mine, one being yours.
24. Torn right off at the wrist bone
25. when you started in your
26. impossible going, gone.
27. Then you place the basket
28. in the old woman's hollow lap
29. and as a last act she fondles
30. these artifacts like a child's head
31. and murmurs, 'Precious. Precious.'
32. And you are glad you have given
33. them to this one for she too
34. is making a trip.
