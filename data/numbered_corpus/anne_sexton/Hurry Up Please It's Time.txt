4. my two wheels rolling off toward Nirvana.
5. They are neat as a wallet,
6. opening and closing on their coins,
7. the quarters, the nickels,
8. straight into the crapper.
9. Why shouldn't I pull down my pants
10. and moon the executioner
11. as well as paste raisins on my breasts?
12. Why shouldn't I pull down my pants
13. and show my little cunny to Tom
14. and Albert? They wee-wee funny.
15. I wee-wee like a squaw.
16. I have ink but no pen, still
17. I dream that I can piss in God's eye.
18. I dream I'm a boy with a zipper.
19. It's so practical, la de dah.
20. The trouble with being a woman, Skeezix,
21. is being a little girl in the first place.
22. Not all the books of the world will change that.
23. I have swallowed an orange, being woman.
24. You have swallowed a ruler, being man.
25. Yet waiting to die we are the same thing.
26. Jehovah pleasures himself with his axe
27. before we are both overthrown.
28. Skeezix, you are me. La de dah.
29. You grow a beard but our drool is identical.

30. Forgive us, Father, for we know not.

31. Today is November 14th, 1972.
32. I live in Weston, Mass., Middlesex County,
33. U.S.A., and it rains steadily
34. in the pond like white puppy eyes.
35. The pond is waiting for its skin.
36. the pond is waiting for its leather.
37. The pond is waiting for December and its Novocain.

67. take some wine,

71. the fives, the tens, the twenties,
72. all in a goo to feed the baby.
73. Andrew Jackson as an hors d'oeuvre,
74. la de dah.
75. I wish I were the U.S. Mint,
76. turning it all out,
77. turtle green
78. and monk black.
79. Who's that at the podium
80. in black and white,
81. blurting into the mike?
82. Ms. Dog.
83. Is she spilling her guts?
84. You bet.
85. Otherwise they cough…
86. The day is slipping away, why am I

127. Ms. Dog, when you gonna feel that cold nose?
128. You better get straight with the Maker
129. cuz it's coming, it's a coming!
130. The cup of coffee is growing and growing
131. and they're gonna stick your little doll's head
132. into it and your lungs a gonna get paid

168. and left me in the big black

190. Ms. Dog prefers to sunbathe nude.
191. Let the indifferent sky look on.
192. So what!
193. Let Mrs. Sewal pull the curtain back,
194. from her second story.
195. So what!
196. Let United Parcel Service see my parcel.
197. La de dah.

199. you hat on fire,
200. you honeysuckle mama,
201. pour your blonde on me!
202. Let me laugh for an entire hour
203. at your supreme being, your Cadillac stuff,
204. because I've come a long way
205. from Brussels sprouts.

207. and lay me down in the grass.

209. Once I hung around in my woolly tank suit,
210. drying my hair in those little meatball curls.
211. Now I am clothed in gold air with
212. one dozen halos glistening on my skin.
213. I am a fortunate lady.
214. I've gotten out of my pouch
215. and my teeth are glad
216. and my heart, that witness,
217. beats well at the thought.

218. Oh body, be glad.
219. You are good goods.

220. *

223. You dig a hole
224. and come out with a sunburn.

226. you start constructing a sailboat.
227. If someone hands you a candy wrapper,
228. you take it to the book binder.
229. Pocketa-pocketa.

230. Once upon a time Ms. Dog was sixty-six.
231. She had white hair and wrinkles deep as splinters.
232. her portrait was nailed up like Christ
233. and she said of it:
234. That's when I was forty-two,
235. down in Rockport with a hat on for the sun,
236. and Barbara drew a line drawing.
237. We were, at that moment, drinking vodka
238. and ginger beer and there was a chill in the air,
239. although it was July, and she gave me her sweater
240. to bundle up in. The next summer Skeezix tied
241. strings in that hat when we were fishing in Maine.
242. (It had gone into the lake twice.)
243. Of such moments is happiness made.

244. Forgive us, Father, for we know not.

245. Once upon a time we were all born,
246. popped out like jelly rolls
247. forgetting our fishdom,
248. the pleasuring seas,
249. the country of comfort,
250. spanked into the oxygens of death,
251. Good morning life, we say when we wake,
252. hail mary coffee toast
253. and we Americans take juice,
254. a liquid sun going down.
255. Good morning life.
256. To wake up is to be born.
257. To brush your teeth is to be alive.
258. To make a bowel movement is also desireable.
259. La de dah,
260. it's all routine.
261. Often there are wars
262. yet the shops keep open
263. and sausages are still fried.
264. People rub someone.
265. People copulate
266. entering each other's blood,
267. tying each other's tendons in knots,
268. transplanting their lives into the bed.
269. It doesn't matter if there are wars,
270. the business of life continues
271. unless you're the one that gets it.
272. Mama, they say, as their intestines
273. leak out. Even without wars
274. life is dangerous.
275. Boats spring leaks.
276. Cigarettes explode.
277. The snow could be radioactive.
278. Cancer could ooze out of the radio.
279. Who knows?
280. Ms. Dog stands on the shore
281. and the sea keeps rocking in
282. and she wants to talk to God.

283. Interrogator:
284. Why talk to God?

285. Anne:
286. It's better than playing bridge.

287. *

288. Learning to talk is a complex business.
289. My daughter's first word was utta,
290. meaning button.
291. Before there are words
292. do you dream?
293. In utero
294. do you dream?
295. Who taught you to suck?
296. And how come?
297. You don't need to be taught to cry.
298. The soul presses a button.
299. Is the cry saying something?
300. Does it mean help?
301. Or hello?
302. The cry of a gull is beautiful
303. and the cry of a crow is ugly
304. but what I want to know
305. is whether they mean the same thing.
306. Somewhere a man sits with indigestion
307. and he doesn't care.
308. A woman is buying bracelets
309. and earrings and she doesn't care.
310. La de dah.

311. Forgive us, Father, for we know not.

312. There are stars and faces.
313. There is ketchup and guitars.
314. There is the hand of a small child
315. when you're crossing the street.
316. There is the old man's last words:
317. More light! More light!
318. Ms. Dog wouldn't give them her buttocks.
319. She wouldn't moon at them.
320. Just at the killers of the dream.
321. The bus boys of the soul.
322. Or at death
323. who wants to make her a mummy.
324. And you too!
325. Wants to stuf her in a cold shoe
326. and then amputate the foot.
327. And you too!
328. La de dah.
329. What's the point of fighting the dollars
330. when all you need is a warm bed?
331. When the dog barks you let him in.
332. All we need is someone to let us in.
333. And one other thing:
334. to consider the lilies in the field.
335. Of course earth is a stranger, we pull at its
336. arms and still it won't speak.
337. The sea is worse.
338. It comes in, falling to its knees
339. but we can't translate the language.
340. It is only known that they are here to worship,
341. to worship the terror of the rain,
342. the mud and all its people,
343. the body itself,
344. working like a city,
345. the night and its slow blood
346. the autumn sky, mary blue.
347. but more than that,
348. to worship the question itself,
349. though the buildings burn
350. and the big people topple over in a faint.
351. Bring a flashlight, Ms. Dog,
352. and look in every corner of the brain
353. and ask and ask and ask
354. until the kingdom,
355. however queer,
356. will come.
