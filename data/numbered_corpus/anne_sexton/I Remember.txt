1. By the first of August
2. the invisible beetles began
3. to snore and the grass was
4. as tough as hemp and was
5. no colorâ€”no more than
6. the sand was a color and
7. we had worn our bare feet
8. bare since the twentieth
9. of June and there were times
10. we forgot to wind up your
11. alarm clock and some nights
12. we took our gin warm and neat
13. from old jelly glasses while
14. the sun blew out of sight
15. like a red picture hat and
16. one day I tied my hair back
17. with a ribbon and you said
18. that I looked almost like
19. a puritan lady and what
20. I remember best is that
21. the door to your room was
22. the door to mine.
