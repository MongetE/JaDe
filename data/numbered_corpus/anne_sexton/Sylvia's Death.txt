1. For Sylvia Plath

2. O Sylvia, Sylvia,
3. with a dead box of stones and spoons,
4. with two children, two meteors
5. wandering loose in a tiny playroom,
6. with your mouth into the sheet,
7. into the roofbeam, into the dumb prayer,
8. (Sylvia, Sylvia
9. where did you go
10. after you wrote me
11. from Devonshire
12. about raising potatoes
13. and keeping bees?)
14. what did you stand by,
15. just how did you lie down into?
16. Thief -
17. how did you crawl into,
18. crawl down alone
19. into the death I wanted so badly and for so long,
20. the death we said we both outgrew,
21. the one we wore on our skinny breasts,
22. the one we talked of so often each time
23. we downed three extra dry martinis in Boston,
24. the death that talked of analysts and cures,
25. the death that talked like brides with plots,
26. the death we drank to,
27. the motives and the quiet deed?
28. (In Boston
29. the dying
30. ride in cabs,
31. yes death again,
32. that ride home
33. with our boy.)
34. O Sylvia, I remember the sleepy drummer
35. who beat on our eyes with an old story,
36. how we wanted to let him come
37. like a sadist or a New York fairy
38. to do his job,
39. a necessity, a window in a wall or a crib,
40. and since that time he waited
41. under our heart, our cupboard,
42. and I see now that we store him up
43. year after year, old suicides
44. and I know at the news of your death
45. a terrible taste for it, like salt,
46. (And me,
47. me too.
48. And now, Sylvia,
49. you again
50. with death again,
51. that ride home
52. with our boy.)
53. And I say only
54. with my arms stretched out into that stone place,
55. what is your death
56. but an old belonging,
57. a mole that fell out
58. of one of your poems?
59. (O friend,
60. while the moon's bad,
61. and the king's gone,
62. and the queen's at her wit's end
63. the bar fly ought to sing!)
64. O tiny mother,
65. you too!
66. O funny duchess!
67. O blonde thing!
