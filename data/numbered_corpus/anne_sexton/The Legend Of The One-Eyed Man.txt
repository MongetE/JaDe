1. Like Oedipus I am losing my sight.
2. Like Judas I have done my wrong.
3. Their punishment is over;
4. the shame and disgrace of it
5. are all used up.
6. But as for me,
7. look into my face
8. and you will know that crimes dropped upon me
9. as from a high building
10. and although I cannot speak of them
11. or explain the degrading details
12. I have remembered much
13. about Judas -
14. about Judas, the old and the famous -
15. that you overlooked.

16. The story of his life
17. is the story of mine.
18. I have one glass eye.
19. My nerves push against its painted surface
20. but the other one
21. waiting for judgment
22. continues to see . . .

23. Of course
24. the New Testament is very small.
25. Its mouth opens four times -
26. as out-of-date as a prehistoric monster,
27. yet somehow man-made
28. held together by pulleys
29. like the stone jaw of a back-hoe.
30. It gouges out the Judaic ground,
31. taking its own backyard
32. like a virgin daughter.

33. And furthermore how did Judas come into it -
34. that Judas Iscariot,
35. belonging to the tribe of Reuben?
36. He should have tried to lift him up there!
37. His neck like an iron pole,
38. hard as Newcastle,
39. his heart as stiff as beeswax,
40. his legs swollen and unmarked,
41. his other limbs still growing.
42. All of it heavy!
43. That dead weight that would have been his fault.
44. He should have known!

45. In the first place who builds up such ugliness?
46. I think of this man saying . . .
47. Look! Here's the price to do it
48. plus the cost of the raw materials
49. and if it took him three or four days
50. to do it, then, they'd understand.
51. They figured it weighed enough
52. to support a man. They said,
53. fifteen stone is the approximate weight
54. of a thief.

55. Its ugliness is a matter of custom.
56. If there was a mistake made
57. then the Crucifix was constructed wrong . . .
58. not from the quality of the pine,
59. not from hanging a mirror,
60. not from dropping the studding or the drill
61. but from having an inspiration.
62. But Judas was not a genius
63. or under the auspices of an inspiration.

64. I don't know whether it was gold or silver.
65. I don't know why he betrayed him
66. other than his motives,
67. other than the avaricious and dishonest man.
68. And then there were the forbidden crimes,
69. those that were expressly foretold,
70. and then overlooked
71. and then forgotten
72. except by me . . .
73. Judas had a mother
74. just as I had a mother.
75. Oh! Honor and relish the facts!
76. Do not think of the intense sensation
77. I have as I tell you this
78. but think only . . .

79. Judas had a mother.
80. His mother had a dream.
81. Because of this dream
82. he was altogether managed by fate
83. and thus he raped her.
84. As a crime we hear little of this.
85. Also he sold his God.
