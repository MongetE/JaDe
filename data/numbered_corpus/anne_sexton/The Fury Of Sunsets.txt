1. Something
2. cold is in the air,
3. an aura of ice
4. and phlegm.
5. All day I've built
6. a lifetime and now
7. the sun sinks to
8. undo it.
9. The horizon bleeds
10. and sucks its thumb.
11. The little red thumb
12. goes out of sight.
13. And I wonder about
14. this lifetime with myself,
15. this dream I'm living.
16. I could eat the sky
17. like an apple
18. but I'd rather
19. ask the first star:
20. why am I here?
21. why do I live in this house?
22. who's responsible?
23. eh?
