1. They come on to my clean
2. sheet of paper and leave a Rorschach blot.
3. They do not do this to be mean,
4. they do it to give me a sign
5. they want me, as Aubrey Beardsley once said,
6. to shove it around till something comes.
7. Clumsy as I am,
8. I do it.
9. For I am like them -
10. both saved and lost,
11. tumbling downward like Humpty Dumpty
12. off the alphabet.

13. Each morning I push them off my bed
14. and when they get in the salad
15. rolling in it like a dog,
16. I pick each one out
17. just the way my daughter
18. picks out the anchovies.
19. In May they dance on the jonquils,
20. wearing out their toes,
21. laughing like fish.
22. In November, the dread month,
23. they suck the childhood out of the berries
24. and turn them sour and inedible.

25. Yet they keep me company.
26. They wiggle up life.
27. They pass out their magic
28. like Assorted Lifesavers.
29. They go with me to the dentist
30. and protect me form the drill.
31. At the same time,
32. they go to class with me
33. and lie to my students.

34. O fallen angel,
35. the companion within me,
36. whisper something holy
37. before you pinch me
38. into the grave.
