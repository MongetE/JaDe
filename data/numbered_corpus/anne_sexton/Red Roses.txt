1. Tommy is three and when he's bad
2. his mother dances with him.
3. She puts on the record,
4. 'Red Roses for a Blue Lady'
5. and throws him across the room.
6. Mind you,
7. she never laid a hand on him.
8. He gets red roses in different places,
9. the head, that time he was as sleepy as a river,
10. the back, that time he was a broken scarecrow,
11. the arm like a diamond had bitten it,
12. the leg, twisted like a licorice stick,
13. all the dance they did together,
14. Blue Lady and Tommy.
15. You fell, she said, just remember you fell.
16. I fell, is all he told the doctors
17. in the big hospital. A nice lady came
18. and asked him questions but because
19. he didn't want to be sent away he said, I fell.
20. He never said anything else although he could talk fine.
21. He never told about the music
22. or how she'd sing and shout
23. holding him up and throwing him.

24. He pretends he is her ball.
25. He tries to fold up and bounce
26. but he squashes like fruit.
27. For he loves Blue Lady and the spots
28. of red roses he gives her
