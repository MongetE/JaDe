1. Sleepmonger,
2. deathmonger,
3. with capsules in my palms each night,
4. eight at a time from sweet pharmaceutical bottles
5. I make arrangements for a pint-sized journey.
6. I'm the queen of this condition.
7. I'm an expert on making the trip
8. and now they say I'm an addict.
9. Now they ask why.
10. WHY!

11. Don't they know that I promised to die!
12. I'm keping in practice.
13. I'm merely staying in shape.
14. The pills are a mother, but better,
15. every color and as good as sour balls.
16. I'm on a diet from death.

17. Yes, I admit
18. it has gotten to be a bit of a habit-
19. blows eight at a time, socked in the eye,
20. hauled away by the pink, the orange,
21. the green and the white goodnights.
22. I'm becoming something of a chemical
23. mixture.
24. that's it!

25. My supply
26. of tablets
27. has got to last for years and years.
28. I like them more than I like me.
29. It's a kind of marriage.
30. It's a kind of war where I plant bombs inside
31. of myself.

32. Yes
33. I try
34. to kill myself in small amounts,
35. an innocuous occupatin.
36. Actually I'm hung up on it.
37. But remember I don't make too much noise.
38. And frankly no one has to lug me out
39. and I don't stand there in my winding sheet.
40. I'm a little buttercup in my yellow nightie
41. eating my eight loaves in a row
42. and in a certain order as in
43. the laying on of hands
44. or the black sacrament.

45. It's a ceremony
46. but like any other sport
47. it's full of rules.
48. It's like a musical tennis match where
49. my mouth keeps catching the ball.
50. Then I lie on; my altar
51. elevated by the eight chemical kisses.

52. What a lay me down this is
53. with two pink, two orange,
54. two green, two white goodnights.
55. Fee-fi-fo-fum-
56. Now I'm borrowed.
57. Now I'm numb.
