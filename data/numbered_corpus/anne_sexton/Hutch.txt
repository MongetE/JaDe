1. of her arms, this was her sin:
2. where the wood berries bin
3. of forest was new and full,
4. she crept out by its tall
5. posts, those wooden legs,
6. and heard the sound of wild pigs.
7. calling and did not wait nor care.
8. The leaves wept in her hair
9. as she sank to a pit of needles
10. and twisted out the ivyless
11. gate, where the wood berries bin
12. was full and a pig came in.
