1. The summer sun ray
2. shifts through a suspicious tree.
3. though I walk through the valley of the shadow
4. It sucks the air
5. and looks around for me.

6. The grass speaks.
7. I hear green chanting all day.
8. I will fear no evil, fear no evil
9. The blades extend
10. and reach my way.

11. The sky breaks.
12. It sags and breathes upon my face.
13. In the presence of mine enemies, mine enemies
14. The world is full of enemies.
15. There is no safe place.
