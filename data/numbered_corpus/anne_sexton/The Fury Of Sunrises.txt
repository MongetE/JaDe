1. Darkness
2. as black as your eyelid,
3. poketricks of stars,
4. the yellow mouth,
5. the smell of a stranger,
6. dawn coming up,
7. dark blue,
8. no stars,
9. the smell of a love,
10. warmer now
11. as authentic as soap,
12. wave after wave
13. of lightness
14. and the birds in their chains
15. going mad with throat noises,
16. the birds in their tracks
17. yelling into their cheeks like clowns,
18. lighter, lighter,
19. the stars gone,
20. the trees appearing in their green hoods,
21. the house appearing across the way,
22. the road and its sad macadam,
23. the rock walls losing their cotton,
24. lighter, lighter,
25. letting the dog out and seeing
26. fog lift by her legs,
27. a gauze dance,
28. lighter, lighter,
29. yellow, blue at the tops of trees,
30. more God, more God everywhere,
31. lighter, lighter,
32. more world everywhere,
33. sheets bent back for people,
34. the strange heads of love
35. and breakfast,
36. that sacrament,
37. lighter, yellower,
38. like the yolk of eggs,
39. the flies gathering at the windowpane,
40. the dog inside whining for good
41. and the day commencing,
42. not to die, not to die,
43. as in the last day breaking,
44. a final day digesting itself,
45. lighter, lighter,
46. the endless colors,
47. the same old trees stepping toward me,
48. the rock unpacking its crevices,
49. breakfast like a dream
50. and the whole day to live through,
51. steadfast, deep, interior.
52. After the death,
53. after the black of black,
54. the lightness, -
55. not to die, not to die -
56. that God begot.
