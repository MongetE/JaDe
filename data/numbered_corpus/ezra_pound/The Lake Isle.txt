1. O God, O Venus, O Mercury, patron of thieves,
2. Give me in due time, I beseech you, a little tobacco-shop,
3. With the little bright boxes
4. piled up neatly upon the shelves
5. And the loose fragment cavendish
6. and the shag,
7. And the bright Virginia
8. loose under the bright glass cases,
9. And a pair of scales
10. not too greasy,
11. And the votailles dropping in for a word or two in passing,
12. For a flip word, and to tidy their hair a bit.

13. O God, O Venus, O Mercury, patron of thieves,
14. Lend me a little tobacco-shop,
15. or install me in any profession
16. Save this damn'd profession of writing,
17. where one needs one's brains all the time.
