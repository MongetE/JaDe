1. Alba

2. When the nightingale to his mate
3. Sings day-long and night late
4. My love and I keep state
5. In bower,
6. In flower,
7. ''Till the watchman on the tower
8. Cry:
9. 'Up! Thou rascal, Rise,
10. I see the white
11. Light
12. And the night
13. Flies:

14. I
15. Compleynt of a gentleman who has been waiting outside for some time

16. O plasmatour and true celestial light,
17. Lord powerful, engirdled all with might,
18. Give my good-fellow aid in fools' despite
19. Who stirs not forth this night,
20. And day comes on.'Sst! my good fellow, art awake or sleeping?
21. Sleep thou no more. I see the star upleaping
22. That hath the dawn in keeping,
23. And day comes on!
24. 'Hi! Harry, hear me, for I sing aright
25. Sleep not thou now, I hear the bird in flight
26. That plaineth of the going of the night,
27. And day comes on!
28. ‘Come now! Old swenkin! Rise up from thy bed,
29. I see the signs upon the welkin spread,
30. If thou come not, the cost be on thy head.
31. And day comes on!
32. ‘And here I am since going down of sun,
33. And pray to God that is St. Mary's son,
34. To bring thee safe back, my companion.
35. And day comes on.'And thou out here beneath the porch of stone
36. Badest me to see that a good watch was done,
37. And now thou'lt none of me, and wilt have none
38. Of song of mine.
39. (Bass voice from inside)
40. 'Wait, my good fellow. For such joy I take
41. With her venust and noblest to my make
42. To hold embraced, and will not her forsake
43. For yammer of the cuckold,
44. Though day break.'

46. II
47. Avril

48. When the springtime is sweet
49. And the birds repeat
50. Their new song in the leaves.
51. ‘Tis meet
52. A man go where he will.

53. But from where my heart is set
54. No message I get;
55. My heart all wakes and grieves;
56. Defeat
57. Or luck, I must have my fill.

58. Our love comes out
59. Like the branch that turns about
60. On the top of the hawthorne,
61. With frost and hail at night
62. Suffers despite
63. 'Till the sun come, and the green leaf on the bough.

64. I remember the young day
65. When we set strife away,
66. And she gave me such gesning,
67. Her love and her ring:
68. God grant I die not by any man's stroke
69. 'Till I have my hand 'neath her cloak.

70. I care not for their clamour
71. Who have come between me and my charmer,
72. For I know how words run loose,
73. Big talk and little use.
74. Spoilers of pleasure,
75. We take their measure.
76. (Guilhem de Peitieu)

77. III
78. Descant on a Theme by Cerclamon

79. When the sweet air goes bitter,
80. And the cold birds twitter
81. Where the leaf falls from the twig,
82. I sough and sing

83. that Love goes out
84. Leaving me no power to hold him.

85. Of love I have naught
86. Save trouble and sad thought,
87. And nothing is grievous
88. as I desirous,
89. Wanting only what
90. No man can get or has got.

91. With the noblest that stands in men's sight,
92. If all the world be in despite
93. I care not a glove.
94. Where my love is, there is a glitter of sun;
95. God give me life, and let my course run

96. 'Till I have her I love
97. To lie with and prove.

98. I do not live, nor cure me,
99. Nor feel my ache great as it is,
100. For love will give
101. me no respite,
102. Nor do I know when I turn left or right
103. nor when I go out.

104. For in her is all my delight
105. And all that can save me.

106. I shake and burn and quiver
107. From love, awake and in swevyn,
108. Such fear I have she deliver
109. me not from pain,
110. Who know not how to ask her;
111. Who can not.
112. Two years, three years I seek
113. And though I fear to speak out,
114. Still she must know it.

115. If she won't have me now, Death is my portion,
116. Would I had died that day
117. I came into her sway.
118. God! How softly this kills!
119. When her love look steals on me.
120. Killed me she has, I know not how it was,
121. For I would not look on a woman.

122. Joy I have none, if she make me not mad
123. Or set me quiet, or bid me chatter.
124. Good is it to me if she flout
125. Or turn me inside out, and about.
126. My ill doth she turn sweet.

127. How swift it is.
128. For I am traist and loose,
129. I am true, or a liar,
130. All vile, or all gentle,
131. Or shaking between,
132. as she desire,
133. I, Cerclamon, sorry and glad,
134. The man whom love had
135. and has ever;
136. Alas! who'er it please or pain,
137. She can me retain.
138. I am gone from one joy,
139. From one I loved never so much,
140. She by one touch
141. Reft me away;
142. So doth bewilder me
143. I can not say my say
144. nor my desire,
145. And when she looks on me
146. It seems to me
147. I lose all wit and sense.

148. The noblest girls men love
149. 'Gainst her I prize not as a glove
150. Worn and old.
151. Though the whole world run rack
152. And go dark with cloud,
153. Light is
154. Where she stands,
155. And a clamour loud
156. in my ears.

158. Vergier

159. In orchard under the hawthorne
160. She has her lover till morn,
161. Till the traist man cry out to warn
162. Them God how swift the night,
163. And day comes on.
164. O Plasmatour, that thou end not the night,
165. Nor take my beloved from my sight,
166. Nor I, nor tower-man, look on daylight,
167. 'Fore God, How swift the night,
168. And day comes on.
169. 'Lovely thou art, to hold me close and kisst,
170. Now cry the birds out, in the meadow mist,
171. Despite the cuckold, do thou as thou list,
172. So swiftly goes the night
173. And day comes on.
174. ‘My pretty boy, make we our play again
175. Here in the orchard where the birds complain,
176. 'Till the traist watcher his song unrein,
177. Ah God! How swift the night
178. And day comes on.'

179. ‘Out of the wind that blows from her,
180. That dancing and gentle is and thereby pleasanter,
181. Have I drunk a draught, sweeter than scent of myrrh.
182. Ah God! How swift the night.
183. And day comes on.'

184. Venust the lady, and none lovelier,
185. For her great beauty, many men look on her,
186. Out ofmy love will her heart not stir.
187. By God, how swift the night.
188. And day comes on.
