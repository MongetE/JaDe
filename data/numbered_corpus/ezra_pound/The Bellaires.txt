1. The good Bellaires
2. Do not understand the conduct of this world's affairs.
3. In fact they understood them so badly
4. That they have had to cross the Channel.
5. Nine lawyers, four counsels, five judges and three
6. proctors of the King,
7. Together with the respective wives, husbands, sisters
8. and heterogeneous connections of the good Bellaires,
9. Met to discuss their affairs;
10. But the good Bellaires have so little understood their
11. affairs
12. That now there is no one at all
13. Who can understand any affair of theirs. Yet
14. Fourteen hunters still eat in the stables of
15. The good Squire Bellaire;
16. But these may not suffer attainder,
17. For they may not belong to the good Squire Bellaire
18. But to his wife.
19. On the contrary, if they do not belong to his wife,
20. He will plead
21. A 'freedom from attainder'
22. For twelve horses and also for twelve boarhounds
23. From Charles the Fourth;
24. And a further freedom for the remainder
25. Of horses, from Henry the Fourth.
26. But the judges,
27. Being free of mediaeval scholarship,
28. Will pay no attention to this,
29. And there will be only the more confusion,
30. Replevin, estoppel, espavin and what not.

31. Nine lawyers, four counsels, etc.,
32. Met to discuss their affairs,
33. But the sole result was bills
34. From lawyers to whom no one was indebted,
35. And even the lawyers
36. Were uncertain who was supposed to be indebted to
37. them.

38. Wherefore the good Squire Bellaire
39. Resides now at Agde and Biaucaire,
40. To Carcassonne, Pui, and Alais
41. He fareth from day to day,
42. Or takes the sea air
43. Between Marseilles
44. And Beziers.
45. And for all this I have considerable regret,
46. For the good Bellaires
47. Are very charming people.
