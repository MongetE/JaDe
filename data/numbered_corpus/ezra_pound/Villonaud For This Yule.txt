1. Towards the Noel that morte saison
2. (Christ make the shepherds' homage dear!)
3. Then when the grey wolves everychone
4. Drink of the winds their chill small-beer
5. And lap o' the snows food's gueredon
6. Then makyth my heart his yule-tide cheer
7. (Skoal! with the dregs if the clear be gone!)
8. Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.
9. Ask ye what ghost I dream upon?
10. (What of the magians' scented gear?)
11. The ghosts of dead loves everyone
12. That make the stark winds reek with fear
13. Lest love return with the foison sun
14. And slay the memories that me cheer
15. (Such as I drink to mine fashion)
16. Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.
17. Where are the joys my heart had won?
18. (Saturn and Mars to Zeus drawn near!)
19. Where are athe lips mine lay upon,
20. Aye! where are the glances feat and clear
21. That bade my heart his valor don?

22. I skoal to the eyes as grey-blown meer
23. (Who knows whose was that paragon?)
24. Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.
25. Prince: ask me not what I have done
26. Nor what God hath that can me cheer
27. But ye ask first where the winds are gone
28. Wineing the ghosts of yester-year.
