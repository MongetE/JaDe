1. I
2. Phyllidula and the Spoils of Gouvernet

3. Where, Lady, are the days
4. When you could go out in a hired hansom
5. Without footmen and equipments?
6. And dine in a soggy, cheap restaurant?
7. Phyllidula now, with your powdered Swiss footman
8. Clanking the door shut,
9. and lying;
10. And carpets from Savonnier, and from Persia,
11. And your new service at dinner,
12. And plates from Germain,
13. And cabinets and chests from Martin (almost lacquer),
14. And your white vases from Japan,
15. And the lustre of diamonds,
16. Etcetera, etcetera, and etcetera?

17. II
18. To Madame du Ch√¢telet

19. If you'd have me go on loving you
20. Give me back the time of the thing.

21. Will you give me dawn light at evening?
22. Time has driven me out from the fine plaisaunces,

23. The parks with the swards all over dew,
24. And grass going glassy with the light on it,
25. The green stretches where love is and the grapes
26. Hang in yellow-white and dark clusters ready for pressing.
27. And if now we can't fit with our time of life
28. There is not much but its evil left us.

29. Life gives us two minutes, two seasons
30. One to be dull in;
31. Two deaths and to stop loving and being lovable,
32. That is the real death,
33. The other is little beside it.

34. Crying after the follies gone by me,
35. Quiet talking is all that is left us
36. Gentle talking, not like the first talking, less lively;
37. And to follow after friendship, as they call it,
38. Weeping that we can follow naught else.

39. III
40. To Madame Lullin

41. You'll wonder that an old man of eighty
42. Can go on writing you verses. . . .

43. Grass showing under the snow,
44. Birds singing late in the year!

45. And Tibullus could say of his death, in his Latin:
46. 'Delia, I would look on you, dying.'

47. And Delia herself fading out,
48. Forgetting even her beauty.
