1. To So-Kin of Rakuyo, ancient friend, Chancellor of
2. Gen.
3. Now I remember that you built me a special tavern
4. By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin.
5. With yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs
6. and laughter
7. And we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the
8. kings and princes.
9. Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from
10. the west border,
11. And with them, and with you especially
12. There was nothing at cross purpose,
13. And they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain-
14. crossing,
15. If only they could be of that fellowship,
16. And we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without
17. regret.
18. And when I was sent off to South Wei,
19. smothered in laurel groves,
20. And you to the north of Raku-hoku,
21. Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in
22. common.
23. And then, when separation had come to its worst,
24. We met, and travelled into Sen-Go,
25. Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and
26. twisting waters,
27. Into a valley of the thousand bright flowers,
28. That was the first valley;
29. And into ten thousand valleys full of voices and pine-
30. winds.
31. And with silver harness and reins of gold,
32. Out came the East of Kan foreman and his company.
33. And there came also the ‘True man’ of Shi-yo to meet
34. me,
35. Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.
36. In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more
37. Sennin music,
38. Many instruments, like the sound of young phoenix
39. broods.
40. The foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced
41. because his long sleeves wouldn't keep still
42. With that music playing,
43. And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my
44. head on his lap,
45. And my spirit so high it was all over the heavens,
46. And before the end of the day we were scattered like
47. stars, or rain.
48. I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,
49. You back to your river-bridge.

50. And your father, who was brave as a leopard,
51. Was governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian
52. rabble.
53. And one May he had you send for me,
54. despite the long distance.
55. And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it
56. wasn't hard going,
57. Over roads twisted like sheep's guts.
58. And I was still going, late in the year,
59. in the cutting wind from the North,
60. And thinking how little you cared for the cost,
61. and you caring enough to pay it.
62. And what a reception:
63. Red jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table,
64. And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning.
65. And you would walk out with me to the western corner
66. of the castle,
67. To the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as
68. blue jade,
69. With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and
70. drums,
71. With ripples like dragon-scales, going grass green on the
72. water,
73. Pleasure lasting, with courtezans, going and coming
74. without hindrance,
75. With the willow flakes falling like snow,
76. And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,
77. And the water, a hundred feet deep, reflecting green
78. eyebrows
79. Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young
80. moonlight,
81. Gracefully painted
82. And the girls singing back at each other,
83. Dancing in transparent brocade,
84. And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,
85. Tossing it up under the clouds.
86. And all this comes to an end.
87. And is not again to be met with.
88. I went up to the court for examination,
89. Tried Layu's luck, offered the Choyo song,
90. And got no promotion,
91. and went back to the East Mountains
92. White-headed.
93. And once again, later, we met at the South bridge-head.
94. And then the crowd broke up, you went north to San
95. palace,
96. And if you ask how I regret that parting:
97. It is like the flowers falling at Spring's end
98. Confused, whirled in a tangle.
99. What is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking,
100. There is no end of things in the heart.
101. I call in the boy,
102. Have him sit on his knees here
103. To seal this,
104. And send it a thousand miles, thinking.
