1. Be in me as the eternal moods
2. of the bleak wind, and'not
3. As transient things are
4. gaiety of flowers.
5. Have me in the strong loneliness
6. of sunless cliffs
7. And of grey waters.
8. Let the gods speak softly of us
9. In days hereafter,
10. The shadowy flowers of Orcus
11. Remember thee.
