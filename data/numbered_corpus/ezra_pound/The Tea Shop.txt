1. The girl in the tea shop
2. Is not so beautiful as she was,
3. The August has worn against her.
4. She does not get up the stairs so eagerly;
5. Yes, she also will turn middle-aged,
6. And the glow of youth that she spread about us
7. As she brought us our muffins
8. Will be spread about us no longer.
9. She also will turn middle-aged.
