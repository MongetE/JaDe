1. â€˜Tis but a vague, invarious delight
2. As gold that rains about some buried king.

3. As the fine flakes,
4. When tourists frolicking
5. Stamp on his roof or in the glazing light
6. Try photographs, wolf down their ale and cakes
7. And start to inspect some further pyramid;

8. As the fine dust, in the hid cell
9. Beneath their transitory step and merriment,
10. Drifts through the air, and the sarcophagus
11. Gains yet another crust
12. Of useless riches for the occupant,
13. So I, the fires that lit once dreams
14. Now over and spent,
15. Lie dead within four walls
16. And so now love
17. Rains down and so enriches some stiff case,
18. And strews a mind with precious metaphors,

19. And so the space
20. Of my still consciousness
21. Is full of gilded snow,

22. The which, no cat has eyes enough
23. To see the brightness of.
