1. At Rochecoart,
2. Where the hills part
3. in three ways,
4. And three valleys, full of winding roads,
5. Fork out to south and north,
6. There is a place of trees . . . gray with lichen.
7. I have walked there
8. thinking of old days.
9. At Chalais
10. is a pleached arbour;
11. Old pensioners and old protected \vomen
12. Have the right there
13. it is charity.
14. I have crept over old rafters,
15. peering down
16. Over the Dronne,
17. over a stream full of lilies.
18. Eastward the road lies,
19. Aubeterre is eastward,
20. With a garrulous old man at the inn.
21. I know the roads in that place:
22. Mareuil to the north-east,
23. La Tour,
24. There are three keeps near Mareuil,
25. And an old woman,
26. glad to hear Arnaut,
27. Glad to lend one dry clothing.

28. I have walked
29. into Perigord,
30. I have seen the torch-flames, high-leaping,
31. Painting the front of that church;
32. Heard, under the dark, whirling laughter.
33. I have looked back over the stream
34. and seen the high building,
35. Seen the long minarets, the white shafts.
36. I have gone in Ribeyrac
37. and in Sarlat,
38. I have climbed rickety stairs, heard talk of Croy,
39. Walked over En Bertran's old layout,
40. Have seen Narbonne, and Cahors and Chalus,
41. Have seen Excideuil, carefully fashioned.

42. I have said:
43. ‘Here such a one walked.
44. ‘Here Cceur-de-Lion was slain.
45. 'Here was good singing.
46. 'Here one man hastened his step.
47. 'Here one lay panting.'
48. I have looked south from Hautefort,
49. thinking of Montaignac, southward.
50. I have lain in Rocafixada,
51. level with sunset,
52. Have seen the copper come down
53. tingeing the mountains,
54. I have seen the fields, pale, clear as an emerald,
55. Sharp peaks, high spurs, distant castles.
56. I have said: The old roads have lain here.
57. 'Men have gone by such valleys
58. ‘Where the great halls were closer together.'
59. I have seen Foix on its rock, seen Toulouse, and
60. Aries greatly altered,
61. I have seen the ruined 'Dorata'.
62. I have said:
63. 'Riquier! Guido.'
64. I have thought of the second Troy,
65. Some little prized place in Auvergnat:
66. Two men tossing a coin, one keeping a castle,
67. One set on the highway to sing.
68. He sang a woman,
69. Auvergne rose to the song;
70. The Dauphin backed him.
71. 'The castle to Austors!'
72. 'Pieire kept the singing
73. ‘A fair man and a pleasant.'
74. He won the lady,
75. Stole her away for himself, kept her against armed force:
76. So ends that story.
77. That age is gone;
78. Pieire de Maensac is gone.
79. I have walked over these roads;
80. I have thought of them living.
