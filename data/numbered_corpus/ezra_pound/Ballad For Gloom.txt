1. For God, our God is a gallant foe
2. That playeth behind the veil.

3. I have loved my God as a child at heart
4. That seeketh deep bosoms for rest,
5. I have loved my God as a maid to man—
6. But lo, this thing is best:

7. To love your God as a gallant foe that plays behind the veil;
8. To meet your God as the night winds meet beyond Arcturus' pale.

9. I have played with God for a woman,
10. I have staked with my God for truth,
11. I have lost to my God as a man, clear-eyed—
12. His dice be not of ruth.

13. For I am made as a naked blade,
14. But hear ye this thing in sooth:

15. Who loseth to God as man to man
16. Shall win at the turn of the game.
17. I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet
18. But the ending is the same:
19. Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose
20. Shall win at the end of the game.

21. For God, our God is a gallant foe that playeth behind the veil.
22. Whom God deigns not to overthrow hath need of triple mail.
