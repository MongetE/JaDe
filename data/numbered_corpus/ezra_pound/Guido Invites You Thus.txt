1. ‘Lappo I leave behind and Dante too,
2. Lo, I would sail the seas with thee alone!
3. Talk me no love talk, no bought-cheap fiddl’ry,
4. Mine is the ship and thine the merchandise,
5. All the blind earth knows not th'emprise
6. Whereto thou calledst and whereto I call.

7. Lo, I have seen thee bound about with dreams,
8. Lo, I have known thy heart and its desire;
9. Life, all of it, my sea, and all men's streams
10. Are fused in it as flames of an altar fire !
11. Lo, thou hast voyaged not! The ship is mine.'
