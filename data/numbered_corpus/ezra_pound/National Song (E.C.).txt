1. There is no land like England
2. Where banks rise day by day,
3. There are no banks like English banks
4. To make the people pay.

5. There is no such land of castles
6. Where an Englishman is free
7. To read his smutty literature
8. With muffins at his tea.

9. Chorus:
10. For the French have comic papers
11. Not that nice Britons read 'em,
12. But the bawdy little Britons
13. Have bank sharks to bleed 'em

14. And to keep an eye on their readin' matter
15. Lest they should overhear the distressing chatter
16. Of the new economical theories
17. And ask inconvenient queetfes.
