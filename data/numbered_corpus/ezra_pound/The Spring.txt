1. Cydonian Spring with her attendant train,
2. Maelids and water-girls,
3. Stepping beneath a boisterous wind from Thrace,
4. Throughout this sylvan place
5. Spreads the bright tips,
6. And every vine-stock is
7. Clad in new brilliancies.
8. And wild desire
9. Falls like black lightning.
10. bewildered heart,
11. Though every branch have back what last year lost,
12. She, who moved here amid the cyclamen,
13. Moves only now a clinging tenuous ghost.
