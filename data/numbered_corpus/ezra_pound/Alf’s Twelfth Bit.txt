1. BALLAD FOR THE TIMES' SPECIAL SILVER NUMBER

2. Sez the Times a silver lining
3. Is what has set us pining,
4. Montague, Montague!
5. In the season sad and weary
6. When our minds are very bleary,
7. Montague, Montague!
8. There is Sir Hen. Deterding
9. His phrases interlarding,
10. Montague, Montague!
11. With the this and that and what
12. For putting silver on the spot,
13. Montague, Montague!
14. Just drop it in the slot
15. And it will surely boil the pot,
16. Montague, Montague!
17. Gold, of course, is solid too,
18. But some silver set to stew
19. Might do, too. Montague!
20. With a lively wood-pulp ‘ad’.

21. To cheer the bad and sad,
22. Montague, Montague!
