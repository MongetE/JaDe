1. "Vocat aestus in umbram"
2. Nemesianus Es. IV.

3. E. P. Ode pour l'élection de son sépulchre

4. For three years, out of key with his time,
5. He strove to resuscitate the dead art
6. Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime"
7. In the old sense. Wrong from the start --

8. No, hardly, but, seeing he had been born
9. In a half savage country, out of date;
10. Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
11. Capaneus; trout for factitious bait:

12. "Idmen gar toi panth, os eni Troie
13. Caught in the unstopped ear;
14. Giving the rocks small lee-way
15. The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.

16. His true Penelope was Flaubert,
17. He fished by obstinate isles;
18. Observed the elegance of Circe's hair
19. Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials.

20. Unaffected by "the march of events",
21. He passed from men's memory in l'an trentiesme
22. De son eage; the case presents
23. No adjunct to the Muses' diadem.

24. II.

25. The age demanded an image
26. Of its accelerated grimace,
27. Something for the modern stage,
28. Not, at any rate, an Attic grace;

29. Not, not certainly, the obscure reveries
30. Of the inward gaze;
31. Better mendacities
32. Than the classics in paraphrase!

33. The "age demanded" chiefly a mould in plaster,
34. Made with no loss of time,
35. A prose kinema, not, not assuredly, alabaster
36. Or the "sculpture" of rhyme.

37. III.

38. The tea-rose, tea-gown, etc.
39. Supplants the mousseline of Cos,
40. The pianola "replaces"
41. Sappho's barbitos.

42. Christ follows Dionysus,
43. Phallic and ambrosial
44. Made way for macerations;
45. Caliban casts out Ariel.

46. All things are a flowing,
47. Sage Heracleitus says;
48. But a tawdry cheapness
49. Shall reign throughout our days.

50. Even the Christian beauty
51. Defects -- after Samothrace;
52. We see to kalon
53. Decreed in the market place.

54. Faun's flesh is not to us,
55. Nor the saint's vision.
56. We have the press for wafer;
57. Franchise for circumcision.

58. All men, in law, are equals.
59. Free of Peisistratus,
60. We choose a knave or an eunuch
61. To rule over us.

62. A bright Apollo,

63. tin andra, tin eroa, tina theon,
64. What god, man, or hero
65. Shall I place a tin wreath upon?

66. IV.

67. These fought, in any case,
68. and some believing, pro domo, in any case ..

69. Some quick to arm,
70. some for adventure,
71. some from fear of weakness,
72. some from fear of censure,
73. some for love of slaughter, in imagination,
74. learning later ...

75. some in fear, learning love of slaughter;
76. Died some pro patria, non dulce non et decor" ..

77. walked eye-deep in hell
78. believing in old men's lies, then unbelieving
79. came home, home to a lie,
80. home to many deceits,
81. home to old lies and new infamy;

82. usury age-old and age-thick
83. and liars in public places.

84. Daring as never before, wastage as never before.
85. Young blood and high blood,
86. Fair cheeks, and fine bodies;

87. fortitude as never before

88. frankness as never before,
89. disillusions as never told in the old days,
90. hysterias, trench confessions,
91. laughter out of dead bellies.


92. V.

93. There died a myriad,
94. And of the best, among them,
95. For an old bitch gone in the teeth,
96. For a botched civilization.

97. Charm, smiling at the good mouth,
98. Quick eyes gone under earth's lid,

99. For two gross of broken statues,
100. For a few thousand battered books.

101. Yeux Glauques

102. Gladstone was still respected,
103. When John Ruskin produced
104. "Kings Treasuries"; Swinburne
105. And Rossetti still abused.

106. Fœtid Buchanan lifted up his voice
107. When that faun's head of hers
108. Became a pastime for
109. Painters and adulterers.

110. The Burne-Jones cartons
111. Have preserved her eyes;
112. Still, at the Tate, they teach
113. Cophetua to rhapsodize;

114. Thin like brook-water,
115. With a vacant gaze.
116. The English Rubaiyat was still-born
117. In those days.

118. The thin, clear gaze, the same
119. Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face,
120. Questing and passive ....
121. "Ah, poor Jenny's case" ...

122. Bewildered that a world
123. Shows no surprise
124. At her last maquero's
125. Adulteries.

126. "Siena Mi Fe', Disfecemi Maremma"

127. Among the pickled fœtuses and bottled bones,
128. Engaged in perfecting the catalogue,
129. I found the last scion of the
130. Senatorial families of Strasbourg, Monsieur Verog.

131. For two hours he talked of Gallifet;
132. Of Dowson; of the Rhymers' Club;
133. Told me how Johnson (Lionel) died
134. By falling from a high stool in a pub ...

135. But showed no trace of alcohol
136. At the autopsy, privately performed --
137. Tissue preserved -- the pure mind
138. Arose toward Newman as the whiskey warmed.

139. Dowson found harlots cheaper than hotels;
140. Headlam for uplift; Image impartially imbued
141. With raptures for Bacchus, Terpsichore and the Church.
142. So spoke the author of "The Dorian Mood",

143. M. Verog, out of step with the decade,
144. Detached from his contemporaries,
145. Neglected by the young,
146. Because of these reveries.

147. Brennbaum.

148. The sky-like limpid eyes,
149. The circular infant's face,
150. The stiffness from spats to collar
151. Never relaxing into grace;

152. The heavy memories of Horeb, Sinai and the forty years,
153. Showed only when the daylight fell
154. Level across the face
155. Of Brennbaum "The Impeccable".

156. Mr. Nixon

157. In the cream gilded cabin of his steam yacht
158. Mr. Nixon advised me kindly, to advance with fewer
159. Dangers of delay. "Consider
160. Carefully the reviewer.

161. "I was as poor as you are;
162. "When I began I got, of course,
163. "Advance on royalties, fifty at first", said Mr. Nixon,
164. "Follow me, and take a column,
165. "Even if you have to work free.

166. "Butter reviewers. From fifty to three hundred
167. "I rose in eighteen months;
168. "The hardest nut I had to crack
169. "Was Dr. Dundas.

170. "I never mentioned a man but with the view
171. "Of selling my own works.
172. "The tip's a good one, as for literature
173. "It gives no man a sinecure."

174. And no one knows, at sight a masterpiece.
175. And give up verse, my boy,
176. There's nothing in it."

177. * * *

178. Likewise a friend of Bloughram's once advised me:
179. Don't kick against the pricks,
180. Accept opinion. The "Nineties" tried your game
181. And died, there's nothing in it.

182. X.

183. Beneath the sagging roof
184. The stylist has taken shelter,
185. Unpaid, uncelebrated,
186. At last from the world's welter

187. Nature receives him,
188. With a placid and uneducated mistress
189. He exercises his talents
190. And the soil meets his distress.

191. The haven from sophistications and contentions
192. Leaks through its thatch;
193. He offers succulent cooking;
194. The door has a creaking latch.

195. XI.

196. "Conservatrix of Milésien"
197. Habits of mind and feeling,
198. Possibly. But in Ealing
199. With the most bank-clerkly of Englishmen?

200. No, "Milésian" is an exaggeration.
201. No instinct has survived in her
202. Older than those her grandmother
203. Told her would fit her station.

204. XII.

205. "Daphne with her thighs in bark
206. Stretches toward me her leafy hands", --
207. Subjectively. In the stuffed-satin drawing-room
208. I await The Lady Valentine's commands,

209. Knowing my coat has never been
210. Of precisely the fashion
211. To stimulate, in her,
212. A durable passion;

213. Doubtful, somewhat, of the value
214. Of well-gowned approbation
215. Of literary effort,
216. But never of The Lady Valentine's vocation:

217. Poetry, her border of ideas,
218. The edge, uncertain, but a means of blending
219. With other strata
220. Where the lower and higher have ending;

221. A hook to catch the Lady Jane's attention,
222. A modulation toward the theatre,
223. Also, in the case of revolution,
224. A possible friend and comforter.

225. * * *

226. Conduct, on the other hand, the soul
227. "Which the highest cultures have nourished"
228. To Fleet St. where
229. Dr. Johnson flourished;

230. Beside this thoroughfare
231. The sale of half-hose has
232. Long since superseded the cultivation
233. Of Pierian roses.
