1. Gone while your tastes were keen to you,
2. Gone where the grey winds call to you,
3. By that high fencer, even Death,
4. Struck of the blade that no man parrieth;
5. Such is your fence, one saith,
6. One that hath known you.
7. Drew you your sword most gallantly
8. Made you your pass most valiantly
9. 'Gainst that grey fencer, even Death.

10. Gone as a gust of breath
11. Faith! no man tarrieth,
12. ‘Se il cor ti manca,’ but it failed thee not!
13. 'Non ti fidar,’ it is the sword that speaks
14. ‘In me.’

15. Thou trusted'st in thyself and met the blade
16. 'Thout mask or gauntlet, and art laid
17. As memorable broken blades that be
18. Kept as bold trophies of old pageantry.
19. As old Toledos past their days of war
20. Are kept mnemonic of the strokes they bore,
21. So art thou with us, being good to keep
22. In our heart's sword-rack, though thy sword-arm sleep.

23. ENVOI
24. Struck of the blade that no man parrieth
25. Pierced of the point that toucheth lastly all,
26. 'Gainst that grey fencer, even Death,
27. Behold the shield! He shall not take thee all.
