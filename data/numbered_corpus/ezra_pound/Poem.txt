2. Over the flat slope of St Eloi
3. A wide wall of sandbags.
4. Night,
5. In the silence desultory men
6. Pottering over small fires, cleaning their mess-tins:

9. Making paths in the dark,
10. Through scattered dead horses,
11. Over a dead Belgianâ€™s body.

12. The Germans have rockets. The English have no rockets,

14. Before the line, chaos.

17. Nothing suggests itself. There is nothing to do but keep on.
