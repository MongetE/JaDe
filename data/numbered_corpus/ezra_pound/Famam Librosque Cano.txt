1. Your songs?
2. Oh! The little mothers
3. Will sing them in the twilight,
4. And when the night
5. Shrinketh the kiss of the dawn
6. That loves and kills,
7. What time the swallow fills
8. Here note, the little rabbit folk
9. That some call children,
10. Such as are up and wide,
11. Will laugh your verses to each other,
12. Pulling on their shoes for the day's business,
13. Serious child business that the world
14. Laughs at, and grows stale;
15. Such is the tale
16. -Part of it-of thy song-life.

17. Mine?

18. A book is known by them that read
19. That same. Thy public in my screed
20. Is listed. Well! Some score years hence
21. Behold mine audience,
22. As we had seen him yesterday.

23. Scrawny, be-spectacled, out at heels,
24. Such an one as the world feels
25. A sort of curse against its guzzling
26. And its age-lasting wallow for red greed
27. And yet; full speed
28. Though it should run for its own getting,
29. Will turn aside to sneer at
30. 'Cause he hath
31. No coin, no will to snatch the aftermath
32. Of Mammon
33. Such an one as women draw away from
34. For the tobacco ashes scattered on his coat
35. And sith his throat
36. Show's razor's unfamiliarity
37. And three days' beard;

38. Such an one picking a ragged
39. Backless copy from the stall,
40. Too cheap for cataloguing,
41. Loquitur,

42. 'Ah-eh! the strange rare name . . .
43. Ah-eh! He must be rare if even 7 have not . . .â€™
44. And lost mid-page
45. Such age
46. As his pardons the habit,
47. He analyses form and thought to see
48. How I 'scaped immortality.
