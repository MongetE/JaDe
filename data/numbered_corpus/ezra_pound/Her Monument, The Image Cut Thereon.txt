1. FROM THE ITALIAN OF LEOPARDI

2. Such wast thou,
3. Who art now
4. But buried dust and rusted skeleton.
5. Above the bones and mire,
6. Motionless, placed in vain,
7. Mute mirror of the flight of speeding years,
8. Sole guard of grief
9. Sole guard of memory
10. Standeth this image of the beauty sped.

11. O glance, when thou wast still as thou art now,
12. How hast thou set the fire
13. A-tremble in men's veins; lip curved high
14. To mind me of some urn of full delight,
15. O throat girt round of old with swift desire,
16. O palms of Love, that in your wonted ways
17. Not once but many a day
18. Felt hands turn ice a-sudden, touching ye,
19. That ye were once! of all the grace ye had
20. That which remaineth now
21. Shameful, most sad
22. Finds 'neath this rock fit mould, fit resting place!

23. And still when fate recalleth,
24. Even that semblance that appears amongst us
25. Is like to heaven's most 'live imagining.
26. All, all our life's eternal mystery!
27. To-day, on high
28. Mounts, from our mighty thoughts and from the fount
29. Of sense untellable, Beauty
30. That seems to be some quivering splendour cast
31. By the immortal nature on this quicksand,

32. And by surhuman fates
33. Given to mortal state
34. To be a sign and an hope made secure
35. Of blissful kingdoms and the aureate spheres;
36. And on the morrow, by some lightsome twist,
37. Shameful in sight, abject, abominable
38. All this angelic aspect can return
39. And be but what it was
40. With all the admirable concepts that moved from it
41. Swept from the mind with it in its departure.

42. Infinite things desired, lofty visions
43. 'Got on desirous thoughts by natural virtue,
44. And the wise concord, whence through delicious seas
45. The arcane spirit of the whole Mankind
46. Turns hardy pilot . . . and if one wrong note
47. Strike the tympanum,
48. Instantly
49. That paradise is hurled to nothingness.

50. O mortal nature,
51. If thou art
52. Frail and so vile in all,
53. How canst thou reach so high with thy poor sense;
54. Yet if thou art
55. Noble in any part
56. How is the noblest of thy speech and thought
57. So lightly wrought
58. Or to such base occasion lit and quenched?
