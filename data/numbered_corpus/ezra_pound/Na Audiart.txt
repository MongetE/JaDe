1. Though thou well dost wish me ill
2. Audiart, Audiart,
3. Where thy bodice laces start
4. As ivy fingers clutching through
5. Its crevices,
6. Audiart, Audiart,
7. Stately, tall and lovely tender
8. Who shall render
9. Audiart, Audiart,
10. Praises meet unto thy fashion?
11. Here a word kiss !
12. Pass I on
13. Unto Lady ‘Miels-de-Ben’,
14. Having praised thy girdle's scope
15. How the stays ply back from it;
16. I breath no hope
17. That thou shouldst . . .
18. Nay no whit
19. Bespeak thyself for anything.
20. Just a word in thy praise, girl,
21. Just for the swirl
22. Thy satins make upon the stair,
23. 'Cause never a flaw was there
24. Where thy torse and limbs are met
25. Though thou hate me, read it set
26. In rose and gold.
27. Or when the minstrel, tale half told,
28. Shall burst to lilting at the praise
29. 'Audiart, Audiart' . .
30. Bertrans, master of his lays,
31. Bertrans of Aultaforte thy praise
32. Sets forth, and though thou hate me well,
33. Yea though thou wish me ill,
34. Audiart, Audiart.
35. Thy loveliness is here writ till,
36. Audiart,
37. Oh, till thou come again.
38. And being bent and wrinkled, in a form
39. That hath no perfect limning, when the warm
40. Youth dew is cold
41. Upon thy hands, and thy old soul
42. Scorning a new, wry'd casement,
43. Churlish at seemed misplacement,
44. Finds the earth as bitter
45. As now seems it sweet,
46. Being so young and fair
47. As then only in dreams,
48. Being then young and wry'd,
49. Broken of ancient pride,
50. Thou shalt then soften,
51. Knowing, I know not how,
52. Thou wert once she
53. Audiart, Audiart
54. For whose fairness one forgave
55. Audiart,
56. Audiart
57. Que be-m vols mal.
