1. For the seven lakes, and by no man these verses:
2. Rain; empty river; a voyage,
3. Fire from frozen cloud, heavy rain in the twilight
4. Under the cabin roof was one lantern.
5. The reeds are heavy; bent;
6. and the bamboos speak as if weeping.

7. Autumn moon; hills rise about lakes
8. against sunset
9. Evening is like a curtain of cloud,
10. a blurr above ripples; and through it
11. sharp long spikes of the cinnamon,
12. a cold tune amid reeds.
13. Behind hill the monk's bell
14. borne on the wind.
15. Sail passed here in April; may return in October
16. Boat fades in silver; slowly;
17. Sun blaze alone on the river.

18. Where wine flag catches the sunset
19. Sparse chimneys smoke in the cross light

20. Comes then snow scur on the river
21. And a world is covered with jade
22. Small boat floats like a lanthorn,
23. The flowing water closts as with cold. And at San Yin
24. they are a people of leisure.

25. Wild geese swoop to the sand-bar,
26. Clouds gather about the hole of the window
27. Broad water; geese line out with the autumn
28. Rooks clatter over the fishermen's lanthorns,

29. A light moves on the north sky line;
30. where the young boys prod stones for shrimp.
31. In seventeen hundred came Tsing to these hill lakes.
32. A light moves on the South sky line.

33. State by creating riches shd. thereby get into debt?
34. Thsi is infamy; this is Geryon.
35. This canal goes still to TenShi
36. Though the old king built it for pleasure

37. K E I M E N R A N K E I
38. K I U M A N M A N K E I
39. JITSU GETSU K O K W A
40. T A N FUKU T A N K A I

41. Sun up; work
42. sundown; to rest
43. dig well and drink of the water
44. dig field; eat of the grain
45. Imperial power is? and to us what is it?

46. The fourth; the dimension of stillness.
47. And the power over wild beasts.
