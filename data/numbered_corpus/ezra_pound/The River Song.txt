1. This boat is of shato-wood, and its gunwales are cut
2. magnolia,
3. Musicians with jewelled flutes and with pipes of gold
4. Fill full the sides in rows, and our wine
5. Is rich for a thousand cups.
6. We carry singing girls, drift with the drifting water,
7. Yet Sennin needs
8. A yellow stork for a charger, and all our seamen
9. Would follow the white gulls or ride them.
10. Kutsu's prose song
11. Hangs with the sun and moon.

12. King So's terraced palace
13. is now but barren hill,
14. But I draw pen on this barge
15. Causing the five peaks to tremble,
16. And I have joy in these words
17. like the joy of blue islands.
18. (If glory could last forever
19. Then the waters of Han would flow northward.)

20. And I have moped in the Emperor's garden, awaiting an
21. order-to-write !
22. I looked at the dragon-pond, with its willow-coloured
23. water
24. Just reflecting the sky's tinge,
25. And heard the five-score nightingales aimlessly singing.

26. The eastern wind brings the green colour into the island
27. grasses at Yei-shu,
28. The purple house and the crimson are full of Spring
29. softness.
30. South of the pond the willow-tips are half-blue and
31. bluer,
32. Their cords tangle in mist, against the brocade-like
33. palace.
34. Vine-strings a hundred feet long hang down from
35. carved railings,
36. And high over the willows, the fine birds sing to each
37. other, and listen,
38. Crying—‘Kwan, Kuan,' for the early wind, and the feel
39. of it.
40. The wind bundles itself into a bluish cloud and wanders
41. off.
42. Over a thousand gates, over a thousand doors are the
43. sounds of spring singing,
44. And the Emperor is at Ko.
45. Five clouds hang aloft, bright on the purple sky,
46. The imperial guards come forth from the golden house
47. with their armour a-gleaming.
48. The Emperor in his jewelled car goes out to inspect his
49. flowers,
50. He goes out to Hori, to look at the wing-flapping storks,
51. He returns by way of Sei rock, to hear the new
52. nightingales,
53. For the gardens at Jo-run are full of new nightingales,
54. Their sound is mixed in this flute,
55. Their voice is in the twelve pipes here.
