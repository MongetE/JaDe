1. WIND

2. Scarce and thin, scarce and thin
3. The government's excuse,
4. Never at all will they do
5. Aught of the slightest use.
6. Over the dying half-wits blow,
7. Over the empty-headed, and the slow
8. Marchers, not getting forwarder,
9. While Ramsay MacDonald sleeps, sleeps.

10. Fester and rot, fester and rot,
11. And angle and tergiversate
12. One thing among all things you will not
13. Do, that is: think, before it's too late.
14. Election will not come very soon,
15. And those born with a silver spoon,
16. Will keep it a little longer,
17. Until the mind of the old nation gets a little stronger.
