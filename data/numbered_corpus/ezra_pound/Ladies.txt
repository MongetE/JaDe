1. Agathas
2. Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,
3. All of whom she refused;
4. And now she turns to me seeking love,
5. And her hair also is turning.

6. Young Lady
7. I have fed your lar with poppies,
8. I have adored you for three full years;
9. And now you grumble because your dress does not fit
10. And because I happen to say so.

11. Lesbia Illa
12. Memnon, Menmon, that lady
13. Who used to walk about amongst us
14. With such gracious uncertainty,
15. Is now wedded
16. To a British householder.
17. Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque !

18. Passing
19. Flawless as Aphrodite,
20. Thoroughly beautiful,
21. Brainless,
22. The faint odour of your patchouli,
23. Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,
24. Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.
