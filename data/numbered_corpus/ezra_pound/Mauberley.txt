1. I
2. Turned from the 'eau-forte
3. Par Jaquemart'
4. To the strait head
5. Of Messalina:

6. 'His true Penelope
7. Was Flaubert,'
8. And his tool
9. The engraver's.

10. Firmness,
11. Not the full smile,
12. His art, but an art
13. In profile;

14. Colourless
15. Pier Francesca,
16. Pisanello lacking the skill
17. To forge Achaia.

18. II
19. For three years, diabolus in the scale,
20. He drank ambrosia,
21. All passes, ANANGKE prevails,

23. He had moved amid her phantasmagoria,
24. Amid her galaxies,
25. NUKTIS 'AGALMA

26. Drifted . . . drifted precipitate,
27. Asking time to be rid of ...
28. Of his bewilderment; to designate
29. His new found orchid. . . .

30. To be certain . . . certain . . .
31. (Amid aerial flowers) . . . time for arrangements-
32. Drifted on
33. To the final estrangement;

34. Unable in the supervening blankness
35. To sift TO AGATHON from the chaff
36. Until he found his sieve . . .
37. Ultimately, his seismograph:

38. Given that is his 'fundamental passion',
39. This urge to convey the relation
40. Of eye-lid and cheek-bone
41. By verbal manifestations;
42. To present the series
43. Of curious heads in medallion

44. He had passed, inconscient, full gaze,
45. The wide-branded irides
46. And botticellian sprays implied
47. In their diastasis;

48. Which ansethesis, noted a year late,
49. And weighed, revealed his great affect,
50. (Orchid), mandate
51. Of Eros, a retrospect.

52. Mouths biting empty air,
53. The still stone dogs,
54. Caught in metamorphosis, were
55. Left him as epilogues.
