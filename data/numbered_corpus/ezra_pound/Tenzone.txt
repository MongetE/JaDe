1. Will people accept them?
2. (i.e. these songs).
3. As a timorous wench from a centaur
4. (or a centurion),
5. Already they flee, howling in terror.

6. Will they be touched with the verisimilitudes?
7. Their virgin stupidity is untemptable.
8. I beg you, my friendly critics,
9. Do not set about to procure me an audience.

10. I mate with my free kind upon the crags;
11. the hidden recesses
12. Have heard the echo ofmy heels,
13. in the cool light,
14. in the darkness.
