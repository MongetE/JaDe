1. I ha' seen them 'mid the clouds on the heather.
2. Lo! they pause not for love nor for sorrow,
3. Yet their eyes are as the eyes of a maid to her lover,
4. When the white hart breaks his cover
5. And the white wind breaks the morn.

6. ‘'Tis the white stag, Fame, we're a-hunting,
7. Bid the world's hounds come to horn!’
