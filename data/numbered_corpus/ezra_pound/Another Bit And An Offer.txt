1. I see by the morning papers
2. That America's sturdy sons
3. Have started a investigation
4. Of the making of guns.

5. The morning paper tells me
6. They have asked the senate to guess
7. Whether Mr. Dupont and the gun-sharks
8. Have influence with the press.

9. I sit alone in the twilight
10. After my work is done
11. And wonder if my day's three and eight-pence
12. Would count on the price of a gun.

13. Was I started wrong as a kiddie,
14. And would my old man have been smarter
15. To send me to work in Vickers
16. Instead of being a carter?
