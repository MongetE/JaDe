1. Go, dumb-born book,
2. Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:
3. Hadst thou but song
4. As thou hast subjects known,
5. Then were there cause in thee that should condone
6. Even my faults that heavy upon me lie
7. And build her glories their longevity.
8. Tell her that sheds
9. Such treasure in the air,
10. Recking naught else but that her graces give
11. Life to the moment,
12. I would bid them live
13. As roses might, in magic amber laid,
14. Red overwrought with orange and all made
15. One substance and one colour
16. Braving time.
17. Tell her that goes
18. With song upon her lips
19. But sings not out the song, nor knows
20. The maker of it, some other mouth,
21. May be as fair as hers,
22. Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,
23. When our two dusts with Waller's shall be laid,
24. Siftings on siftings in oblivion,
25. Till change hath broken down
26. All things save Beauty alone.
