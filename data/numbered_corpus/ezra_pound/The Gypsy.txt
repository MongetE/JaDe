1. That was the top of the walk, when he said:
2. 'Have you seen any others, any of our lot,
3. With apes or bears?'
4. A brown upstanding fellow
5. Not like the half-castes,
6. up on the wet road near Clermont.
7. The wind came, and the rain,
8. And mist clotted about the trees in the valley,
9. And Iâ€™d the long ways behind me,
10. gray Aries and Biaucaire,
11. And he said, 'Have you seen any of our lot?'
12. I'd seen a lot of his lot . . .
13. ever since Rhodez,
14. Coming down from the fair
15. of St. John,
16. With caravans, but never an ape or a bear.
