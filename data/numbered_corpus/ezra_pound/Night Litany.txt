1. O Dieu, purifiez nos cceurs!
2. Purifiez nos coeurs !

3. Yea the lines hast thou laid unto me
4. in pleasant places,
5. And the beauty of this thy Venice
6. hast thou shown unto me
7. Until is its loveliness become unto me
8. a thing of tears.

9. O God, what great kindness
10. have we done in times past
11. and forgotten it,
12. That thou givest this wonder unto us,
13. O God of waters?

14. O God of the night,
15. What great sorrow
16. Cometh unto us,
17. That thou thus repayest us
18. Before the time of its coming?

19. O God of silence,
20. Purifiez nos cœurs,
21. Purifiez nos cœurs,
22. For we have seen
23. The glory of the shadow of the
24. likeness of thine handmaid,

25. Yea, the glory of the shadow
26. of thy Beauty hath walked
27. Upon the shadow of the waters
28. In this thy Venice.
29. And before the holiness
30. Of the shadow of thy handmaid
31. Have I hidden mine eyes,
32. O God of waters.
33. O God of silence,
34. Purifiez nos cœurs,
35. Purifiez nos cœurs,
36. O God of waters,
37. make clean our hearts within us,
38. For I have seen the
39. Shadow of this thy Venice
40. Floating upon the waters,
41. And thy stars

42. Have seen this thing, out of their far courses
43. Have they seen this thing,
44. O God of waters,
45. Even as are thy stars
46. Silent unto us in their far-coursing,
47. Even so is mine heart
48. become silent within me.

49. Purifiez nos cœurs,
50. O God of the silence,
51. Purifiez nos cœurs,
52. O God of waters.
