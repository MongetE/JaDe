1. FROM CHARLES D'ORLEANS
2. God! that mad'st her well regard her,
3. How she is so fair and bonny;
4. For the great charms that are upon her
5. Ready are all folks to reward her.

6. Who could part him from her borders
7. When spells are alway renewed on her?
8. God! that mad'st her well regard her,
9. How she is so fair and bonny.

10. From here to there to the sea's border,
11. Dame nor damsel there's not any
12. Hath of perfect charms so many.
13. Thoughts of her are of dream's order:
14. God! that mad'st her well regard her.
