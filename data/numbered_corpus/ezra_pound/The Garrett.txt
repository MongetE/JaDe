1. Come, let us pity those who are better off than we are.
2. Come, my friend, and remember
3. t hat the rich have butlers and no friends,
4. And we have friends and no butlers.
5. Come, let us pity the married and the unmarried.

6. Dawn enters with little feet
7. like a gilded Pavlova
8. And I am near my desire.
9. Nor has life in it aught better
10. Than this hour of clear coolness
11. t he hour of waking together.
