1. ‘I am thy soul, Nikoptis. I have watched
2. These five millennia, and thy dead eyes
3. Moved not, nor ever answer my desire,
4. And thy light limbs, wherethrough I leapt aflame,
5. Burn not with me nor any saffron thing.

6. See, the light grass sprang up to pillow thee,
7. And kissed thee with a myriad grassy tongues;
8. But not thou me.
9. I have read out the gold upon the wall,
10. And wearied out my thought upon the signs.
11. And there is no new thing in all this place.

12. I have been kind. See, I have left the jars sealed,
13. Lest thou shouldst wake and whimper for thy wine.
14. And all thy robes I have kept smooth on thee.

15. O thou unmindful ! How should I forget!
16. -Even the river many days ago,
17. The river? thou wast over young.
18. And three souls came upon Thee-
19. And I came.
20. And I flowed in upon thee, beat them off;
21. 1 have been intimate with thee, known thy ways.
22. Have I not touched thy palms and finger-tips,
23. Flowed in, and through thee and about thy heels?
24. How 'came I in'? Was I not thee and Thee?

25. And no sun comes to rest me in this place,
26. And I am torn against the jagged dark,
27. And no light beats upon me, and you say
28. No word, day after day.

29. Oh! I could get me out, despite the marks
30. And all their crafty work upon the door,
31. Out through the glass-green fields. . . .

32. Yet it is quiet here:
33. I do not go.’
