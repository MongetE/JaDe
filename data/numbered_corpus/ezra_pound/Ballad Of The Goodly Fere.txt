1. Ha' we lost the goodliest fere o' all
2. For the priests and the gallows tree?
3. Aye lover he was of brawny men,
4. O' ships and the open sea.

5. When they came wi' a host to take Our Man
6. His smile was good to see,
7. "First let these go!" quo' our Goodly Fere,
8. "Or I'll see ye damned," says he.

9. Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears
10. And the scorn of his laugh rang free,
11. "Why took ye not me when I walked about
12. Alone in the town?" says he.

13. Oh we drank his "Hale" in the good red wine
14. When we last made company,
15. No capon priest was the Goodly Fere
16. But a man o' men was he.

17. I ha' seen him drive a hundred men
18. Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free,
19. That they took the high and holy house
20. For their pawn and treasury.

21. They'll no' get him a' in a book I think
22. Though they write it cunningly;
23. No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere
24. But aye loved the open sea.

25. If they think they ha' snared our Goodly Fere
26. They are fools to the last degree.
27. "I'll go to the feast," quo' our Goodly Fere,
28. "Though I go to the gallows tree."

29. "Ye ha' seen me heal the lame and blind,
30. And wake the dead," says he,
31. "Ye shall see one thing to master all:
32. 'Tis how a brave man dies on the tree."

33. A son of God was the Goodly Fere
34. That bade us his brothers be.
35. I ha' seen him cow a thousand men.
36. I have seen him upon the tree.

37. He cried no cry when they drave the nails
38. And the blood gushed hot and free,
39. The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue
40. But never a cry cried he.

41. I ha' seen him cow a thousand men
42. On the hills o' Galilee,
43. They whined as he walked out calm between,
44. Wi' his eyes like the grey o' the sea,

45. Like the sea that brooks no voyaging
46. With the winds unleashed and free,
47. Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret
48. Wi' twey words spoke' suddently.

49. A master of men was the Goodly Fere,
50. A mate of the wind and sea,
51. If they think they ha' slain our Goodly Fere
52. They are fools eternally.

53. I ha' seen him eat o' the honey-comb
54. Sin' they nailed him to the tree.
