1. The lateral vibrations caress me,
2. They leap and caress me,
3. They work pathetically in my favour,
4. They seek my financial good.

5. She of the spear stands present.
6. The gods of the underworld attend me, O Annubis,
7. These are they of thy company.
8. With a pathetic solicitude they attend me;
9. Undulant,
10. Their realm is the lateral courses.


11. Light!
12. I am up to follow thee, Pallas.Up and out of their caresses.
13. You were gone up as a rocket,
14. Bending your passages from right to left and from left to right
15. In the flat projection of a spiral.
16. The gods of drugged sleep attend me,
17. Wishing me well;
18. I am up to follow thee, Pallas.
