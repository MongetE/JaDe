1. The tree has entered my hands,
2. The sap has ascended my arms,
3. The tree has grown in my breast -
4. Downward,
5. The branches grow out of me, like arms.

6. Tree you are,
7. Moss you are,
8. You are violets with wind above them.
9. A child - so high - you are,
10. And all this is folly to the world.
