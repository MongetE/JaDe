1. For I was a gaunt, grave councillor
2. Being in all things wise, and very old,
3. But I have put aside this folly and the cold
4. That old age weareth for a cloak.

5. I was quite strong-at least they said so-
6. The young men at the sword-play;
7. But I have put aside this folly, being gay
8. In another fashion that more suiteth me.

9. I have curled 'mid the boles of the ash wood,
10. I have hidden my face where the oak
11. Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke
12. Of the old ways of men have I cast aside.

13. By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha
14. Have I found me a bride
15. That was a dog-wood tree some syne.
16. She hath called me from mine old ways
17. She hath hushed my rancour of council,
18. Bidding me praise

19. Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves.

20. She hath drawn me from mine old ways,
21. Till men say that I am mad;
22. But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad,
23. For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly.

24. And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief.
25. I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf
26. And left them under a stone
27. And now men call me mad because I have thrown
28. All folly from me, putting it aside
29. To leave the old barren ways of men,
30. Because my bride
31. Is a pool of the wood, and
32. Though all men say that I am mad
33. It is only that I am glad,
34. Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love
35. That is sweeter than the love of women
36. That plague and burn and drive one away.

37. Aie-e! 'Tis true that I am gay
38. Quite gay, for I have her alone here
39. And no man troubleth us.

40. Once when I was among the young men . . .
41. And they said I was quite strong, among the young men.
42. Once there was a woman . . .
43. . . . but I forget . . . she was . .
44. ... I hope she will not come again.

45. ... I do not rememberâ€¦..

46. I think she hurt me once, but . . .
47. That was very long ago.

48. I do not like to remember things any more.

49. I like one little band of winds that blow
50. In the ash trees here:
51. For we are quite alone
52. Here 'mid the ash trees.
