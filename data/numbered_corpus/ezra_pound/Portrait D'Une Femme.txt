1. Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea,
2. London has swept about you this score years
3. And bright ships left you this or that in fee:
4. Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things,
5. Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price.
6. Great minds have sought you -- lacking someone else.
7. You have been second always. Tragical?
8. No. You preferred it to the usual thing:
9. One dull man, dulling and uxorious,
10. One average mind -- with one thought less, each year.
11. Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit
12. Hours, where something might have floated up.
13. And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay.
14. You are a person of some interest, one comes to you
15. And takes strange gain away:
16. Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion;
17. Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two,
18. Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else
19. That might prove useful and yet never proves,
20. That never fits a corner or shows use,
21. Or finds its hour upon the loom of days:
22. The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work;
23. Idols and ambergris and rare inlays,
24. These are your riches, your great store; and yet
25. For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things,
26. Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff:
27. In the slow float of differing light and deep,
28. No! there is nothing! In the whole and all,
29. Nothing that's quite your own.
30. Yet this is you.
