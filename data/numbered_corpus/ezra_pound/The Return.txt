1. See, they return; ah, see the tentative
2. Movements, and the slow feet,
3. The trouble in the pace and the uncertain
4. Wavering!

5. See, they return, one by one,
6. With fear, as half-awakened;
7. As if the snow should hesitate
8. And murmur in the wind,
9. and half turn back;
10. These were the "Wing'd-with-Awe,"
11. Inviolable.

12. Gods of the Wing√®d shoe!
13. With them the silver hounds,
14. sniffing the trace of air!

15. Haie! Haie!
16. These were the swift to harry;
17. These the keen-scented;
18. These were the souls of blood.

19. Slow on the leash,
20. pallid the leash-men!
