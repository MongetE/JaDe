1. O generation of the thoroughly smug
2. and thoroughly uncomfortable,
3. I have seen fishermen picnicking in the sun,
4. I have seen them with untidy families,
5. I have seen their smiles full of teeth
6. and heard ungainly laughter.
7. And I am happier than you are,
8. And they were happier than I am;
9. And the fish swim in the lake
10. and do not even own clothing.
