1. If all the grief and woe and bitterness,
2. All dolour, ill and every evil chance
3. That ever came upon this grieving world
4. Were set together they would seem but light
5. Against the death of the young English King.
6. Worth lieth riven and Youth dolorous,
7. The world overshadowed, soiled and overcast,
8. Void of all joy and full of ire and sadness.

9. Grieving and sad and full of bitterness
10. Are left in teen the liegemen courteous,
11. The joglars supple and the troubadours.
12. O'er much hath ta'en Sir Death that deadly warrior
13. In taking from them the young English King,
14. Who made the freest hand seem covetous.
15. 'Las! Never was nor will be in this world
16. The balance for this loss in ire and sadness!

17. O skilful Death and full of bitterness,
18. Well mayst thou boast that thou the best chevalier
19. That any folk e'er had, hast from us taken;
20. Sith nothing is that unto worth pertaineth
21. But had its life in the young English King
22. And better were it, should God grant his pleasure,
23. That he should live than many a living dastard
24. That doth but wound the good with ire and sadness.

25. From this faint world, how full of bitterness
26. Love takes his way and holds his joy deceitful
27. Sith no thing is but turneth unto anguish
28. And each to-day Vails less than yestere'en,
29. Let each man visage this young English King
30. That was most valiant 'mid all worthiest men!
31. Gone is his body fine and amorous,
32. Whence have we grief, discord and deepest sadness.

33. Him, whom it pleased for our great bitterness
34. To come to earth to draw us from misventure,
35. Who drank of death for our salvacioun,
36. Him do we pray as to a Lord most righteous
37. And humble eke, that the young English King
38. He please to pardon, as true pardon is,
39. And bid go in with honoured companions
40. There where there is no grief, nor shall be sadness.
