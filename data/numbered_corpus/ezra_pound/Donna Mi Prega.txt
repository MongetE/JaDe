5. I for the nonce to them that know it call,
6. Having no hope at all
7. that man who is base in heart
8. Can bear his part of wit
9. into the light of it,
10. And save they know't aright from nature's source
11. I have no will to prove Love's course
12. or say
13. Where he takes rest; who maketh him to be;
14. Or what his active virtu is, or what his force;
15. Nay, nor his very essence or his mode;
16. What his placation; why he is in verb,
17. Or if a man have might
18. To show him visible to men's sight.

23. His modus takes from soul, from heart his will;
24. From form seen doth he start, that, understood,
25. Taketh in latent intellect
26. As in a subject ready
27. place and abode,
28. Yet in that place it ever is unstill,
29. Spreading its rays, it tendeth never down
30. By quality, but is its own effect unendingly
31. Not to delight, but in an ardour of thought
32. That the base likeness of it kindleth not.

40. Be he withstayed
41. or from true course
42. bewrayed

46. Or that he hath not stablished seigniory
47. Or loseth power, e'en lost to memory.

48. He comes to be and is when will's so great
49. It twists itself from out all natural measure;
50. Leisure s adornment puts he then never on,
51. Never thereafter, but moves changing state,
52. Moves changing colour, or to laugh or weep
53. Or wries the face with fear and little stays,

55. yet is found the most
56. Where folk of worth be host.

75. in such his desire
76. To follow a noble spirit,
77. edge, that is, and point to the dart,
