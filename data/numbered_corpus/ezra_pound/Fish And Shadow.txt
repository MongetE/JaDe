2. The soul of the salmon-trout floats over the stream
3. Like a little wafer of light.

5. As light as the shadow of the fish
6. that falls through the water,
7. She came into the large room by the stair,

9. 'I am just from bed. The sleep is still in my eyes.
10. 'Come. I have had a long dream.'

12. 'And two springs have passed us.'
13. 'Not so far, no, not so far now,
14. There is a place but no one else knows it
15. A field in a valley . . .
16. Qu'ieu sui avinen,
17. Ieu lo sai,'

18. She must speak of the time
19. Of Arnaut de Mareuil, I thought, 'qu'ieu sui avinen.â€™

20. Light as the shadow of the fish
21. That falls through the pale green water.
