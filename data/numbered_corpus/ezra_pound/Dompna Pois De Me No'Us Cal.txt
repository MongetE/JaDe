1. FROM THE PROVENCAL OF EN BERTRANS DE BORN
2. Lady, since you care nothing for me,
3. And since you have shut me away from you
4. Causelessly,
5. I know not wnere to go seeking,
6. For certainly
7. I will never again gather
8. Joy so rich, and if I find not ever
9. A lady with look so speaking
10. To my desire, worth yours whom I have lost,
11. Iâ€™ll have no other love at any cost.

12. And since I could not find a peer to you,
13. Neither one so fair, nor of such heart,
14. So eager and alert,
15. Nor with such art
16. In attire, nor so gay
17. Nor with gift so bountiful and so true,
18. I will go out a-searching,
19. Culling from each a fair trait
20. To make me a borrowed lady
21. Till I again find you ready.

22. Bels Cembelins, I take of you your colour,
23. For it's your own, and your glance
24. Where love is,
25. A proud thing I do here,
26. For, as to colour and eyes
27. I shall have missed nothing at all,
28. Having yours.
29. I ask of Midons Aelis (of Montfort)
30. Her straight speech free-running,
31. That my phantom lack not in cunning,

32. At Chalais of the Viscountess, I would
33. That she give me outright
34. Her two hands and her throat,
35. So take I my road
36. To Rochechouart,
37. Swift-foot to my Lady Anhes,
38. Seeing that Tristan's lady Iseutz had never
39. Such grace of locks, I do ye to wit,
40. Though she'd the far fame for it.

41. Of Audiart at Malemort,
42. Though she with a full heart
43. Wish me ill,
44. I'd have her form that's laced
45. So cunningly,
46. Without blemish, for her love
47. Breaks not nor turns aside.
48. I of Miels-de-ben demand
49. Her straight fresh body,
50. She is so supple and young,
51. Her robes can but do her wrong.

52. Her white teeth, of the Lady Faidita
53. I ask, and the fine courtesy
54. She hath to welcome one,
55. And such replies she lavishes
56. Within her nest;
57. Of Bels Mirals, the rest,
58. Tall stature and gaiety,
59. To make these avail
60. She knoweth well, betide
61. No change nor turning aside.

62. Ah, Bels Senher, Maent, at last
63. I ask naught from you,
64. Save that I have such hunger for
65. This phantom
66. As I've for you, such flame-lap,
67. And yet I'd rather
68. Ask of you than hold another,
69. Mayhap, right close and kissed.
70. Ah, lady, why have you cast
71. Me out, knowing you hold me so fast!
