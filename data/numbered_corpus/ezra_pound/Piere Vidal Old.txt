1. When I but think upon the great dead days
2. And turn my mind upon that splendid madness,
3. Lo! I do curse my strength
4. And blame the sun his gladness;
5. For that the one is dead
6. And the red sun mocks my sadness.

7. Behold me, Vidal, that was fool of fools!
8. Swift as the king wolf was I and as strong
9. When tall stags fled me through the alder brakes,
10. And every jongleur knew me in his song,
11. And the hounds fled and the deer fled
12. And none fled over long.

13. Even the grey pack knew me and knew fear.
14. God! how the swiftest hind's blood spurted hot
15. Over the sharpened teeth and purpling lips!
16. Hot was that hind's blood yet it scorched me not
17. As did first scorn, then lips of the Penautier!
18. Aye ye are fools, if ye think time can blot

19. From Piere Vidalâ€™s remembrance that blue night.
20. God! but the purple of the sky was deep!
21. Clear, deep, translucent, so the stars me seemed
22. Set deep in crystal; and because my sleep
23. Rare visitor came not, the Saints I guerdon
24. For that restlessness Piere set to keep

25. One more fool's vigil with the hollyhocks.
26. Swift came the Loba, as a branch that's caught,
27. Torn, green and silent in the swollen Rhone,
28. Green was her mantle, close, and wrought
29. Of some thin silk stuff that's scarce stuff at all,
30. But like a mist wherethrough her white form fought,

31. And conquered! Ah God! conquered!
32. Silent my mate came as the night was still.
33. Speech? Words? Faugh! Who talks of words and love?!
34. Hot is such love and silent,
35. Silent as fate is, and as strong until
36. It faints in taking and in giving all.

37. Stark, keen, triumphant, till it plays at death.
38. God! she was white then, splendid as some tomb
39. High wrought of marble, and the panting breath
40. Ceased utterly. Well, then I waited, drew,
41. Half-sheathed, then naked from its saffron sheath
42. Drew full this dagger that doth tremble here.

43. Just then she woke and mocked the less keen blade.
44. Ah God, the Loba! and my only mate!
45. Was there such flesh made ever and unmade!
46. God curse the years that turn such women grey!
47. Behold here Vidal, that was hunted, flayed,
48. Shamed and yet bowed not and that won at last.

49. And yet I curse the sun for his red gladness,
50. I that have known strath, garth, brake, dale,
51. And every run-away of the wood through that great
52. madness,
53. Behold me shrivelled as an old oak's trunk
54. And made men's mock'ry in my rotten sadness!

55. No man hath heard the glory of my days:
56. No man hath dared and won his dare as I:
57. One night, one body and one welding flame!
58. What do ye own, ye niggards! that can buy
59. Such glory of the earth? Or who will win
60. Such battle-guerdon with his 'prowesse high' ?

61. O age gone lax! O stunted followers,
62. That mask at passions and desire desires,
63. Behold me shrivelled, and your mock of mocks;
64. And yet I mock you by the mighty fires
65. That burnt me to this ash.

66. Ah! Cabaret! Ah Cabaret, thy hills again!

67. Take your hands off me! . . . [Sniffing the air.
68. Ha! this scent is hot!
