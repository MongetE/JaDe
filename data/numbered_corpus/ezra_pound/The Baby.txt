1. The baby new to earth and sky
2. Has never until now
3. Unto himself the question put
4. Or asked us if the cow

5. Is higher in the mental scale
6. Than men like me and you,
7. Or if the cow refrains from food
8. Till she finds work to do.

9. 'The baby new to earth and sky,'
10. As Tennyson has written,
11. Just goes ahead and sucks a teat
12. Like to-day's great men in Britain.
