1. I can not bow to woo thee
2. With honey words and flower kisses
3. And the dew of sweet half-truths
4. Fallen on the grass of old quaint love-tales
5. Of broidered days foredone.
6. Nor in the murmurous twilight
7. May I sit below thee,
8. Worshiping in whispers
9. Tremulous as far-heard bells.
10. All these things have I known once
11. And passed
12. In that gay youth I had but yester-year.
13. And that is gone
14. As the shadow of wind.
15. Nay, I can not woo thee thus;
16. But as I am ever swept upward
17. To the centre of all truth
18. So must I bear thee with me
19. Rapt into this great involving flame,
20. Calling ever from the midst thereof,
21. "Follow! Follow!"
22. And in the glory of our meeting
23. Shall the power be reborn.
24. And together in the midst of this power
25. Must we, each outstriving each,
26. Cry eternally:
27. "I come, go thou yet further."
28. And again, "Follow,"
29. For we may not tarry.
