1. The very small children in patched clothing,
2. Being smitten with an unusual wisdom,
3. Stopped in their play as she passed them
4. And cried up from their cobbles:

5. Guarda! Ahi, guarda! Ch’ è be’ a!

6. But three years after this
7. I heard the young Dante, whose last name I do not
8. know--
9. For there are, in Sirmione, twenty-eight young Dantes
10. and thirty-four Catulli;
11. And there had been a great catch of sardines,
12. And his elders
13. Were packing them in the great wooden boxes
14. For the market in Brescia, and he
15. Leapt about, snatching at the bright fish
16. And getting in both of their ways;
17. And in vain they commanded him to stafermo!
18. And when they would not let him arrange
19. The fish in the boxes
20. He stroked those which were already arranged,
21. Murmuring for his own satisfaction
22. This identical phrase:

23. Ch’ è be’ a

24. And at this I was mildly abashed.
