1. Hymn to the Dope


2. Goddess of the murmuring courts,
3. Nicotine, my Nicotine,
4. Houri of the mystic sports,
5. trailing-robed in gabardine,
6. Gliding where the breath hath glided,
7. Hidden sylph of filmy veils,
8. Truth behind the dream is veiléd
9. E'en as thou art, smiling ever, ever gliding,
10. Wraith of wraiths, dim lights dividing
11. Purple, grey, and shadow green
12. Goddess, Dream-grace, Nicotine.

13. Goddess of the shadow's lights,
14. Nicotine, my Nicotine,
15. Some would set old Earth to rights,
16. Thou I none such ween.
17. Veils of shade our dream dividing,
18. Houris dancing, intergliding,
19. Wraith of wraiths and dream of faces,
20. Silent guardian of the old unhallowed places,
21. Utter symbol of all old sweet druidings,
22. Mem'ry of witched wold and green,
23. Nicotine, my Nicotine:

24. Neath the shadows of thy weaving
25. Dreams that need no undeceiving,
26. Loves that longer hold me not,
27. Dreams I dream not any more,
28. Fragrance of old sweet forgotten places,
29. Smiles of dream-lit, flit-by faces
30. All as perfume Arab-sweet
31. Deck the high road to thy feet

32. As were Godiva's coming fated
33. And all the April's blush belated
34. Were lain before her, carpeting
35. The stones of Coventry with spring,
36. So thou my mist-enwreathéd queen,
37. Nicotine, white Nicotine,
38. Riding engloried in they hair
39. Mak'st by-road of our dreams
40. Thy thorough-fare.
