1. SCENE: 'En ce bourdel ou tenons nostre estat.'

2. It being remembered that there were six of us with Master Villon, when
3. that expecting presently lo be hanged he writ a ballad whereof ye know:

4. â€˜Freres humains qui apres nous vivez.'

5. Drink ye a skoal for the gallows tree!
6. Francois and Margot and thee and me,
7. Drink we the comrades merrily
8. That said us, 'Till then' for the gallows tree!

9. Fat Pierre with the hook gauche-main,
10. Thomas Larron 'Ear-the-less',
11. Tybalde and that armouress
12. Who gave this poignard its premier stain
13. Pinning the Guise that had been fain
14. To make him a mate of the 'Haulte Noblesse'
15. And bade her be out with ill address
16. As a fool that mocketh his drue's disdeign.

17. Drink we a skoal for the gallows tree!
18. Francois and Margot and thee and me,
19. Drink we to Marienne Ydole,
20. That hell brenn not her o'er cruelly.

21. Drink we the lusty robbers twain,
22. Black is the pitch o' their wedding dress,
23. Lips shrunk back for the wind's caress
24. As lips shrink back when we feel the strain

25. Of love that loveth in hell's disdeign,
26. And sense the teeth through the lips that press
27. 'Gainst our lips for the soul's distress
28. That striveth to ours across the pain.

29. Drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
30. Francois and Margot and thee and me,
31. For Jehan and Raoul de Vallerie
32. Whose frames have the night and its winds in fee.

33. Maturin, Guillaume, Jacques d'Allmain,
34. Culdou lacking a coat to bless
35. One lean moiety of his nakedness
36. That plundered St. Hubert back o' the fane:
37. Aie! the lean bare tree is widowed again
38. For Michault le Borgne that would confess
39. In 'faith and troth' to a traitoress,
40. 'Which of his brothers had he slain?'

41. But drink we skoal to the gallows tree!
42. Francois and Margot and thee and me:

43. These that we loved shall God love less
44. And smite always at their faibleness?

45. Skoal!! to the gallows! and then pray we:
46. God damn his hell out speedily
47. And bring their souls to his 'Haulte Citee'.
