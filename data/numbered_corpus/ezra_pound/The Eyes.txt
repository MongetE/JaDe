1. Rest Master, for we be a-weary, weary
2. And would feel the fingers of the wind
3. Upon these lids that lie over us
4. Sodden and lead-heavy.

5. Rest brother, for lo ! the dawn is without !
6. The yellow flame paleth
7. And the wax runs low.

8. Free us, for without be goodly colours,
9. Green of the wood-moss and flower colours,
10. And coolness beneath the trees.

11. Free us, for we perish
12. In this ever-flowing monotony
13. Of ugly print marks, black
14. Upon white parchment.

15. Free us, for there is one
16. Whose smile more availeth
17. Than all the age-old knowledge of thy books:
18. And we would look thereon.
