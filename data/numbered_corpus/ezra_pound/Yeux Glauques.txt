1. Gladstone was still respected,
2. When John Ruskin produced
3. 'King's Treasuries'; Swinburne
4. And Rossetti still abused.

5. Foetid Buchanan lifted up his voice
6. When that faun's head of hers
7. Became a pastime for
8. Painters and adulterers.

9. The Burne-Jones cartons
10. Have preserved her eyes;
11. Still, at the Tate, they teach
12. Cophetua to rhapsodize;

13. Thin like brook-water,
14. With a vacant gaze.
15. The English Rubaiyat was still-born
16. In those days.

17. The thin, clear gaze, the same
18. Still darts out faun-like from the half-ruin'd face,
19. Questing and passive. . . .
20. ;Ah, poor Jenny's case' . . .

21. Bewildered that a world
22. Shows no surprise
23. At her last maquero's
24. Adulteries.
