1. The light became her grace and dwelt among
2. Blind eyes and shadows that are formed as men;
3. Lo, how the light doth melt us into song:

4. The broken sunlight for a healm she beareth
5. Who hath my heart in jurisdiction.
6. In wild-wood never fawn nor fallow fareth
7. So silent light; no gossamer is spun
8. So delicate as she is, when the sun
9. Drives the clear emeralds from the bended grasses
10. Lest they should parch too swiftly, where she passes.
