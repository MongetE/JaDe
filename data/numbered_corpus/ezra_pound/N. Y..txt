1. My City, my beloved, my white! Ah, slender,
2. Listen! Listen to me, and I will breathe into thee a soul.
3. Delicately upon the reed, attend me!

4. Now do I know that I am mad,
5. For here are a million people surly with traffic;
6. This is no maid.
7. Neither could I play upon any reed if I had one.

8. My City, my beloved,
9. Thou art a maid with no breasts,
10. Thou art slender as a silver reed.
11. Listen to me, attend me!
12. And I will breathe into thee a soul,
13. And thou shalt live for ever.
