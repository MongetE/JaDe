1. O chansons foregoing
2. You were a seven days' wonder.
3. When you came out in the magazines
4. You created considerable stir in Chicago,
5. And now you are stale and worn out,
6. You're a very depleted fashion,
7. A hoop-skirt, a calash,
8. An homely, transient antiquity.
9. Only emotion remains.
10. Your emotions?
11. Are those of a maitre-de-cafe.
