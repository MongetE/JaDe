1. For three years, out of key with his time,
2. He strove to resuscitate the dead art
3. Of poetry; to maintain "the sublime"
4. In the old scene.Wrong from the start--

5. No, hardly, but seeing he had been born
6. In a half-savage country, out of date;
7. Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn;
8. Capaneus; trout for factitious bait;

9. [idmen gar toi pant, hos eni Troiei]
10. Caught in the unstopped ear;
11. Giving the rocks small lee-way
12. The chopped seas held him, therefore, that year.

13. His true Penelope was Flaubert,
14. He fished by obstinate isles;
15. Observed the elegance of Circe's hair
16. Rather than the mottoes on sun-dials.

17. Unaffected by "the march of events,"
18. He passed from men's memory in l'an trentuniesme
19. De son eage; the case presents
20. No adjunct to the Muses' diadem.
