1. Thou keep'st thy rose-leaf
2. Till the rose-time will be over,
3. Think'st thou that Death will kiss thee?
4. Think'st thou that the Dark House
5. Will find thee such a lover
6. As I? Will the new roses miss thee?

7. Prefer my cloak unto the cloak of dust
8. 'Neath which the last year lies,
9. For thou shouldst more mistrust
10. Time than my eyes.
