1. O thou newcomer who seek’st Rome in Rome
2. And find’st in Rome no thing thou canst call Roman;
3. Arches worn old and palaces made common
4. Rome’s name alone within these walls keeps home.

5. Behold how pride and ruin can befall
6. One who hath set the whole world ’neath her laws,
7. All-conquering, now conquered, because
8. She is Time’s prey, and Time conquereth all.

9. Rome that art Rome’s one sole last monument,
10. Rome that alone hast conquered Rome the town,
11. Tiber alone, transient and seaward bent,

12. Remains of Rome. O world, thou unconstant mime!
13. That which stands firm in thee Time batters down,
14. And that which fleeteth doth outrun swift Time.
