1. Vex not thou the banker's mind
2. (His what?) with a show of sense,
3. Vex it not, Willie, his mind,
4. Or pierce its pretence
5. On the supposition that it ever
6. Was other, or that this cheerful giver
7. Will give, save to the blind.

8. Come not anear the dark-browed sophist
9. Who on the so well-paid ground
10. Will cheerfully tell you a fist is no fist,
11. Come not here
12. With 2 and 2 making 4 in reason,
13. Knowest thou not the truth is never in season
14. In these quarters or Fleet St.?

15. In his eye there is death, I mean the banker's,
16. In his purse there is deceit,
17. It is he who buys gold-braid for the swankers
18. And gives you Australian iced rabbits' meat
19. In place of the roast beef of Britain,
20. And leaves you a park bench to sit on
21. If you git off the Embankment.

22. This is the kind of tone and Solemnity
23. That used to be used on the young,
24. My old man got no indemnity
25. But he swaller'd his tongue.
26. Like all his class was told to hold it in those days,
27. To mind their ‘p’s’ and their ‘q’s’ and their ways
28. An' be thankful for occasional holidays.

29. I don't quite see the joke any more,
30. Or why we should stand to attention
31. And lick the dirt off the floor
32. In the hope of honourable mention
33. From a great employer like Selfridge
34. Or a buyer of space in the papers.
35. I'm getting too old for such capers.
