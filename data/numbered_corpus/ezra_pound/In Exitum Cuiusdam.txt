1. On a certain one's departure

2. ‘Time's bitter flood'! Oh, that's all very well,
3. But where's the old friend hasn't fallen off,
4. Or slacked his hand-grip when you first gripped fame?
5. I know your circle and can fairly tell
6. What you have kept and what you’ve left behind:
7. I know my circle and know very well
8. How many faces I'd have out of mind.
