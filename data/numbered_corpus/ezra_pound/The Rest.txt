1. O helpless few in my country, remnant enslaved!

2. Artists broken against her,
3. A-stray, lost in the villages,
4. Mistrusted, spoken-against,

5. Lovers of beauty, starved,
6. Thwarted with systems,
7. Helpless against the control;

8. You who can not wear yourselves out
9. By persisting to successes,
10. You who can only speak,
11. Who can not steel yourselves into reiteration;

12. You of the finer sense,
13. Broken against false knowledge,
14. You who can know at first hand,
15. Hated, shut in, mistrusted:

16. Take thought:
17. I have weathered the storm,
18. I have beaten out my exile.
