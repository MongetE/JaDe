1. En robe de parade. Samain

2. Like a skein of loose silk blown against a wall
3. She walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens,
4. And she is dying piece-meal
5. Tof a sort of emotional anaemia.

6. And round about there is a rabble
7. Of the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor.
8. They shall inherit the earth.

9. In her is the end of breeding.
10. Her boredom is exquisite and excessive.
11. She would like some one to speak to her,
12. And is almost afraid that I
13. Twill commit that indiscretion.
