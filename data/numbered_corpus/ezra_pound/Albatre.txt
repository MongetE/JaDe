1. This lady in the white bath-robe which she calls a
2. peignoir,
3. Is, for the time being, the mistress of my friend,
4. And the delicate white feet of her little white dog
5. Are not more delicate than she is,
6. Nor would Gautier himself have despised their contrasts
7. in whiteness
8. As she sits in the great chair
9. Between the two indolent candles.
