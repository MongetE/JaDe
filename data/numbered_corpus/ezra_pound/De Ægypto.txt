1. I even I, am he who knoweth the roads
2. Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body.
3. I have beheld the Lady of Life,
4. I, even I, who fly with the swallows.

5. Green and gray is her raiment,
6. Trailing along the wind.

7. I, even I, am he who knoweth the roads
8. Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body.
9. Manus animam pinxit,
10. My pen is in my hand

11. To write the acceptable word. . . .
12. My mouth to chant the pure singing!

13. Who hath the mouth to receive it,
14. The song of the Lotus of Kumi?

15. I, even I, am he who knoweth the roads
16. Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body.
17. I am flame that riseth in the sun,
18. I, even I, who fly with the swallows.

19. The moon is upon my forehead,
20. The winds are under my lips.

21. The moon is a great pearl in the waters of sapphire,
22. Cool to my fingers the flowing waters.

23. I, even I, am he who knoweth the roads
24. Through the sky, and the wind thereof is my body.
