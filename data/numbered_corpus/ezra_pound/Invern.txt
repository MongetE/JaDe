1. Earth's winter cometh
2. And I being part of all
3. And sith the spirit of all moveth in me
4. I must needs bear earth's winter
5. Drawn cold and grey with hours
6. And joying in a momentary sun,
7. Lo I am withered with waiting till my spring cometh!
8. Or crouch covetous of warmth
9. O'er scant-logged ingle blaze,
10. Must take cramped joy in tomed Longinus
11. That, read I him first time
12. The woods agleam with summer
13. Or mid desirous winds of spring,
14. Had set me singing spheres
15. Or made heart to wander forth among warm roses
16. Or curl in grass next neath a kindly moon.
