1. An image of Lethe,
2. and the fields
3. Full of faint light
4. but golden,
5. Gray cliffs,
6. and beneath them

7. A sea
8. Harsher than granite,
9. unstill, never ceasing;
10. High forms
11. with the movement of gods,
12. Perilous aspect;
13. And one said:
14. 'This is Actaeon.'
15. Actaeon of golden greaves!
16. Over fair meadows,
17. Over the cool face of that field,
18. Unstill, ever moving
19. Hosts of an ancient people,
20. The silent cort√®ge.
