1. Good God! They say you are risqu√©,
2. O canzonetti!
3. We who went out into the four A. M. of the world
4. Composing our albas,
5. We who shook off our dew with the rabbits,
6. We who have seen even Artemis a-binding her sandals,
7. Have we ever heard the like?
8. O mountains of Hellas!!
9. Gather about me, O Muses!
10. When we sat upon the granite brink in Helicon
11. Clothed in the tattered sunlight,
12. Muses with delicate shins,
13. O Muses with delectable knee-joints,
14. When we splashed and were splashed with
15. The lucid Castalian spray,
16. Had we ever such an epithet cast upon us!!
