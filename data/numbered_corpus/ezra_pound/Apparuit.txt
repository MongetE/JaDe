1. Golden rose the house, in the portal I saw
2. thee, a marvel, carven in subtle stuff, a
3. portent. Life died down in the lamp and flickered,
4. caught at the wonder.

5. Crimson, frosty with dew, the roses bend where
6. thou afar, moving in the glamorous sun,
7. drinkst in life of earth, of the air, the tissue
8. golden about thee.

9. Green the ways, the breath of the fields is thine there,
10. open lies the land, yet the steely going
11. darkly hast thou dared and the dreaded aether
12. parted before thee.

13. Swift at courage thou in the shell of gold, casting
14. a-loose the cloak of the body, earnest
15. straight, then shone thine oriel and the stunned light
16. faded about thee.

17. Half the graven shoulder, the throat aflash with
18. strands of light inwoven about it, loveliest
19. of all things, frail alabaster, ah me!
20. swift in departing.

21. Clothed in goldish weft, delicately perfect,
22. gone as wind ! The cloth of the magical hands!
23. Thou a slight thing, thou in access of cunning
24. dar'dst to assume this?
