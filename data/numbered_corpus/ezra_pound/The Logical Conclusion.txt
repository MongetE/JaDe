1. When earth's last thesis is copied
2. From the theses that went before,
3. When idea from fact has departed
4. And bare-boned factlets shall bore,
5. When all joy shall have fled from study
6. And scholarship reign supreme;
7. When truth shall 'baaa' on the hill crests
8. And no one shall dare to dream;

9. When all the good poems have been buried
10. With comment annoted in full
11. And art shall bow down in homage
12. To scholarship's zinc-plated bull,
13. When there shall be nothing to research
14. But the notes of annoted notes,
15. And Baalam's ass shall inquire
16. The price of imported oats;

17. Then no one shall tell him the answer
18. For each shall know the one fact
19. That lies in the special ass-ignment
20. From which he is making his tract.
21. So the ass shall sigh uninstructed
22. While each in his separate book
23. Shall grind for the love of grinding
24. And only the devil shall look.


25. Against the 'germanic' system of graduate study and insane specialization in the Inanities.
