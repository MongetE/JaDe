1. You came in out of the night
2. And there were flowers in your hand,
3. Now you will come out of a confusion of people,
4. Out of a turmoil of speech about you.

5. I who have seen you amid the primal things
6. Was angry when they spoke your name
7. IN ordinary places.
8. I would that the cool waves might flow over my mind,
9. And that the world should dry as a dead leaf,
10. Or as a dandelion see-pod and be swept away,
11. So that I might find you again,
12. Alone.
