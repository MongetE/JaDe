1. At the table beyond us
2. With her little suede slippers off,
3. With her white-stocking'd feet
4. Carefully kept from the floor by a napkin,
5. She converses:

6. 'Connaissez-vous Ostende?'

7. The gurgling Italian lady on the other side of the
8. restaurant
9. Replies with a certain hauteur,
10. But I await with patience,
11. To see how Celestine will re-enter her slippers.
12. She re-enters them with a groan.
