1. In vain have I striven,
2. to teach my heart to bow;
3. In vain have I said to him
4. 'There be many singers greater than thou'.

5. But his answer cometh, as winds and as lutany,
6. As a vague crying upon the night
7. That leaveth me no rest, saying ever,
8. 'Song, a song.'
9. Their echoes play upon each other in the twilight
10. Seeking ever a song.
11. Lo, I am worn with travail
12. And the wandering of many roads hath made my eyes
13. As dark red circles filled with dust.
14. Yet there is a trembling upon me in the twilight,
15. And little red elf words crying, ‘A song',
16. Little grey elf words crying for a song,
17. Little brown leaf words crying, ‘A song',
18. Little green leaf words crying for a song.
19. The words are as leaves, old brown leaves in the spring time
20. Blowing they know not whither, seeking a song.

21. White words as snow flakes but they are cold,
22. Moss words, lip words, words of slow streams.

23. In vain have I striven
24. to teach my soul to bow,
25. In vain have I pled with him:
26. 'There be greater souls than thou.'

27. For in the morn of my years there came a woman
28. As moonlight calling,
29. As the moon calleth the tides,
30. 'Song, a song.'

31. Wherefore I made her a song and she went from me
32. As the moon doth from the sea,
33. But still came the leaf words, little brown elf words
34. Stying 'The soul sendeth us'.
35. 'A song, a song!'
36. And in vain I cried unto them ‘I have no song
37. For she I sang of hath gone from me'.

38. But my soul sent a woman, a woman of the wonder-folk,
39. A woman as fire upon the pine woods
40. crying 'Song, a song'.
41. As the flame crieth unto the sap.
42. My song was ablaze with her and she went from me
43. As flame leaveth the embers so went she unto new forests '
44. And the words were with me
45. crying ever. 'Song, a song'.

46. And I 'I have no song',
47. Till my soul sent a woman as the sun:
48. Yea as the sun calleth to the seed,
49. As the spring upon the bough
50. So is she that cometh, the mother of songs,
51. She that holdeth the wonder words within her eyes
52. The words, little elf words
53. that call ever unto me,
54. 'Song, a song'.

55. In vain have I striven with my soul
56. to teach my soul to bow.
57. What soul boweth
58. while in his heart art thou?
