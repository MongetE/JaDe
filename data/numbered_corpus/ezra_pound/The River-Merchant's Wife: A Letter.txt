1. After Li Po

2. While my hair was still cut straight
3. across my forehead
4. I played at the front gate, pulling
5. flowers.
6. You came by on bamboo stilts, playing
7. horse,
8. You walked about my seat, playing with
9. blue plums.
10. And we went on living in the village of
11. Chokan:
12. Two small people, without dislike or
13. suspicion.

14. At fourteen I married My Lord you.
15. I never laughed, being bashful.
16. Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
17. Called to, a thousand times, I never
18. looked back.

19. At fifteen I stopped scowling,
20. I desired my dust to be mingled with
21. yours
22. Forever and forever and forever.
23. Why should I climb the lookout?

24. At sixteen you departed,
25. You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river
26. of swirling eddies,
27. And you have been gone five months.
28. The monkeys make sorrowful noise
29. overhead.

30. You dragged your feet when you went
31. out,
32. By the gate now, the moss is grown,
33. the different mosses,
34. Too deep to clear them away!
35. The leaves fall early this autumn, in
36. wind.
37. The paired butterflies are already
38. yellow with August
39. Over the grass in the West garden;
40. They hurt me.  I grow older.
41. If you are coming down through the
42. narrows of the river Kiang,
43. Please let me know beforehand,
44. And I will come out to meet you
45. As far as Cho-fu-sa.
