1. They say the roads of Sanso are steep,
2. Sheer as the mountains.
3. The walls rise in a man's face,
4. Clouds grow out of the hill
5. at his horse's bridle.
6. Sweet trees are on the paved way of the Shin,
7. Their trunks burst through the paving,
8. And freshets are bursting their ice
9. in the midst of Shoku, a proud city.
10. Men's fates are already set,
11. There is no need of asking diviners.
