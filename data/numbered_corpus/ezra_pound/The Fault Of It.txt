1. Some may have blamed us that we cease to speak
2. Of things we spoke of in our verses early,
3. Saying: a lovely voice is such as such;
4. Saying: that lady's eyes were sad last week,
5. Wherein the world's whole joy is born and dies;
6. Saying: she hath this way or that, this much
7. Of grace, this way or that, this much
8. Of grace, this little misericorde;
9. Ask us no further word;
10. If we were proud, then proud to be so wise
11. Ask us no more of all the things ye heard;
12. We may not speak of them, they touch us nearly.
