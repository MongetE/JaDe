2. Go also to the nerve-racked, go to the enslaved-by-convention,
3. Bear to them my contempt for their oppressors.
4. Go as a great wave of cool water,
5. Bear my contempt of oppressors.

6. Speak against unconscious oppression,
7. Speak against the tyranny of the unimaginative,
8. Speak against bonds.

10. Go to the women in suburbs.
11. Go to the hideously wedded,
12. Go to them whose failure is concealed,
13. Go to the unluckily mated,
14. Go to the bought wife,
15. Go to the woman entailed.

16. Go to those who have delicate lust,
17. Go to those whose delicate desires are thwarted,
18. Go like a blight upon the dulness of the world;
19. Go with your edge against this,
20. Strengthen the subtle cords,
21. Bring confidence upon the algae and the tentacles of the soul.

27. To those who have lost their interest.

28. Go to the adolescent who are smothered in family-
29. Oh how hideous it is
30. To see three generations of one house gathered together!
31. It is like an old tree with shoots,
32. And with some branches rotted and falling.

33. Go out and defy opinion,
34. Go against this vegetable bondage of the blood.
35. Be against all sorts of mortmain.
