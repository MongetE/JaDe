1. When I am old
2. I will not have you look apart
3. From me, into the cold,
4. Friend of my heart,
5. Nor be sad in your remembrance
6. Of the careless, mad-heart semblance
7. That the wind hath blown away
8. When I am old.

9. When I am old
10. And the white hot wonder-fire
11. Unto the world seem cold,
12. My soul's desire
13. Know you then that all life's shower,
14. The rain of the years, that hour
15. Shall make blow for us one flower,
16. Including all, when we are old.

17. When I am old
18. If you remember
19. Any love save what is then
20. Hearth light unto life's December
21. Be your joy of past sweet chalices
22. To know then naught but this
23. "How many wonders are less sweet
24. Than love I bear to thee
25. When I am old."
