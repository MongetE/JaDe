1. How have I laboured?
2. How have I not laboured
3. To bring her soul to birth,
4. To give these elements a name and a centre!
5. She is beautiful as the sunlight, and as fluid.
6. She has no name, and no place.
7. How have I laboured to bring her soul into separation;
8. To give her a name and her being!

9. Surely you are bound and entwined,
10. You are mingled with the elements unborn;
11. I have loved a stream and a shadow.
12. I beseech you enter your life.
13. I beseech you learn to say ‘I’
14. When I question you;
15. For you are no part, but a whole,
16. No portion, but a being.
