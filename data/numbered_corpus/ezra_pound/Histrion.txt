1. No man hath dared to write this thing as yet,
2. And yet I know, how that the souls of all men great
3. At times pass athrough us,
4. And we are melted into them, and are not
5. Save reflexions of their souls.
6. Thus am I Dante for a space and am
7. One Francois Villon, ballad-lord and thief,
8. Or am such holy ones I may not write
9. Lest blasphemy be writ against my name;
10. This for an instant and the flame is gone.

11. 'Tis as in midmost us there glows a sphere
12. Translucent, molten gold, that is the "I"
13. And into this some form projects itself:
14. Christus, or John, or eke the Florentine;
15. And as the clear space is not if a form's
16. Imposed thereon,
17. So cease we from all being for the time,
18. And these, the Masters of the Soul, live on.
