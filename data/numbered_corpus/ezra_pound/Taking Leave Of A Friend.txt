1. Blue mountains to the north of the walls,
2. White river winding about them;
3. Here we must make separation
4. And go out through a thousand miles of dead grass.

5. Mind like a floating wide cloud,
6. Sunset like the parting of old acquaintances
7. Who bow over their clasped hands at a distance.
8. Our horses neigh to each others
9. as we are departing.
