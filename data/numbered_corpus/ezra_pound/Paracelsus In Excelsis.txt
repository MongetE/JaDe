1. â€˜Being no longer human, why should I
2. Pretend humanity or don the frail attire?
3. Men have I known and men, but never one
4. Was grown so free an essence, or become
5. So simply element as what I am.
6. The mist goes from the mirror and I see.
7. Behold! the world of forms is swept beneath-
8. Turmoil grown visible beneath our peace,
9. And we that are grown formless, rise above-
10. Fluids intangible that have been men,
11. We seem as statues round whose high-risen base
12. Some overflowing river is run mad,
13. In us alone the element of calm.'
