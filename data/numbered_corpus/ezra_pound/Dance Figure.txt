1. For the Marriage in Cana of Galilee

2. Dark-eyed,
3. O woman of my dreams,
4. Ivory sandalled,
5. There is none like thee among the dancers,
6. None with swift feet.I have not found thee in the tents,
7. In the broken darkness.
8. I have not found thee at the well-head
9. Among the women with pitchers.
10. Thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark;
11. Thy face as a river with lights.

12. White as an almond are thy shoulders;
13. As new almonds stripped from the husk.
14. They guard thee not with eunuchs;
15. Not with bars of copper.

16. Gilt turquoise and silver are in the place of thy rest.
17. A brown robe, with threads of gold woven in
18. patterns, hast thou gathered about thee,
19. O Nathat-Ikanaie, 'Tree-at-the-river'.

20. As a rillet among the sedge are thy hands upon me;
21. Thy fingers a frosted stream.

22. Thy maidens are white like pebbles;
23. Their music about thee!

24. There is none like thee among the dancers;
25. None with swift feet.
