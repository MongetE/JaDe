1. Lord God of heaven that with mercy dight
2. Th'alternate prayer wheel of the night and light
3. Eternal hath to thee, and in whose sight
4. Our days as rain drops in the sea surge fall,

5. As bright white drops upon a leaden sea
6. Grant so my songs to this grey folk may be:

7. As drops that dream and gleam and falling catch the sun
8. Evan'scent mirrors every opal one
9. Of such his splendor as their compass is,
10. So, bold My Songs, seek ye such death as this.
