1. I stood still and was a tree amid the wood,
2. Knowing the truth of things unseen before;
3. Of Daphne and the laurel bow
4. And that god-feasting couple old
5. that grew elm-oak amid the wold.
6. 'Twas not until the gods had been
7. Kindly entreated, and been brought within
8. Unto the hearth of their heart's home
9. That they might do this wonder thing;
10. Nathless I have been a tree amid the wood
11. And many a new thing understood
12. That was rank folly to my head before.
