1. All night, and as the wind lieth among
2. The cypress trees, he lay,
3. Nor held me save as air that brusheth by one
4. Close, and as the petals of flowers in falling
5. Waver and seem not drawn to earth, so he
6. Seemed over me to hover light as leaves
7. And closer me than air,
8. And music flowing through me seemed to open
9. Mine eyes upon new colours.
10. O winds, what wind can match the weight of him!
