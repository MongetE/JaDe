1. Blue, blue is the grass about the river
2. And the willows have overfilled the close garden.
3. And within, the mistress, in the midmost of her youth.
4. White, white of face, hesitates, passing the door.
5. Slender, she puts forth a slender hand;

6. And she was a courtezan in the old days,
7. And she has married a sot,
8. Who now goes drunkenly out
9. And leaves her too much alone.
