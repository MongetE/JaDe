1. There is a truce among the gods,
2. Kore is seen in the North
3. Skirting the blue-gray sea
4. In gilded and russet mantle.
5. The corn has again it's mother and she, Leuconoe,
6. That failed never women,
7. Fails not the earth now.

8. The tricksome Hermes is here;
9. He moves behind me
10. Eager to catch my words,
11. Eager to spread them with rumour;
12. To set upon them his change
13. Crafty and subtle;
14. To alter them to his purpose;
15. But do thou speak true, even to the letter:

16. ‘Once more in Delos, once more is the altar a-quiver.
17. Once more is the chant heard.
18. Once more are the never abandoned gardens
19. Full of gossip and old tales.’
