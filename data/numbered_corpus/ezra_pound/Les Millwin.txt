1. The little Millwins attend the Russian Ballet.
2. The mauve and greenish souls of the little Millwins
3. Were seen lying along the upper seats
4. Like so many unused boas.

5. The turbulent and undisciplined host of art students-
6. The rigorous deputation from ‘Slade’-
7. Was before them.

8. With arms exalted, with fore-arms
9. Crossed in great futuristic X's, the art students
10. Exulted, they beheld the splendours of Cleopatra

11. And the little Millwins beheld these things;
12. With their large and anaemic eyes they looked out upon
13. this configuration.

14. Let us therefore mention the fact,
15. For it seems to us worthy of record.
