1. Luini in porcelain!
2. The grand piano
3. Utters a profane
4. Protest with her clear soprano.

5. The sleek head emerges
6. From the gold-yellow frock
7. As Anadyomene in the opening
8. Pages of Reinach.

9. Honey-red, closing the face-oval,
10. A basket-work of braids which seem as if they were
11. Spun in King Minos' hall
12. From metal, or intractable amber;

13. The face-oval beneath the glaze,
14. Bright in its suave bounding-line, as,
15. Beneath half-watt rays,
16. The eyes turn topaz.
