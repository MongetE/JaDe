1. Aye! I am a poet and upon my tomb
2. Shall maidens scatter rose leaves
3. And men myrtles, ere the night
4. Slays day with her dark sword.

5. 'Lo ! this thing is not mine
6. Nor thine to hinder,
7. For the custom is full old,
8. And here in Nineveh have I beheld
9. Many a singer pass and take his place
10. In those dim halls where no man troubleth
11. His sleep or song.
12. And many a one hath sung his songs
13. More craftily, more subtle-souled than I;
14. And many a one now doth surpass
15. My wave-worn beauty with his wind of flowers,
16. Yet am I poet, and upon my tomb
17. Shall all men scatter rose leaves
18. Ere the night slay light
19. With her blue sword.

20. ‘It is not, Raana, that my song rings highest
21. Or more sweet in tone than any, but that I
22. Am here a Poet, that doth drink of life
23. As lesser men drink wine.’
