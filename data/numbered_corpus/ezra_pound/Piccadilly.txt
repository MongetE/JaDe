1. Beautiful, tragical facesâ€”
2. Ye that were whole, and are so sunken;
3. And, O ye vile, ye that might have been loved,
4. That are so sodden and drunken,
5. Who hath forgotten you?
6. O wistful, fragile faces, few out of many!

7. The crass, the coarse, the brazen,
8. God knows I cannot pity them, perhaps, as I should do;
9. But oh, ye delicate, wistful faces,
10. Who hath forgotten you?
