1. My name is Nunty Cormorant
2. And my finance is sound,
3. I lend you Englishmen hot air
4. At one and three the pound.

5. I lend you Englishmen hot air
6. And I get all the beef
7. While you stalwart sheep of freedom
8. Are on the poor relief.

9. Wot oh! my buxom hearties,
10. What ain't got work no more
11. And don't know what bug is a-bitin'
12. To keep your feelin's sore,

13. There is blokes in automobiles
14. And their necks sunk into fur
15. That keep on gettin' usury
16. To make 'em cosier.

17. I read these fellers puts it
18. Most tidily away
19. And then lends out their printed slips
20. To keep the wolf away

21. From the vaults and combination
22. Safes in Thread and Needle street.
23. I wouldn't 'ave the needle
24. If I had more grub to eat.

25. Oh the needle is your portion,
26. My sufferin' fellow men,
27. Till the King shall take the notion
28. To own his coin again.
