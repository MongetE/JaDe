1. FROM â€˜DIE HEIMKEHR'

2. I
3. Is your hate, then, of such measure?
4. Do you, truly, so detest me?
5. Through all the world will I complain
6. Of how you have addressed me.

7. O ye lips that are ungrateful,
8. Hath it never once distressed you,
9. That you can say such awful things
10. Of any one who ever kissed you?


11. II
12. So thou hast forgotten fully
13. That I so long held thy heart wholly,
14. Thy little heart, so sweet and false and small
15. That there's no thing more sweet or false at all.

16. Love and lay thou hast forgotten fully,
17. And my heart worked at them unduly.
18. I know not if the love or if the lay were better stuff,
19. But I know now, they both were good enough.


20. III
21. Tell me where thy lovely love is,
22. Whom thou once did sing so sweetly,
23. When the fairy flames enshrouded
24. Thee, and held thy heart completely.

25. All the flames are dead and sped now
26. And my heart is cold and sere;
27. Behold this book, the urn of ashes,
28. Tis my true love's sepulchre.


29. IV
30. I dreamt that I was God Himself
31. Whom heavenly joy immerses,
32. And all the angels sat about
33. And praised my verses.


34. V
35. The mutilated choir boys
36. When I begin to sing
37. Complain about the awful noise
38. And call my voice too thick a thing.

39. When light their voices lift them up,
40. Bright notes against the ear,
41. Through trills and runs like crystal,
42. Ring delicate and clear.

43. They sing of Love that's grown desirous,
44. Of Love, and joy that is Love's inmost part,
45. And all the ladies swim through tears
46. Toward such a work of art.


47. VI
48. This delightful young man
49. Should not lack for honourers,
50. He propitiates me with oysters,
51. With Rhine wine and liqueurs.

52. How his coat and pants adorn him!
53. Yet his ties are more adorning,
54. In these he daily comes to ask me:
55. 'Are you feeling well this morning?'

56. He speaks of my extended fame,
57. My wit, charm, definitions,
58. And is diligent to serve me,
59. Is detailed in his provisions.

60. In evening company he sets his face
61. In most spirituel positions,
62. And declaims before the ladies
63. My god-like compositions.

64. what comfort is it for me
65. To find him such, when the days bring
66. No comfort, at my time of life when
67. All good things go vanishing.


68. TRANSLATOR TO TRANSLATED
69. O Harry Heine, curses be,
70. I live too late to sup with thee!
71. Who can demolish at such polished ease
72. Philistia's pomp and Art's pomposities!


73. VII
74. SONG FROM 'DIE HARZREISE'
75. I am the Princess Ilza
76. In Ilsenstein I fare,
77. Come with me to that castle
78. And we'll be happy there.

79. Thy head will I cover over
80. With my waves' clarity
81. Till thou forget thy sorrow,
82. wounded sorrowfully.

83. Thou wilt in my white arms then
84. Nay, on my breast thou must
85. Forget and rest and dream there
86. For thine old legend-lust.

87. My lips and my heart are thine there
88. As they were his and mine.
89. His? Why the good King Harry's,
90. And he is dead lang syne.

91. Dead men stay alway dead men.
92. Life is the live man's part,
93. And I am fair and golden
94. With joy breathless at heart.

95. If my heart stay below there,
96. My crystal halls ring clear
97. To the dance of lords and ladies
98. In all their splendid gear.

99. The silken trains go rustling,
100. The spur-clinks sound between,
101. The dark dwarfs blow and bow there
102. Small horn and violin.

103. Yet shall my white arms hold thee,
104. That bound King Harry about.
105. Ah, I covered his ears with them
106. When the trumpet rang out.


107. VIII
108. NIGHT SONG
109. And have you thoroughly kissed my lips;
110. There was no particular haste,
111. And are you not ready when evening's come?
112. There's no particular haste.

113. You've got the whole night before you,
114. Heart's-all-beloved-my-own;
115. In an uninterrupted night one can
116. Get a good deal of kissing done.
