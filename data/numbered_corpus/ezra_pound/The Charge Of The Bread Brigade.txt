1. Half a loaf, half a loaf,
2. Half a loaf? Urn-hum?
3. Down through the vale of gloom
4. Slouched the ten million,
5. Onward th' 'ungry blokes,
6. Crackin' their smutty jokes!
7. We'll send 'em mouchin' 'ome,
8. Damn the ten million!

9. There goes the night brigade,
10. They got no steady trade,
11. Several old so'jers know
12. Monty has blunder'd.
13. Theirs not to reason why,
14. Theirs but to buy the pie,
15. Slouching and mouching,
16. Lousy ten million!

17. Plenty to right of 'em,
18. Plenty to left of 'em,
19. Yes, wot is left of 'em,
20. Damn the ten million.
21. Stormed at by press and all,
22. How shall we dress 'em all?
23. Glooming and mouching!

24. See 'em go slouching there,
25. With cowed and crouching air
26. Dundering dullards!
27. How the whole nation shook
28. While Milord Beaverbrook
29. Fed 'em with hogwash!
