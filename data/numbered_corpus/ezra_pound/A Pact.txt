1. I make a pact with you, Walt Whitman -
2. I have detested you long enough.
3. I come to you as a grown child
4. Who has had a pig-headed father;
5. I am old enough now to make friends.
6. It was you that broke the new wood,
7. Now is a time for carving.
8. We have one sap and one root -
9. Let there be commerce between us.
