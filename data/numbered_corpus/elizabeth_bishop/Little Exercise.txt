1. For Thomas Edwards Wanning


2. Think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily
3. like a dog looking for a place to sleep in,
4. listen to it growling.

5. Think how they must look now, the mangrove keys
6. lying out there unresponsive to the lightning
7. in dark, coarse-fibred families,

8. where occasionally a heron may undo his head,
9. shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment
10. when the surrounding water shines.

11. Think of the boulevard and the little palm trees
12. all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed
13. as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons.

14. It is raining there. The boulevard
15. and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack,
16. are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened.

17. Now the storm goes away again in a series
18. of small, badly lit battle-scenes,
19. each in "Another part of the field."

20. Think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat
21. tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge;
22. think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed.
