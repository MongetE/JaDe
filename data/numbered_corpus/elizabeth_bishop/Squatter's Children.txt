1. On the unbreathing sides of hills
2. they play, a specklike girl and boy,
3. alone, but near a specklike house.
4. The Sun's suspended eye
5. blinks casually, and then they wade
6. gigantic waves of light and shade.
7. A dancing yellow spot, a pup,
8. attends them. Clouds are piling up;

9. a storm piles up behind the house.
10. The children play at digging holes.
11. The ground is hard; they try to use
12. one of their father's tools,
13. a mattock with a broken haft
14. the two of them can scarcely lift.
15. It drops and clangs. Their laughter spreads
16. effulgence in the thunderheads,

17. Weak flashes of inquiry
18. direct as is the puppy's bark.
19. But to their little, soluble,
20. unwarrantable ark,
21. apparently the rain's reply
22. consists of echolalia,
23. and Mother's voice, ugly as sin,
24. keeps calling to them to come in.

25. Children, the threshold of the storm
26. has slid beneath your muddy shoes;
27. wet and beguiled, you stand among
28. the mansions you may choose
29. out of a bigger house than yours,
30. whose lawfulness endures.
31. It's soggy documents retain
32. your rights in rooms of falling rain.
