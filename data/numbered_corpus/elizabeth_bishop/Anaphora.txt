1. Each day with so much ceremony
2. begins, with birds, with bells,
3. with whistles from a factory;
4. such white-gold skies our eyes
5. first open on, such brilliant walls
6. that for a moment we wonder
7. 'Where is the music coming from, the energy?
8. The day was meant for what ineffable creature
9. we must have missed? ' Oh promptly he
10. appears and takes his earthly nature
11. instantly, instantly falls
12. victim of long intrigue,
13. assuming memory and mortal
14. mortal fatigue.

15. More slowly falling into sight
16. and showering into stippled faces,
17. darkening, condensing all his light;
18. in spite of all the dreaming
19. squandered upon him with that look,
20. suffers our uses and abuses,
21. sinks through the drift of bodies,
22. sinks through the drift of classes
23. to evening to the beggar in the park
24. who, weary, without lamp or book
25. prepares stupendous studies:
26. the fiery event
27. of every day in endless
28. endless assent.
