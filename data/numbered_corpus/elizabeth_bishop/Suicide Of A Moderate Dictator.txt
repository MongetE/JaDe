1. This is a day when truths will out, perhaps;
2. leak from the dangling telephone earphones
3. sapping the festooned switchboards' strength;
4. fall from the windows, blow from off the sills,
5. â€”the vague, slight unremarkable contents
6. of emptying ash-trays; rub off on our fingers
7. like ink from the un-proof-read newspapers,
8. crocking the way the unfocused photographs
9. of crooked faces do that soil our coats,
10. our tropical-weight coats, like slapped-at moths.

11. Today's a day when those who work
12. are idling. Those who played must work
13. and hurry, too, to get it done,
14. with little dignity or none.
15. The newspapers are sold; the kiosk shutters
16. crash down. But anyway, in the night
17. the headlines wrote themselves, see, on the streets
18. and sidewalks everywhere; a sediment's splashed
19. even to the first floors of apartment houses.

20. This is a day that's beautiful as well,
21. and warm and clear. At seven o'clock I saw
22. the dogs being walked along the famous beach
23. as usual, in a shiny gray-green dawn,
24. leaving their paw prints draining in the wet.
25. The line of breakers was steady and the pinkish,
26. segmented rainbow steadily hung above it.
27. At eight two little boys were flying kites.
