1. The roaring alongside he takes for granted,
2. and that every so often the world is bound to shake.
3. He runs, he runs to the south, finical, awkward,
4. in a state of controlled panic, a student of Blake.

5. The beach hisses like fat. On his left, a sheet
6. of interrupting water comes and goes
7. and glazes over his dark and brittle feet.
8. He runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes.

9. - Watching, rather, the spaces of sand between them
10. where (no detail too small) the Atlantic drains
11. rapidly backwards and downwards. As he runs,
12. he stares at the dragging grains.

13. The world is a mist. And then the world is
14. minute and vast and clear. The tide
15. is higher or lower. He couldn't tell you which.
16. His beak is focussed; he is preoccupied,

17. looking for something, something, something.
18. Poor bird, he is obsessed!
19. The millions of grains are black, white, tan, and gray
20. mixed with quartz grains, rose and amethyst.
