1. Hidden, oh hidden
2. in the high fog
3. the house we live in,
4. beneath the magnetic rock,
5. rain-, rainbow-ridden,
6. where blood-black
7. bromelias, lichens,
8. owls, and the lint
9. of the waterfalls cling,
10. familiar, unbidden.

11. In a dim age
12. of water
13. the brook sings loud
14. from a rib cage
15. of giant fern; vapor
16. climbs up the thick growth
17. effortlessly, turns back,
18. holding them both,
19. house and rock,
20. in a private cloud.

21. At night, on the roof,
22. blind drops crawl
23. and the ordinary brown
24. owl gives us proof
25. he can count:
26. five times--always five--
27. he stamps and takes off
28. after the fat frogs that,
29. shrilling for love,
30. clamber and mount.

31. House, open house
32. to the white dew
33. and the milk-white sunrise
34. kind to the eyes,
35. to membership
36. of silver fish, mouse,
37. bookworms,
38. big moths; with a wall
39. for the mildew's
40. ignorant map;

41. darkened and tarnished
42. by the warm touch
43. of the warm breath,
44. maculate, cherished;
45. rejoice! For a later
46. era will differ.
47. (O difference that kills
48. or intimidates, much
49. of all our small shadowy
50. life!) Without water

51. the great rock will stare
52. unmagnetized, bare,
53. no longer wearing
54. rainbows or rain,
55. the forgiving air
56. and the high fog gone;
57. the owls will move on
58. and the several
59. waterfalls shrivel
60. in the steady sun.
