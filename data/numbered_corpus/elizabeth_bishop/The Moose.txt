1. For Grace Bulmer Bowers


2. From narrow provinces
3. of fish and bread and tea,
4. home of the long tides
5. where the bay leaves the sea
6. twice a day and takes
7. the herrings long rides,

8. where if the river
9. enters or retreats
10. in a wall of brown foam
11. depends on if it meets
12. the bay coming in,
13. the bay not at home;

14. where, silted red,
15. sometimes the sun sets
16. facing a red sea,
17. and others, veins the flats'
18. lavender, rich mud
19. in burning rivulets;

20. on red, gravelly roads,
21. down rows of sugar maples,
22. past clapboard farmhouses
23. and neat, clapboard churches,
24. bleached, ridged as clamshells,
25. past twin silver birches,

26. through late afternoon
27. a bus journeys west,
28. the windshield flashing pink,
29. pink glancing off of metal,
30. brushing the dented flank
31. of blue, beat-up enamel;

32. down hollows, up rises,
33. and waits, patient, while
34. a lone traveller gives
35. kisses and embraces
36. to seven relatives
37. and a collie supervises.

38. Goodbye to the elms,
39. to the farm, to the dog.
40. The bus starts. The light
41. grows richer; the fog,
42. shifting, salty, thin,
43. comes closing in.

44. Its cold, round crystals
45. form and slide and settle
46. in the white hens' feathers,
47. in gray glazed cabbages,
48. on the cabbage roses
49. and lupins like apostles;

50. the sweet peas cling
51. to their wet white string
52. on the whitewashed fences;
53. bumblebees creep
54. inside the foxgloves,
55. and evening commences.

56. One stop at Bass River.
57. Then the Economies
58. Lower, Middle, Upper;
59. Five Islands, Five Houses,
60. where a woman shakes a tablecloth
61. out after supper.

62. A pale flickering. Gone.
63. The Tantramar marshes
64. and the smell of salt hay.
65. An iron bridge trembles
66. and a loose plank rattles
67. but doesn't give way.

68. On the left, a red light
69. swims through the dark:
70. a ship's port lantern.
71. Two rubber boots show,
72. illuminated, solemn.
73. A dog gives one bark.

74. A woman climbs in
75. with two market bags,
76. brisk, freckled, elderly.
77. "A grand night. Yes, sir,
78. all the way to Boston."
79. She regards us amicably.

80. Moonlight as we enter
81. the New Brunswick woods,
82. hairy, scratchy, splintery;
83. moonlight and mist
84. caught in them like lamb's wool
85. on bushes in a pasture.

86. The passengers lie back.
87. Snores. Some long sighs.
88. A dreamy divagation
89. begins in the night,
90. a gentle, auditory,
91. slow hallucination. . . .

92. In the creakings and noises,
93. an old conversation
94. --not concerning us,
95. but recognizable, somewhere,
96. back in the bus:
97. Grandparents' voices

98. uninterruptedly
99. talking, in Eternity:
100. names being mentioned,
101. things cleared up finally;
102. what he said, what she said,
103. who got pensioned;

104. deaths, deaths and sicknesses;
105. the year he remarried;
106. the year (something) happened.
107. She died in childbirth.
108. That was the son lost
109. when the schooner foundered.

110. He took to drink. Yes.
111. She went to the bad.
112. When Amos began to pray
113. even in the store and
114. finally the family had
115. to put him away.

116. "Yes . . ." that peculiar
117. affirmative. "Yes . . ."
118. A sharp, indrawn breath,
119. half groan, half acceptance,
120. that means "Life's like that.
121. We know it (also death)."

122. Talking the way they talked
123. in the old featherbed,
124. peacefully, on and on,
125. dim lamplight in the hall,
126. down in the kitchen, the dog
127. tucked in her shawl.

128. Now, it's all right now
129. even to fall asleep
130. just as on all those nights.
131. --Suddenly the bus driver
132. stops with a jolt,
133. turns off his lights.

134. A moose has come out of
135. the impenetrable wood
136. and stands there, looms, rather,
137. in the middle of the road.
138. It approaches; it sniffs at
139. the bus's hot hood.

140. Towering, antlerless,
141. high as a church,
142. homely as a house
143. (or, safe as houses).
144. A man's voice assures us
145. "Perfectly harmless. . . ."

146. Some of the passengers
147. exclaim in whispers,
148. childishly, softly,
149. "Sure are big creatures."
150. "It's awful plain."
151. "Look! It's a she!"

152. Taking her time,
153. she looks the bus over,
154. grand, otherworldly.
155. Why, why do we feel
156. (we all feel) this sweet
157. sensation of joy?

158. "Curious creatures,"
159. says our quiet driver,
160. rolling his r's.
161. "Look at that, would you."
162. Then he shifts gears.
163. For a moment longer,

164. by craning backward,
165. the moose can be seen
166. on the moonlit macadam;
167. then there's a dim
168. smell of moose, an acrid
169. smell of gasoline.
