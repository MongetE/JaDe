1. For Louise Crane


2. In your next letter I wish you'd say
3. where you are going and what you are doing;
4. how are the plays and after the plays
5. what other pleasures you're pursuing:

6. taking cabs in the middle of the night,
7. driving as if to save your soul
8. where the road gose round and round the park
9. and the meter glares like a moral owl,

10. and the trees look so queer and green
11. standing alone in big black caves
12. and suddenly you're in a different place
13. where everything seems to happen in waves,

14. and most of the jokes you just can't catch,
15. like dirty words rubbed off a slate,
16. and the songs are loud but somehow dim
17. and it gets so teribly late,

18. and coming out of the brownstone house
19. to the gray sidewalk, the watered street,
20. one side of the buildings rises with the sun
21. like a glistening field of wheat.

22. --Wheat, not oats, dear. I'm afraid
23. if it's wheat it's none of your sowing,
24. nevertheless I'd like to know
25. what you are doing and where you are going.
