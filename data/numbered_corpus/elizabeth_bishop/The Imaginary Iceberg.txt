1. We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship,
2. although it meant the end of travel.
3. Although it stood stock-still like cloudy rock
4. and all the sea were moving marble.
5. We'd rather have the iceberg than the ship;
6. we'd rather own this breathing plain of snow
7. though the ship's sails were laid upon the sea
8. as the snow lies undissolved upon the water.
9. O solemn, floating field,
10. are you aware an iceberg takes repose
11. with you, and when it wakes may pasture on your snows?

12. This is a scene a sailor'd give his eyes for.
13. The ship's ignored. The iceberg rises
14. and sinks again; its glassy pinnacles
15. correct elliptics in the sky.
16. This is a scene where he who treads the boards
17. is artlessly rhetorical. The curtain
18. is light enough to rise on finest ropes
19. that airy twists of snow provide.
20. The wits of these white peaks
21. spar with the sun. Its weight the iceberg dares
22. upon a shifting stage and stands and stares.

23. The iceberg cuts its facets from within.
24. Like jewelry from a grave
25. it saves itself perpetually and adorns
26. only itself, perhaps the snows
27. which so surprise us lying on the sea.
28. Good-bye, we say, good-bye, the ship steers off
29. where waves give in to one another's waves
30. and clouds run in a warmer sky.
31. Icebergs behoove the soul
32. (both being self-made from elements least visible)
33. to see them so: fleshed, fair, erected indivisible.
