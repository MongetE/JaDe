1. I dreamed that dead, and meditating,
2. I lay upon a grave, or bed,
3. (at least, some cold and close-built bower).
4. In the cold heart, its final thought
5. stood frozen, drawn immense and clear,
6. stiff and idle as I was there;
7. and we remained unchanged together
8. for a year, a minute, an hour.
9. Suddenly there was a motion,
10. as startling, there, to every sense
11. as an explosion. Then it dropped
12. to insistent, cautious creeping
13. in the region of the heart,
14. prodding me from desperate sleep.
15. I raised my head. A slight young weed
16. had pushed up through the heart and its
17. green head was nodding on the breast.
18. (All this was in the dark.)
19. It grew an inch like a blade of grass;
20. next, one leaf shot out of its side
21. a twisting, waving flag, and then
22. two leaves moved like a semaphore.
23. The stem grew thick. The nervous roots
24. reached to each side; the graceful head
25. changed its position mysteriously,
26. since there was neither sun nor moon
27. to catch its young attention.
28. The rooted heart began to change
29. (not beat) and then it split apart
30. and from it broke a flood of water.
31. Two rivers glanced off from the sides,
32. one to the right, one to the left,
33. two rushing, half-clear streams,
34. (the ribs made of them two cascades)
35. which assuredly, smooth as glass,
36. went off through the fine black grains of earth.
37. The weed was almost swept away;
38. it struggled with its leaves,
39. lifting them fringed with heavy drops.
40. A few drops fell upon my face
41. and in my eyes, so I could see
42. (or, in that black place, thought I saw)
43. that each drop contained a light,
44. a small, illuminated scene;
45. the weed-deflected stream was made
46. itself of racing images.
47. (As if a river should carry all
48. the scenes that it had once reflected
49. shut in its waters, and not floating
50. on momentary surfaces.)
51. The weed stood in the severed heart.
52. "What are you doing there?" I asked.
53. It lifted its head all dripping wet
54. (with my own thoughts?)
55. and answered then: "I grow," it said,
56. "but to divide your heart again."
