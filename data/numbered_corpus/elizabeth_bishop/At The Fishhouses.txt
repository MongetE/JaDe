1. Although it is a cold evening,
2. down by one of the fishhouses
3. an old man sits netting,
4. his net, in the gloaming almost invisible,
5. a dark purple-brown,
6. and his shuttle worn and polished.
7. The air smells so strong of codfish
8. it makes one's nose run and one's eyes water.
9. The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs
10. and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up
11. to storerooms in the gables
12. for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on.
13. All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea,
14. swelling slowly as if considering spilling over,
15. is opaque, but the silver of the benches,
16. the lobster pots, and masts, scattered
17. among the wild jagged rocks,
18. is of an apparent translucence
19. like the small old buildings with an emerald moss
20. growing on their shoreward walls.
21. The big fish tubs are completely lined
22. with layers of beautiful herring scales
23. and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered
24. with creamy iridescent coats of mail,
25. with small iridescent flies crawling on them.
26. Up on the little slope behind the houses,
27. set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass,
28. is an ancient wooden capstan,
29. cracked, with two long bleached handles
30. and some melancholy stains, like dried blood,
31. where the ironwork has rusted.
32. The old man accepts a Lucky Strike.
33. He was a friend of my grandfather.
34. We talk of the decline in the population
35. and of codfish and herring
36. while he waits for a herring boat to come in.
37. There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb.
38. He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty,
39. from unnumbered fish with that black old knife,
40. the blade of which is almost worn away.

41. Down at the water's edge, at the place
42. where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp
43. descending into the water, thin silver
44. tree trunks are laid horizontally
45. across the gray stones, down and down
46. at intervals of four or five feet.

47. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear,
48. element bearable to no mortal,
49. to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly
50. I have seen here evening after evening.
51. He was curious about me. He was interested in music;
52. like me a believer in total immersion,
53. so I used to sing him Baptist hymns.
54. I also sang "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God."
55. He stood up in the water and regarded me
56. steadily, moving his head a little.
57. Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge
58. almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug
59. as if it were against his better judgment.
60. Cold dark deep and absolutely clear,
61. the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us,
62. the dignified tall firs begin.
63. Bluish, associating with their shadows,
64. a million Christmas trees stand
65. waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended
66. above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones.
67. I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same,
68. slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones,
69. icily free above the stones,
70. above the stones and then the world.
71. If you should dip your hand in,
72. your wrist would ache immediately,
73. your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn
74. as if the water were a transmutation of fire
75. that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame.
76. If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter,
77. then briny, then surely burn your tongue.
78. It is like what we imagine knowledge to be:
79. dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free,
80. drawn from the cold hard mouth
81. of the world, derived from the rocky breasts
82. forever, flowing and drawn, and since
83. our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.
