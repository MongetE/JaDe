1. I caught a tremendous fish
2. and held him beside the boat
3. half out of water, with my hook
4. fast in a corner of his mouth.
5. He didn't fight.
6. He hadn't fought at all.
7. He hung a grunting weight,
8. battered and venerable
9. and homely. Here and there
10. his brown skin hung in strips
11. like ancient wallpaper,
12. and its pattern of darker brown
13. was like wallpaper:
14. shapes like full-blown roses
15. stained and lost through age.
16. He was speckled with barnacles,
17. fine rosettes of lime,
18. and infested
19. with tiny white sea-lice,
20. and underneath two or three
21. rags of green weed hung down.
22. While his gills were breathing in
23. the terrible oxygen
24. - the frightening gills,
25. fresh and crisp with blood,
26. that can cut so badly-
27. I thought of the coarse white flesh
28. packed in like feathers,
29. the big bones and the little bones,
30. the dramatic reds and blacks
31. of his shiny entrails,
32. and the pink swim-bladder
33. like a big peony.
34. I looked into his eyes
35. which were far larger than mine
36. but shallower, and yellowed,
37. the irises backed and packed
38. with tarnished tinfoil
39. seen through the lenses
40. of old scratched isinglass.
41. They shifted a little, but not
42. to return my stare.
43. - It was more like the tipping
44. of an object toward the light.
45. I admired his sullen face,
46. the mechanism of his jaw,
47. and then I saw
48. that from his lower lip
49. - if you could call it a lip
50. grim, wet, and weaponlike,
51. hung five old pieces of fish-line,
52. or four and a wire leader
53. with the swivel still attached,
54. with all their five big hooks
55. grown firmly in his mouth.
56. A green line, frayed at the end
57. where he broke it, two heavier lines,
58. and a fine black thread
59. still crimped from the strain and snap
60. when it broke and he got away.
61. Like medals with their ribbons
62. frayed and wavering,
63. a five-haired beard of wisdom
64. trailing from his aching jaw.
65. I stared and stared
66. and victory filled up
67. the little rented boat,
68. from the pool of bilge
69. where oil had spread a rainbow
70. around the rusted engine
71. to the bailer rusted orange,
72. the sun-cracked thwarts,
73. the oarlocks on their strings,
74. the gunnels- until everything
75. was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
76. And I let the fish go.
