1. September rain falls on the house.
2. In the failing light, the old grandmother
3. sits in the kitchen with the child
4. beside the Little Marvel Stove,
5. reading the jokes from the almanac,
6. laughing and talking to hide her tears.

7. She thinks that her equinoctial tears
8. and the rain that beats on the roof of the house
9. were both foretold by the almanac,
10. but only known to a grandmother.
11. The iron kettle sings on the stove.
12. She cuts some bread and says to the child,

13. It's time for tea now; but the child
14. is watching the teakettle's small hard tears
15. dance like mad on the hot black stove,
16. the way the rain must dance on the house.
17. Tidying up, the old grandmother
18. hangs up the clever almanac

19. on its string. Birdlike, the almanac
20. hovers half open above the child,
21. hovers above the old grandmother
22. and her teacup full of dark brown tears.
23. She shivers and says she thinks the house
24. feels chilly, and puts more wood in the stove.

25. It was to be, says the Marvel Stove.
26. I know what I know, says the almanac.
27. With crayons the child draws a rigid house
28. and a winding pathway. Then the child
29. puts in a man with buttons like tears
30. and shows it proudly to the grandmother.

31. But secretly, while the grandmother
32. busies herself about the stove,
33. the little moons fall down like tears
34. from between the pages of the almanac
35. into the flower bed the child
36. has carefully placed in the front of the house.

37. Time to plant tears, says the almanac.
38. The grandmother sings to the marvelous stove
39. and the child draws another inscrutable house.
