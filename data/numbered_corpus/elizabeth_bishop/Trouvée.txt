1. Oh, why should a hen
2. have been run over
3. on West 4th Street
4. in the middle of summer?

5. She was a white hen
6. --red-and-white now, of course.
7. How did she get there?
8. Where was she going?

9. Her wing feathers spread
10. flat, flat in the tar,
11. all dirtied, and thin
12. as tissue paper.

13. A pigeon, yes,
14. or an English sparrow,
15. might meet such a fate,
16. but not that poor fowl.

17. Just now I went back
18. to look again.
19. I hadn't dreamed it:
20. there is a hen

21. turned into a quaint
22. old country saying
23. scribbled in chalk
24. (except for the beak).
