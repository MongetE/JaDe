1. Oh, but it is dirty!
2. --this little filling station,
3. oil-soaked, oil-permeated
4. to a disturbing, over-all
5. black translucency.
6. Be careful with that match!

7. Father wears a dirty,
8. oil-soaked monkey suit
9. that cuts him under the arms,
10. and several quick and saucy
11. and greasy sons assist him
12. (it's a family filling station),
13. all quite thoroughly dirty.

14. Do they live in the station?
15. It has a cement porch
16. behind the pumps, and on it
17. a set of crushed and grease-
18. impregnated wickerwork;
19. on the wicker sofa
20. a dirty dog, quite comfy.

21. Some comic books provide
22. the only note of color--
23. of certain color. They lie
24. upon a big dim doily
25. draping a taboret
26. (part of the set), beside
27. a big hirsute begonia.

28. Why the extraneous plant?
29. Why the taboret?
30. Why, oh why, the doily?
31. (Embroidered in daisy stitch
32. with marguerites, I think,
33. and heavy with gray crochet.)

34. Somebody embroidered the doily.
35. Somebody waters the plant,
36. or oils it, maybe. Somebody
37. arranges the rows of cans
38. so that they softly say:
39. ESSO--SO--SO--SO

40. to high-strung automobiles.
41. Somebody loves us all.
