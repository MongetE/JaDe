1. For Robert Lowell

2. This is the time of year
3. when almost every night
4. the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.
5. Climbing the mountain height,

6. rising toward a saint
7. still honored in these parts,
8. the paper chambers flush and fill with light
9. that comes and goes, like hearts.

10. Once up against the sky it's hard
11. to tell them from the stars--
12. planets, that is--the tinted ones:
13. Venus going down, or Mars,

14. or the pale green one. With a wind,
15. they flare and falter, wobble and toss;
16. but if it's still they steer between
17. the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,

18. receding, dwindling, solemnly
19. and steadily forsaking us,
20. or, in the downdraft from a peak,
21. suddenly turning dangerous.

22. Last night another big one fell.
23. It splattered like an egg of fire
24. against the cliff behind the house.
25. The flame ran down. We saw the pair

26. of owls who nest there flying up
27. and up, their whirling black-and-white
28. stained bright pink underneath, until
29. they shrieked up out of sight.

30. The ancient owls' nest must have burned.
31. Hastily, all alone,
32. a glistening armadillo left the scene,
33. rose-flecked, head down, tail down,

34. and then a baby rabbit jumped out,
35. short-eared, to our surprise.
36. So soft!--a handful of intangible ash
37. with fixed, ignited eyes.

38. Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry! O falling fire and piercing cry and panic,
39. and a weak mailed fist clenched ignorant against the sky!
