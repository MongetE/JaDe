1. We must admire her perfect aim,
2. this huntress of the winter air
3. whose level weapon needs no sight,
4. if it were not that everywhere
5. her game is sure, her shot is right.
6. The least of us could do the same.

7. The chalky birds or boats stand still,
8. reducing her conditions of chance;
9. air's gallery marks identically
10. the narrow gallery of her glance.
11. The target-center in her eye
12. is equally her aim and will.

13. Time's in her pocket, ticking loud
14. on one stalled second. She'll consult
15. not time nor circumstance. She calls
16. on atmosphere for her result.
17. (It is this clock that later falls
18. in wheels and chimes of leaf and cloud.)
