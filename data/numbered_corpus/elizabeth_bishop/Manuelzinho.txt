1. [Brazil. A friend of the writer is speaking.]


2. Half squatter, half tenant (no rent)—
3. a sort of inheritance; white,
4. in your thirties now, and supposed
5. to supply me with vegetables,
6. but you don't; or you won't; or you can't
7. get the idea through your brain—
8. the world's worst gardener since Cain.
9. Titled above me, your gardens
10. ravish my eyes. You edge
11. the beds of silver cabbages
12. with red carnations, and lettuces
13. mix with alyssum. And then
14. umbrella ants arrive,
15. or it rains for a solid week
16. and the whole thing's ruined again
17. and I buy you more pounds of seeds,
18. imported, guaranteed,
19. and eventually you bring me
20. a mystic thee-legged carrot,
21. or a pumpkin "bigger than the baby."

22. I watch you through the rain,
23. trotting, light, on bare feet,
24. up the steep paths you have made—
25. or your father and grandfather made—
26. all over my property,
27. with your head and back inside
28. a sodden burlap bag,
29. and feel I can't endure it
30. another minute; then,
31. indoors, beside the stove,
32. keep on reading a book.

33. You steal my telephone wires,
34. or someone does. You starve
35. your horse and yourself
36. and your dogs and family.
37. among endless variety,
38. you eat boiled cabbage stalks.
39. And once I yelled at you
40. so loud to hurry up
41. and fetch me those potatoes
42. your holey hat flew off,
43. you jumped out of your clogs,
44. leaving three objects arranged
45. in a triangle at my feet,
46. as if you'd been a gardener
47. in a fairy tale all this time
48. and at the word "potatoes"
49. had vanished to take up your work
50. of fairy prince somewhere.

51. The strangest things happen to you.
52. Your cows eats a "poison grass"
53. and drops dead on the spot.
54. Nobody else's does.
55. And then your father dies,
56. a superior old man
57. with a black plush hat, and a moustache
58. like a white spread-eagled sea gull.
59. The family gathers, but you,
60. no, you "don't think he's dead!
61. I look at him. He's cold.
62. They're burying him today.
63. But you know, I don't think he's dead."
64. I give you money for the funeral
65. and you go and hire a bus
66. for the delighted mourners,
67. so I have to hand over some more
68. and then have to hear you tell me
69. you pray for me every night!

70. And then you come again,
71. sniffing and shivering,
72. hat in hand, with that wistful
73. face, like a child's fistful
74. of bluets or white violets,
75. improvident as the dawn,
76. and once more I provide
77. for a shot of penicillin
78. down at the pharmacy, or
79. one more bottle of
80. Electrical Baby Syrup.
81. Or, briskly, you come to settle
82. what we call our "accounts,"
83. with two old copybooks,
84. one with flowers on the cover,
85. the other with a camel.
86. immediate confusion.
87. You've left out decimal points.
88. Your columns stagger,
89. honeycombed with zeros.
90. You whisper conspiratorially;
91. the numbers mount to millions.
92. Account books? They are Dream Books.
93. in the kitchen we dream together
94. how the meek shall inherit the earth—
95. or several acres of mine.

96. With blue sugar bags on their heads,
97. carrying your lunch,
98. your children scuttle by me
99. like little moles aboveground,
100. or even crouch behind bushes
101. as if I were out to shoot them!
102. —Impossible to make friends,
103. though each will grab at once
104. for an orange or a piece of candy.

105. Twined in wisps of fog,
106. I see you all up there
107. along with Formoso, the donkey,
108. who brays like a pump gone dry,
109. then suddenly stops.
110. —All just standing, staring
111. off into fog and space.
112. Or coming down at night,
113. in silence, except for hoofs,
114. in dim moonlight, the horse
115. or Formoso stumbling after.
116. Between us float a few
117. big, soft, pale-blue,
118. sluggish fireflies,
119. the jellyfish of the air...

120. Patch upon patch upon patch,
121. your wife keeps all of you covered.
122. She has gone over and over
123. (forearmed is forewarned)
124. your pair of bright-blue pants
125. with white thread, and these days
126. your limbs are draped in blueprints.
127. You paint—heaven knows why—
128. the outside of the crown
129. and brim of your straw hat.
130. Perhaps to reflect the sun?
131. Or perhaps when you were small,
132. your mother said, "Manuelzinho,
133. one thing; be sure you always
134. paint your straw hat."
135. One was gold for a while,
136. but the gold wore off, like plate.
137. One was bright green. Unkindly,
138. I called you Klorophyll Kid.
139. My visitors thought it was funny.
140. I apologize here and now.
141. You helpless, foolish man,
142. I love you all I can,
143. I think. Or I do?
144. I take off my hat, unpainted
145. and figurative, to you.
146. Again I promise to try.
