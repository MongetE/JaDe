1. The state with the prettiest name,
2. the state that floats in brackish water,
3. held together by mangrave roots
4. that bear while living oysters in clusters,
5. and when dead strew white swamps with skeletons,
6. dotted as if bombarded, with green hummocks
7. like ancient cannon-balls sprouting grass.
8. The state full of long S-shaped birds, blue and white,
9. and unseen hysterical birds who rush up the scale
10. every time in a tantrum.
11. Tanagers embarrassed by their flashiness,
12. and pelicans whose delight it is to clown;
13. who coast for fun on the strong tidal currents
14. in and out among the mangrove islands
15. and stand on the sand-bars drying their damp gold wings
16. on sun-lit evenings.
17. Enormous turtles, helpless and mild,
18. die and leave their barnacled shells on the beaches,
19. and their large white skulls with round eye-sockets
20. twice the size of a man's.
21. The palm trees clatter in the stiff breeze
22. like the bills of the pelicans. The tropical rain comes down
23. to freshen the tide-looped strings of fading shells:
24. Job's Tear, the Chinese Alphabet, the scarce Junonia,
25. parti-colored pectins and Ladies' Ears,
26. arranged as on a gray rag of rotted calico,
27. the buried Indian Princess's skirt;
28. with these the monotonous, endless, sagging coast-line
29. is delicately ornamented.

30. Thirty or more buzzards are drifting down, down, down,
31. over something they have spotted in the swamp,
32. in circles like stirred-up flakes of sediment
33. sinking through water.
34. Smoke from woods-fires filters fine blue solvents.
35. On stumps and dead trees the charring is like black velvet.
36. The mosquitoes
37. go hunting to the tune of their ferocious obbligatos.
38. After dark, the fireflies map the heavens in the marsh
39. until the moon rises.
40. Cold white, not bright, the moonlight is coarse-meshed,
41. and the careless, corrupt state is all black specks
42. too far apart, and ugly whites; the poorest
43. post-card of itself.
44. After dark, the pools seem to have slipped away.
45. The alligator, who has five distinct calls:
46. friendliness, love, mating, war, and a warning--
47. whimpers and speaks in the throat
48. of the Indian Princess.
