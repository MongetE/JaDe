1. Alone on the railroad track
2. I walked with pounding heart.
3. The ties were too close together
4. or maybe too far apart.

5. The scenery was impoverished:
6. scrub-pine and oak; beyond
7. its mingled gray-green foliage
8. I saw the little pond

9. where the dirty old hermit lives,
10. lie like an old tear
11. holding onto its injuries
12. lucidly year after year.

13. The hermit shot off his shot-gun
14. and the tree by his cabin shook.
15. Over the pond went a ripple
16. The pet hen went chook-chook.

17. "Love should be put into action!"
18. screamed the old hermit.
19. Across the pond an echo
20. tried and tried to confirm it.
