1. At four o'clock
2. in the gun-metal blue dark
3. we hear the first crow of the first cock

4. just below
5. the gun-metal blue window
6. and immediately there is an echo

7. off in the distance,
8. then one from the backyard fence,
9. then one, with horrible insistence,

10. grates like a wet match
11. from the broccoli patch,
12. flares,and all over town begins to catch.

13. Cries galore
14. come from the water-closet door,
15. from the dropping-plastered henhouse floor,

16. where in the blue blur
17. their rusting wives admire,
18. the roosters brace their cruel feet and glare

19. with stupid eyes
20. while from their beaks there rise
21. the uncontrolled, traditional cries.

22. Deep from protruding chests
23. in green-gold medals dressed,
24. planned to command and terrorize the rest,

25. the many wives
26. who lead hens' lives
27. of being courted and despised;

28. deep from raw throats
29. a senseless order floats
30. all over town. A rooster gloats

31. over our beds
32. from rusty irons sheds
33. and fences made from old bedsteads,

34. over our churches
35. where the tin rooster perches,
36. over our little wooden northern houses,

37. making sallies
38. from all the muddy alleys,
39. marking out maps like Rand McNally's:

40. glass-headed pins,
41. oil-golds and copper greens,
42. anthracite blues, alizarins,

43. each one an active
44. displacement in perspective;
45. each screaming, "This is where I live!"

46. Each screaming
47. "Get up! Stop dreaming!"
48. Roosters, what are you projecting?

49. You, whom the Greeks elected
50. to shoot at on a post, who struggled
51. when sacrificed, you whom they labeled

52. "Very combative..."
53. what right have you to give
54. commands and tell us how to live,

55. cry "Here!" and "Here!"
56. and wake us here where are
57. unwanted love, conceit and war?

58. The crown of red
59. set on your little head
60. is charged with all your fighting blood

61. Yes, that excrescence
62. makes a most virile presence,
63. plus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence

64. Now in mid-air
65. by two they fight each other.
66. Down comes a first flame-feather,

67. and one is flying,
68. with raging heroism defying
69. even the sensation of dying.

70. And one has fallen
71. but still above the town
72. his torn-out, bloodied feathers drift down;

73. and what he sung
74. no matter. He is flung
75. on the gray ash-heap, lies in dung

76. with his dead wives
77. with open, bloody eyes,
78. while those metallic feathers oxidize.


79. St. Peter's sin
80. was worse than that of Magdalen
81. whose sin was of the flesh alone;

82. of spirit, Peter's,
83. falling, beneath the flares,
84. among the "servants and officers."

85. Old holy sculpture
86. could set it all together
87. in one small scene, past and future:

88. Christ stands amazed,
89. Peter, two fingers raised
90. to surprised lips, both as if dazed.

91. But in between
92. a little cock is seen
93. carved on a dim column in the travertine,

94. explained by gallus canit;
95. flet Petrus underneath it,
96. There is inescapable hope, the pivot;

97. yes, and there Peter's tears
98. run down our chanticleer's
99. sides and gem his spurs.

100. Tear-encrusted thick
101. as a medieval relic
102. he waits. Poor Peter, heart-sick,

103. still cannot guess
104. those cock-a-doodles yet might bless,
105. his dreadful rooster come to mean forgiveness,

106. a new weathervane
107. on basilica and barn,
108. and that outside the Lateran

109. there would always be
110. a bronze cock on a porphyry
111. pillar so the people and the Pope might see

112. that event the Prince
113. of the Apostles long since
114. had been forgiven, and to convince

115. all the assembly
116. that "Deny deny deny"
117. is not all the roosters cry.

118. In the morning
119. a low light is floating
120. in the backyard, and gilding

121. from underneath
122. the broccoli, leaf by leaf;
123. how could the night have come to grief?

124. gilding the tiny
125. floating swallow's belly
126. and lines of pink cloud in the sky,

127. the day's preamble
128. like wandering lines in marble,
129. The cocks are now almost inaudible.

130. The sun climbs in,
131. following "to see the end,"
132. faithful as enemy, or friend.
