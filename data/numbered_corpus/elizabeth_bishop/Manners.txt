1. For a Child of 1

2. My grandfather said to me
3. as we sat on the wagon seat,
4. "Be sure to remember to always
5. speak to everyone you meet."

6. We met a stranger on foot.
7. My grandfather's whip tapped his hat.
8. "Good day, sir. Good day. A fine day."
9. And I said it and bowed where I sat.

10. Then we overtook a boy we knew
11. with his big pet crow on his shoulder.
12. "Always offer everyone a ride;
13. don't forget that when you get older,"

14. my grandfather said. So Willy
15. climbed up with us, but the crow
16. gave a "Caw!" and flew off. I was worried.
17. How would he know where to go?

18. But he flew a little way at a time
19. from fence post to fence post, ahead;
20. and when Willy whistled he answered.
21. "A fine bird," my grandfather said,

22. "and he's well brought up. See, he answers
23. nicely when he's spoken to.
24. Man or beast, that's good manners.
25. Be sure that you both always do."

26. When automobiles went by,
27. the dust hid the people's faces,
28. but we shouted "Good day! Good day!
29. Fine day!" at the top of our voices.

30. When we came to Hustler Hill,
31. he said that the mare was tired,
32. so we all got down and walked,
33. as our good manners required.
