1. In Worcester, Massachusetts,
2. I went with Aunt Consuelo
3. to keep her dentist's appointment
4. and sat and waited for her
5. in the dentist's waiting room.
6. It was winter. It got dark
7. early. The waiting room
8. was full of grown-up people,
9. arctics and overcoats,
10. lamps and magazines.
11. My aunt was inside
12. what seemed like a long time
13. and while I waited and read
14. the National Geographic
15. (I could read) and carefully
16. studied the photographs:
17. the inside of a volcano,
18. black, and full of ashes;
19. then it was spilling over
20. in rivulets of fire.
21. Osa and Martin Johnson
22. dressed in riding breeches,
23. laced boots, and pith helmets.
24. A dead man slung on a pole
25. "Long Pig," the caption said.
26. Babies with pointed heads
27. wound round and round with string;
28. black, naked women with necks
29. wound round and round with wire
30. like the necks of light bulbs.
31. Their breasts were horrifying.
32. I read it right straight through.
33. I was too shy to stop.
34. And then I looked at the cover:
35. the yellow margins, the date.
36. Suddenly, from inside,
37. came an oh! of pain
38. --Aunt Consuelo's voice--
39. not very loud or long.
40. I wasn't at all surprised;
41. even then I knew she was
42. a foolish, timid woman.
43. I might have been embarrassed,
44. but wasn't. What took me
45. completely by surprise
46. was that it was me:
47. my voice, in my mouth.
48. Without thinking at all
49. I was my foolish aunt,
50. I--we--were falling, falling,
51. our eyes glued to the cover
52. of the National Geographic,
53. February, 1918.

54. I said to myself: three days
55. and you'll be seven years old.
56. I was saying it to stop
57. the sensation of falling off
58. the round, turning world.
59. into cold, blue-black space.
60. But I felt: you are an I,
61. you are an Elizabeth,
62. you are one of them.
63. Why should you be one, too?
64. I scarcely dared to look
65. to see what it was I was.
66. I gave a sidelong glance
67. --I couldn't look any higher--
68. at shadowy gray knees,
69. trousers and skirts and boots
70. and different pairs of hands
71. lying under the lamps.
72. I knew that nothing stranger
73. had ever happened, that nothing
74. stranger could ever happen.

75. Why should I be my aunt,
76. or me, or anyone?
77. What similarities
78. boots, hands, the family voice
79. I felt in my throat, or even
80. the National Geographic
81. and those awful hanging breasts
82. held us all together
83. or made us all just one?
84. How I didn't know any
85. word for it how "unlikely". . .
86. How had I come to be here,
87. like them, and overhear
88. a cry of pain that could have
89. got loud and worse but hadn't?

90. The waiting room was bright
91. and too hot. It was sliding
92. beneath a big black wave,
93. another, and another.

94. Then I was back in it.
95. The War was on. Outside,
96. in Worcester, Massachusetts,
97. were night and slush and cold,
98. and it was still the fifth
99. of February, 1918.
