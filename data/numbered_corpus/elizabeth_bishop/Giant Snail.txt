1. The rain has stopped. The waterfall will roar like that all
2. night. I have come out to take a walk and feed. My body--foot,
3. that is--is wet and cold and covered with sharp gravel. It is
4. white, the size of a dinner plate. I have set myself a goal, a
5. certain rock, but it may well be dawn before I get there.
6. Although I move ghostlike and my floating edges barely graze
7. the ground, I am heavy, heavy, heavy. My white muscles are
8. already tired. I give the impression of mysterious ease, but it is
9. only with the greatest effort of my will that I can rise above the
10. smallest stones and sticks. And I must not let myself be dis-
11. tracted by those rough spears of grass. Don't touch them. Draw
12. back. Withdrawal is always best.
13. The rain has stopped. The waterfall makes such a noise! (And
14. what if I fall over it?) The mountains of black rock give off such
15. clouds of steam! Shiny streamers are hanging down their sides.
16. When this occurs, we have a saying that the Snail Gods have
17. come down in haste. I could never descend such steep escarp-
18. ments, much less dream of climbing them.
19. That toad was too big, too, like me. His eyes beseeched my
20. love. Our proportions horrify our neighbors.
21. Rest a minute; relax. Flattened to the ground, my body is like
22. a pallid, decomposing leaf. What's that tapping on my shell?
23. Nothing. Let's go on.
24. My sides move in rhythmic waves, just off the ground, from
25. front to back, the wake of a ship, wax-white water, or a slowly
26. melting floe. I am cold, cold, cold as ice. My blind, white bull's
27. head was a Cretan scare-head; degenerate, my four horns that
28. can't attack. The sides of my mouth are now my hands. They
29. press the earth and suck it hard. Ah, but I know my shell is
30. beautiful, and high, and glazed, and shining. I know it well,
31. although I have not seen it. Its curled white lip is of the finest
32. enamel. Inside, it is as smooth as silk, and I, I fill it to perfection.
33. My wide wake shines, now it is growing dark. I leave a lovely
34. opalescent ribbon: I know this.
35. But O! I am too big. I feel it. Pity me.
36. If and when I reach the rock, I shall go into a certain crack
37. there for the night. The waterfall below will vibrate through
38. my shell and body all night long. In that steady pulsing I can
39. rest. All night I shall be like a sleeping ear.
