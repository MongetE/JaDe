1. Tended by Faustina
2. yes in a crazy house
3. upon a crazy bed,
4. frail, of chipped enamel,
5. blooming above her head
6. into four vaguely roselike
7. flower-formations,

8. the white woman whispers to
9. herself. The floorboards sag
10. this way and that. The crooked
11. towel-covered table
12. bears a can of talcum
13. and five pasteboard boxes
14. of little pills,

15. most half-crystallized.
16. The visitor sits and watches
17. the dew glint on the screen
18. and in it two glow-worms
19. burning a drowned green.
20. Meanwhile the eighty-watt bulb
21. betrays us all,

22. discovering the concern
23. within our stupefaction;
24. lighting as well on heads
25. of tacks in the wallpaper,
26. on a paper wall-pocket,
27. violet-embossed, glistening
28. with mica flakes.

29. It exposes the fine white hair,
30. the gown with the undershirt
31. showing at the neck,
32. the pallid palm-leaf fan
33. she holds but cannot wield,
34. her white disordered sheets
35. like wilted roses.

36. Clutter of trophies,
37. chamber of bleached flags!
38. -Rags or ragged garments
39. hung on the chairs and hooks
40. each contributing its
41. shade of white, confusing
42. as undazzling.

43. The visitor is embarrassed
44. not by pain nor age
45. nor even nakedness,
46. though perhaps by its reverse.
47. By and by the whisper
48. says, "Faustina, Faustina. . ."
49. Vengo, senora!"

50. On bare scraping feet
51. Faustina nears the bed.
52. She exhibits the talcum powder,
53. the pills, the cans of "cream,"
54. the white bowl of farina,
55. requesting for herself
56. a little conac;

57. complaining of, explaining,
58. the terms of her employment.
59. She bends above the other.
60. Her sinister kind face
61. presents a cruel black
62. coincident conundrum.
63. Oh, is it

64. freedom at last, a lifelong
65. dream of time and silence,
66. dream of protection and rest?
67. Or is it the very worst,
68. the unimaginable nightmare
69. that never before dared last
70. more than a second?

71. The acuteness of the question
72. forks instantly and starts
73. a snake-tongue flickering;
74. blurs further, blunts, softens,
75. separates, falls, our problems
76. becoming helplessly
77. proliferative.

78. There is no way of telling.
79. The eyes say only either.
80. At last the visitor rises,
81. awkwardly proffers her bunch
82. of rust-perforated roses
83. and wonders oh, whence come
84. all the petals.
