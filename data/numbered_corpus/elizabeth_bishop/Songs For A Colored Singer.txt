1. I

2. A washing hangs upon the line,
3. but it's not mine.
4. None of the things that I can see
5. belong to me.
6. The neighbors got a radio with an aerial;
7. we got a little portable.
8. They got a lot of closet space;
9. we got a suitcase.

10. I say, "Le Roy, just how much are we owing?
11. Something I can't comprehend,
12. the more we got the more we spend...."
13. He only answers, "Let's get going."
14. Le Roy, you're earning too much money now.

16. and find it very hard.

20. but he sure has an inquiring mind.
21. He's seen a lot; he's bound to see the rest,
22. and if I protest

23. Le Roy answers with a frown,
24. "Darling, when I earns I spends.
25. The world is wide; it still extends....
26. I'm going to get a job in the next town."
27. Le Roy, you're earning too much money now.

37. to th' accompaniment of the piccolo.

38. The time has come to call a halt.
39. I met him walking with Varella
40. and hit him twice with my umbrella.
41. Perhaps that occasion was my fault,
42. but the time has come to call a halt.

44. Let the piccolo play.
45. I'm sick of all your fussing anyway.
46. Now I'm pursuing my own way.

54. and it will take me anywhere.
55. For this occasion's all his fault.
56. The time has come to call a halt.

57. III

58. Lullaby.
59. Adult and child
60. sink to their rest.
61. At sea the big ship sinks and dies,
62. lead in its breast.

63. Lullaby.
64. Let mations rage,
65. let nations fall.

67. upon the wall.

68. Lullaby.

75. you have no sense,
76. don't you mind them; it won't make
77. much difference.

78. Lullaby.

83. IV

84. What's that shining in the leaves,
85. the shadowy leaves,
86. like tears when somebody grieves,
87. shining, shining in the leaves?

88. Is it dew or is it tears,
89. dew or tears,
90. hanging there for years and years
91. like a heavy dew of tears?

92. Then that dew begins to fall,
93. roll down and fall,
94. Maybe it's not tears at all.
95. See it, see it roll and fall.

96. Hear it falling on the ground,
97. hear, all around.
98. That is not a tearful sound,
99. beating, beating on the ground.

100. See it lying there like seeds,
101. like black seeds.
102. see it taking root like weeds,
103. faster, faster than the weeds,

104. all the shining seeds take root,
105. conspiring root,
106. and what curious flower or fruit
107. will grow from that conspiring root?

108. fruit or flower? It is a face.
109. Yes, a face.
110. In that dark and dreary place
111. each seed grows into a face.

112. Like an army in a dream
113. the faces seem,
114. darker, darker, like a dream.
115. They're too real to be a dream.
