1. It is so peaceful on the ceiling!
2. It is the Place de la Concorde.
3. The little crystal chandelier
4. is off, the fountain is in the dark.
5. Not a soul is in the park.

6. Below, where the wallpaper is peeling,
7. the Jardin des Plantes has locked its gates.
8. Those photographs are animals.
9. The mighty flowers and foliage rustle;
10. under the leaves the insects tunnel.

11. We must go under the wallpaper
12. to meet the insect-gladiator,
13. to battle with a net and trident,
14. and leave the fountain and the square
15. But oh, that we could sleep up there...
