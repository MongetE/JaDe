1. From Brooklyn, over the Brooklyn Bridge, on this fine morning,
2. please come flying.In a cloud of fiery pale chemicals,
3. please come flying,
4. to the rapid rolling of thousands of small blue drums
5. descending out of the mackerel sky
6. over the glittering grandstand of harbor-water,
7. pl ease come flying.

8. Whistles, pennants and smoke are blowing. The ships
9. are signaling cordially with multitudes of flags
10. rising and falling like birds all over the harbor.
11. Enter: two rivers, gracefully bearing
12. countless little pellucid jellies
13. in cut-glass epergnes dragging with silver chains.
14. The flight is safe; the weather is all arranged.
15. The waves are running in verses this fine morning.
16. Please come flying.

17. Come with the pointed toe of each black shoe
18. trailing a sapphire highlight,
19. with a black capeful of butterfly wings and bon-mots,
20. with heaven knows how many angels all riding
21. on the broad black brim of your hat,
22. please come flying.
23. Bearing a musical inaudible abacus,
24. a slight censorious frown, and blue ribbons,
25. please come flying.Facts and skyscrapers glint in the tide; Manhattan
26. is all awash with morals this fine morning,
27. so please come flying.

28. Mounting the sky with natural heroism,
29. above the accidents, above the malignant movies,
30. the taxicabs and injustices at large,
31. while horns are resounding in your beautiful ears
32. that simultaneously listen to
33. a soft uninvented music, fit for the musk deer,
34. please come flying.
35. For whom the grim museums will behave
36. like courteous male bower-birds,
37. for whom the agreeable lions lie in wait
38. on the steps of the Public Library,
39. eager to rise and follow through the doors
40. up into the reading rooms,
41. please come flying.We can sit down and weep; we can go shopping,
42. or play at a game of constantly being wrong
43. with a priceless set of vocabularies,
44. or we can bravely deplore, but please
45. please come flying.
46. With dynasties of negative constructions
47. darkening and dying around you,
48. with grammar that suddenly turns and shines
49. like flocks of sandpipers flying,
50. please come flying.
51. Come like a light in the white mackerel sky,
52. come like a daytime comet
53. with a long unnebulous train of words,
54. from Brooklyn, over the Brooklyn Bridge, on this fine morning,
55. please come flying.
