1. The still explosions on the rocks,
2. the lichens, grow
3. by spreading, gray, concentric shocks.
4. They have arranged
5. to meet the rings around the moon, although
6. within our memories they have not changed.

7. And since the heavens will attend
8. as long on us,
9. you've been, dear friend,
10. precipitate and pragmatical;
11. and look what happens. For Time is
12. nothing if not amenable.

13. The shooting stars in your black hair
14. in bright formation
15. are flocking where,
16. so straight, so soon?
17. --Come, let me wash it in this big tin basin,
18. battered and shiny like the moon.
