1. Unfunny uncles who insist
2. in trying on a lady's hat,
3. --oh, even if the joke falls flat,
4. we share your slight transvestite twist

5. in spite of our embarrassment.
6. Costume and custom are complex.
7. The headgear of the other sex
8. inspires us to experiment.

9. Anandrous aunts, who, at the beach
10. with paper plates upon your laps,
11. keep putting on the yachtsmen's caps
12. with exhibitionistic screech,

13. the visors hanging o'er the ear
14. so that the golden anchors drag,
15. --the tides of fashion never lag.
16. Such caps may not be worn next year.

17. Or you who don the paper plate
18. itself, and put some grapes upon it,
19. or sport the Indian's feather bonnet,
20. --perversities may aggravate

21. the natural madness of the hatter.
22. And if the opera hats collapse
23. and crowns grow draughty, then, perhaps,
24. he thinks what might a miter matter?

25. Unfunny uncle, you who wore a
26. hat too big, or one too many,
27. tell us, can't you, are there any
28. stars inside your black fedora?

29. Aunt exemplary and slim,
30. with avernal eyes, we wonder
31. what slow changes they see under
32. their vast, shady, turned-down brim.
