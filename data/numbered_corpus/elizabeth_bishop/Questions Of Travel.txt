1. There are too many waterfalls here; the crowded streams
2. hurry too rapidly down to the sea,
3. and the pressure of so many clouds on the mountaintops
4. makes them spill over the sides in soft slow-motion,
5. turning to waterfalls under our very eyes.
6. - For if those streaks, those mile-long, shiny, tearstains,
7. aren't waterfalls yet,
8. in a quick age or so, as ages go here,
9. they probably will be.
10. But if the streams and clouds keep travelling, travelling,
11. the mountains look like the hulls of capsized ships,
12. slime-hung and barnacled.

13. Think of the long trip home.
14. Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?
15. Where should we be today?
16. Is it right to be watching strangers in a play
17. in this strangest of theatres?
18. What childishness is it that while there's a breath of life
19. in our bodies, we are determined to rush
20. to see the sun the other way around?
21. The tiniest green hummingbird in the world?
22. To stare at some inexplicable old stonework,
23. inexplicable and impenetrable,
24. at any view,
25. instantly seen and always, always delightful?
26. Oh, must we dream our dreams
27. and have them, too?
28. And have we room
29. for one more folded sunset, still quite warm?

30. But surely it would have been a pity
31. not to have seen the trees along this road,
32. really exaggerated in their beauty,
33. not to have seen them gesturing
34. like noble pantomimists, robed in pink.
35. - Not to have had to stop for gas and heard
36. the sad, two-noted, wooden tune
37. of disparate wooden clogs
38. carelessly clacking over
39. a grease-stained filling-station floor.
40. (In another country the clogs would all be tested.
41. Each pair there would have identical pitch.)
42. - A pity not to have heard
43. the other, less primitive music of the fat brown bird
44. who sings above the broken gasoline pump
45. in a bamboo church of Jesuit baroque:
46. three towers, five silver crosses.

47. - Yes, a pity not to have pondered,
48. blurr'dly and inconclusively,
49. on what connection can exist for centuries
50. between the crudest wooden footwear
51. and, careful and finicky,
52. the whittled fantasies of wooden cages
53. - Never to have studied history in
54. the weak calligraphy of songbirds' cages.
55. - And never to have had to listen to rain
56. so much like politicians' speeches:
57. two hours of unrelenting oratory
58. and then a sudden golden silence
59. in which the traveller takes a notebook, writes:

60. 'Is it lack of imagination that makes us come
61. to imagined places, not just stay at home?
62. Or could Pascal have been not entirely right
63. about just sitting quietly in one's room?

64. Continent, city, country, society:
65. the choice is never wide and never free.
66. And here, or there... No. Should we have stayed at home,
67. wherever that may be? '
