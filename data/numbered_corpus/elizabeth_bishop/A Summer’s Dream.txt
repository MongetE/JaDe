1. To the sagging wharf
2. few ships could come.
3. The population numbered
4. two giants, an idiot, a dwarf,

5. a gentle storekeeper
6. asleep behind his counter,
7. and our kind landlady—
8. the dwarf was her dressmaker.

9. The idiot could be beguiled
10. by picking blackberries,
11. but then threw them away.
12. The shrunken seamstress smiled.

13. By the sea, lying
14. blue as a mackerel,
15. our boarding house was streaked
16. as though it had been crying.

17. Extraordinary geraniums
18. crowded the front windows,
19. the floors glittered with
20. assorted linoleums.

21. Every night we listened
22. for a horned owl.
23. In the horned lamp flame,
24. the wallpaper glistened.

25. The giant with the stammer
26. was the landlady’s son,
27. grumbling on the stairs
28. over an old grammar.

29. He was morose,
30. but she was cheerful.
31. The bedroom was cold,
32. the feather bed close.

33. We were awakened in the dark by
34. the somnambulist brook
35. nearing the sea,
36. still dreaming audibly.
