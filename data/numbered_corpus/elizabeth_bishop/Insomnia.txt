1. The moon in the bureau mirror
2. looks out a million miles
3. (and perhaps with pride, at herself,
4. but she never, never smiles)
5. far and away beyond sleep, or
6. perhaps she's a daytime sleeper.

7. By the Universe deserted,
8. she'd tell it to go to hell,
9. and she'd find a body of water,
10. or a mirror, on which to dwell.
11. So wrap up care in a cobweb
12. and drop it down the well

13. into that world inverted
14. where left is always right,
15. where the shadows are really the body,
16. where we stay awake all night,
17. where the heavens are shallow as the sea
18. is now deep, and you love me.
