1. Remembering the Strait of Belle Isle or
2. some northerly harbor of Labrador,
3. before he became a schoolteacher
4. a great-uncle painted a big picture.

5. Receding for miles on either side
6. into a flushed, still sky
7. are overhanging pale blue cliffs
8. hundreds of feet high,

9. their bases fretted by little arches,
10. the entrances to caves
11. running in along the level of a bay
12. masked by perfect waves.

13. On the middle of that quiet floor
14. sits a fleet of small black ships,
15. square-rigged, sails furled, motionless,
16. their spars like burnt match-sticks.

17. And high above them, over the tall cliffs'
18. semi-translucent ranks,
19. are scribbled hundreds of fine black birds
20. hanging in n's in banks.

21. One can hear their crying, crying,
22. the only sound there is
23. except for occasional sizhine
24. as a large aquatic animal breathes.

25. In the pink light
26. the small red sun goes rolling, rolling,
27. round and round and round at the same height
28. in perpetual sunset, comprehensive, consoling,

29. while the ships consider it.
30. Apparently they have reached their destination.
31. It would be hard to say what brought them there,
32. commerce or contemplation.
