1. This celestial seascape, with white herons got up as angels,
2. flying high as they want and as far as they want sidewise
3. in tiers and tiers of immaculate reflections;
4. the whole region, from the highest heron
5. down to the weightless mangrove island
6. with bright green leaves edged neatly with bird-droppings
7. like illumination in silver,
8. and down to the suggestively Gothic arches of the mangrove roots
9. and the beautiful pea-green back-pasture
10. where occasionally a fish jumps, like a wildflower
11. in an ornamental spray of spray;
12. this cartoon by Raphael for a tapestry for a Pope:
13. it does look like heaven.
14. But a skeletal lighthouse standing there
15. in black and white clerical dress,
16. who lives on his nerves, thinks he knows better.
17. He thinks that hell rages below his iron feet,
18. that that is why the shallow water is so warm,
19. and he knows that heaven is not like this.
20. Heaven is not like flying or swimming,
21. but has something to do with blackness and a strong glare
22. and when it gets dark he will remember something
23. strongly worded to say on the subject.
