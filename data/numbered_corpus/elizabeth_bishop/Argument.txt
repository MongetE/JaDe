1. Days that cannot bring you near
2. or will not,
3. Distance trying to appear
4. something more obstinate,
5. argue argue argue with me
6. endlessly
7. neither proving you less wanted nor less dear.

8. Distance: Remember all that land
9. beneath the plane;
10. that coastline
11. of dim beaches deep in sand
12. stretching indistinguishably
13. all the way,
14. all the way to where my reasons end?

15. Days: And think
16. of all those cluttered instruments,
17. one to a fact,
18. canceling each other's experience;
19. how they were
20. like some hideous calendar
21. "Compliments of Never & Forever, Inc."

22. The intimidating sound
23. of these voices
24. we must separately find
25. can and shall be vanquished:
26. Days and Distance disarrayed again
27. and gone...
