1. He sleeps on the top of a mast. - Bunyan


2. He sleeps on the top of a mast
3. with his eyes fast closed.
4. The sails fall away below him
5. like the sheets of his bed,
6. leaving out in the air of the night the sleeper's head.

7. Asleep he was transported there,
8. asleep he curled
9. in a gilded ball on the mast's top,
10. or climbed inside
11. a gilded bird, or blindly seated himself astride.

12. "I am founded on marble pillars,"
13. said a cloud. "I never move.
14. See the pillars there in the sea?"
15. Secure in introspection
16. he peers at the watery pillars of his reflection.

17. A gull had wings under his
18. and remarked that the air
19. was "like marble." He said: "Up here
20. I tower through the sky
21. for the marble wings on my tower-top fly."

22. But he sleeps on the top of his mast
23. with his eyes closed tight.
24. The gull inquired into his dream,
25. which was, "I must not fall.
26. The spangled sea below wants me to fall.
27. It is hard as diamonds; it wants to destroy us all."
