1. It is marvellous to wake up together
2. At the same minute; marvellous to hear
3. The rain begin suddenly all over the roof,
4. To feel the air suddenly clear
5. As if electricity had passed through it
6. From a black mesh of wires in the sky.
7. All over the roof the rain hisses,
8. And below, the light falling of kisses.

9. An electrical storm is coming or moving away;
10. It is the prickling air that wakes us up.
11. If lighting struck the house now, it would run
12. From the four blue china balls on top
13. Down the roof and down the rods all around us,
14. And we imagine dreamily
15. How the whole house caught in a bird-cage of lightning
16. Would be quite delightful rather than frightening;

17. And from the same simplified point of view
18. Of night and lying flat on one's back
19. All things might change equally easily,
20. Since always to warn us there must be these black
21. Electrical wires dangling. Without surprise
22. The world might change to something quite different,
23. As the air changes or the lightning comes without our blinking,
24. Change as our kisses are changing without our thinking.
