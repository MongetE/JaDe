1. In the cold, cold parlor
2. my mother laid out Arthur
3. beneath the chromographs:
4. Edward, Prince of Wales,
5. with Princess Alexandra,
6. and King George with Queen Mary.
7. Below them on the table
8. stood a stuffed loon
9. shot and stuffed by Uncle
10. Arthur, Arthur's father.

11. Since Uncle Arthur fired
12. a bullet into him,
13. he hadn't said a word.
14. He kept his own counsel
15. on his white, frozen lake,
16. the marble-topped table.
17. His breast was deep and white,
18. cold and caressable;
19. his eyes were red glass,
20. much to be desired.

21. "Come," said my mother,
22. "Come and say good-bye
23. to your little cousin Arthur."
24. I was lifted up and given
25. one lily of the valley
26. to put in Arthur's hand.
27. Arthur's coffin was
28. a little frosted cake,
29. and the red-eyed loon eyed it
30. from his white, frozen lake.

31. Arthur was very small.
32. He was all white, like a doll
33. that hadn't been painted yet.
34. Jack Frost had started to paint him
35. the way he always painted
36. the Maple Leaf (Forever).
37. He had just begun on his hair,
38. a few red strokes, and then
39. Jack Frost had dropped the brush
40. and left him white, forever.

41. The gracious royal couples
42. were warm in red and ermine;
43. their feet were well wrapped up
44. in the ladies' ermine trains.
45. They invited Arthur to be
46. the smallest page at court.
47. But how could Arthur go,
48. clutching his tiny lily,
49. with his eyes shut up so tight
50. and the roads deep in snow?
