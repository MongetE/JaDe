1. Earliest morning, switching all the tracks
2. that cross the sky from cinder star to star,
3. coupling the ends of streets
4. to trains of light.

5. now draw us into daylight in our beds;
6. and clear away what presses on the brain:
7. put out the neon shapes
8. that float and swell and glare

9. down the gray avenue between the eyes
10. in pinks and yellows, letters and twitching signs.
11. Hang-over moons, wane, wane!
12. From the window I see

13. an immense city, carefully revealed,
14. made delicate by over-workmanship,
15. detail upon detail,
16. cornice upon facade,

17. reaching up so languidly up into
18. a weak white sky, it seems to waver there.
19. (Where it has slowly grown
20. in skies of water-glass

21. from fused beads of iron and copper crystals,
22. the little chemical "garden" in a jar
23. trembles and stands again,
24. pale blue, blue-green, and brick.)

25. The sparrows hurriedly begin their play.
26. Then, in the West, "Boom!" and a cloud of smoke.
27. "Boom!" and the exploding ball
28. of blossom blooms again.

29. (And all the employees who work in a plants
30. where such a sound says "Danger," or once said "Death,"
31. turn in their sleep and feel
32. the short hairs bristling

33. on backs of necks.) The cloud of smoke moves off.
34. A shirt is taken of a threadlike clothes-line.
35. Along the street below
36. the water-wagon comes

37. throwing its hissing, snowy fan across
38. peelings and newspapers.  The water dries
39. light-dry, dark-wet, the pattern
40. of the cool watermelon.

41. I hear the day-springs of the morning strike
42. from stony walls and halls and iron beds,
43. scattered or grouped cascades,
44. alarms for the expected:

45. queer cupids of all persons getting up,
46. whose evening meal they will prepare all day,
47. you will dine well
48. on his heart, on his, and his,

49. so send them about your business affectionately,
50. dragging in the streets their unique loves.
51. Scourge them with roses only,
52. be light as helium,

53. for always to one, or several, morning comes
54. whose head has fallen over the edge of his bed,
55. whose face is turned
56. so that the image of

57. the city grows down into his open eyes
58. inverted and distorted.  No.  I mean
59. distorted and revealed,
60. if he sees it at all.
