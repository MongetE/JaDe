1. A new volcano has erupted,
2. the papers say, and last week I was reading
3. where some ship saw an island being born:
4. at first a breath of steam, ten miles away;
5. and then a black fleck—basalt, probably—
6. rose in the mate's binoculars
7. and caught on the horizon like a fly.
8. They named it. But my poor old island's still
9. un-rediscovered, un-renamable.
10. None of the books has ever got it right.

11. Well, I had fifty-two
12. miserable, small volcanoes I could climb
13. with a few slithery strides—
14. volcanoes dead as ash heaps.
15. I used to sit on the edge of the highest one
16. and count the others standing up,
17. naked and leaden, with their heads blown off.
18. I'd think that if they were the size
19. I thought volcanoes should be, then I had
20. become a giant;
21. and if I had become a giant,
22. I couldn't bear to think what size
23. the goats and turtles were,
24. or the gulls, or the overlapping rollers
25. —a glittering hexagon of rollers
26. closing and closing in, but never quite,
27. glittering and glittering, though the sky
28. was mostly overcast.

29. My island seemed to be
30. a sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere's
31. left-over clouds arrived and hung
32. above the craters—their parched throats
33. were hot to touch.
34. Was that why it rained so much?
35. And why sometimes the whole place hissed?
36. The turtles lumbered by, high-domed,
37. hissing like teakettles.
38. (And I'd have given years, or taken a few,
39. for any sort of kettle, of course.)
40. The folds of lava, running out to sea,
41. would hiss. I'd turn. And then they'd prove
42. to be more turtles.
43. The beaches were all lava, variegated,
44. black, red, and white, and gray;
45. the marbled colors made a fine display.
46. And I had waterspouts. Oh,
47. half a dozen at a time, far out,
48. they'd come and go, advancing and retreating,
49. their heads in cloud, their feet in moving patches
50. of scuffed-up white.
51. Glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,
52. sacerdotal beings of glass ... I watched
53. the water spiral up in them like smoke.
54. Beautiful, yes, but not much company.

55. I often gave way to self-pity.
56. "Do I deserve this? I suppose I must.
57. I wouldn't be here otherwise. Was there
58. a moment when I actually chose this?
59. I don't remember, but there could have been."
60. What's wrong about self-pity, anyway?
61. With my legs dangling down familiarly
62. over a crater's edge, I told myself
63. "Pity should begin at home." So the more
64. pity I felt, the more I felt at home.

65. The sun set in the sea; the same odd sun
66. rose from the sea,
67. and there was one of it and one of me.
68. The island had one kind of everything:
69. one tree snail, a bright violet-blue
70. with a thin shell, crept over everything,
71. over the one variety of tree,
72. a sooty, scrub affair.
73. Snail shells lay under these in drifts
74. and, at a distance,
75. you'd swear that they were beds of irises.
76. There was one kind of berry, a dark red.
77. I tried it, one by one, and hours apart.
78. Sub-acid, and not bad, no ill effects;
79. and so I made home-brew. I'd drink
80. the awful, fizzy, stinging stuff
81. that went straight to my head
82. and play my home-made flute
83. (I think it had the weirdest scale on earth)
84. and, dizzy, whoop and dance among the goats.
85. Home-made, home-made! But aren't we all?
86. I felt a deep affection for
87. the smallest of my island industries.
88. No, not exactly, since the smallest was
89. a miserable philosophy.

90. Because I didn't know enough.
91. Why didn't I know enough of something?
92. Greek drama or astronomy? The books
93. I'd read were full of blanks;
94. the poems—well, I tried
95. reciting to my iris-beds,
96. "They flash upon that inward eye,
97. which is the bliss ..." The bliss of what?
98. One of the first things that I did
99. when I got back was look it up.

100. The island smelled of goat and guano.
101. The goats were white, so were the gulls,
102. and both too tame, or else they thought
103. I was a goat, too, or a gull.
104. Baa, baa, baa and shriek, shriek, shriek,
105. baa ... shriek ... baa ... I still can't shake
106. them from my ears; they're hurting now.
107. The questioning shrieks, the equivocal replies
108. over a ground of hissing rain
109. and hissing, ambulating turtles
110. got on my nerves.
111. When all the gulls flew up at once, they sounded
112. like a big tree in a strong wind, its leaves.
113. I'd shut my eyes and think about a tree,
114. an oak, say, with real shade, somewhere.
115. I'd heard of cattle getting island-sick.
116. I thought the goats were.
117. One billy-goat would stand on the volcano
118. I'd christened Mont d'Espoir or Mount Despair
119. (I'd time enough to play with names),
120. and bleat and bleat, and sniff the air.
121. I'd grab his beard and look at him.
122. His pupils, horizontal, narrowed up
123. and expressed nothing, or a little malice.
124. I got so tired of the very colors!
125. One day I dyed a baby goat bright red
126. with my red berries, just to see
127. something a little different.
128. And then his mother wouldn't recognize him.

129. Dreams were the worst. Of course I dreamed of food
130. and love, but they were pleasant rather
131. than otherwise. But then I'd dream of things
132. like slitting a baby's throat, mistaking it
133. for a baby goat. I'd have
134. nightmares of other islands
135. stretching away from mine, infinities
136. of islands, islands spawning islands,
137. like frogs' eggs turning into polliwogs
138. of islands, knowing that I had to live
139. on each and every one, eventually,
140. for ages, registering their flora,
141. their fauna, their geography.

142. Just when I thought I couldn't stand it
143. another minute longer, Friday came.
144. (Accounts of that have everything all wrong.)
145. Friday was nice.
146. Friday was nice, and we were friends.
147. If only he had been a woman!
148. I wanted to propagate my kind,
149. and so did he, I think, poor boy.
150. He'd pet the baby goats sometimes,
151. and race with them, or carry one around.
152. —Pretty to watch; he had a pretty body.

153. And then one day they came and took us off.

154. Now I live here, another island,
155. that doesn't seem like one, but who decides?
156. My blood was full of them; my brain
157. bred islands. But that archipelago
158. has petered out. I'm old.
159. I'm bored, too, drinking my real tea,
160. surrounded by uninteresting lumber.
161. The knife there on the shelf—
162. it reeked of meaning, like a crucifix.
163. It lived. How many years did I
164. beg it, implore it, not to break?
165. I knew each nick and scratch by heart,
166. the bluish blade, the broken tip,
167. the lines of wood-grain on the handle ...
168. Now it won't look at me at all.
169. The living soul has dribbled away.
170. My eyes rest on it and pass on.

171. The local museum's asked me to
172. leave everything to them:
173. the flute, the knife, the shrivelled shoes,
174. my shedding goatskin trousers
175. (moths have got in the fur),
176. the parasol that took me such a time
177. remembering the way the ribs should go.
178. It still will work but, folded up,
179. looks like a plucked and skinny fowl.
180. How can anyone want such things?
181. —And Friday, my dear Friday, died of measles
182. seventeen years ago come March.
