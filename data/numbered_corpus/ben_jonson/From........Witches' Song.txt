1. The owl is abroad,the bat and the toad,
2. And so is the cat-a mountain,
3. The ant and the mole sit both in a hole,
4. And frog peeps out o'the fountain;
5. The dogs they do bay,and the timbrels play,
6. The spindle is now a-turning;
7. The moon it is red,and the stars are fled,
8. And all the sky is a-burning.
