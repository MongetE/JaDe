1. This morning, timely rapt with holy fire,
2. I thought to form unto my zealous Muse
3. What kind of creature I could most desire,
4. To honour, serve, and love; as poets use.
5. I meant to make her fair, and free, and wise,
6. Of greatest blood, and yet more good than great;
7. I meant the day-star should not brighter rise,
8. Nor lend like influence from his lucent seat.
9. I meant she should be courteous, facile, sweet,
10. Hating that solemn vice of greatness, pride;
11. I meant each softest virtue there should meet,
12. Fit in that softer bosom to reside.
13. Only a learn√®d and a manly soul
14. I purposed her; that should, with even powers,
15. The rock, the spindle, and the shears control
16. Of Destiny, and spin her own free hours.
17. Such when I meant to feign, and wished to see,
18. My Muse bade
19. Bedford
20. write, and that was she.
