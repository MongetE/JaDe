1. To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of that Noble Pair, Sir Lucius
2. Cary and Sir Henry Morison.


3. I.

4. THE TURN.

5. Brave infant of Saguntum, clear
6. Thy coming forth in that great year,
7. When the prodigious Hannibal did crown
8. His cage, with razing your immortal town.
9. Thou, looking then about,
10. Ere thou wert half got out,
11. Wise child, didst hastily return,
12. And mad'st thy mother's womb thine urn.
13. How summed a circle didst thou leave mankind
14. Of deepest lore, could we the centre find!

15. THE COUNTER-TURN.

16. Did wiser nature draw thee back,
17. From out the horror of that sack,
18. Where shame, faith, honour, and regard of right,
19. Lay trampled on? the deeds of death and night,
20. Urged, hurried forth, and hurled
21. Upon th' affrighted world;
22. Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met,
23. And all on utmost ruin set;
24. As, could they but life's miseries foresee,
25. No doubt all infants would return like thee.

26. THE STAND.

27. For what is life, if measured by the space
28. Not by the act?
29. Or masked man, if valued by his face,
30. Above his fact?
31. Here's one outlived his peers,
32. And told forth fourscore years;
33. He vexed time, and busied the whole state;
34. Troubled both foes and friends;
35. But ever to no ends:
36. What did this stirrer but die late?
37. How well at twenty had he fallen or stood!
38. For three of his fourscore he did no good.

39. II.

40. THE TURN

41. He entered well, by virtuous parts,
42. Got up, and thrived with honest arts;
43. He purchased friends, and fame, and honours then,
44. And had his noble name advanced with men:
45. But weary of that flight,
46. He stooped in all men's sight
47. To sordid flatteries, acts of strife,
48. And sunk in that dead sea of life,
49. So deep, as he did then death's waters sup,
50. But that the cork of title buoyed him up.

51. THE COUNTER-TURN

52. Alas! but Morison fell young:
53. He never fell,--thou fall'st, my tongue.
54. He stood a soldier to the last right end,
55. A perfect patriot, and a noble friend;
56. But most, a virtuous son.
57. All offices were done
58. By him, so ample, full, and round,
59. In weight, in measure, number, sound,
60. As, though his age imperfect might appear,
61. His life was of humanity the sphere.

62. THE STAND

63. Go now, and tell out days summed up with fears,
64. And make them years;
65. Produce thy mass of miseries on the stage,
66. To swell thine age;
67. Repeat of things a throng,
68. To show thou hast been long,
69. Not lived: for life doth her great actions spell.
70. By what was done and wrought
71. In season, and so brought
72. To light: her measures are, how well
73. Each syllabe answered, and was formed, how fair;
74. These make the lines of life, and that's her air!

75. III.

76. THE TURN

77. It is not growing like a tree
78. In bulk, doth make men better be;
79. Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,
80. To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear:
81. A lily of a day,
82. Is fairer far in May,
83. Although it fall and die that night;
84. It was the plant, and flower of light.
85. In small proportions we just beauties see;
86. And in short measures, life may perfect be.

87. THE COUNTER-TURN

88. Call, noble Lucius, then for wine,
89. And let thy looks with gladness shine:
90. Accept this garland, plant it on thy head
91. And think, nay know, thy Morison's not dead
92. He leaped the present age,
93. Possessed with holy rage
94. To see that bright eternal day;
95. Of which we priests and poets say,
96. Such truths, as we expect for happy men:
97. And there he lives with memory and Ben.

98. THE STAND

99. Jonson, who sung this of him, ere he went,
100. Himself to rest,
101. Or taste a part of that full joy he meant
102. To have expressed,
103. In this bright Asterism!
104. Where it were friendship's schism,
105. Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry,
106. To separate these twi-
107. Lights, the Dioscouri;
108. And keep the one half from his Harry,
109. But fate doth so alternate the design
110. Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine.

111. IV.

112. THE TURN

113. And shine as you exalted are;
114. Two names of friendship, but one star:
115. Of hearts the union, and those not by chance
116. Made, or indenture, or leased out t'advance
117. The profits for a time.
118. No pleasures vain did chime,
119. Of rhymes, or riots, at your feasts,
120. Orgies of drink, or feigned protests:
121. But simple love of greatness and of good,
122. That knits brave minds and manners more than blood.

123. THE COUNTER-TURN

124. This made you first to know the why
125. You liked, then after, to apply
126. That liking; and approach so one the t'other,
127. Till either grew a portion of the other:
128. Each styled by his end,
129. The copy of his friend.
130. You lived to be the great sir-names,
131. And titles, by which all made claims
132. Unto the virtue; nothing perfect done,
133. But as a Cary, or a Morison.

134. THE STAND

135. And such a force the fair example had,
136. As they that saw
137. The good, and durst not practise it, were glad
138. That such a law
139. Was left yet to mankind;
140. Where they might read and find
141. Friendship, indeed, was written not in words;
142. And with the heart, not pen,
143. Of two so early men,
144. Whose lines her rolls were, and records;
145. Who, ere the first down bloomed upon the chin,
146. Had sowed these fruits, and got the harvest in.
