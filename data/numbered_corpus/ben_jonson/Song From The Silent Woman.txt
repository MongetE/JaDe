1. Still to be neat, still to be dressed,
2. As you were going to a feast;
3. Still to be powdered, still perfumed:
4. Lady, it is to be presumed,
5. Though art's hid causes are not found,
6. All is not sweet, all is not sound.

7. Give me a look, give me a face,
8. That makes simplicity a grace;
9. Robes loosely flowing, hair as free;
10. Such sweet neglect more taketh me
11. Than all th' adulteries of art:
12. They strike mine eyes, but not my heart.
