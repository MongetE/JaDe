1. Good, and great God, can I not think of thee,
2. But it must, straight, my melancholy bee?
3. Is it interpreted in mee disease,
4. That, laden with my sinnes. I seeke for ease?
5. O, be thou witnesse, that the reines dost know,
6. And hearts of all, if I be sad for show,
7. And judge mee after: if I dare pretend
8. To ought but grace, or ayme at other end.
9. As thou art all, so be thou all to mee,
10. First, midst, and last, converted one, and three;
11. My faith, my hope, my love: and in this state,
12. My judge, my witnesse, and my advocate.
13. Where have I been this while exil'd from thee?
14. And whither rapt, now thou but stoup'st to mee?
15. Dwell, dwell here still: O, being every-where,
16. How can I doubt to finde thee ever, here?
17. I know my state, both full of shame, and scorne,
18. Conceiv'd in sinne, and unto labour borne,
19. Standing with feare, and must with horror fall,
20. And destin'd unto judgement, after all.
21. I feele my griefes too, and there scarce is ground,
22. Upon my flesh t'inflict another wound.
23. Yet dare I not complaine, or wish for death
24. With holy Paul, lest it be thought the breath
25. Of Discontent; or that these prayers bee
26. For wearinesse of life, not love of thee.
