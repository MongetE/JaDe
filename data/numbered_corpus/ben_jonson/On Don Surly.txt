1. Don Surly, to aspire the glorious name
2. Of a great man, and to be thought the same,
3. Makes serious use of all great trade he know.
4. He speaks to men with a Rhinocerotes' nose,
5. Which he thinks great; and so reads verses too,
6. And that is done as he saw great men do.
7. He has timpanies of business in his face,
8. And can forget men's names with a great grace.
9. He will both argue and discourse in oaths,
10. Both which are great; and laugh at ill-made clothes-
11. That's greater yet-to cry his own up neat.
12. He doth, at meals, alone his pheasant eat,
13. Which is main greatness; and at his still board
14. He drinks to no man; that's, too, like a lord.
15. He keeps another's wife, which is a spice
16. Of solemn greatness. And he dares, at dice,
17. Blaspheme God greatly, or some poor hind beat
18. That breathes in his dog's way; and this is great.
19. Nay more, for greatness' sake, he will be one
20. May hear my epigrams, but like of none,
21. Surly, use other arts; these only can
22. Style thee a most great fool, but no great man.
