1. I now think love is rather deaf, than blind,
2. For else it could not be,
3. That she,
4. Whom I adore so much, should so slight me,
5. And cast my love behind:
6. I'm sure my language was as sweet,
7. And every close did meet
8. In sentence of as subtle feet
9. As hath the youngest he,
10. That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree.

11. Oh, but my conscious fears,
12. That fly my thoughts between,
13. Tell me that she hath seen
14. My hundreds of gray hairs,
15. Told seven and forty years,
16. Read so much waist, as she cannot embrace
17. My mountain belly and my rock face,
18. As all these, through her eyes, have stopt her ears.
