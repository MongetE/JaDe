1. My son finds occupation
2. in almost nothing, in everything:
3. my soapy penitential toothpaste,
4. his mother's loosened hair
5. orts, containers, useless things;
6. watches as I pee
7. as at Victoria Falls,
8. once pushed his head between my knees
9. to risk some sort of baptism.

10. Before his birth I thought
11. I had room for no more love:
12. now when he (say) hurts himself
13. love, consideration, care
14. (copies from the originals)
15. as if burst inside me.

16. Undoggedly I interest myself
17. in his uninteresting concerns,
18. grow backward to him,
19. more than hoping to find
20. a forward interest for myself.
