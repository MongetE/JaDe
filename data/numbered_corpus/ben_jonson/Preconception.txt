1. I have no children:

2. But tonight a poem came
3. in which a small child,
4. my daughter, appeared at the door
5. of a half-lit room
6. where late one night I wrote
7. at a heavy desk.

8. And though interruption
9. was hardly welcome
10. I took her to myself,
11. just as the poem,
12. comforted this daughter
13. until she found peace.

14. The poems as the children
15. come as they will come.
