1. If I freely can discover
2. What would please me in my lover,
3. I would have her fair and witty,
4. Savouring more of court than city;
5. A little proud, but full of pity;
6. Light and humourous in her toying;
7. Oft building hopes, and soon destroying;
8. Long, but sweet in the enjoying,
9. Neither too easy, nor too hard:
10. All extremes I would have barred.

11. She should be allowed her passions,
12. So they were but used as fashions;
13. Sometimes froward, and then frowning,
14. Sometimes sickish, and then swowning,
15. Every fit with change still crowning.
16. Purely jealous I would have her;
17. Then only constant when I crave her,
18. â€™Tis a virtue should not save her.
19. Thus, nor her delicates would cloy me,
20. Neither her peevishness annoy me.
