1. Queen and huntress, chaste and fair,
2. Now the sun is laid to sleep,
3. Seated in thy silver chair
4. State in wonted manner keep:
5. Hesperus entreats thy light,
6. Goddess excellently bright.
7. Earth, let not thy envious shade
8. Dare itself to interpose;
9. Cynthia's shining orb was made
10. Heaven to clear when day did close:
11. Bless us then with wished sight,
12. Goddess excellently bright.
13. Lay thy bow of pearl apart
14. And thy crystal-shining quiver;
15. Give unto the flying hart
16. Space to breathe, how short soever:
17. Thou that mak'st a day of night,
18. Goddess excellently bright.
