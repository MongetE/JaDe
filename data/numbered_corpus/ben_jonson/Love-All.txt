1. The decorously informative church
2. Guide to Sex suggested that any urge
3. could well be controlled by playing tennis:
4. and the game provided also 'many
5. harmless opportunities for healthy
6. social intercourse between the sexes.'

7. For weeks the drawings in the Guide misled
8. me as to what went where, but nonetheless
9. I booked the public courts and learnt the game
10. with other curious youths of my age:
11. and later joined a club, to lose six one,
12. six love, in the first round of the Open.

13. But the only girl I ever met had
14. her 'energies channelled' far too bloody
15. 'healthily', and very quickly let me
16. know that love was merely another means
17. of saying nil. It was not as though I
18. became any good at tennis; either.
