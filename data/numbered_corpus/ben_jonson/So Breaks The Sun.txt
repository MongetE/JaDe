1. So breaks the sun earth's rugged chains,
2. Wherein rude winter bound her veins;
3. So grows both stream and source of price,
4. That lately fettered were with ice.
5. So naked trees get crisped heads,
6. And colored coats the roughest meads,
7. And all get vigor, youth, and sprite,
8. That are but looked on by his light.
