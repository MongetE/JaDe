1. The Turn


2. Brave infant of Saguntum, clear
3. Thy coming forth in that great year,
4. When the prodigious Hannibal did crown
5. His rage, with razing your immortal town.
6. Thou looking then about
7. Ere thou wert half got out,
8. Wise child, didst hastily return,
9. And mad'st thy mother's womb thine urn.
10. How summed a circle didst thou leave mankind
11. Of deepest lore, could we the centre find!



12. The Counter-Turn


13. Did wiser nature draw thee back
14. From out the horror of that sack,
15. Where shame, faith, honour, and regard of right,
16. Lay trampled on?-the deeds of death and night
17. Urged, hurried forth, and hurled
18. Upon th' affrighted world?
19. Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met,
20. And all on utmost ruin set:
21. As, could they but life's miseries foresee,
22. No doubt all infants would return like thee.



23. The Stand


24. For what is life, if measured by the space,
25. Not by the act?
26. Or maskèd man, if valued by his face,
27. Above his fact?
28. Here's one outlived his peers
29. And told forth fourscore years:
30. He vexèd time, and busied the whole state,
31. Troubled both foes and friends,
32. But ever to no ends:
33. What did this stirrer but die late?
34. How well at twenty had he fall'n or stood!
35. For three of his four score, he did no good.



36. The Turn


37. He entered well, by virtuous parts,
38. Got up and thrived with honest arts:
39. He purchased friends, and fame, and honours then,
40. And had his noble name advanced with men;
41. But, weary of that flight,
42. He stooped in all men's sight
43. To sordid flatteries, acts of strife,
44. And sunk in that dead sea of life
45. So deep, as he did then death's waters sup,
46. But that the cork of title buoyed him up.



47. The Counter-Turn


48. Alas, but Morison fell young;-
49. He never fell, thou fall'st, my tongue.
50. He stood, a soldier to the last right end,
51. A perfect patriot and a noble friend,
52. But most a virtuous son.
53. All offices were done
54. By him, so ample, full, and round
55. In weight, in measure, number, sound,
56. As, though his age imperfect might appear,
57. His life was of humanity the sphere.



58. The Stand


59. Go now, and tell out days summed up with fears,
60. And make them years;
61. Produce thy mass of miseries on the stage
62. To swell thine age;
63. Repeat of things a throng,
64. To show thou hast been long,
65. Not lived; for life doth her great actions spell,
66. By what was done and wrought
67. In season, and so brought
68. To light: her measures are, how well
69. Each syllab'e answered, and was formed how fair;
70. These make the lines of life, and that's her air.



71. The Turn


72. It is not growing like a tree
73. In bulk, doth make men better be,
74. Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,
75. To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere:
76. A lily of a day
77. Is fairer far in May,
78. Although it fall and die that night;
79. It was the plant and flower of light.
80. In small proportions we just beauties see;
81. And in short measures life may perfect be.



82. The Counter-Turn


83. Call, noble Lucius, then for wine,
84. And let thy looks with gladness shine:
85. Accept this garland, plant it on thy head,
86. And think, nay, know, thy Morison's not dead.
87. He leaped the present age,
88. Possest with holy rage,
89. To see that bright eternal day,
90. Of which we priests and poets say
91. Such truths as we expect for happy men,
92. And there he lives with memory: and Ben



93. The Stand


94. Jonson, who sung this of him ere he went
95. Himself to rest,
96. Or taste a part of that full joy he meant
97. To have expressed
98. In this bright asterism:
99. Where it were friendship's schism,
100. (Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry)
101. To separate these twi-
102. Lights, the Dioscuri,
103. And keep the one half from his Harry.
104. But fate doth so alternate the design,
105. Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine.



106. The Turn


107. And shine as you exalted are,
108. Two names of friendship, but one star,
109. Of hearts the union. And those not by chance
110. Made, or indentured, or leased out t' advance
111. The profits for a time.
112. No pleasures vain did chime
113. Of rhymes, or riots at your feasts,
114. Orgies of drink, or feigned protests;
115. But simple love of greatness and of good
116. That knits brave minds and manners, more than blood.



117. The Counter-Turn


118. This made you first to know the why
119. You liked, then after to apply
120. That liking; and approach so one the t'other,
121. Till either grew a portion of the other;
122. Each stylèd by his end,
123. The copy of his friend.
124. You lived to be the great surnames
125. And titles by which all made claims
126. Unto the virtue: nothing perfect done,
127. But as a Cary or a Morison.



128. The Stand


129. And such a force the fair example had,
130. As they that saw
131. The good and durst not practise it, were glad
132. That such a law
133. Was left yet to mankind;
134. Where they might read and find
135. Friendship in deed was written, not in words.
136. And with the heart, not pen,
137. Of two so early men,
138. Whose lives her rolls were, and records,
139. Who, ere the first down bloomèd on the chin
140. Had sow'd these fruits, and got the harvest in.
