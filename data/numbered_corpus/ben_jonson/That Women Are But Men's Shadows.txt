1. Follow a shadow, it still flies you;
2. Seem to fly it, it will pursue:
3. So court a mistress, she denies you;
4. Let her alone, she will court you.
5. Say, are not women truly then
6. Styled but the shadows of us men?
7. At morn and even shades are longest,
8. At noon they are or short or none;
9. So men at weakest, they are strongest,
10. But grant us perfect, they're not known.
11. Say, are not women truly then
12. Styled but the shadows of us men?
