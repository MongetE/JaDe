1. For love's sake, kiss me once again;
2. I long, and should not beg in vain,
3. Here's none to spy or see;
4. Why do you doubt or stay?
5. I'll taste as lightly as the bee
6. That doth but touch his flower and flies away.

7. Once more, and faith I will be gone;
8. Can he that loves ask less than one?
9. Nay, you may err in this
10. And all your bounty wrong;
11. This could be called but half a kiss,
12. What we're but once to do, we should do long.

13. I will but mend the last, and tell
14. Where, how it should have relished well;
15. Join lip to lip, and try
16. Each suck other's breath.
17. And whilst our tongues perplexed lie,
18. Let who will, think us dead or wish our death.
