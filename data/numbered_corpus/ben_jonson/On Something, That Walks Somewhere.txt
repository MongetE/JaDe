1. At court I met it, in clothes brave enough
2. To be a courtier, and looks grave enough
3. To seem a statesman: as I near it came,
4. It made me a great face. I asked the name.
5. 'A lord,' it cried, 'buried in flesh and blood,
6. And such from whom let no man hope least good,
7. For I will do none; and as little ill,
8. For I will dare none.' Good lord, walk dead still.
