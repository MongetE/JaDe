1. Here lies, to each her parents' ruth,
2. Mary, the daughter of their youth;
3. Yet all heaven's gifts being heaven's due,
4. It makes the father less to rue.
5. At six months' end she parted hence
6. With safety of her innocence;
7. Whose soul heaven's queen, whose name she bears,
8. In comfort of her mother's tears,
9. Hath placed amongst her virgin-train:
10. Where, while that severed doth remain,
11. This grave partakes the fleshly birth;
12. Which cover lightly, gentle earth!
