1. Why do we lie

2. ’Why do we lie,’ she questioned, her warm eyes
3. on the grey Autumn wind and its coursing,
4. ’all afternoon wasted in bed like this?’
5. ’Because we cannot lie all night together.’
6. ’Yes,’ she said, satisfied at my reasoning,
7. but going on to search her cruel mind
8. for better excuses to leave my narrow bed.

9. Too many flesh suppers

10. Abstracted in art,
11. in architecture,
12. in scholars’ detail;

13. absorbed by music,
14. by minutiae,
15. by sad trivia;

16. all to efface her,
17. whom I can forget
18. no more than breathing.

19. Theatregoer

20. Somewhere some nights she sees
21. curtains rise on those rites
22. we also knew and felt

23. I sit here desolate
24. in spite of company

25. Love is between people

26. And should she die?

27. And should she die tonight,
28. with this three years’ difference
29. as well between us now?

30. Or no, be maimed perhaps
31. and bearing pain, to live
32. on damages for life?

33. In any case, I wish
34. her no good, whom I loved
35. as Brunel loved iron.

36. All this Sunday long

37. All this Sunday long it has snowed,
38. and I weighted with the old grief
39. struggling to unseat her from my mind.

40. Yet winnowing our past I cannot find
41. a snow-gilded scene however brief:
42. thus do I wilfully increase my load.

43. Spatial Definition

44. Razed the room in which
45. we made so much love:

46. I try to re-place
47. it in space against
48. the windracked planetrees:

49. my eyes quarter air.

50. Able at last

51. ’Able at last,’ she writes,
52. ’to see things as they were,
53. I wonder we were so blind
54. to think our trust could bind
55. instead of just defer.’

56. I shudder at her fall,
57. for that was, from the heights,
58. not how it was at all.

59. Arrived at the place

60. Arrived at the place
61. to which I always
62. said I was going:

63. comfortless for lack
64. of her who chose not
65. to travel with me:

66. too aware of my way
67. to wherever next
68. is also alone.

69. Knowledge

70. Knowledge of her was
71. earned like miners’ pay:

72. afterwards I sought
73. friends’ knowledge of her:

74. now I need to know
75. nothing of this girl:

76. she whom once I knew
77. as my tongue my mouth.
