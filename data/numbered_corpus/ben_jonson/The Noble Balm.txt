1. HIGH-SPIRITED friend,
2. I send nor balms nor cor'sives to your wound:
3. Your fate hath found
4. A gentler and more agile hand to tend
5. The cure of that which is but corporal;
6. And doubtful days, which were named critical,
7. Have made their fairest flight
8. And now are out of sight.
9. Yet doth some wholesome physic for the mind
10. Wrapp'd in this paper lie,
11. Which in the taking if you misapply,
12. You are unkind.

13. Your covetous hand,
14. Happy in that fair honour it hath gain'd,
15. Must now be rein'd.
16. True valour doth her own renown command
17. In one full action; nor have you now more
18. To do, than be a husband of that store.
19. Think but how dear you bought
20. This fame which you have caught:
21. Such thoughts will make you more in love with truth.
22. 'Tis wisdom, and that high,
23. For men to use their fortune reverently,
24. Even in youth.
