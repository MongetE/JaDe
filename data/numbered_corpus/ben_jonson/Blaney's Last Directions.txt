1. It is usual
2. for people in this country
3. (out of pretended respect
4. but rather from an impertinent curiosity)
5. to desire to see
6. persons
7. after they are
8. dead.

9. It is my earnest request that no person
10. on any pretence whatever
11. may be permitted to see my
12. corpse
13. but those who
14. unavoidably must.

15. I desire to be buried
16. in the north side of the churchyard
17. of Tregynon
18. somewhere about the centre
19. my coffin to be made in the most
20. plain and simple manner
21. without the usual fantastical decorations
22. and the more
23. perishable the material
24. the better.

25. I desire that no undertaker
26. or professed performer of funerals
27. may be employed:
28. but that I may be conveyed
29. to the churchyard
30. in some country hears
31. which may be hired for the occasion
32. and my corpse
33. to be carried
34. from hearse to the grave
35. immediately
36. without going into the church
37. by six of the chief Tregynon tenants
38. to whom I give two guineas each
39. for their trouble.

40. It is my earnes request and desire
41. to have no upper bearers
42. or any persons whatever
43. invited to my funeral
44. which I desire may be at so
45. early an hour as will best prevent
46. a concourse of people
47. from collecting together:
48. the better sort
49. I presume will not intrude
50. as there is no
51. invitation.

52. I have been present at the funerals
53. of three of my uncles at Morville.
54. I was pleased with the privacy and decency
55. with which all things were conducted:
56. no strangers attended
57. all was done
58. by the servants of the family.
59. It is my earnest desire to follow these examples
60. however unpopular
61. and that
62. no coach
63. no escutcheon
64. and no pomp of any kind may appear.

65. I trust that my executor will be well justified
66. against the clamor and obloquy
67. of mercenary people
68. when he acts in performance of the last request
69. of a dying friend
70. who solemnly adjures him in the name of God
71. punctually to observe these directions.

72. codicil
73. I likewise give to all my servants
74. five guineas each
75. in lieu of all mourning
76. which it is my desire
77. no person may use on my account.
