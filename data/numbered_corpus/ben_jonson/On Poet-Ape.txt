1. Poor POET-APE, that would be thought our chief,
2. Whose works are e'en the frippery of wit,
3. From brokage is become so bold a thief,
4. As we, the robbed, leave rage, and pity it.
5. At first he made low shifts, would pick and glean,
6. Buy the reversion of old plays; now grown
7. To a little wealth, and credit in the scene,
8. He takes up all, makes each man's wit his own.
9. And, told of this, he slights it. Tut, such crimes
10. The sluggish gaping auditor devours;
11. He marks not whose 'twas first: and after-times
12. May judge it to be his, as well as ours.
13. Fool, as if half eyes will not know a fleece
14. From locks of wool, or shreds from the whole piece!
