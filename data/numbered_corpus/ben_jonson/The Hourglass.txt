1. Do but consider this small dust
2. Here running in the glass,
3. By atoms moved;
4. Could you believe that this
5. The body was
6. Of one that loved?
7. And in his mistress' flame, playing like a fly,
8. Turned to cinders by her eye?
9. Yes; and in death, as life, unblessed,
10. To have't expressed,
11. Even ashes of lovers find no rest.
