1. Drink to me only with thine eyes,
2. And I will pledge with mine;
3. Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
4. And I'll not look for wine.

5. The thirst that from the soul doth rise
6. Doth ask a drink divine;
7. But might I of Jove's nectar sup,
8. I would not change for thine.

9. I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
10. Not so much honouring thee
11. As giving it a hope, that there
12. It could not withered be.

13. But thou thereon didst only breathe,
14. And sent'st it back to me;
15. Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,
16. Not of itself, but thee.
