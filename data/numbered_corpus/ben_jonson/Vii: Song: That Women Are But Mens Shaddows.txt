1. Follow a shaddow, it still flies you,
2. Seeme to flye it, it will pursue:
3. So court a mistris, she denies you;
4. Let her alone, she will court you.
5. Say, are not women truly, then,
6. Stil'd but the shaddows of us men?At morne, and even, shades are longest;
7. At noone, they are short, or none:
8. So men at weakest, they are strongest,
9. But grant us perfect, they're not knowne.
10. Say, are not women truly, then,
11. Stil'd but the shaddows of us men?
