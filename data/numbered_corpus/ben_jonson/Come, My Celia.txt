1. Come, my Celia, let us prove
2. While we may, the sports of love;
3. Time will not be ours forever;
4. He at length our good will sever.
5. Spend not then his gifts in vain.
6. Suns that set may rise again;
7. But if once we lose this light,
8. 'Tis with us perpetual night.
9. Why should we defer our joys?
10. Fame and rumor are but toys.
11. Cannot we delude the eyes
12. Of a few poor household spies,
13. Or his easier ears beguile,
14. So removed by our wile?
15. 'Tis no sin love's fruit to steal;
16. But the sweet theft to reveal.
17. To be taken, to be seen,
18. These have crimes accounted been.
