1. Beauties, have ye seen this toy,
2. Called Love, a little boy,
3. Almost naked, wanton, blind;
4. Cruel now, and then as kind?
5. If he be amongst ye, say?
6. He is Venus' runaway.

7. She that will but now discover
8. Where the winged wag doth hover,
9. Shall to-night receive a kiss,
10. How or where herself would wish:
11. But who brings him to his mother,
12. Shall have that kiss, and another.

13. He hath marks about him plenty:
14. You shall know him among twenty.
15. All his body is a fire,
16. And his breath a flame entire,
17. That, being shot like lightning in,
18. Wounds the heart, but not the skin.

19. At his sight, the sun hath turned,
20. Neptune in the waters burned;
21. Hell hath felt a greater heat;
22. Jove himself forsook his seat:
23. From the centre to the sky,
24. Are his trophies reared high.

25. Wings he hath, which though ye clip,
26. He will leap from lip to lip,
27. Over liver, lights, and heart,
28. But not stay in any part;
29. But if chance his arrow misses,
30. He will shoot himself in kisses.

31. He doth bear a golden bow,
32. And a quiver, hanging low,
33. Full of arrows, that outbrave
34. Dian's shafts; where, if he have
35. Any head more sharp than other,
36. With that first he strikes his mother.

37. Still the fairest are his fuel.
38. When his days are to be cruel,
39. Lovers' hearts are all his food,
40. And his baths their warmest blood:
41. Naught but wounds his hands doth season,
42. And he hates none like to Reason.

43. Trust him not; his words, though sweet,
44. Seldom with his heart do meet.
45. All his practice is deceit;
46. Every gift it is a bait;

47. Not a kiss but poison bears;
48. And most treason in his tears.

49. Idle minutes are his reign;
50. Then, the straggler makes his gain
51. By presenting maids with toys,
52. And would have ye think them joys:
53. 'Tis the ambition of the elf
54. To have all childish as himself.

55. If by these ye please to know him,
56. Beauties, be not nice, but show him.
57. Though ye had a will to hide him,
58. Now, we hope, ye'll not abide him;
59. Since you hear his falser play,
60. And that he's Venus' runaway.
