1. Some act of
2. Love's
3. bound to reherse,
4. I thought to bind him, in my verse:
5. Which when he felt, Away (quoth he)
6. Can Poets hope to fetter me?
7. It is enough, they once did get
8. Mars, and my
9. Mother
10. , in their net:
11. I weare not these my wings in vaine.
12. With which he fled me: and againe,
13. Into my rimes could ne're be got
14. By any art. Then wonder not,
15. That since, my numbers are so cold,
16. When
17. Love
18. is fled, and I grow old.
