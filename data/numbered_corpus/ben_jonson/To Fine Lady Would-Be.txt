1. Fine madam Would-Be, wherefore should you fear,
2. That love to make so well, a child to bear?
3. The world reputes you barren: but I know
4. Your 'pothecary, and his drug says no.
5. Is it the pain affrights? That's soon forgot.
6. Or your complexion's loss? you have a pot,
7. That can restore that. Will it hurt your feature?
8. To make amends, you are thought a wholesome creature.
9. What should the cause be? Oh, you live at court;
10. And there's both loss of time, and loss of sport,
11. In a great belly: Write then on thy womb,
12. 'Of the not born, yet buried, here's the tomb.'
