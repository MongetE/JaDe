1. The trawl of unquiet mind drops astern

2. Great lucid streamers bar the sky ahead
3. (bifurcated banners at a tourney)
4. light alchemizes the brass on the bridge
5. into sallow gold
6. now the short northern
7. autumn day closes quickly

8. the thin coast
9. (of grey Norway is it, or of Russia?)
10. distinguished only as a formal change
11. in the pattern of clouds on our port side

12. on the deck the strung lights illuminate no
13. movement but the sullen swill of water
14. in the washer, but the unnatural way
15. dead starfish and disregarded dabs swim
16. in the strict seas surging through the bilges
17. and out. A fishgut hangs like a hank of
18. hair from the iron grill in a pound board

19. brighter now that the sun, the fishfinder's
20. green bleep catches the skipper's intentness

21. and the trawl is down, is out, is catching!
