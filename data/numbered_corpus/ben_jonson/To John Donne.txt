1. Donne, the delight of Phoebus and each Muse
2. Who, to thy one, all other brains refuse;
3. Whose every work of thy most early wit
4. Came forth example, and remains so yet;
5. Longer a-knowing than most wits do live;
6. And which no affection praise enough can give!
7. To it, thy language, letters, arts, best life,
8. Which might with half mankind maintain a strife.
9. All which I meant to praise, and yet I would;
10. But leave, because I cannot as I should!
