1. Drinke to me, onely, with thine eyes,
2. And I will pledge with mine;
3. Or leave a kisse but in the cup,
4. And Ile not looke for wine.
5. The thirst, that from the soule doth rise,
6. Doth aske a drinke divine:
7. But might I of Jove's Nectar sup,
8. I would not change for thine.
9. I sent thee, late, a rosie wreath,
10. Not so much honoring thee,
11. As giving it a hope, that there
12. It could not withered bee.
13. But thou thereon did'st onely breath,
14. And sent'st it back to mee:
15. Since when it growes, and smells, I sweare,
16. Not of it selfe, but thee.
