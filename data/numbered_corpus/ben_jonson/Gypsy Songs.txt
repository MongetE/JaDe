1. I

2. THE faery beam upon you,
3. The stars to glister on you;
4. A moon of light
5. In the noon of night,
6. Till the fire-drake hath o'ergone you!
7. The wheel of fortune guide you,
8. The boy with the bow beside you;
9. Run ay in the way
10. Till the bird of day,
11. And the luckier lot betide you!

12. II

13. To the old, long life and treasure!
14. To the young all health and pleasure!
15. To the fair, their face
16. With eternal grace
17. And the soul to be loved at leisure!
18. To the witty, all clear mirrors;
19. To the foolish, their dark errors;
20. To the loving sprite,
21. A secure delight;
22. To the jealous, his own false terrors!
