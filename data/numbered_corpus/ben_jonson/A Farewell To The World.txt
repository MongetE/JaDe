1. FALSE world, good night! since thou hast brought
2. That hour upon my morn of age;
3. Henceforth I quit thee from my thought,
4. My part is ended on thy stage.

5. Yes, threaten, do. Alas! I fear
6. As little as I hope from thee:
7. I know thou canst not show nor bear
8. More hatred than thou hast to me.

9. My tender, first, and simple years
10. Thou didst abuse and then betray;
11. Since stir'd'st up jealousies and fears,
12. When all the causes were away.

13. Then in a soil hast planted me
14. Where breathe the basest of thy fools;
15. Where envious arts professed be,
16. And pride and ignorance the schools;

17. Where nothing is examined, weigh'd,
18. But as 'tis rumour'd, so believed;
19. Where every freedom is betray'd,
20. And every goodness tax'd or grieved.

21. But what we're born for, we must bear:
22. Our frail condition it is such
23. That what to all may happen here,
24. If 't chance to me, I must not grutch.

25. Else I my state should much mistake
26. To harbour a divided thought
27. From all my kind-that, for my sake,
28. There should a miracle be wrought.

29. No, I do know that I was born
30. To age, misfortune, sickness, grief:
31. But I will bear these with that scorn
32. As shall not need thy false relief.

33. Nor for my peace will I go far,
34. As wanderers do, that still do roam;
35. But make my strengths, such as they are,
36. Here in my bosom, and at home.
