1. In all faith, we did our part:
2. generated punctually, prepared adequately,
3. ejected promptly,
4. and swam in the approved manner
5. in the appropriate direction;
6. did all instinctive things well,
7. even eagerlyâ€”
8. an exemplary start.

9. But then the barrier: unexpectedness
10. unexpectedly.
11. (They did not tell us this).
12. To go back impossible, unnatural:
13. so round; many times;
14. we tired ourselves.
15. Where were the promised homes,
16. embedded in the soft wall?
17. Or the anticipated achievement
18. so momentous, fulfilling?

19. So we died:
20. what else was there to do?
21. But in all faith, we did our part!
