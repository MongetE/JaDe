1. From
2. 'Cynthia's Revels'

3. Queen and huntress, chaste and fair,
4. Now the sun is laid to sleep,
5. Seated in thy silver chair,
6. State in wonted manner keep:
7. Hesperus entreats thy light,
8. Goddess excellently bright.
9. Earth, let not thy envious shade
10. Dare itself to interpose;
11. Cynthia's shining orb was made
12. Heaven to clear, when day did close:
13. Bless us then with wished sight,
14. Goddess excellently bright.
15. Lay thy bow of pearl apart,
16. And thy crystal-shining quiver;
17. Give unto the flying hart
18. Space to breathe, how short soever:
19. Thou that mak'st a day of night,
20. Goddess excellently bright.
