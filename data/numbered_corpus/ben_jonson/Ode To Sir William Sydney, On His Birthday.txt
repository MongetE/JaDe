1. Now that the harth is crown'd with smiling fire,
2. And some do drink, and some do dance,
3. Some ring,
4. Some sing,
5. And all do strive t'advance
6. The gladnesse higher:
7. Wherefore should I
8. Stand silent by.
9. Who not the least,
10. Both love the cause, and authors of the feast.
11. Give me my cup, but from the Thespian Well,
12. That I may tell to Sydney, what
13. This day
14. Doth say,
15. And he may think on that
16. Which I do tell:
17. When all the noyse
18. Of these forc'd joyes,
19. Are fled and gone,
20. And he, with his best Genius left alone.
21. This day says, then, the number of glad yeares
22. Are justly summ'd, that make you man;
23. Your vow
24. Must now
25. Strive all right ways it can,
26. T'out-strip your peeres:
27. Since he doth lack
28. Of going back
29. Little, whose will
30. Doth urge him to run wrong, or to stand still.
31. Nor can a little of the common store,
32. Of nobles vertue, shew in you;
33. Your blood
34. So good
35. And great, must seek for new,
36. And study more:
37. Nor weary, rest
38. On what's deceast.
39. For they, that swell
40. With dust of ancestors, in graves but dwell.
41. 'Twill be exacted of your name, whose sonne,
42. Whose nephew, whose grand-child you are;
43. And men
44. Will, then,
45. Say you have follow'd farre,
46. When well begun:
47. Which must be now,
48. They teach you, how.
49. And he that stayes
50. To liue untill to morrow 'hath lost two dayes.
51. So may you live in honor, as in name,
52. If with this truth you be inspir'd;
53. So may
54. This day
55. Be more, and long desir'd:
56. And with the flame
57. Of love bee bright,
58. As with the light
59. Of bone-fires. Then
60. The Birth-day shines, when logs not burne, but men.
