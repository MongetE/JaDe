1. A child of Queen Elizabeth's Chapel
2. Epitaphs: ii

3. WEEP with me, all you that read
4. This little story;
5. And know, for whom a tear you shed
6. Death's self is sorry.
7. 'Twas a child that so did thrive
8. In grace and feature,
9. As Heaven and Nature seem'd to strive
10. Which own'd the creature.
11. Years he number'd scarce thirteen
12. When Fates turn'd cruel,
13. Yet three fill'd zodiacs had he been
14. The stage's jewel;
15. And did act (what now we moan)
16. Old men so duly,
17. As sooth the Parcae thought him one,
18. He play'd so truly.
19. So, by error, to his fate
20. They all consented;
21. But, viewing him since, alas, too late!
22. They have repented;
23. And have sought, to give new birth,
24. In baths to steep him;
25. But, being so much too good for earth,
26. Heaven vows to keep him.
