2. in bulk, doth make Man better be;
3. or standing long an oak three hundred year,
4. to fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere;

5. A lily of a day
6. is fairer in May,
7. although it fall and die that night-
8. It was the plant and flower of Light.

10. and in short measures life may perfect be.
