1. Hear me, O God!
2. A broken heart
3. Is my best part.
4. Use still thy rod,
5. That I may prove
6. Therein thy Love.

7. If thou hadst not
8. Been stern to me,
9. But left me free,
10. I had forgot
11. Myself and thee.

12. For sin's so sweet,
13. As minds ill-bent
14. Rarely repent,
15. Until they meet
16. Their punishment.

17. Who more can crave
18. Than thou hast done?
19. That gav'st a Son,
20. To free a slave,
21. First made of nought;
22. With all since bought.

23. Sin, Death, and Hell
24. His glorious name
25. Quite overcame,
26. Yet I rebel
27. And slight the same.

28. But I'll come in
29. Before my loss
30. Me farther toss,
31. As sure to win
32. Under His cross.
