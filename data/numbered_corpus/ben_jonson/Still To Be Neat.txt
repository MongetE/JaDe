1. Still to be neat, still to be drest,
2. As you were going to a feast;
3. Still to be powder'd, still perfum'd:
4. Lady, it is to be presum'd,
5. Though art's hid causes are not found,
6. All is not sweet, all is not sound.

7. Give me a look, give me a face,
8. That make simplicity a grace;
9. Robes loosely flowing, hair as free:
10. Such sweet neglect more taketh me
11. Than all th'adulteries of art.
12. They strike mine eyes, but not my heart.
