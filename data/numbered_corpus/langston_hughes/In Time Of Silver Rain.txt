1. In time of silver rain
2. The earth puts forth new life again,
3. Green grasses grow
4. And flowers lift their heads,
5. And over all the plain
6. The wonder spreads

7. Of Life,
8. Of Life,
9. Of life!

10. In time of silver rain
11. The butterflies lift silken wings
12. To catch a rainbow cry,
13. And trees put forth new leaves to sing
14. In joy beneath the sky
15. As down the roadway
16. Passing boys and girls
17. Go singing, too,

18. In time of silver rain When spring
19. And life
20. Are new.
