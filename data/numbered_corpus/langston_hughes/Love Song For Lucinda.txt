1. Love
2. Is a ripe plum
3. Growing on a purple tree.
4. Taste it once
5. And the spell of its enchantment
6. Will never let you be.

7. Love
8. Is a bright star
9. Glowing in far Southern skies.
10. Look too hard
11. And its burning flame
12. Will always hurt your eyes.

13. Love
14. Is a high mountain
15. Stark in a windy sky.
16. If you
17. Would never lose your breath
18. Do not climb too high.
