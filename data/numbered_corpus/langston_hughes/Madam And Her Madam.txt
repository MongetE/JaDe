1. I worked for a woman,
2. She wasn't mean--
3. But she had a twelve-room
4. House to clean.

5. Had to get breakfast,
6. Dinner, and supper, too--
7. Then take care of her children
8. When I got through.

9. Wash, iron, and scrub,
10. Walk the dog around--
11. It was too much,
12. Nearly broke me down.

13. I said, Madam,
14. Can it be
15. You trying to make a
16. Pack-horse out of me?

17. She opened her mouth.
18. She cried, Oh, no!
19. You know, Alberta,
20. I love you so!

21. I said, Madam,
22. That may be true--
23. But I'll be dogged
24. If I love you!
