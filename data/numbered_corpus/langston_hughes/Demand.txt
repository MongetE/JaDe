1. Listen!
2. Dear dream of utter aliveness-
3. Touching my body of utter death-
4. Tell me, O quickly! dream of aliveness,
5. The flaming source of your bright breath.
6. Tell me, O dream of utter aliveness-
7. Knowing so well the wind and the sun-
8. Where is this light
9. Your eyes see forever?
10. And what is the wind
11. You touch when you run?
