1. Because my mouth
2. Is wide with laughter
3. And my throat
4. Is deep with song,
5. You do not think
6. I suffer after
7. I have held my pain
8. So long?

9. Because my mouth
10. Is wide with laughter,
11. You do not hear
12. My inner cry?
13. Because my feet
14. Are gay with dancing,
15. You do not know
16. I die?
