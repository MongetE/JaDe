1. Oh, silver tree!
2. Oh, shining rivers of the soul!

3. In a Harlem cabaret
4. Six long-headed jazzers play.A dancing girl whose eyes are bold
5. Lifts high a dress of silken gold.

6. Oh, singing tree!
7. Oh, shining rivers of the soul!

8. Were Eve's eyes
9. In the first garden
10. Just a bit too bold?
11. Was Cleopatra gorgeous
12. In a gown of gold?

13. Oh, shining tree!
14. Oh, silver rivers of the soul!

15. In a whirling cabaret
16. Six long-headed jazzers play.
