1. I work all day,
2. Said Simple John,
3. Myself a house to buy.
4. I work all day,
5. Said Simple John,
6. But Pierrot wondered why.
7. For Pierrrot loved the long white road,
8. And Pierrot loved the moon,
9. And Pierrot loved a star-filled sky,
10. And the breath of a rose in June.
11. I have one wife,
12. Said Simple John,
13. And,faith,I love her yet.
14. I have one wife,
15. Said Simple John,
16. But Pierrot left Pierrette.

17. For Pierrot saw a world of girls,
18. And Pierrot loved each one,
19. And Pierrot thought all maidens fair
20. As flowers in the sun.
21. Oh, I am good,
22. Said Simple John,
23. The Lord will take me in.
24. Yes, I am good,
25. Said Simple John,
26. But Pierrot's steeped in sin.
27. For Pierrot played on a slim guitar,
28. And Pierrot loved the moon,
29. And Pierrot ran down the long white road
30. With the burgher's wife one June.
