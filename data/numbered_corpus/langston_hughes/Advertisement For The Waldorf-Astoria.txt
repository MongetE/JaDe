1. Fine living . . . a la carte?
2. Come to the Waldorf-Astoria!

3. LISTEN HUNGRY ONES!
4. Look! See what Vanity Fair says about the
5. new Waldorf-Astoria:

6. "All the luxuries of private home. . . ."
7. Now, won't that be charming when the last flop-house
8. has turned you down this winter?
9. Furthermore:
10. "It is far beyond anything hitherto attempted in the hotel
11. world. . . ." It cost twenty-eight million dollars. The fa-
12. mous Oscar Tschirky is in charge of banqueting.
13. Alexandre Gastaud is chef. It will be a distinguished
14. background for society.
15. So when you've no place else to go, homeless and hungry
16. ones, choose the Waldorf as a background for your rags--
17. (Or do you still consider the subway after midnight good
18. enough?)

19. ROOMERS
20. Take a room at the new Waldorf, you down-and-outers--
21. sleepers in charity's flop-houses where God pulls a
22. long face, and you have to pray to get a bed.
23. They serve swell board at the Waldorf-Astoria. Look at the menu, will
24. you:

25. GUMBO CREOLE
26. CRABMEAT IN CASSOLETTE
27. BOILED BRISKET OF BEEF
28. SMALL ONIONS IN CREAM
29. WATERCRESS SALAD
30. PEACH MELBA

31. Have luncheon there this afternoon, all you jobless.
32. Why not?
33. Dine with some of the men and women who got rich off of
34. your labor, who clip coupons with clean white fingers
35. because your hands dug coal, drilled stone, sewed gar-
36. ments, poured steel to let other people draw dividends
37. and live easy.
38. (Or haven't you had enough yet of the soup-lines and the bit-
39. ter bread of charity?)
40. Walk through Peacock Alley tonight before dinner, and get
41. warm, anyway. You've got nothing else to do.
