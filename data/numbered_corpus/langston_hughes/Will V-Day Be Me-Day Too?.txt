1. Over There,
2. World War II.

3. Dear Fellow Americans,
4. I write this letter
5. Hoping times will be better
6. When this war
7. Is through.
8. I'm a Tan-skinned Yank
9. Driving a tank.
10. I ask, WILL V-DAY
11. BE ME-DAY, TOO?

12. I wear a U. S. uniform.
13. I've done the enemy much harm,
14. I've driven back
15. The Germans and the Japs,
16. From Burma to the Rhine.
17. On every battle line,
18. I've dropped defeat
19. Into the Fascists' laps.

20. I am a Negro American
21. Out to defend my land
22. Army, Navy, Air Corps--
23. I am there.
24. I take munitions through,
25. I fight--or stevedore, too.
26. I face death the same as you do
27. Everywhere.

28. I've seen my buddy lying
29. Where he fell.
30. I've watched him dying
31. I promised him that I would try
32. To make our land a land
33. Where his son could be a man--
34. And there'd be no Jim Crow birds
35. Left in our sky.

36. So this is what I want to know:
37. When we see Victory's glow,
38. Will you still let old Jim Crow
39. Hold me back?
40. When all those foreign folks who've waited--
41. Italians, Chinese, Danes--are liberated.
42. Will I still be ill-fated
43. Because I'm black?

44. Here in my own, my native land,
45. Will the Jim Crow laws still stand?
46. Will Dixie lynch me still
47. When I return?
48. Or will you comrades in arms
49. From the factories and the farms,
50. Have learned what this war
51. Was fought for us to learn?

52. When I take off my uniform,
53. Will I be safe from harm--
54. Or will you do me
55. As the Germans did the Jews?
56. When I've helped this world to save,
57. Shall I still be color's slave?
58. Or will Victory change
59. Your antiquated views?

60. You can't say I didn't fight
61. To smash the Fascists' might.
62. You can't say I wasn't with you
63. in each battle.
64. As a soldier, and a friend.
65. When this war comes to an end,
66. Will you herd me in a Jim Crow car
67. Like cattle?

68. Or will you stand up like a man
69. At home and take your stand
70. For Democracy?
71. That's all I ask of you.
72. When we lay the guns away
73. To celebrate
74. Our Victory Day
75. WILL V-DAY BE ME-DAY, TOO?
76. That's what I want to know.

77. Sincerely,
78. GI Joe.
