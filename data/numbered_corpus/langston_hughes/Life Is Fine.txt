1. I went down to the river,
2. I set down on the bank.
3. I tried to think but couldn't,
4. So I jumped in and sank.

5. I came up once and hollered!
6. I came up twice and cried!
7. If that water hadn't a-been so cold
8. I might've sunk and died.

9. But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!

10. I took the elevator
11. Sixteen floors above the ground.
12. I thought about my baby
13. And thought I would jump down.

14. I stood there and I hollered!
15. I stood there and I cried!
16. If it hadn't a-been so high
17. I might've jumped and died.

18. But it was High up there! It was high!

19. So since I'm still here livin',
20. I guess I will live on.
21. I could've died for love--
22. But for livin' I was born

23. Though you may hear me holler,
24. And you may see me cry--
25. I'll be dogged, sweet baby,
26. If you gonna see me die.

27. Life is fine! Fine as wine! Life is fine!
