1. I woke up this mornin’
2. ’Bout half-past three.
3. All the womens in town
4. Was gathered round me.


5. Sweet gals was a-moanin’,
6. “Sylvester’s gonna die!”
7. And a hundred pretty mamas
8. Bowed their heads to cry.


9. I woke up little later
10. ’Bout half-past fo’,
11. The doctor ‘n’ undertaker’s
12. Both at ma do’.


13. Black gals was a-beggin’,
14. “You can’t leave us here!”
15. Brown-skins cryin’, “Daddy!
16. Honey! Baby! Don’t go, dear!”


17. But I felt ma time’s a-comin’,
18. And I know’d I’s dyin’ fast.
19. I seed the River Jerden
20. A-creepin’ muddy past—
21. But I’s still Sweet Papa ’Vester,
22. Yes, sir! Long as life do last!


23. So I hollers, “Com’ere, babies,
24. Fo’ to love yo’ daddy right!”
25. And I reaches up to hug ’em—
26. When the Lawd put out the light.


27. Then everything was darkness
28. In a great ... big ... night.
