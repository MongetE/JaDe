1. The instructor said,

2. Go home and write
3. a page tonight.
4. And let that page come out of you--
5. Then, it will be true.

6. I wonder if it's that simple?
7. I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.
8. I went to school there, then Durham, then here
9. to this college on the hill above Harlem.
10. I am the only colored student in my class.
11. The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,
12. through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,
13. Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,
14. the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator
15. up to my room, sit down, and write this page:

16. It's not easy to know what is true for you or me
17. at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what
18. I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
19. hear you, hear me--we two--you, me, talk on this page.
20. (I hear New York, too.) Me--who?
21. Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.
22. I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.
23. I like a pipe for a Christmas present,
24. or records--Bessie, bop, or Bach.
25. I guess being colored doesn't make me not like
26. the same things other folks like who are other races.
27. So will my page be colored that I write?

28. Being me, it will not be white.
29. But it will be
30. a part of you, instructor.
31. You are white--
32. yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.
33. That's American.
34. Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me.
35. Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
36. But we are, that's true!
37. As I learn from you,
38. I guess you learn from me--
39. although you're older--and white--
40. and somewhat more free.

41. This is my page for English B.
