1. I, too, sing America.

2. I am the darker brother.
3. They send me to eat in the kitchen
4. When company comes,
5. But I laugh,
6. And eat well,
7. And grow strong.

8. Tomorrow,
9. I'll be at the table
10. When company comes.
11. Nobody'll dare
12. Say to me,
13. "Eat in the kitchen,"
14. Then.

15. Besides,
16. They'll see how beautiful I am
17. And be ashamed--

18. I, too, am America.
