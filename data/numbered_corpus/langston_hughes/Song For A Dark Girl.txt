1. Way Down South in Dixie
2. (Break the heart of me)
3. They hung my black young lover
4. To a cross roads tree.

5. Way Down South in Dixie
6. (Bruised body high in air)
7. I asked the white Lord Jesus
8. What was the use of prayer.

9. Way Down South in Dixie
10. (Break the heart of me)
11. Love is a naked shadow
12. On a gnarled and naked tree.
