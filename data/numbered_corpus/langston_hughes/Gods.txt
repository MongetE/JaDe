1. The ivory gods,
2. And the ebony gods,
3. And the gods of diamond and jade,
4. Sit silently on their temple shelves
5. While the people
6. Are afraid.
7. Yet the ivory gods,
8. And the ebony gods,
9. And the gods of diamond-jade,
10. Are only silly puppet gods
11. That the people themselves
12. Have made.
