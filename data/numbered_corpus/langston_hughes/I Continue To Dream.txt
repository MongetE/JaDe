1. I take my dreams and make of them a bronze vase
2. and a round fountain with a beautiful statue in its center.
3. And a song with a broken heart and I ask you:
4. Do you understand my dreams?
5. Sometimes you say you do,
6. And sometimes you say you don't.
7. Either way it doesn't matter.
8. I continue to dream.
