1. The Negro
2. With the trumpet at his lips
3. Has dark moons of weariness
4. Beneath his eyes
5. where the smoldering memory
6. of slave ships
7. Blazed to the crack of whips
8. about thighs

9. The negro
10. with the trumpet at his lips
11. has a head of vibrant hair
12. tamed down,
13. patent-leathered now
14. until it gleams
15. like jet-
16. were jet a crown

17. the music
18. from the trumpet at his lips
19. is honey
20. mixed with liquid fire
21. the rhythm
22. from the trumpet at his lips
23. is ecstasy
24. distilled from old desire-

25. Desire
26. that is longing for the moon
27. where the moonlight's but a spotlight
28. in his eyes,
29. desire
30. that is longing for the sea
31. where the sea's a bar-glass
32. sucker size

33. The Negro
34. with the trumpet at his lips
35. whose jacket
36. Has a fine one-button roll,
37. does not know
38. upon what riff the music slips

39. It's hypodermic needle
40. to his soul
41. but softly
42. as the tune comes from his throat
43. trouble
44. mellows to a golden note
