1. Democracy will not come
2. Today, this year
3. Nor ever
4. Through compromise and fear.

5. I have as much right
6. As the other fellow has
7. To stand
8. On my two feet
9. And own the land.

10. I tire so of hearing people say,
11. Let things take their course.
12. Tomorrow is another day.
13. I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.
14. I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.

15. Freedom
16. Is a strong seed
17. Planted
18. In a great need.

19. I live here, too.
20. I want freedom
21. Just as you.
