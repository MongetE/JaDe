1. When Susanna Jones wears red
2. her face is like an ancient cameo
3. Turned brown by the ages.
4. Come with a blast of trumphets, Jesus!

5. When Susanna Jones wears red
6. A queen from some time-dead Egyptian night
7. Walks once again.
8. Blow trumphets, Jesus!

9. And the beauty of Susanna Jones in red
10. Burns in my heart a love-fire sharp like a pain.
11. Sweet silver trumphets, Jesus!
