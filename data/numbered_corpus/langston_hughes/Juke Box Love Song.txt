1. I could take the Harlem night
2. and wrap around you,
3. Take the neon lights and make a crown,
4. Take the Lenox Avenue busses,
5. Taxis, subways,
6. And for your love song tone their rumble down.
7. Take Harlem's heartbeat,
8. Make a drumbeat,
9. Put it on a record, let it whirl,
10. And while we listen to it play,
11. Dance with you till day--
12. Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.
