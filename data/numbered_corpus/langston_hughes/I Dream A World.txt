1. I dream a world where man
2. No other man will scorn,
3. Where love will bless the earth
4. And peace its paths adorn
5. I dream a world where all
6. Will know sweet freedom's way,
7. Where greed no longer saps the soul
8. Nor avarice blights our day.
9. A world I dream where black or white,
10. Whatever race you be,
11. Will share the bounties of the earth
12. And every man is free,
13. Where wretchedness will hang its head
14. And joy, like a pearl,
15. Attends the needs of all mankind-
16. Of such I dream, my world!
