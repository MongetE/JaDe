1. My old man's a white old man
2. And my old mother's black.
3. If ever I cursed my white old man
4. I take my curses back.
5. If ever I cursed my black old mother
6. And wished she were in hell,
7. I'm sorry for that evil wish
8. And now I wish her well
9. My old man died in a fine big house.
10. My ma died in a shack.
11. I wonder where I'm going to die,
12. Being neither white nor black?
