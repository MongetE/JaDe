1. This is for the kids who die,
2. Black and white,
3. For kids will die certainly.
4. The old and rich will live on awhile,
5. As always,
6. Eating blood and gold,
7. Letting kids die.

8. Kids will die in the swamps of Mississippi
9. Organizing sharecroppers
10. Kids will die in the streets of Chicago
11. Organizing workers
12. Kids will die in the orange groves of California
13. Telling others to get together
14. Whites and Filipinos,
15. Negroes and Mexicans,
16. All kinds of kids will die
17. Who don't believe in lies, and bribes, and contentment
18. And a lousy peace.

19. Of course, the wise and the learned
20. Who pen editorials in the papers,
21. And the gentlemen with Dr. in front of their names
22. White and black,
23. Who make surveys and write books
24. Will live on weaving words to smother the kids who die,
25. And the sleazy courts,
26. And the bribe-reaching police,
27. And the blood-loving generals,
28. And the money-loving preachers
29. Will all raise their hands against the kids who die,
30. Beating them with laws and clubs and bayonets and bullets
31. To frighten the people—
32. For the kids who die are like iron in the blood of the people—
33. And the old and rich don't want the people
34. To taste the iron of the kids who die,
35. Don't want the people to get wise to their own power,
36. To believe an Angelo Herndon, or even get together

37. Listen, kids who die—
38. Maybe, now, there will be no monument for you
39. Except in our hearts
40. Maybe your bodies'll be lost in a swamp
41. Or a prison grave, or the potter's field,
42. Or the rivers where you're drowned like Leibknecht
43. But the day will come—
44. You are sure yourselves that it is coming—
45. When the marching feet of the masses
46. Will raise for you a living monument of love,
47. And joy, and laughter,
48. And black hands and white hands clasped as one,
49. And a song that reaches the sky—
50. The song of the life triumphant
51. Through the kids who die.
