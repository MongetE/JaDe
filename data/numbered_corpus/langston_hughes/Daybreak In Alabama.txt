1. When I get to be a composer
2. I'm gonna write me some music about
3. Daybreak in Alabama
4. And I'm gonna put the purtiest songs in it
5. Rising out of the ground like a swamp mist
6. And falling out of heaven like soft dew.
7. I'm gonna put some tall tall trees in it
8. And the scent of pine needles
9. And the smell of red clay after rain
10. And long red necks
11. And poppy colored faces
12. And big brown arms
13. And the field daisy eyes
14. Of black and white black white black people
15. And I'm gonna put white hands
16. And black hands and brown and yellow hands
17. And red clay earth hands in it
18. Touching everybody with kind fingers
19. And touching each other natural as dew
20. In that dawn of music when I
21. Get to be a composer
22. And write about daybreak
23. In Alabama.
