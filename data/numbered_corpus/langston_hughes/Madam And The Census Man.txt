1. The census man,
2. The day he came round,
3. Wanted my name
4. To put it down.

5. I said, Johnson,
6. Alberta K.
7. But he hated to write
8. The K that way.

9. He said, What
10. Does K stand for?
11. I said, K--
12. And nothing more.

13. He said, I'm gonna put it
14. KÐAÐY.
15. I said, If you do,
16. You lie.

17. My mother christened me
18. Alberta K.
19. You leave my name
20. Just that way!

21. He said, Mrs.,
22. (With a snort)
23. Just a K
24. Makes your name too short.

25. I said, I don't
26. Give a damn!
27. Leave me and my name
28. Just like I am!

29. Furthermore, rub out
30. That MRS., too--
31. I'll have you know
32. I'm Madam to you!
