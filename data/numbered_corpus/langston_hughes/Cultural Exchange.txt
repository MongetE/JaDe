1. In the Quarter of the Negroes
2. Where the doors are doors of paper
3. Dust of dingy atoms
4. Blows a scratchy sound.
5. Amorphous jack-o'-Lanterns caper
6. And the wind won't wait for midnight
7. For fun to blow doors down.
8. By the river and the railroad
9. With fluid far-off goind
10. Boundaries bind unbinding
11. A whirl of whisteles blowing.
12. No trains or steamboats going--
13. Yet Leontyne's unpacking.

14. In the Quarter of the Negroes
15. Where the doorknob lets in Lieder
16. More than German ever bore,
17. Her yesterday past grandpa--
18. Not of her own doing--
19. In a pot of collard greens
20. Is gently stewing.

21. Pushcarts fold and unfold
22. In a supermarket sea.
23. And we better find out, mama,
24. Where is the colored laundromat
25. Since we move dup to Mount Vernon.

26. In the pot begind the paper doors
27. on the old iron stove what's cooking?
28. What's smelling, Leontyne?
29. Lieder, lovely Lieder
30. And a leaf of collard green.
31. Lovely Lieder, Leontyne.

32. You know, right at Christmas
33. They asked me if my blackness,
34. Would it rub off?
35. I said, Ask your mama.

36. Dreams and nightmares!
37. Nightmares, dreams, oh!
38. Dreaming that the Negroes
39. Of the South have taken over--
40. Voted all the Dixiecrats
41. Right out of power--

42. Comes the COLORED HOUR:
43. Martin Luther King is Governor of Georgia,
44. Dr. Rufus Clement his Chief Adviser,
45. A. Philip Randolph the High Grand Worthy.
46. In white pillared mansions
47. Sitting on their wide verandas,
48. Wealthy Negroes have white servants,
49. White sharecroppers work the black plantations,
50. And colored children have white mammies:
51. Mammy Faubus
52. Mammy Eastland
53. Mammy Wallace
54. Dear, dear darling old white mammies--
55. Sometimes even buried with our family.
56. Dear old
57. Mammy Faubus!

58. Culture, they say, is a two-way street:
59. Hand me my mint julep, mammny.
60. Hurry up!
61. Make haste!
