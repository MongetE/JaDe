1. When the night winds whistle through the trees and blow the crisp brown leaves a-crackling down,
2. When the autumn moon is big and yellow-orange and round,
3. When old Jack Frost is sparkling on the ground,
4. It's Thanksgiving Time!
5. When the pantry jars are full of mince-meat and the shelves are laden with sweet spices for a cake,
6. When the butcher man sends up a turkey nice and fat to bake,
7. When the stores are crammed with everything ingenious cooks can make,
8. It's Thanksgiving Time!
9. When the gales of coming winter outside your window howl,
10. When the air is sharp and cheery so it drives away your scowl,
11. When one's appetite craves turkey and will have no other fowl,
12. It's Thanksgiving Time!
