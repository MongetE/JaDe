1. To-day, this insect, and the world I breathe,
2. Now that my symbols have outelbowed space,
3. Time at the city spectacles, and half
4. The dear, daft time I take to nudge the sentence,
5. In trust and tale I have divided sense,
6. Slapped down the guillotine, the blood-red double
7. Of head and tail made witnesses to this
8. Murder of Eden and green genesis.

9. The insect certain is the plague of fables.

10. This story's monster has a serpent caul,
11. Blind in the coil scrams round the blazing outline,
12. Measures his own length on the garden wall
13. And breaks his shell in the last shocked beginning;
14. A crocodile before the chrysalis,
15. Before the fall from love the flying heartbone,
16. Winged like a sabbath ass this children's piece
17. Uncredited blows Jericho on Eden.

18. The insect fable is the certain promise.

19. Death: death of Hamlet and the nightmare madmen,
20. An air-drawn windmill on a wooden horse,
21. John's beast, Job's patience, and the fibs of vision,
22. Greek in the Irish sea the ageless voice:
23. 'Adam I love, my madmen's love is endless,
24. No tell-tale lover has an end more certain,
25. All legends' sweethearts on a tree of stories,
26. My cross of tales behind the fabulous curtain.'
