1. I

2. Never and never, my girl riding far and near
3. In the land of the hearthstone tales, and spelled asleep,
4. Fear or believe that the wolf in a sheepwhite hood
5. Loping and bleating roughly and blithely shall leap,
6. My dear, my dear,
7. Out of a lair in the flocked leaves in the dew dipped year
8. To eat your heart in the house in the rosy wood.

9. Sleep, good, for ever, slow and deep, spelled rare and wise,
10. My girl ranging the night in the rose and shire
11. Of the hobnail tales: no gooseherd or swine will turn
12. Into a homestall king or hamlet of fire
13. And prince of ice
14. To court the honeyed heart from your side before sunrise
15. In a spinney of ringed boys and ganders, spike and burn,

16. Nor the innocent lie in the rooting dingle wooed
17. And staved, and riven among plumes my rider weep.
18. From the broomed witch's spume you are shielded by fern
19. And flower of country sleep and the greenwood keep.
20. Lie fast and soothed,
21. Safe be and smooth from the bellows of the rushy brood.
22. Never, my girl, until tolled to sleep by the stern

23. Bell believe or fear that the rustic shade or spell
24. Shall harrow and snow the blood while you ride wide and near,
25. For who unmanningly haunts the mountain ravened eaves
26. Or skulks in the dell moon but moonshine echoing clear
27. From the starred well?
28. A hill touches an angel. Out of a saint's cell
29. The nightbird lauds through nunneries and domes of leaves

30. Her robin breasted tree, three Marys in the rays.
31. _Sanctum sanctorum_ the animal eye of the wood
32. In the rain telling its beads, and the gravest ghost
33. The owl at its knelling. Fox and holt kneel before blood.
34. Now the tales praise
35. The star rise at pasture and nightlong the fables graze
36. On the lord's-table of the bowing grass. Fear most

37. For ever of all not the wolf in his baaing hood
38. Nor the tusked prince, in the ruttish farm, at the rind
39. And mire of love, but the Thief as meek as the dew.
40. The country is holy: O bide in that country kind,
41. Know the green good,
42. Under the prayer wheeling moon in the rosy wood
43. Be shielded by chant and flower and gay may you

44. Lie in grace. Sleep spelled at rest in the lowly house
45. In the squirrel nimble grove, under linen and thatch
46. And star: held and blessed, though you scour the high four
47. Winds, from the dousing shade and the roarer at the latch,
48. Cool in your vows.
49. Yet out of the beaked, web dark and the pouncing boughs
50. Be you sure the Thief will seek a way sly and sure

51. And sly as snow and meek as dew blown to the thorn,
52. This night and each vast night until the stern bell talks
53. In the tower and tolls to sleep over the stalls
54. Of the hearthstone tales my own, lost love; and the soul walks
55. The waters shorn.
56. This night and each night since the falling star you were born,
57. Ever and ever he finds a way, as the snow falls,

58. As the rain falls, hail on the fleece, as the vale mist rides
59. Through the haygold stalls, as the dew falls on the wind-
60. Milled dust of the apple tree and the pounded islands
61. Of the morning leaves, as the star falls, as the winged
62. Apple seed glides,
63. And falls, and flowers in the yawning wound at our sides,
64. As the world falls, silent as the cyclone of silence.


65. II

66. Night and the reindeer on the clouds above the haycocks
67. And the wings of the great roc ribboned for the fair!
68. The leaping saga of prayer! And high, there, on the hare-
69. Heeled winds the rooks
70. Cawing from their black bethels soaring, the holy books
71. Of birds! Among the cocks like fire the red fox

72. Burning! Night and the vein of birds in the winged, sloe wrist
73. Of the wood! Pastoral beat of blood through the laced leaves!
74. The stream from the priest black wristed spinney and sleeves
75. Of thistling frost
76. Of the nightingale's din and tale! The upgiven ghost
77. Of the dingle torn to singing and the surpliced

78. Hill of cypresses! The din and tale in the skimmed
79. Yard of the buttermilk rain on the pail! The sermon
80. Of blood! The bird loud vein! The saga from mermen
81. To seraphim
82. Leaping! The gospel rooks! All tell, this night, of him
83. Who comes as red as the fox and sly as the heeled wind.

84. Illumination of music! the lulled black-backed
85. Gull, on the wave with sand in its eyes! And the foal moves
86. Through the shaken greensward lake, silent, on moonshod hooves,
87. In the winds' wakes.
88. Music of elements, that a miracle makes!
89. Earth, air, water, fire, singing into the white act,

90. The haygold haired, my love asleep, and the rift blue
91. Eyed, in the haloed house, in her rareness and hilly
92. High riding, held and blessed and true, and so stilly
93. Lying the sky
94. Might cross its planets, the bell weep, night gather her eyes,
95. The Thief fall on the dead like the willy nilly dew,

96. Only for the turning of the earth in her holy
97. Heart! Slyly, slowly, hearing the wound in her side go
98. Round the sun, he comes to my love like the designed snow,
99. And truly he
100. Flows to the strand of flowers like the dew's ruly sea,
101. And surely he sails like the ship shape clouds. Oh he

102. Comes designed to my love to steal not her tide raking
103. Wound, nor her riding high, nor her eyes, nor kindled hair,
104. But her faith that each vast night and the saga of prayer
105. He comes to take
106. Her faith that this last night for his unsacred sake
107. He comes to leave her in the lawless sun awaking

108. Naked and forsaken to grieve he will not come.
109. Ever and ever by all your vows believe and fear
110. My dear this night he comes and night without end my dear
111. Since you were born:
112. And you shall wake, from country sleep, this dawn and each first dawn,
113. Your faith as deathless as the outcry of the ruled sun.
