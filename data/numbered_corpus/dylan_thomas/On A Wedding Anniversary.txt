1. The sky is torn across
2. This ragged anniversary of two
3. Who moved for three years in tune
4. Down the long walks of their vows.

5. Now their love lies a loss
6. And Love and his patients roar on a chain;
7. From every tune or crater
8. Carrying cloud, Death strikes their house.

9. Too late in the wrong rain
10. They come together whom their love parted:
11. The windows pour into their heart
12. And the doors burn in their brain.
