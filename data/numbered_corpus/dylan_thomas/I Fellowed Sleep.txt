1. I fellowed sleep who kissed me in the brain,
2. Let fall the tear of time; the sleeper's eye,
3. Shifting to light, turned on me like a moon.
4. So, planning-heeled, I flew along my man
5. And dropped on dreaming and the upward sky.

6. I fled the earth and, naked, climbed the weather,
7. Reaching a second ground far from the stars;
8. And there we wept I and a ghostly other,
9. My mothers-eyed, upon the tops of trees;
10. I fled that ground as lightly as a feather.

11. 'My fathers' globe knocks on its nave and sings.'
12. 'This that we tread was, too, your father's land.'
13. 'But this we tread bears the angelic gangs
14. Sweet are their fathered faces in their wings.'
15. 'These are but dreaming men. Breathe, and they fade.'

16. Faded my elbow ghost, the mothers-eyed,
17. As, blowing on the angels, I was lost
18. On that cloud coast to each grave-grabbing shade;
19. I blew the dreaming fellows to their bed
20. Where still they sleep unknowing of their ghost.

21. Then all the matter of the living air
22. Raised up a voice, and, climbing on the words,
23. I spelt my vision with a hand and hair,
24. How light the sleeping on this soily star,
25. How deep the waking in the worlded clouds.

26. There grows the hours' ladder to the sun,
27. Each rung a love or losing to the last,
28. The inches monkeyed by the blood of man.
29. And old, mad man still climbing in his ghost,
30. My fathers' ghost is climbing in the rain.
