1. Do you not father me, nor the erected arm
2. For my tall tower's sake cast in her stone?
3. Do you not mother me, nor, as I am,
4. The lovers' house, lie suffering my stain?
5. Do you not sister me, nor the erected crime
6. For my tall turrets carry as your sin?
7. Do you not brother me, nor, as you climb,
8. Adore my windows for their summer scene?

9. Am I not father, too, and the ascending boy,
10. The boy of woman and the wanton starer
11. Marking the flesh and summer in the bay?
12. Am I not sister, too, who is my saviour?
13. Am I not all of you by the directed sea
14. Where bird and shell are babbling in my tower?
15. Am I not you who front the tidy shore,
16. Nor roof of sand, nor yet the towering tiler?

17. You are all these, said she who gave me the long suck,
18. All these, he said who sacked the children's town,
19. Up rose the Abraham-man, mad for my sake,
20. They said, who hacked and humoured, they were mine.
21. I am, the tower told, felled by a timeless stroke,
22. Who razed my wooden folly stands aghast,
23. For man-begetters in the dry-as-paste,
24. The ringed-sea ghost, rise grimly from the wrack.

25. Do you not father me on the destroying sand?
26. You are your sisters' sire, said seaweedy,
27. The salt sucked dam and darlings of the land
28. Who play the proper gentleman and lady.
29. Shall I still be love's house on the widdershin earth,
30. Woe to the windy masons at my shelter?
31. Love's house, they answer, and the tower death
32. Lie all unknowing of the grave sin-eater.
