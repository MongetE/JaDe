1. A saint about to fall,
2. The stained flats of heaven hit and razed
3. To the kissed kite hems of his shawl,
4. On the last street wave praised
5. The unwinding, song by rock,
6. Of the woven wall
7. Of his father's house in the sands,
8. The vanishing of the musical ship-work and the chucked bells,
9. The wound-down cough of the blood-counting clock
10. Behind a face of hands,
11. On the angelic etna of the last whirring featherlands,
12. Wind-heeled foot in the hole of a fireball,
13. Hymned his shrivelling flock,
14. On the last rick's tip by spilled wine-wells
15. Sang heaven hungry and the quick
16. Cut Christbread spitting vinegar and all
17. The mazes of his praise and envious tongue were worked in flames and shells.

18. Glory cracked like a flea.
19. The sun-leaved holy candlewoods
20. Drivelled down to one singeing tree
21. With a stub of black buds,
22. The sweet, fish-gilled boats bringing blood
23. Lurched through a scuttled sea
24. With a hold of leeches and straws,
25. Heaven fell with his fall and one crocked bell beat the left air.
26. O wake in me in my house in the mud
27. Of the crotch of the squawking shores,
28. Flicked from the carbolic city puzzle in a bed of sores
29. The scudding base of the familiar sky,
30. The lofty roots of the clouds.
31. From an odd room in a split house stare,
32. Milk in your mouth, at the sour floods
33. That bury the sweet street slowly, see
34. The skull of the earth is barbed with a war of burning brains and hair.

35. Strike in the time-bomb town,
36. Raise the live rafters of the eardrum,
37. Throw your fear a parcel of stone
38. Through the dark asylum,
39. Lapped among herods wail
40. As their blade marches in
41. That the eyes are already murdered,
42. The stocked heart is forced, and agony has another mouth to feed.
43. O wake to see, after a noble fall,
44. The old mud hatch again, the horrid
45. Woe drip from the dishrag hands and the pressed sponge of the forehead,
46. The breath draw back like a bolt through white oil
47. And a stranger enter like iron.
48. Cry joy that hits witchlike midwife second
49. Bullies into rough seas you so gentle
50. And makes with a flick of the thumb and sun
51. A thundering bullring of your silent and girl-circled island.
