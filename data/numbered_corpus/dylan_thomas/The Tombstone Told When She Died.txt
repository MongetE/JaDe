1. The tombstone told when she died.
2. Her two surnames stopped me still.
3. A virgin married at rest.
4. She married in this pouring place,
5. That I struck one day by luck,
6. Before I heard in my mother's side
7. Or saw in the looking-glass shell
8. The rain through her cold heart speak
9. And the sun killed in her face.
10. More the thick stone cannot tell.
11. Before she lay on a stranger's bed
12. With a hand plunged through her hair,
13. Or that rainy tongue beat back
14. Through the devilish years and innocent deaths
15. To the room of a secret child,
16. Among men later I heard it said
17. She cried her white-dressed limbs were bare
18. And her red lips were kissed black,
19. She wept in her pain and made mouths,
20. Talked and tore though her eyes smiled.
21. I who saw in a hurried film
22. Death and this mad heroine
23. Meet once on a mortal wall
24. Heard her speak through the chipped beak
25. Of the stone bird guarding her:
26. I died before bedtime came
27. But my womb was bellowing
28. And I felt with my bare fall
29. A blazing red harsh head tear up
30. And the dear floods of his hair.
