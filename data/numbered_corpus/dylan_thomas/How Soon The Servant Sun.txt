1. How soon the servant sun,
2. (Sir morrow mark),
3. Can time unriddle, and the cupboard stone,
4. (Fog has a bone
5. He'll trumpet into meat),
6. Unshelve that all my gristles have a gown
7. And the naked egg stand straight,

8. Sir morrow at his sponge,
9. (The wound records),
10. The nurse of giants by the cut sea basin,
11. (Fog by his spring
12. Soaks up the sewing tides),
13. Tells you and you, my masters, as his strange
14. Man morrow blows through food.

15. All nerves to serve the sun,
16. The rite of light,
17. A claw I question from the mouse's bone,
18. The long-tailed stone
19. Trap I with coil and sheet,
20. Let the soil squeal I am the biting man
21. And the velvet dead inch out.

22. How soon my level, lord,
23. (Sir morrow stamps
24. Two heels of water on the floor of seed),
25. Shall raise a lamp
26. Or spirit up a cloud,
27. Erect a walking centre in the shroud,
28. Invisible on the stump

29. A leg as long as trees,
30. This inward sir,
31. Mister and master, darkness for his eyes,
32. The womb-eyed, cries,
33. And all sweet hell, deaf as an hour's ear,
34. Blasts back the trumpet voice.
