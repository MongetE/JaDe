1. There was a saviour
2. Rarer than radium,
3. Commoner than water, crueller than truth;
4. Children kept from the sun
5. Assembled at his tongue
6. To hear the golden note turn in a groove,
7. Prisoners of wishes locked their eyes
8. In the jails and studies of his keyless smiles.

9. The voice of children says
10. From a lost wilderness
11. There was calm to be done in his safe unrest,
12. When hindering man hurt
13. Man, animal, or bird
14. We hid our fears in that murdering breath,
15. Silence, silence to do, when earth grew loud,
16. In lairs and asylums of the tremendous shout.

17. There was glory to hear
18. In the churches of his tears,
19. Under his downy arm you sighed as he struck,
20. O you who could not cry
21. On to the ground when a man died
22. Put a tear for joy in the unearthly flood
23. And laid your cheek against a cloud-formed shell:
24. Now in the dark there is only yourself and myself.

25. Two proud, blacked brothers cry,
26. Winter-locked side by side,
27. To this inhospitable hollow year,
28. O we who could not stir
29. One lean sigh when we heard
30. Greed on man beating near and fire neighbour
31. But wailed and nested in the sky-blue wall
32. Now break a giant tear for the little known fall,

33. For the drooping of homes
34. That did not nurse our bones,
35. Brave deaths of only ones but never found,
36. Now see, alone in us,
37. Our own true strangers' dust
38. Ride through the doors of our unentered house.
39. Exiled in us we arouse the soft,
40. Unclenched, armless, silk and rough love that breaks all rocks.
