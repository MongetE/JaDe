1. Not from this anger, anticlimax after
2. Refusal struck her loin and the lame flower
3. Bent like a beast to lap the singular floods
4. In a land strapped by hunger
5. Shall she receive a bellyful of weeds
6. And bear those tendril hands I touch across
7. The agonized, two seas.
8. Behind my head a square of sky sags over
9. The circular smile tossed from lover to lover
10. And the golden ball spins out of the skies;
11. Not from this anger after
12. Refusal struck like a bell under water
13. Shall her smile breed that mouth, behind the mirror,
14. That burns along my eyes.
