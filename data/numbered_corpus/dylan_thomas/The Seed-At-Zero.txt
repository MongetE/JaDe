1. The seed-at-zero shall not storm
2. That town of ghosts, the trodden womb,
3. With her rampart to his tapping,
4. No god-in-hero tumble down
5. Like a tower on the town
6. Dumbly and divinely stumbling
7. Over the manwaging line.

8. The seed-at-zero shall not storm
9. That town of ghosts, the manwaged tomb
10. With her rampart to his tapping,
11. No god-in-hero tumble down
12. Like a tower on the town
13. Dumbly and divinely leaping
14. Over the warbearing line.

15. Through the rampart of the sky
16. Shall the star-flanked seed be riddled,
17. Manna for the rumbling ground,
18. Quickening for the riddled sea;
19. Settled on a virgin stronghold
20. He shall grapple with the guard
21. And the keeper of the key.

22. May a humble village labour
23. And a continent deny?
24. A hemisphere may scold him
25. And a green inch be his bearer;
26. Let the hero seed find harbour,
27. Seaports by a drunken shore
28. Have their thirsty sailors hide him.

29. May be a humble planet labour
30. And a continent deny?
31. A village green may scold him
32. And a high sphere be his bearer;
33. Let the hero seed find harbour,
34. Seaports by a thirsty shore
35. Have their drunken sailors hide him.

36. Man-in-seed, in seed-at-zero,
37. From the foreign fields of space,
38. Shall not thunder on the town
39. With a star-flanked garrison,
40. Nor the cannons of his kingdom
41. Shall the hero-in-tomorrow
42. Range on the sky-scraping place.

43. Man-in-seed, in seed-at-zero,
44. From the star-flanked fields of space,
45. Thunders on the foreign town
46. With a sand-bagged garrison,
47. Nor the cannons of his kingdom
48. Shall the hero-in-to-morrow
49. Range from the grave-groping place.
