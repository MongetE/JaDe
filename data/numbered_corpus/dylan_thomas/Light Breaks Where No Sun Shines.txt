1. Light breaks where no sun shines;
2. Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart
3. Push in their tides;
4. And, broken ghosts with glowworms in their heads,
5. The things of light
6. File through the flesh where no flesh decks the bones.

7. A candle in the thighs
8. Warms youth and seed and burns the seeds of age;
9. Where no seed stirs,
10. The fruit of man unwrinkles in the stars,
11. Bright as a fig;
12. Where no wax is, the candle shows its hairs.

13. Dawn breaks behind the eyes;
14. From poles of skull and toe the windy blood
15. Slides like a sea;
16. Nor fenced, nor staked, the gushers of the sky
17. Spout to the rod
18. Divining in a smile the oil of tears.

19. Night in the sockets rounds,
20. Like some pitch moon, the limit of the globes;
21. Day lights the bone;
22. Where no cold is, the skinning gales unpin
23. The winter's robes;
24. The film of spring is hanging from the lids.

25. Light breaks on secret lots,
26. On tips of thought where thoughts smell in the rain;
27. When logics die,
28. The secret of the soil grows through the eye,
29. And blood jumps in the sun;
30. Above the waste allotments the dawn halts.
