1. Waking alone in a multitude of loves when morning's light
2. Surprised in the opening of her nightlong eyes
3. His golden yesterday asleep upon the iris
4. And this day's sun leapt up the sky out of her thighs
5. Was miraculous virginity old as loaves and fishes,
6. Though the moment of a miracle is unending lightning
7. And the shipyards of Galilee's footprints hide a navy of doves.

8. No longer will the vibrations of the sun desire on
9. Her deepsea pillow where once she married alone,
10. Her heart all ears and eyes, lips catching the avalanche
11. Of the golden ghost who ringed with his streams her mercury bone,
12. Who under the lids of her windows hoisted his golden luggage,
13. For a man sleeps where fire leapt down and she learns through his arm
14. That other sun, the jealous coursing of the unrivalled blood.
