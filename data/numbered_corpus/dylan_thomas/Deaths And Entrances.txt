1. On almost the incendiary eve
2. Of several near deaths,
3. When one at the great least of your best loved
4. And always known must leave
5. Lions and fires of his flying breath,
6. Of your immortal friends
7. Who'd raise the organs of the counted dust
8. To shoot and sing your praise,
9. One who called deepest down shall hold his peace
10. That cannot sink or cease
11. Endlessly to his wound
12. In many married London's estranging grief.

13. On almost the incendiary eve
14. When at your lips and keys,
15. Locking, unlocking, the murdered strangers weave,
16. One who is most unknown,
17. Your polestar neighbour, sun of another street,
18. Will dive up to his tears.
19. He'll bathe his raining blood in the male sea
20. Who strode for your own dead
21. And wind his globe out of your water thread
22. And load the throats of shells
23. with every cry since light
24. Flashed first across his thunderclapping eyes.

25. On almost the incendiary eve
26. Of deaths and entrances,
27. When near and strange wounded on London's waves
28. Have sought your single grave,
29. One enemy, of many, who knows well
30. Your heart is luminous
31. In the watched dark, quivering through locks and caves,
32. Will pull the thunderbolts
33. To shut the sun, plunge, mount your darkened keys
34. And sear just riders back,
35. Until that one loved least
36. Looms the last Samson of your zodiac.
