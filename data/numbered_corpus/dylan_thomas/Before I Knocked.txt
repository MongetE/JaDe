1. Before I knocked and flesh let enter,
2. With liquid hands tapped on the womb,
3. I who was as shapeless as the water
4. That shaped the Jordan near my home
5. Was brother to Mnetha's daughter
6. And sister to the fathering worm.

7. I who was deaf to spring and summer,
8. Who knew not sun nor moon by name,
9. Felt thud beneath my flesh's armour,
10. As yet was in a molten form
11. The leaden stars, the rainy hammer
12. Swung by my father from his dome.

13. I knew the message of the winter,
14. The darted hail, the childish snow,
15. And the wind was my sister suitor;
16. Wind in me leaped, the hellborn dew;
17. My veins flowed with the Eastern weather;
18. Ungotten I knew night and day.

19. As yet ungotten, I did suffer;
20. The rack of dreams my lily bones
21. Did twist into a living cipher,
22. And flesh was snipped to cross the lines
23. Of gallow crosses on the liver
24. And brambles in the wringing brains.

25. My throat knew thirst before the structure
26. Of skin and vein around the well
27. Where words and water make a mixture
28. Unfailing till the blood runs foul;
29. My heart knew love, my belly hunger;
30. I smelt the maggot in my stool.

31. And time cast forth my mortal creature
32. To drift or drown upon the seas
33. Acquainted with the salt adventure
34. Of tides that never touch the shores.
35. I who was rich was made the richer
36. By sipping at the vine of days.

37. I, born of flesh and ghost, was neither
38. A ghost nor man, but mortal ghost.
39. And I was struck down by death's feather.
40. I was a mortal to the last
41. Long breath that carried to my father
42. The message of his dying christ.

43. You who bow down at cross and altar,
44. Remember me and pity Him
45. Who took my flesh and bone for armour
46. And doublecrossed my mother's womb.
