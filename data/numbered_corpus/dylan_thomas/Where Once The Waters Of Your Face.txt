1. Where once the waters of your face
2. Spun to my screws, your dry ghost blows,
3. The dead turns up its eye;
4. Where once the mermen through your ice
5. Pushed up their hair, the dry wind steers
6. Through salt and root and roe.

7. Where once your green knots sank their splice
8. Into the tided cord, there goes
9. The green unraveller,
10. His scissors oiled, his knife hung loose
11. To cut the channels at their source
12. And lay the wet fruits low.

13. Invisible, your clocking tides
14. Break on the lovebeds of the weeds;
15. The weed of love's left dry;
16. There round about your stones the shades
17. Of children go who, from their voids,
18. Cry to the dolphined sea.

19. Dry as a tomb, your coloured lids
20. Shall not be latched while magic glides
21. Sage on the earth and sky;
22. There shall be corals in your beds
23. There shall be serpents in your tides,
24. Till all our sea-faiths die.
