1. Ears in the turrets hear
2. Hands grumble on the door,
3. Eyes in the gables see
4. The fingers at the locks.
5. Shall I unbolt or stay
6. Alone till the day I die
7. Unseen by stranger-eyes
8. In this white house?
9. Hands, hold you poison or grapes?

10. Beyond this island bound
11. By a thin sea of flesh
12. And a bone coast,
13. The land lies out of sound
14. And the hills out of mind.
15. No birds or flying fish
16. Disturbs this islandâ€™s rest.

17. Ears in this island hear
18. The wind pass like a fire,
19. Eyes in this island see
20. Ships anchor off the bay.
21. Shall I run to the ships
22. With the wind in my hair,
23. Or stay till the day I die
24. And welcome no sailor?
25. Ships, hold you poison or grapes?

26. Hands grumble on the door,
27. Ships anchor off the bay,
28. Rain beats the sand and slates.
29. Shall I let in the stranger,
30. Shall I welcome the sailor,
31. Or stay till the day I die?

32. Hands of the stranger and holds of the ships,
33. Hold you poison or grapes?
