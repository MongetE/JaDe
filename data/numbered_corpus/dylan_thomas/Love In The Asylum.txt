1. A stranger has come
2. To share my room in the house not right in the head,
3. A girl mad as birds

4. Bolting the night of the door with her arm her plume.
5. Strait in the mazed bed
6. She deludes the heaven-proof house with entering clouds

7. Yet she deludes with walking the nightmarish room,
8. At large as the dead,
9. Or rides the imagined oceans of the male wards.

10. She has come possessed
11. Who admits the delusive light through the bouncing wall,
12. Possessed by the skies

13. She sleeps in the narrow trough yet she walks the dust
14. Yet raves at her will
15. On the madhouse boards worn thin by my walking tears.

16. And taken by light in her arms at long and dear last
17. I may without fail
18. Suffer the first vision that set fire to the stars.
