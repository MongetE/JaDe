1. Then was my neophyte,
2. Child in white blood bent on its knees
3. Under the bell of rocks,
4. Ducked in the twelve, disciple seas
5. The winder of the water-clocks
6. Calls a green day and night.
7. My sea hermaphrodite,
8. Snail of man in His ship of fires
9. That burn the bitten decks,
10. Knew all His horrible desires
11. The climber of the water sex
12. Calls the green rock of light.

13. Who in these labyrinths,
14. This tidethread and the lane of scales,
15. Twine in a moon-blown shell,
16. Escapes to the flat cities' sails
17. Furled on the fishes' house and hell,
18. Nor falls to His green myths?
19. Stretch the salt photographs,
20. The landscape grief, love in His oils
21. Mirror from man to whale
22. That the green child see like a grail
23. Through veil and fin and fire and coil
24. Time on the canvas paths.

25. He films my vanity.
26. Shot in the wind, by tilted arcs,
27. Over the water come
28. Children from homes and children's parks
29. Who speak on a finger and thumb,
30. And the masked, headless boy.
31. His reels and mystery
32. The winder of the clockwise scene
33. Wound like a ball of lakes
34. Then threw on that tide-hoisted screen
35. Love's image till my heartbone breaks
36. By a dramatic sea.

37. Who kills my history?
38. The year-hedged row is lame with flint,
39. Blunt scythe and water blade.
40. 'Who could snap off the shapeless print
41. From your to-morrow-treading shade
42. With oracle for eye?'
43. Time kills me terribly.
44. 'Time shall not murder you,' He said,
45. 'Nor the green nought be hurt;
46. Who could hack out your unsucked heart,
47. O green and unborn and undead?'
48. I saw time murder me.
