1. Unluckily for a death
2. Waiting with phoenix under
3. The pyre yet to be lighted of my sins and days,
4. And for the woman in shades
5. Saint carved and sensual among the scudding
6. Dead and gone, dedicate forever to my self
7. Though the brawl of the kiss has not occurred
8. On the clay cold mouth, on the fire
9. Branded forehead, that could bind
10. Her constant, nor the winds of love broken wide
11. To the wind the choir and cloister
12. Of the wintry nunnery of the order of lust
13. Beneath my life, that sighs for the seducer's coming
14. In the sun strokes of summer,

15. Loving on this sea banged guilt
16. My holy lucky body
17. Under the cloud against love is caught and held and kissed
18. In the mill of the midst
19. Of the descending day, the dark our folly,
20. Cut to the still star in the order of the quick
21. But blessed by such heroic hosts in your every
22. Inch and glance that the wound
23. Is certain god, and the ceremony of souls
24. Is celebrated there, and communion between suns.
25. Never shall my self chant
26. About the saint in shades while the endless breviary
27. Turns of your prayed flesh, nor shall I shoo the bird below me:
28. The death biding two lie lonely.

29. I see the tigron in tears
30. In the androgynous dark,
31. His striped and noon maned tribe striding to holocaust,
32. The she mules bear their minotaurs,
33. The duck-billed platypus broody in a milk of birds.
34. I see the wanting nun saint carved in a garb
35. Of shades, symbol of desire beyond my hours
36. And guilts, great crotch and giant
37. Continence. I see the unfired phoenix, herald
38. And heaven crier, arrow now of aspiring
39. And the renouncing of islands.
40. All love but for the full assemblage in flower
41. Of the living flesh is monstrous or immortal,
42. And the grave its daughters.

43. Love, my fate got luckily,
44. Teaches with no telling
45. That the phoenix' bid for heaven and the desire after
46. Death in the carved nunnery
47. Both shall fail if I bow not to your blessing
48. Nor walk in the cool of your mortal garden
49. With immortality at my side like Christ the sky.
50. This I know from the native
51. Tongue of your translating eyes. The young stars told me,
52. Hurling into beginning like Christ the child.
53. Lucklessly she must lie patient
54. And the vaulting bird be still. O my true love, hold me.
55. In your every inch and glance is the globe of genesis spun,
56. And the living earth your sons.
