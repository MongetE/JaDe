1. Once it was the colour of saying
2. Soaked my table the uglier side of a hill
3. With a capsized field where a school sat still
4. And a black and white patch of girls grew playing;
5. The gentle seaslides of saying I must undo
6. That all the charmingly drowned arise to cockcrow and kill.
7. When I whistled with mitching boys through a reservoir park
8. Where at night we stoned the cold and cuckoo
9. Lovers in the dirt of their leafy beds,
10. The shade of their trees was a word of many shades
11. And a lamp of lightning for the poor in the dark;
12. Now my saying shall be my undoing,
13. And every stone I wind off like a reel.
