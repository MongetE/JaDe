1. Shall gods be said to thump the clouds
2. When clouds are cursed by thunder,
3. Be said to weep when weather howls?
4. Shall rainbows be their tunics' colour?

5. When it is rain where are the gods?
6. Shall it be said they sprinkle water
7. From garden cans, or free the floods?

8. Shall it be said that, venuswise,
9. An old god's dugs are pressed and pricked,
10. The wet night scolds me like a nurse?

11. It shall be said that gods are stone.
12. Shall a dropped stone drum on the ground,
13. Flung gravel chime? Let the stones speak
14. With tongues that talk all tongues.
