1. After the funeral, mule praises, brays,
2. Windshake of sailshaped ears, muffle-toed tap
3. Tap happily of one peg in the thick
4. Grave's foot, blinds down the lids, the teeth in black,
5. The spittled eyes, the salt ponds in the sleeves,
6. Morning smack of the spade that wakes up sleep,
7. Shakes a desolate boy who slits his throat
8. In the dark of the coffin and sheds dry leaves,
9. That breaks one bone to light with a judgment clout'
10. After the feast of tear-stuffed time and thistles
11. In a room with a stuffed fox and a stale fern,
12. I stand, for this memorial's sake, alone
13. In the snivelling hours with dead, humped Ann
14. Whose hodded, fountain heart once fell in puddles
15. Round the parched worlds of Wales and drowned each sun
16. (Though this for her is a monstrous image blindly
17. Magnified out of praise; her death was a still drop;
18. She would not have me sinking in the holy
19. Flood of her heart's fame; she would lie dumb and deep
20. And need no druid of her broken body).
21. But I, Ann's bard on a raised hearth, call all
22. The seas to service that her wood-tongud virtue
23. Babble like a bellbuoy over the hymning heads,
24. Bow down the walls of the ferned and foxy woods
25. That her love sing and swing through a brown chapel,
26. Blees her bent spirit with four, crossing birds.
27. Her flesh was meek as milk, but this skyward statue
28. With the wild breast and blessed and giant skull
29. Is carved from her in a room with a wet window
30. In a fiercely mourning house in a crooked year.
31. I know her scrubbed and sour humble hands
32. Lie with religion in their cramp, her threadbare
33. Whisper in a damp word, her wits drilled hollow,
34. Her fist of a face died clenched on a round pain;
35. And sculptured Ann is seventy years of stone.
36. These cloud-sopped, marble hands, this monumental
37. Argument of the hewn voice, gesture and psalm
38. Storm me forever over her grave until
39. The stuffed lung of the fox twitch and cry Love
40. And the strutting fern lay seeds on the black sill.
