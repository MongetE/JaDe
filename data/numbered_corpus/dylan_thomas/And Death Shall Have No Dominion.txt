1. And death shall have no dominion.
2. Dead man naked they shall be one
3. With the man in the wind and the west moon;
4. When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,
5. They shall have stars at elbow and foot;
6. Though they go mad they shall be sane,
7. Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;
8. Though lovers be lost love shall not;
9. And death shall have no dominion.
10. And death shall have no dominion.Under the windings of the sea
11. They lying long shall not die windily;
12. Twisting on racks when sinews give way,
13. Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;
14. Faith in their hands shall snap in two,
15. And the unicorn evils run them through;
16. Split all ends up they shan't crack;
17. And death shall have no dominion.
18. And death shall have no dominion.No more may gulls cry at their ears
19. Or waves break loud on the seashores;
20. Where blew a flower may a flower no more
21. Lift its head to the blows of the rain;
22. Though they be mad and dead as nails,
23. Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;
24. Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,
25. And death shall have no dominion.
