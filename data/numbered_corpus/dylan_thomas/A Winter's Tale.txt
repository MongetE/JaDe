1. It is a winter's tale
2. That the snow blind twilight ferries over the lakes
3. And floating fields from the farm in the cup of the vales,
4. Gliding windless through the hand folded flakes,
5. The pale breath of cattle at the stealthy sail,

6. And the stars falling cold,
7. And the smell of hay in the snow, and the far owl
8. Warning among the folds, and the frozen hold
9. Flocked with the sheep white smoke of the farm house cowl
10. In the river wended vales where the tale was told.

11. Once when the world turned old
12. On a star of faith pure as the drifting bread,
13. As the food and flames of the snow, a man unrolled
14. The scrolls of fire that burned in his heart and head,
15. Torn and alone in a farm house in a fold

16. Of fields. And burning then
17. In his firelit island ringed by the winged snow
18. And the dung hills white as wool and the hen
19. Roosts sleeping chill till the flame of the cock crow
20. Combs through the mantled yards and the morning men

21. Stumble out with their spades,
22. The cattle stirring, the mousing cat stepping shy,
23. The puffed birds hopping and hunting, the milkmaids
24. Gentle in their clogs over the fallen sky,
25. And all the woken farm at its white trades,

26. He knelt, he wept, he prayed,
27. By the spit and the black pot in the log bright light
28. And the cup and the cut bread in the dancing shade,
29. In the muffled house, in the quick of night,
30. At the point of love, forsaken and afraid.

31. He knelt on the cold stones,
32. He wept form the crest of grief, he prayed to the veiled sky
33. May his hunger go howling on bare white bones
34. Past the statues of the stables and the sky roofed sties
35. And the duck pond glass and the blinding byres alone

36. Into the home of prayers
37. And fires where he should prowl down the cloud
38. Of his snow blind love and rush in the white lairs.
39. His naked need struck him howling and bowed
40. Though no sound flowed down the hand folded air

41. But only the wind strung
42. Hunger of birds in the fields of the bread of water, tossed
43. In high corn and the harvest melting on their tongues.
44. And his nameless need bound him burning and lost
45. When cold as snow he should run the wended vales among

46. The rivers mouthed in night,
47. And drown in the drifts of his need, and lie curled caught
48. In the always desiring centre of the white
49. Inhuman cradle and the bride bed forever sought
50. By the believer lost and the hurled outcast of light.

51. Deliver him, he cried,
52. By losing him all in love, and cast his need
53. Alone and naked in the engulfing bride,
54. Never to flourish in the fields of the white seed
55. Or flower under the time dying flesh astride.

56. Listen. The minstrels sing
57. In the departed villages. The nightingale,
58. Dust in the buried wood, flies on the grains of her wings
59. And spells on the winds of the dead his winter's tale.
60. The voice of the dust of water from the withered spring

61. Is telling. The wizened
62. Stream with bells and baying water bounds. The dew rings
63. On the gristed leaves and the long gone glistening
64. Parish of snow. The carved mouths in the rock are wind swept strings.
65. Time sings through the intricately dead snow drop. Listen.

66. It was a hand or sound
67. In the long ago land that glided the dark door wide
68. And there outside on the bread of the ground
69. A she bird rose and rayed like a burning bride.
70. A she bird dawned, and her breast with snow and scarlet downed.

71. Look. And the dancers move
72. On the departed, snow bushed green, wanton in moon light
73. As a dust of pigeons. Exulting, the grave hooved
74. Horses, centaur dead, turn and tread the drenched white
75. Paddocks in the farms of birds. The dead oak walks for love.

76. The carved limbs in the rock
77. Leap, as to trumpets. Calligraphy of the old
78. Leaves is dancing. Lines of age on the stones weave in a flock.
79. And the harp shaped voice of the water's dust plucks in a fold
80. Of fields. For love, the long ago she bird rises. Look.

81. And the wild wings were raised
82. Above her folded head, and the soft feathered voice
83. Was flying through the house as though the she bird praised
84. And all the elements of the slow fall rejoiced
85. That a man knelt alone in the cup of the vales,

86. In the mantle and calm,
87. By the spit and the black pot in the log bright light.
88. And the sky of birds in the plumed voice charmed
89. Him up and he ran like a wind after the kindling flight
90. Past the blind barns and byres of the windless farm.

91. In the poles of the year
92. When black birds died like priests in the cloaked hedge row
93. And over the cloth of counties the far hills rode near,
94. Under the one leaved trees ran a scarecrow of snow
95. And fast through the drifts of the thickets antlered like deer,

96. Rags and prayers down the knee-
97. Deep hillocks and loud on the numbed lakes,
98. All night lost and long wading in the wake of the she-
99. Bird through the times and lands and tribes of the slow flakes.
100. Listen and look where she sails the goose plucked sea,

101. The sky, the bird, the bride,
102. The cloud, the need, the planted stars, the joy beyond
103. The fields of seed and the time dying flesh astride,
104. The heavens, the heaven, the grave, the burning font.
105. In the far ago land the door of his death glided wide,

106. And the bird descended.
107. On a bread white hill over the cupped farm
108. And the lakes and floating fields and the river wended
109. Vales where he prayed to come to the last harm
110. And the home of prayers and fires, the tale ended.

111. The dancing perishes
112. On the white, no longer growing green, and, minstrel dead,
113. The singing breaks in the snow shoed villages of wishes
114. That once cut the figures of birds on the deep bread
115. And over the glazed lakes skated the shapes of fishes

116. Flying. The rite is shorn
117. Of nightingale and centaur dead horse. The springs wither
118. Back. Lines of age sleep on the stones till trumpeting dawn.
119. Exultation lies down. Time buries the spring weather
120. That belled and bounded with the fossil and the dew reborn.

121. For the bird lay bedded
122. In a choir of wings, as though she slept or died,
123. And the wings glided wide and he was hymned and wedded,
124. And through the thighs of the engulfing bride,
125. The woman breasted and the heaven headed

126. Bird, he was brought low,
127. Burning in the bride bed of love, in the whirl-
128. Pool at the wanting centre, in the folds
129. Of paradise, in the spun bud of the world.
130. And she rose with him flowering in her melting snow.
