1. In the beginning was the three-pointed star,
2. One smile of light across the empty face,
3. One bough of bone across the rooting air,
4. The substance forked that marrowed the first sun,
5. And, burning ciphers on the round of space,
6. Heaven and hell mixed as they spun.

7. In the beginning was the pale signature,
8. Three-syllabled and starry as the smile,
9. And after came the imprints on the water,
10. Stamp of the minted face upon the moon;
11. The blood that touched the crosstree and the grail
12. Touched the first cloud and left a sign.

13. In the beginning was the mounting fire
14. That set alight the weathers from a spark,
15. A three-eyed, red-eyed spark, blunt as a flower,
16. Life rose and spouted from the rolling seas,
17. Burst in the roots, pumped from the earth and rock
18. The secret oils that drive the grass.

19. In the beginning was the word, the word
20. That from the solid bases of the light
21. Abstracted all the letters of the void;
22. And from the cloudy bases of the breath
23. The word flowed up, translating to the heart
24. First characters of birth and death.

25. In the beginning was the secret brain.
26. The brain was celled and soldered in the thought
27. Before the pitch was forking to a sun;
28. Before the veins were shaking in their sieve,
29. Blood shot and scattered to the winds of light
30. The ribbed original of love.
