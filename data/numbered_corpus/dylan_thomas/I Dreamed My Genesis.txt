1. I dreamed my genesis in sweat of sleep, breaking
2. Through the rotating shell, strong
3. As motor muscle on the drill, driving
4. Through vision and the girdered nerve.

5. From limbs that had the measure of the worm, shuffled
6. Off from the creasing flesh, filed
7. Through all the irons in the grass, metal
8. Of suns in the man-melting night.

9. Heir to the scalding veins that hold love's drop, costly
10. A creature in my bones I
11. Rounded my globe of heritage, journey
12. In bottom gear through night-geared man.

13. I dreamed my genesis and died again, shrapnel
14. Rammed in the marching heart, hole
15. In the stitched wound and clotted wind, muzzled
16. Death on the mouth that ate the gas.

17. Sharp in my second death I marked the hills, harvest
18. Of hemlock and the blades, rust
19. My blood upon the tempered dead, forcing
20. My second struggling from the grass.

21. And power was contagious in my birth, second
22. Rise of the skeleton and
23. Rerobing of the naked ghost. Manhood
24. Spat up from the resuffered pain.

25. I dreamed my genesis in sweat of death, fallen
26. Twice in the feeding sea, grown
27. Stale of Adam's brine until, vision
28. Of new man strength, I seek the sun.
