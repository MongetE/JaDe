1. (for Llewelyn)

2. This side of the truth,
3. You may not see, my son,
4. King of your blue eyes
5. In the blinding country of youth,
6. That all is undone,
7. Under the unminding skies,
8. Of innocence and guilt
9. Before you move to make
10. One gesture of the heart or head,
11. Is gathered and spilt
12. Into the winding dark
13. Like the dust of the dead.

14. Good and bad, two ways
15. Of moving about your death
16. By the grinding sea,
17. King of your heart in the blind days,
18. Blow away like breath,
19. Go crying through you and me
20. And the souls of all men
21. Into the innocent
22. Dark, and the guilty dark, and good
23. Death, and bad death, and then
24. In the last element
25. Fly like the stars' blood

26. Like the sun's tears,
27. Like the moon's seed, rubbish
28. And fire, the flying rant
29. Of the sky, king of your six years.
30. And the wicked wish,
31. Down the beginning of plants
32. And animals and birds,
33. Water and Light, the earth and sky,
34. Is cast before you move,
35. And all your deeds and words,
36. Each truth, each lie,
37. Die in unjudging love.
