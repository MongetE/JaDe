1. When the morning was waking over the war
2. He put on his clothes and stepped out and he died,
3. The locks yawned loose and a blast blew them wide,
4. He dropped where he loved on the burst pavement stone
5. And the funeral grains of the slaughtered floor.
6. Tell his street on its back he stopped a sun
7. And the craters of his eyes grew springshots and fire
8. When all the keys shot from the locks, and rang.
9. Dig no more for the chains of his grey-haired heart.
10. The heavenly ambulance drawn by a wound
11. Assembling waits for the spade's ring on the cage.
12. O keep his bones away from the common cart,
13. The morning is flying on the wings of his age
14. And a hundred storks perch on the sun's right hand.
