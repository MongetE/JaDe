1. How shall my animal
2. Whose wizard shape I trace in the cavernous skull,
3. Vessel of abscesses and exultation's shell,
4. Endure burial under the spelling wall,
5. The invoked, shrouding veil at the cap of the face,
6. Who should be furious,
7. Drunk as a vineyard snail, flailed like an octopus,
8. Roaring, crawling, quarrel
9. With the outside weathers,
10. The natural circle of the discovered skies
11. Draw down to its weird eyes?

12. How shall it magnetize,
13. Towards the studded male in a bent, midnight blaze
14. That melts the lionhead's heel and horseshoe of the heart
15. A brute land in the cool top of the country days
16. To trot with a loud mate the haybeds of a mile,
17. Love and labour and kill
18. In quick, sweet, cruel light till the locked ground sprout
19. The black, burst sea rejoice,
20. The bowels turn turtle,
21. Claw of the crabbed veins squeeze from each red particle
22. The parched and raging voice?

23. Fishermen of mermen
24. Creep and harp on the tide, sinking their charmed, bent pin
25. With bridebait of gold bread, I with a living skein,
26. Tongue and ear in the thread, angle the temple-bound
27. Curl-locked and animal cavepools of spells and bone,
28. Trace out a tentacle,
29. Nailed with an open eye, in the bowl of wounds and weed
30. To clasp my fury on ground
31. And clap its great blood down;
32. Never shall beast be born to atlas the few seas
33. Or poise the day on a horn.

34. Sigh long, clay cold, lie shorn,
35. Cast high, stunned on gilled stone; sly scissors ground in frost
36. Clack through the thicket of strength, love hewn in pillars drops
37. With carved bird, saint, and suns the wrackspiked maiden mouth
38. Lops, as a bush plumed with flames, the rant of the fierce eye,
39. Clips short the gesture of breath.
40. Die in red feathers when the flying heaven's cut,
41. And roll with the knocked earth:
42. Lie dry, rest robbed, my beast.
43. You have kicked from a dark den, leaped up the whinnying light,
44. And dug your grave in my breast.
