1. A process in the weather of the heart
2. Turns damp to dry; the golden shot
3. Storms in the freezing tomb.
4. A weather in the quarter of the veins
5. Turns night to day; blood in their suns
6. Lights up the living worm.

7. A process in the eye forwarns
8. The bones of blindness; and the womb
9. Drives in a death as life leaks out.

10. A darkness in the weather of the eye
11. Is half its light; the fathomed sea
12. Breaks on unangled land.
13. The seed that makes a forest of the loin
14. Forks half its fruit; and half drops down,
15. Slow in a sleeping wind.

16. A weather in the flesh and bone
17. Is damp and dry; the quick and dead
18. Move like two ghosts before the eye.

19. A process in the weather of the world
20. Turns ghost to ghost; each mothered child
21. Sits in their double shade.
22. A process blows the moon into the sun,
23. Pulls down the shabby curtains of the skin;
24. And the heart gives up its dead.
