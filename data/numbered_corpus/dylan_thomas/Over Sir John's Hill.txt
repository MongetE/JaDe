1. Over Sir John's hill,
2. The hawk on fire hangs still;
3. In a hoisted cloud, at drop of dusk, he pulls to his claws
4. And gallows, up the rays of his eyes the small birds of the bay
5. And the shrill child's play
6. Wars
7. Of the sparrows and such who swansing, dusk, in wrangling hedges.
8. And blithely they squawk
9. To fiery tyburn over the wrestle of elms until
10. The flash the noosed hawk
11. Crashes, and slowly the fishing holy stalking heron
12. In the river Towy below bows his tilted headstone.

13. Flash, and the plumes crack,
14. And a black cap of jack-
15. Daws Sir John's just hill dons, and again the gulled birds hare
16. To the hawk on fire, the halter height, over Towy's fins,
17. In a whack of wind.
18. There
19. Where the elegiac fisherbird stabs and paddles
20. In the pebbly dab-filled
21. Shallow and sedge, and 'dilly dilly,' calls the loft hawk,
22. 'Come and be killed,'
23. I open the leaves of the water at a passage
24. Of psalms and shadows among the pincered sandcrabs prancing

25. And read, in a shell
26. Death clear as a bouy's bell:
27. All praise of the hawk on fire in hawk-eyed dusk be sung,
28. When his viperish fuse hangs looped with flames under the brand
29. Wing, and blest shall
30. Young
31. Green chickens of the bay and bushes cluck, 'dilly dilly,
32. Come let us die.'
33. We grieve as the blithe birds, never again, leave shingle and elm,
34. The heron and I,
35. I young Aesop fabling to the near night by the dingle
36. Of eels, saint heron hymning in the shell-hung distant

37. Crystal harbour vale
38. Where the sea cobbles sail,
39. And wharves of water where the walls dance and the white cranes stilt.
40. It is the heron and I, under judging Sir John's elmed
41. Hill, tell-tale the knelled
42. Guilt
43. Of the led-astray birds whom God, for their breast of whistles,
44. Have Mercy on,
45. God in his whirlwind silence save, who marks the sparrows hail,
46. For their souls' song.
47. Now the heron grieves in the weeded verge. Through windows
48. Of dusk and water I see the tilting whispering

49. Heron, mirrored, go,
50. As the snapt feathers snow,
51. Fishing in the tear of the Towy. Only a hoot owl
52. Hollows, a grassblade blown in cupped hands, in the looted elms
53. And no green cocks or hens
54. Shout
55. Now on Sir John's hill. The heron, ankling the scaly
56. Lowlands of the waves,
57. Makes all the music; and I who hear the tune of the slow,
58. Wear-willow river, grave,
59. Before the lunge of the night, the notes on this time-shaken
60. Stone for the sake of the souls of the slain birds sailing.
