1. When I woke, the town spoke.
2. Birds and clocks and cross bells
3. Dinned aside the coiling crowd,
4. The reptile profligates in a flame,
5. Spoilers and pokers of sleep,
6. The next-door sea dispelled
7. Frogs and satans and woman-luck,
8. While a man outside with a billhook,
9. Up to his head in his blood,
10. Cutting the morning off,
11. The warm-veined double of Time
12. And his scarving beard from a book,
13. Slashed down the last snake as though
14. It were a wand or subtle bough,
15. Its tongue peeled in the wrap of a leaf.

16. Every morning I make,
17. God in bed, good and bad,
18. After a water-face walk,
19. The death-stagged scatter-breath
20. Mammoth and sparrowfall
21. Everybody's earth.
22. Where birds ride like leaves and boats like ducks
23. I heard, this morning, waking,
24. Crossly out of the town noises
25. A voice in the erected air,
26. No prophet-progeny of mine,
27. Cry my sea town was breaking.
28. No Time, spoke the clocks, no God, rang the bells,
29. I drew the white sheet over the islands
30. And the coins on my eyelids sang like shells.
