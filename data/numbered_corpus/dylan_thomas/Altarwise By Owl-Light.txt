1. Altarwise by owl-light in the half-way house
2. The gentleman lay graveward with his furies;
3. Abaddon in the hangnail cracked from Adam,
4. And, from his fork, a dog among the fairies,
5. The atlas-eater with a jaw for news,
6. Bit out the mandrake with to-morrows scream.
7. Then, penny-eyed, that gentlemen of wounds,
8. Old cock from nowheres and the heaven's egg,
9. With bones unbuttoned to the half-way winds,
10. Hatched from the windy salvage on one leg,
11. Scraped at my cradle in a walking word
12. That night of time under the Christward shelter:
13. I am the long world's gentlemen, he said,
14. And share my bed with Capricorn and Cancer.

15. Death is all metaphors, shape in one history;
16. The child that sucketh long is shooting up,
17. The planet-ducted pelican of circles
18. Weans on an artery the genders strip;
19. Child of the short spark in a shapeless country
20. Soon sets alight a long stick from the cradle;
21. The horizontal cross-bones of Abaddon,
22. You by the cavern over the black stairs,
23. Rung bone and blade, the verticals of Adam,
24. And, manned by midnight, Jacob to the stars.
25. Hairs of your head, then said the hollow agent,
26. Are but the roots of nettles and feathers
27. Over the groundworks thrusting through a pavement
28. And hemlock-headed in the wood of weathers.

29. First there was the lamb on knocking knees
30. And three dead seasons on a climbing grave
31. That Adam's wether in the flock of horns,
32. Butt of the tree-tailed worm that mounted Eve,
33. Horned down with skullfoot and the skull of toes
34. On thunderous pavements in the garden of time;
35. Rip of the vaults, I took my marrow-ladle
36. Out of the wrinkled undertaker's van,
37. And, Rip Van Winkle from a timeless cradle,
38. Dipped me breast-deep in the descending bone;
39. The black ram, shuffling of the year, old winter,
40. Alone alive among his mutton fold,
41. We rung our weathering changes on the ladder,
42. Said the antipodes, and twice spring chimed.

43. What is the metre of the dictionary?
44. The size of genesis? the short spark's gender?
45. Shade without shape? the shape of the Pharaohs echo?
46. (My shape of age nagging the wounded whisper.)
47. Which sixth of wind blew out the burning gentry?
48. (Questions are hunchbacks to the poker marrow.)
49. What of a bamboo man amomg your acres?
50. Corset the boneyards for a crooked boy?
51. Button your bodice on a hump of splinters,
52. My camel's eyes will needle through the shroud.
53. Loves reflection of the mushroom features,
54. Still snapped by night in the bread-sided field,
55. Once close-up smiling in the wall of pictures,
56. Arc-lamped thrown back upon the cutting flood.
