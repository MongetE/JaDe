1. Foster the light nor veil the manshaped moon,
2. Nor weather winds that blow not down the bone,
3. But strip the twelve-winded marrow from his circle;
4. Master the night nor serve the snowman's brain
5. That shapes each bushy item of the air
6. Into a polestar pointed on an icicle.

7. Murmur of spring nor crush the cockerel's eggs,
8. Nor hammer back a season in the figs,
9. But graft these four-fruited ridings on your country;
10. Farmer in time of frost the burning leagues,
11. By red-eyed orchards sow the seeds of snow,
12. In your young years the vegetable century.

13. And father all nor fail the fly-lord's acre,
14. Nor sprout on owl-seed like a goblin-sucker,
15. But rail with your wizard's ribs the heart-shaped planet;
16. Of mortal voices to the ninnies' choir,
17. High lord esquire, speak up the singing cloud,
18. And pluck a mandrake music from the marrowroot.

19. Roll unmanly over this turning tuft,
20. O ring of seas, nor sorrow as I shift
21. From all my mortal lovers with a starboard smile;
22. Nor when my love lies in the cross-boned drift
23. Naked among the bow-and-arrow birds
24. Shall you turn cockwise on a tufted axle.

25. Who gave these seas their colour in a shape,
26. Shaped my clayfellow, and the heaven's ark
27. In time at flood filled with his coloured doubles;
28. O who is glory in the shapeless maps,
29. Now make the world of me as I have made
30. A merry manshape of your walking circle.
