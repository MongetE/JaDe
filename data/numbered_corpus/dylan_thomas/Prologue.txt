1. This day winding down now
2. At God speeded summer's end
3. In the torrent salmon sun,
4. In my seashaken house
5. On a breakneck of rocks
6. Tangled with chirrup and fruit,
7. Froth, flute, fin, and quill
8. At a wood's dancing hoof,
9. By scummed, starfish sands
10. With their fishwife cross
11. Gulls, pipers, cockles, and snails,
12. Out there, crow black, men
13. Tackled with clouds, who kneel
14. To the sunset nets,
15. Geese nearly in heaven, boys
16. Stabbing, and herons, and shells
17. That speak seven seas,
18. Eternal waters away
19. From the cities of nine
20. Days' night whose towers will catch
21. In the religious wind
22. Like stalks of tall, dry straw,
23. At poor peace I sing
24. To you strangers (though song
25. Is a burning and crested act,
26. The fire of birds in
27. The world's turning wood,
28. For my swan, splay sounds),
29. Out of these seathumbed leaves
30. That will fly and fall
31. Like leaves of trees and as soon
32. Crumble and undie
33. Into the dogdayed night.
34. Seaward the salmon, sucked sun slips,
35. And the dumb swans drub blue
36. My dabbed bay's dusk, as I hack
37. This rumpus of shapes
38. For you to know
39. How I, a spining man,
40. Glory also this star, bird
41. Roared, sea born, man torn, blood blest.
42. Hark: I trumpet the place,
43. From fish to jumping hill! Look:
44. I build my bellowing ark
45. To the best of my love
46. As the flood begins,
47. Out of the fountainhead
48. Of fear, rage read, manalive,
49. Molten and mountainous to stream
50. Over the wound asleep
51. Sheep white hollow farms

52. To Wales in my arms.
53. Hoo, there, in castle keep,
54. You king singsong owls, who moonbeam
55. The flickering runs and dive
56. The dingle furred deer dead!
57. Huloo, on plumbed bryns,
58. O my ruffled ring dove
59. in the hooting, nearly dark
60. With Welsh and reverent rook,
61. Coo rooning the woods' praise,
62. who moons her blue notes from her nest
63. Down to the curlew herd!
64. Ho, hullaballoing clan
65. Agape, with woe
66. In your beaks, on the gabbing capes!
67. Heigh, on horseback hill, jack
68. Whisking hare! who
69. Hears, there, this fox light, my flood ship's
70. Clangour as I hew and smite
71. (A clash of anvils for my
72. Hubbub and fiddle, this tune
73. On a toungued puffball)
74. But animals thick as theives
75. On God's rough tumbling grounds
76. (Hail to His beasthood!).
77. Beasts who sleep good and thin,
78. Hist, in hogback woods! The haystacked
79. Hollow farms in a throng
80. Of waters cluck and cling,
81. And barnroofs cockcrow war!
82. O kingdom of neighbors finned
83. Felled and quilled, flash to my patch
84. Work ark and the moonshine
85. Drinking Noah of the bay,
86. With pelt, and scale, and fleece:
87. Only the drowned deep bells
88. Of sheep and churches noise
89. Poor peace as the sun sets
90. And dark shoals every holy field.
91. We will ride out alone then,
92. Under the stars of Wales,
93. Cry, multitudes of arks! Across
94. The water lidded lands,
95. Manned with their loves they'll move
96. Like wooden islands, hill to hill.
97. Hulloo, my prowed dove with a flute!
98. Ahoy, old, sea-legged fox,
99. Tom tit and Dai mouse!
100. My ark sings in the sun
101. At God speeded summer's end
102. And the flood flowers now.
