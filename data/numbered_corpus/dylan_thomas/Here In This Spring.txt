1. Here in this spring, stars float along the void;
2. Here in this ornamental winter
3. Down pelts the naked weather;
4. This summer buries a spring bird.

5. Symbols are selected from the years'
6. Slow rounding of four seasons' coasts,
7. In autumn teach three seasons' fires
8. And four birds' notes.

9. I should tell summer from the trees, the worms
10. Tell, if at all, the winter's storms
11. Or the funeral of the sun;
12. I should learn spring by the cuckooing,
13. And the slug should teach me destruction.

14. A worm tells summer better than the clock,
15. The slug's a living calendar of days;
16. What shall it tell me if a timeless insect
17. Says the world wears away?
