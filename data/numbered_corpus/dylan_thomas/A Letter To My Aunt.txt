1. A Letter To My Aunt Discussing The Correct Approach To Modern Poetry


2. To you, my aunt, who would explore
3. The literary Chankley Bore,
4. The paths are hard, for you are not
5. A literary Hottentot
6. But just a kind and cultured dame
7. Who knows not Eliot (to her shame).
8. Fie on you, aunt, that you should see
9. No genius in David G.,
10. No elemental form and sound
11. In T.S.E. and Ezra Pound.
12. Fie on you, aunt! I'll show you how
13. To elevate your middle brow,
14. And how to scale and see the sights
15. From modernist Parnassian heights.

16. First buy a hat, no Paris model
17. But one the Swiss wear when they yodel,
18. A bowler thing with one or two
19. Feathers to conceal the view;
20. And then in sandals walk the street
21. (All modern painters use their feet
22. For painting, on their canvas strips,
23. Their wives or mothers, minus hips).

24. Perhaps it would be best if you
25. Created something very new,
26. A dirty novel done in Erse
27. Or written backwards in Welsh verse,
28. Or paintings on the backs of vests,
29. Or Sanskrit psalms on lepers' chests.
30. But if this proved imposs-i-ble
31. Perhaps it would be just as well,
32. For you could then write what you please,
33. And modern verse is done with ease.

34. Do not forget that 'limpet' rhymes
35. With 'strumpet' in these troubled times,
36. And commas are the worst of crimes;
37. Few understand the works of Cummings,
38. And few James Joyce's mental slummings,
39. And few young Auden's coded chatter;
40. But then it is the few that matter.
41. Never be lucid, never state,
42. If you would be regarded great,
43. The simplest thought or sentiment,
44. (For thought, we know, is decadent);
45. Never omit such vital words
46. As belly, genitals and -----,
47. For these are things that play a part
48. (And what a part) in all good art.
49. Remember this: each rose is wormy,
50. And every lovely woman's germy;
51. Remember this: that love depends
52. On how the Gallic letter bends;
53. Remember, too, that life is hell
54. And even heaven has a smell
55. Of putrefying angels who
56. Make deadly whoopee in the blue.
57. These things remembered, what can stop
58. A poet going to the top?

59. A final word: before you start
60. The convulsions of your art,
61. Remove your brains, take out your heart;
62. Minus these curses, you can be
63. A genius like David G.

64. Take courage, aunt, and send your stuff
65. To Geoffrey Grigson with my luff,
66. And may I yet live to admire
67. How well your poems light the fire.
