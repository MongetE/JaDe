1. Never until the mankind making
2. Bird beast and flower
3. Fathering and all humbling darkness
4. Tells with silence the last light breaking
5. And the still hour
6. Is come of the sea tumbling in harness

7. And I must enter again the round
8. Zion of the water bead
9. And the synagogue of the ear of corn
10. Shall I let pray the shadow of a sound
11. Or sow my salt seed
12. In the least valley of sackcloth to mourn

13. The majesty and burning of the child's death.
14. I shall not murder
15. The mankind of her going with a grave truth
16. Nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath
17. With any further
18. Elegy of innocence and youth.

19. Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter,
20. Robed in the long friends,
21. The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,
22. Secret by the unmourning water
23. Of the riding Thames.
24. After the first death, there is no other.
