1. Friend by enemy I call you out.
2. You with a bad coin in your socket,
3. You my friend there with a winning air
4. Who palmed the lie on me when you looked
5. Brassily at my shyest secret,
6. Enticed with twinkling bits of the eye
7. Till the sweet tooth of my love bit dry,
8. Rasped at last, and I stumbled and sucked,
9. Whom now I conjure to stand as thief
10. In the memory worked by mirrors,
11. With unforgettably smiling act,
12. Quickness of hand in the velvet glove
13. And my whole heart under your hammer,
14. Were once such a creature, so gay and frank
15. A desireless familiar
16. I never thought to utter or think
17. While you displaced a truth in the air,

18. That though I loved them for their faults
19. As much as for their good,
20. My friends were enemies on stilts
21. With their heads in a cunning cloud.
