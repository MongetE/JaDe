1. In my craft or sullen art
2. Exercised in the still night
3. When only the moon rages
4. And the lovers lie abed
5. With all their griefs in their arms
6. I labour by singing light
7. Not for ambition or bread
8. Or the strut and trade of charms
9. On the ivory stages
10. But for the common wages
11. Of their most secret heart.

12. Not for the proud man apart
13. From the raging moon I write
14. On these spindrift pages
15. Nor for the towering dead
16. With their nightingales and psalms
17. But for the lovers, their arms
18. Round the griefs of the ages,
19. Who pay no praise or wages
20. Nor heed my craft or art
