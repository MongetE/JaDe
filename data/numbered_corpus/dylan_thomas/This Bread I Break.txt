1. This bread I break was once the oat,
2. This wine upon a foreign tree
3. Plunged in its fruit;
4. Man in the day or wine at night
5. Laid the crops low, broke the grape's joy.

6. Once in this time wine the summer blood
7. Knocked in the flesh that decked the vine,
8. Once in this bread
9. The oat was merry in the wind;
10. Man broke the sun, pulled the wind down.

11. This flesh you break, this blood you let
12. Make desolation in the vein,
13. Were oat and grape
14. Born of the sensual root and sap;
15. My wine you drink, my bread you snap.
