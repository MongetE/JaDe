1. Hold hard, these ancient minutes in the cuckoo's month,
2. Under the lank, fourth folly on Glamorgan's hill,
3. As the green blooms ride upward, to the drive of time;
4. Time, in a folly's rider, like a county man
5. Over the vault of ridings with his hound at heel,
6. Drives forth my men, my children, from the hanging south.

7. Country, your sport is summer, and December's pools
8. By crane and water-tower by the seedy trees
9. Lie this fifth month unstaked, and the birds have flown;
10. Holy hard, my country children in the world if tales,
11. The greenwood dying as the deer fall in their tracks,
12. The first and steepled season, to the summer's game.

13. And now the horns of England, in the sound of shape,
14. Summon your snowy horsemen, and the four-stringed hill,
15. Over the sea-gut loudening, sets a rock alive;
16. Hurdles and guns and railings, as the boulders heave,
17. Crack like a spring in vice, bone breaking April,
18. Spill the lank folly's hunter and the hard-held hope.

19. Down fall four padding weathers on the scarlet lands,
20. Stalking my children's faces with a tail of blood,
21. Time, in a rider rising, from the harnessed valley;
22. Hold hard, my country darlings, for a hawk descends,
23. Golden Glamorgan straightens, to the falling birds.
24. Your sport is summer as the spring runs angrily.
