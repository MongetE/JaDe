1. The hand that signed the paper felled a city;
2. Five sovereign fingers taxed the breath,
3. Doubled the globe of dead and halved a country;
4. These five kings did a king to death.

5. The mighty hand leads to a sloping shoulder,
6. The finger joints are cramped with chalk;
7. A goose's quill has put an end to murder
8. That put an end to talk.

9. The hand that signed the treaty bred a fever,
10. And famine grew, and locusts came;
11. Great is the hand that holds dominion over
12. Man by a scribbled name.

13. The five kings count the dead but do not soften
14. The crusted wound nor pat the brow;
15. A hand rules pity as a hand rules heaven;
16. Hands have no tears to flow.
