1. Grief thief of time crawls off,
2. The moon-drawn grave, with the seafaring years,
3. The knave of pain steals off
4. The sea-halved faith that blew time to his knees,
5. The old forget the cries,
6. Lean time on tide and times the wind stood rough,
7. Call back the castaways
8. Riding the sea light on a sunken path,
9. The old forget the grief,
10. Hack of the cough, the hanging albatross,
11. Cast back the bone of youth
12. And salt-eyed stumble bedward where she lies
13. Who tossed the high tide in a time of stories
14. And timelessly lies loving with the thief.

15. Now Jack my fathers let the time-faced crook,
16. Death flashing from his sleeve,
17. With swag of bubbles in a seedy sack
18. Sneak down the stallion grave,
19. Bull's-eye the outlaw through a eunuch crack
20. And free the twin-boxed grief,
21. No silver whistles chase him down the weeks'
22. Dayed peaks to day to death,
23. These stolen bubbles have the bites of snakes
24. And the undead eye-teeth,
25. No third eye probe into a rainbow's sex
26. That bridged the human halves,
27. All shall remain and on the graveward gulf
28. Shape with my fathers' thieves.
