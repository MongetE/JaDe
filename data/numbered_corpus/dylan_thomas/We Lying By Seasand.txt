1. We lying by seasand, watching yellow
2. And the grave sea, mock who deride
3. Who follow the red rivers, hollow
4. Alcove of words out of cicada shade,
5. For in this yellow grave of sand and sea
6. A calling for colour calls with the wind
7. That's grave and gay as grave and sea
8. Sleeping on either hand.
9. The lunar silences, the silent tide
10. Lapping the still canals, the dry tide-master
11. Ribbed between desert and water storm,
12. Should cure our ills of the water
13. With a one-coloured calm;
14. The heavenly music over the sand
15. Sounds with the grains as they hurry
16. Hiding the golden mountains and mansions
17. Of the grave, gay, seaside land.
18. Bound by a sovereign strip, we lie,
19. Watch yellow, wish for wind to blow away
20. The strata of the shore and drown red rock;
21. But wishes breed not, neither
22. Can we fend off rock arrival,
23. Lie watching yellow until the golden weather
24. Breaks, O my heart's blood, like a heart and hill.
