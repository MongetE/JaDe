1. I

2. Into her lying down head
3. His enemies entered bed,
4. Under the encumbered eyelid,
5. Through the rippled drum of the hair-buried ear;
6. And Noah's rekindled now unkind dove
7. Flew man-bearing there.
8. Last night in a raping wave
9. Whales unreined from the green grave
10. In fountains of origin gave up their love,
11. Along her innocence glided
12. Jaun aflame and savagely young King Lear,
13. Queen Catherine howling bare
14. And Samson drowned in his hair,
15. The colossal intimacies of silent
16. Once seen strangers or shades on a stair;
17. There the dark blade and wanton sighing her down
18. To a haycock couch and the scythes of his arms
19. Rode and whistled a hundred times
20. Before the crowing morning climbed;
21. Man was the burning England she was sleep-walking, and the enamouring island
22. Made her limbs blind by luminous charms,
23. Sleep to a newborn sleep in a swaddling loin-leaf stroked and sang
24. And his runaway beloved childlike laid in the acorned sand.


25. II

26. There where a numberless tongue
27. Wound their room with a male moan,
28. His faith around her flew undone
29. And darkness hung the walls with baskets of snakes,
30. A furnace-nostrilled column-membered
31. Super-or-near man
32. Resembling to her dulled sense
33. The thief of adolescence,
34. Early imaginary half remembered
35. Oceanic lover alone
36. Jealousy cannot forget for all her sakes,
37. Made his bad bed in her good
38. Night, and enjoyed as he would.
39. Crying, white gowned, from the middle moonlit stages
40. Out to the tiered and hearing tide,
41. Close and far she announced the theft of the heart
42. In the taken body at many ages,
43. Trespasser and broken bride
44. Celebrating at her side
45. All blood-signed assailing and vanished marriages in which he had no lovely part
46. Nor could share, for his pride, to the least
47. Mutter and foul wingbeat of the solemnizing nightpriest
48. Her holy unholy hours with the always anonymous beast.


49. III

50. Two sand grains together in bed,
51. Head to heaven-circling head,
52. Singly lie with the whole wide shore,
53. The covering sea their nightfall with no names;
54. And out of every domed and soil-based shell
55. One voice in chains declaims
56. The female, deadly, and male
57. Libidinous betrayal,
58. Golden dissolving under the water veil.
59. A she bird sleeping brittle by
60. Her lover's wings that fold to-morrow's flight,
61. Within the nested treefork
62. Sings to the treading hawk
63. Carrion, paradise, chirrup my bright yolk.
64. A blade of grass longs with the meadow,
65. A stone lies lost and locked in the lark-high hill.
66. Open as to the air to the naked shadow
67. O she lies alone and still,
68. Innocent between two wars,
69. With the incestuous secret brother in the seconds to perpetuate the stars,
70. A man torn up mourns in the sole night.
71. And the second comers, the severers, the enemies from the deep
72. Forgotten dark, rest their pulse and bury their dead in her faithless sleep.
