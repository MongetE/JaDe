1. Twenty-four years remind the tears of my eyes.
2. (Bury the dead for fear that they walk to the grave in labour.)
3. In the groin of the natural doorway I crouched like a tailor
4. Sewing a shroud for a journey
5. By the light of the meat-eating sun.
6. Dressed to die, the sensual strut begun,
7. With my red veins full of money,
8. In the final direction of the elementary town
9. I advance as long as forever is.
