1. Especially when the October wind
2. With frosty fingers punishes my hair,
3. Caught by the crabbing sun I walk on fire
4. And cast a shadow crab upon the land,
5. By the sea's side, hearing the noise of birds,
6. Hearing the raven cough in winter sticks,
7. My busy heart who shudders as she talks
8. Sheds the syllabic blood and drains her words.

9. Shut, too, in a tower of words, I mark
10. On the horizon walking like the trees
11. The wordy shapes of women, and the rows
12. Of the star-gestured children in the park.
13. Some let me make you of the vowelled beeches,
14. Some of the oaken voices, from the roots
15. Of many a thorny shire tell you notes,
16. Some let me make you of the water's speeches.

17. Behind a pot of ferns the wagging clock
18. Tells me the hour's word, the neural meaning
19. Flies on the shafted disk, declaims the morning
20. And tells the windy weather in the cock.
21. Some let me make you of the meadow's signs;
22. The signal grass that tells me all I know
23. Breaks with the wormy winter through the eye.
24. Some let me tell you of the raven's sins.

25. Especially when the October wind
26. (Some let me make you of autumnal spells,
27. The spider-tongued, and the loud hill of Wales)
28. With fists of turnips punishes the land,
29. Some let me make you of the heartless words.
30. The heart is drained that, spelling in the scurry
31. Of chemic blood, warned of the coming fury.
32. By the sea's side hear the dark-vowelled birds.
