1. Was there a time when dancers with their fiddles
2. In children's circuses could stay their troubles?
3. There was a time they could cry over books,
4. But time has sent its maggot on their track.
5. Under the arc of the sky they are unsafe.
6. What's never known is safest in this life.
7. Under the skysigns they who have no arms
8. have cleanest hands, and, as the heartless ghost
9. Alone's unhurt, so the blind man sees best.
