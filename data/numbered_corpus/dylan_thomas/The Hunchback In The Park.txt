1. The hunchback in the park
2. A solitary mister
3. Propped between trees and water
4. From the opening of the garden lock
5. That lets the trees and water enter
6. Until the Sunday sombre bell at dark

7. Eating bread from a newspaper
8. Drinking water from the chained cup
9. That the children filled with gravel
10. In the fountain basin where I sailed my ship
11. Slept at night in a dog kennel
12. But nobody chained him up.

13. Like the park birds he came early
14. Like the water he sat down
15. And Mister they called Hey mister
16. The truant boys from the town
17. Running when he had heard them clearly
18. On out of sound

19. Past lake and rockery
20. Laughing when he shook his paper
21. Hunchbacked in mockery
22. Through the loud zoo of the willow groves
23. Dodging the park keeper
24. With his stick that picked up leaves.

25. And the old dog sleeper
26. Alone between nurses and swans
27. While the boys among willows
28. Made the tigers jump out of their eyes
29. To roar on the rockery stones
30. And the groves were blue with sailors

31. Made all day until bell time
32. A woman figure without fault
33. Straight as a young elm
34. Straight and tall from his crooked bones
35. That she might stand in the night
36. After the locks and chains

37. All night in the unmade park
38. After the railings and shrubberies
39. The birds the grass the trees the lake
40. And the wild boys innocent as strawberries
41. Had followed the hunchback
42. To his kennel in the dark.
