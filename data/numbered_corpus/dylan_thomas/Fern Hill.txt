1. Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
2. About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
3. The night above the dingle starry,
4. Time let me hail and climb
5. Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
6. And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
7. And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
8. Trail with daisies and barley
9. Down the rivers of the windfall light.

10. And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
11. About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
12. In the sun that is young once only,
13. Time let me play and be
14. Golden in the mercy of his means,
15. And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
16. Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and
17. cold,
18. And the sabbath rang slowly
19. In the pebbles of the holy streams.

20. All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
21. Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was
22. air
23. And playing, lovely and watery
24. And fire green as grass.
25. And nightly under the simple stars
26. As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
27. All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the
28. nightjars
29. Flying with the ricks, and the horses
30. Flashing into the dark.

31. And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
32. With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
33. Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
34. The sky gathered again
35. And the sun grew round that very day.
36. So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
37. In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking
38. warm
39. Out of the whinnying green stable
40. On to the fields of praise.

41. And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
42. Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
43. In the sun born over and over,
44. I ran my heedless ways,
45. My wishes raced through the house high hay
46. And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
47. In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
48. Before the children green and golden
49. Follow him out of grace.

50. Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would
51. take me
52. Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
53. In the moon that is always rising,
54. Nor that riding to sleep
55. I should hear him fly with the high fields
56. And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
57. Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
58. Time held me green and dying
59. Though I sang in my chains like the sea.
