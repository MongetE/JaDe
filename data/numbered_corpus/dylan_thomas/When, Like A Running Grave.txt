1. When, like a running grave, time tracks you down,
2. Your calm and cuddled is a scythe of hairs,
3. Love in her gear is slowly through the house,
4. Up naked stairs, a turtle in a hearse,
5. Hauled to the dome,

6. Comes, like a scissors stalking, tailor age,
7. Deliver me who timid in my tribe,
8. Of love am barer than Cadaver's trap
9. Robbed of the foxy tongue, his footed tape
10. Of the bone inch

11. Deliver me, my masters, head and heart,
12. Heart of Cadaver's candle waxes thin,
13. When blood, spade-handed, and the logic time
14. Drive children up like bruises to the thumb,
15. From maid and head,

16. For, sunday faced, with dusters in my glove,
17. Chaste and the chaser, man with the cockshut eye,
18. I, that time's jacket or the coat of ice
19. May fail to fasten with a virgin o
20. In the straight grave,

21. Stride through Cadaver's country in my force,
22. My pickbrain masters morsing on the stone
23. Despair of blood faith in the maiden's slime,
24. Halt among eunuchs, and the nitric stain
25. On fork and face.

26. Time is a foolish fancy, time and fool.
27. No, no, you lover skull, descending hammer
28. Descends, my masters, on the entered honour.
29. You hero skull, Cadaver in the hangar
30. Tells the stick, 'fail.'

31. Joy is no knocking nation, sir and madam,
32. The cancer's fashion, or the summer feather
33. Lit on the cuddled tree, the cross of fever,
34. Not city tar and subway bored to foster
35. Man through macadam.

36. I dump the waxlights in your tower dome.
37. Joy is the knock of dust, Cadaver's shoot
38. Of bud of Adam through his boxy shift,
39. Love's twilit nation and the skull of state,
40. Sir, is your doom.

41. Everything ends, the tower ending and,
42. (Have with the house of wind), the leaning scene,
43. Ball of the foot depending from the sun,
44. (Give, summer, over), the cemented skin,
45. The actions' end.

46. All, men my madmen, the unwholesome wind
47. With whistler's cough contages, time on track
48. Shapes in a cinder death; love for his trick,
49. Happy Cadaver's hunger as you take
50. The kissproof world.
