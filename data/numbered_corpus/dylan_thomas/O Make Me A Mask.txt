1. O make me a mask and a wall to shut from your spies
2. Of the sharp, enamelled eyes and the spectacled claws
3. Rape and rebellion in the nurseries of my face,
4. Gag of dumbstruck tree to block from bare enemies
5. The bayonet tongue in this undefended prayerpiece,
6. The present mouth, and the sweetly blown trumpet of lies,
7. Shaped in old armour and oak the countenance of a dunce
8. To shield the glistening brain and blunt the examiners,
9. And a tear-stained widower grief drooped from the lashes
10. To veil belladonna and let the dry eyes perceive
11. Others betray the lamenting lies of their losses
12. By the curve of the nude mouth or the laugh up the sleeve.
