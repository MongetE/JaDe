1. In the mustardseed sun,
2. By full tilt river and switchback sea
3. Where the cormorants scud,
4. In his house on stilts high among beaks
5. And palavers of birds
6. This sandgrain day in the bent bay's grave
7. He celebrates and spurns
8. His driftwood thirty-fifth wind turned age;
9. Herons spire and spear.

10. Under and round him go
11. Flounders, gulls, on their cold, dying trails,
12. Doing what they are told,
13. Curlews aloud in the congered waves
14. Work at their ways to death,
15. And the rhymer in the long tongued room,
16. Who tolls his birthday bell,
17. Toesl towards the ambush of his wounds;
18. Herons, stepple stemmed, bless.

19. In the thistledown fall,
20. He sings towards anguish; finches fly
21. In the claw tracks of hawks
22. On a seizing sky; small fishes glide
23. Through wynds and shells of drowned
24. Ship towns to pastures of otters. He
25. In his slant, racking house
26. And the hewn coils of his trade perceives
27. Herons walk in their shroud,

28. The livelong river's robe
29. Of minnows wreathing around their prayer;
30. And far at sea he knows,
31. Who slaves to his crouched, eternal end
32. Under a serpent cloud,
33. Dolphins dyive in their turnturtle dust,
34. The rippled seals streak down
35. To kill and their own tide daubing blood
36. Slides good in the sleek mouth.

37. In a cavernous, swung
38. Wave's silence, wept white angelus knells.
39. Thirty-five bells sing struck
40. On skull and scar where his lovews lie wrecked,
41. Steered by the falling stars.
42. And to-morrow weeps in a blind cage
43. Terror will rage apart
44. Before chains break to a hammer flame
45. And love unbolts the dark

46. And freely he goes lost
47. In the unknown, famous light of great
48. And fabulous, dear God.
49. Dark is a way and light is a place,
50. Heaven that never was
51. Nor will be ever is alwas true,
52. And, in that brambled void,
53. Plenty as blackberries in the woods
54. The dead grow for His joy.

55. There he might wander bare
56. With the spirits of the horseshoe bay
57. Or the stars' seashore dead,
58. Marrow of eagles, the roots of whales
59. And wishbones of wild geese,
60. With blessed, unborn God and His Ghost,
61. And every soul His priest,
62. Gulled and chanter in youg Heaven's fold
63. Be at cloud quaking peace,

64. But dark is a long way.
65. He, on the earth of the night, alone
66. With all the living, prays,
67. Who knows the rocketing wind will blow
68. The bones out of the hills,
69. And the scythed boulders bleed, and the last
70. Rage shattered waters kick
71. Masts and fishes to the still quick stars,
72. Faithlessly unto Him

73. Who is the light of old
74. And air shaped Heaven where souls grow wild
75. As horses in the foam:
76. Oh, let me midlife mourn by the shrined
77. And druid herons' vows
78. The voyage to ruin I must run,
79. Dawn ships clouted aground,
80. Yet, though I cry with tumbledown tongue,
81. Count my blessings aloud:

82. Four elements and five
83. Senses, and man a spirit in love
84. Thangling through this spun slime
85. To his nimbus bell cool kingdom come
86. And the lost, moonshine domes,
87. And the sea that hides his secret selves
88. Deep in its black, base bones,
89. Lulling of spheres in the seashell flesh,
90. And this last blessing most,

91. That the closer I move
92. To death, one man through his sundered hulks,
93. The louder the sun blooms
94. And the tusked, ramshackling sea exults;
95. And every wave of the way
96. And gale I tackle, the whole world then,
97. With more triumphant faith
98. That ever was since the world was said,
99. Spins its morning of praise,

100. I hear the bouncing hills
101. Grow larked and greener at berry brown
102. Fall and the dew larks sing
103. Taller this thuderclap spring, and how
104. More spanned with angles ride
105. The mansouled fiery islands! Oh,
106. Holier then their eyes,
107. And my shining men no more alone
108. As I sail out to die
