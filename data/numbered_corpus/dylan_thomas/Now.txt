7. Forsake, the fool, the hardiness of anger.

8. Now
9. Say nay,
10. Sir no say,
11. Death to the yes,
12. the yes to death, the yesman and the answer,

27. The sun that leaps on petals through a nought,
28. the come-a-cropper rider of the flower.

29. Now
30. Say nay

35. The two-a-vein, the foreskin, and the cloud.
