1. The bows glided down, and the coast
2. Blackened with birds took a last look
3. At his thrashing hair and whale-blue eye;
4. The trodden town rang its cobbles for luck.

5. Then good-bye to the fishermanned
6. Boat with its anchor free and fast
7. As a bird hooking over the sea,
8. High and dry by the top of the mast,

9. Whispered the affectionate sand
10. And the bulwarks of the dazzled quay.
11. For my sake sail, and never look back,
12. Said the looking land.

13. Sails drank the wind, and white as milk
14. He sped into the drinking dark;
15. The sun shipwrecked west on a pearl
16. And the moon swam out of its hulk.

17. Funnels and masts went by in a whirl.
18. Good-bye to the man on the sea-legged deck
19. To the gold gut that sings on his reel
20. To the bait that stalked out of the sack,

21. For we saw him throw to the swift flood
22. A girl alive with his hooks through her lips;
23. All the fishes were rayed in blood,
24. Said the dwindling ships.

25. Good-bye to chimneys and funnels,
26. Old wives that spin in the smoke,
27. He was blind to the eyes of candles
28. In the praying windows of waves

29. But heard his bait buck in the wake
30. And tussle in a shoal of loves.
31. Now cast down your rod, for the whole
32. Of the sea is hilly with whales,

33. She longs among horses and angels,
34. The rainbow-fish bend in her joys,
35. Floated the lost cathedral
36. Chimes of the rocked buoys.

37. Where the anchor rode like a gull
38. Miles over the moonstruck boat
39. A squall of birds bellowed and fell,
40. A cloud blew the rain from its throat;

41. He saw the storm smoke out to kill
42. With fuming bows and ram of ice,
43. Fire on starlight, rake Jesu's stream;
44. And nothing shone on the water's face

45. But the oil and bubble of the moon,
46. Plunging and piercing in his course
47. The lured fish under the foam
48. Witnessed with a kiss.

49. Whales in the wake like capes and Alps
50. Quaked the sick sea and snouted deep,
51. Deep the great bushed bait with raining lips
52. Slipped the fins of those humpbacked tons

53. And fled their love in a weaving dip.
54. Oh, Jericho was falling in their lungs!
55. She nipped and dived in the nick of love,
56. Spun on a spout like a long-legged ball

57. Till every beast blared down in a swerve
58. Till every turtle crushed from his shell
59. Till every bone in the rushing grave
60. Rose and crowed and fell!

61. Good luck to the hand on the rod,
62. There is thunder under its thumbs;
63. Gold gut is a lightning thread,
64. His fiery reel sings off its flames,

65. The whirled boat in the burn of his blood
66. Is crying from nets to knives,
67. Oh the shearwater birds and their boatsized brood
68. Oh the bulls of Biscay and their calves

69. Are making under the green, laid veil
70. The long-legged beautiful bait their wives.
71. Break the black news and paint on a sail
72. Huge weddings in the waves,

73. Over the wakeward-flashing spray
74. Over the gardens of the floor
75. Clash out the mounting dolphin's day,
76. My mast is a bell-spire,

77. Strike and smoothe, for my decks are drums,
78. Sing through the water-spoken prow
79. The octopus walking into her limbs
80. The polar eagle with his tread of snow.

81. From salt-lipped beak to the kick of the stern
82. Sing how the seal has kissed her dead!
83. The long, laid minute's bride drifts on
84. Old in her cruel bed.

85. Over the graveyard in the water
86. Mountains and galleries beneath
87. Nightingale and hyena
88. Rejoicing for that drifting death

89. Sing and howl through sand and anemone
90. Valley and sahara in a shell,
91. Oh all the wanting flesh his enemy
92. Thrown to the sea in the shell of a girl


93. Is old as water and plain as an eel;
94. Always good-bye to the long-legged bread
95. Scattered in the paths of his heels
96. For the salty birds fluttered and fed

97. And the tall grains foamed in their bills;
98. Always good-bye to the fires of the face,
99. For the crab-backed dead on the sea-bed rose
100. And scuttled over her eyes,

101. The blind, clawed stare is cold as sleet.
102. The tempter under the eyelid
103. Who shows to the selves asleep
104. Mast-high moon-white women naked

105. Walking in wishes and lovely for shame
106. Is dumb and gone with his flame of brides.
107. Susannah's drowned in the bearded stream
108. And no-one stirs at Sheba's side

109. But the hungry kings of the tides;
110. Sin who had a woman's shape
111. Sleeps till Silence blows on a cloud
112. And all the lifted waters walk and leap.

113. Lucifer that bird's dropping
114. Out of the sides of the north
115. Has melted away and is lost
116. Is always lost in her vaulted breath,

117. Venus lies star-struck in her wound
118. And the sensual ruins make
119. Seasons over the liquid world,
120. White springs in the dark.

121. Always good-bye, cried the voices through the shell,
122. Good-bye always, for the flesh is cast
123. And the fisherman winds his reel
124. With no more desire than a ghost.

125. Always good luck, praised the finned in the feather
126. Bird after dark and the laughing fish
127. As the sails drank up the hail of thunder
128. And the long-tailed lightning lit his catch.

129. The boat swims into the six-year weather,
130. A wind throws a shadow and it freezes fast.
131. See what the gold gut drags from under
132. Mountains and galleries to the crest!

133. See what clings to hair and skull
134. As the boat skims on with drinking wings!
135. The statues of great rain stand still,
136. And the flakes fall like hills.

137. Sing and strike his heavy haul
138. Toppling up the boatside in a snow of light!
139. His decks are drenched with miracles.
140. Oh miracle of fishes! The long dead bite!

141. Out of the urn a size of a man
142. Out of the room the weight of his trouble
143. Out of the house that holds a town
144. In the continent of a fossil

145. One by one in dust and shawl,
146. Dry as echoes and insect-faced,
147. His fathers cling to the hand of the girl
148. And the dead hand leads the past,

149. Leads them as children and as air
150. On to the blindly tossing tops;
151. The centuries throw back their hair
152. And the old men sing from newborn lips:

153. Time is bearing another son.
154. Kill Time! She turns in her pain!
155. The oak is felled in the acorn
156. And the hawk in the egg kills the wren.

157. He who blew the great fire in
158. And died on a hiss of flames
159. Or walked the earth in the evening
160. Counting the denials of the grains

161. Clings to her drifting hair, and climbs;
162. And he who taught their lips to sing
163. Weeps like the risen sun among
164. The liquid choirs of his tribes.

165. The rod bends low, divining land,
166. And through the sundered water crawls
167. A garden holding to her hand
168. With birds and animals

169. With men and women and waterfalls
170. Trees cool and dry in the whirlpool of ships
171. And stunned and still on the green, laid veil
172. Sand with legends in its virgin laps

173. And prophets loud on the burned dunes;
174. Insects and valleys hold her thighs hard,
175. Times and places grip her breast bone,
176. She is breaking with seasons and clouds;

177. Round her trailed wrist fresh water weaves,
178. with moving fish and rounded stones
179. Up and down the greater waves
180. A separate river breathes and runs;

181. Strike and sing his catch of fields
182. For the surge is sown with barley,
183. The cattle graze on the covered foam,
184. The hills have footed the waves away,

185. With wild sea fillies and soaking bridles
186. With salty colts and gales in their limbs
187. All the horses of his haul of miracles
188. Gallop through the arched, green farms,

189. Trot and gallop with gulls upon them
190. And thunderbolts in their manes.
191. O Rome and Sodom To-morrow and London
192. The country tide is cobbled with towns

193. And steeples pierce the cloud on her shoulder
194. And the streets that the fisherman combed
195. When his long-legged flesh was a wind on fire
196. And his loin was a hunting flame

197. Coil from the thoroughfares of her hair
198. And terribly lead him home alive
199. Lead her prodigal home to his terror,
200. The furious ox-killing house of love.

201. Down, down, down, under the ground,
202. Under the floating villages,
203. Turns the moon-chained and water-wound
204. Metropolis of fishes,

205. There is nothing left of the sea but its sound,
206. Under the earth the loud sea walks,
207. In deathbeds of orchards the boat dies down
208. And the bait is drowned among hayricks,

209. Land, land, land, nothing remains
210. Of the pacing, famous sea but its speech,
211. And into its talkative seven tombs
212. The anchor dives through the floors of a church.

213. Good-bye, good luck, struck the sun and the moon,
214. To the fisherman lost on the land.
215. He stands alone in the door of his home,
216. With his long-legged heart in his hand.
