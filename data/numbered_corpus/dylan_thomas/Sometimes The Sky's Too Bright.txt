1. Sometimes the sky's too bright,
2. Or has too many clouds or birds,
3. And far away's too sharp a sun
4. To nourish thinking of him.
5. Why is my hand too blunt
6. To cut in front of me
7. My horrid images for me,
8. Of over-fruitful smiles,
9. The weightless touching of the lip
10. I wish to know
11. I cannot lift, but can,
12. The creature with the angel's face
13. Who tells me hurt,
14. And sees my body go
15. Down into misery?
16. No stopping. Put the smile
17. Where tears have come to dry.
18. The angel's hurt is left;
19. His telling burns.

20. Sometimes a woman's heart has salt,
21. Or too much blood;
22. I tear her breast,
23. And see the blood is mine,
24. Flowing from her, but mine,
25. And then I think
26. Perhaps the sky's too bright;
27. And watch my hand,
28. But do not follow it,
29. And feel the pain it gives,
30. But do not ache.
