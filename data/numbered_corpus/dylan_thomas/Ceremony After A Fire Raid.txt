1. I

2. Myselves
3. The grievers
4. Grieve
5. Among the street burned to tireless death
6. A child of a few hours
7. With its kneading mouth
8. Charred on the black breast of the grave
9. The mother dug, and its arms full of fires.

10. Begin
11. With singing
12. Sing
13. Darkness kindled back into beginning
14. When the caught tongue nodded blind,
15. A star was broken
16. Into the centuries of the child
17. Myselves grieve now, and miracles cannot atone.

18. Forgive
19. Us forgive
20. Us your death that myselves the believers
21. May hold it in a great flood
22. Till the blood shall spurt,
23. And the dust shall sing like a bird
24. As the grains blow, as your death grows, through our heart.

25. Crying
26. Your dying
27. Cry,
28. Child beyond cockcrow, by the fire-dwarfed
29. Street we chant the flying sea
30. In the body bereft.
31. Love is the last light spoken. Oh
32. Seed of sons in the loin of the black husk left.


33. II

34. I know not whether
35. Adam or Eve, the adorned holy bullock
36. Or the white ewe lamb
37. Or the chosen virgin
38. Laid in her snow
39. On the altar of London,
40. Was the first to die
41. In the cinder of the little skull,
42. O bride and bride groom
43. O Adam and Eve together
44. Lying in the lull
45. Under the sad breast of the head stone
46. White as the skeleton
47. Of the garden of Eden.

48. I know the legend
49. Of Adam and Eve is never for a second
50. Silent in my service
51. Over the dead infants
52. Over the one
53. Child who was priest and servants,
54. Word, singers, and tongue
55. In the cinder of the little skull,
56. Who was the serpent's
57. Night fall and the fruit like a sun,
58. Man and woman undone,
59. Beginning crumbled back to darkness
60. Bare as nurseries
61. Of the garden of wilderness.


62. III

63. Into the organpipes and steeples
64. Of the luminous cathedrals,
65. Into the weathercocks' molten mouths
66. Rippling in twelve-winded circles,
67. Into the dead clock burning the hour
68. Over the urn of sabbaths
69. Over the whirling ditch of daybreak
70. Over the sun's hovel and the slum of fire
71. And the golden pavements laid in requiems,
72. Into the bread in a wheatfield of flames,
73. Into the wine burning like brandy,
74. The masses of the sea
75. The masses of the sea under
76. The masses of the infant-bearing sea
77. Erupt, fountain, and enter to utter for ever
78. Glory glory glory
79. The sundering ultimate kingdom of genesis' thunder.
