1. The force that through the green fuse drives the flower
2. Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
3. Is my destroyer.
4. And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose
5. My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.

6. The force that drives the water through the rocks
7. Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams
8. Turns mine to wax.
9. And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins
10. How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.

11. The hand that whirls the water in the pool
12. Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind
13. Hauls my shroud sail.
14. And I am dumb to tell the hanging man
15. How of my clay is made the hangman's lime.

16. The lips of time leech to the fountain head;
17. Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood
18. Shall calm her sores.
19. And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind
20. How time has ticked a heaven round the stars.

21. And I am dumb to tell the lover's tomb
22. How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm.
