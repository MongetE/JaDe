1. Why east wind chills and south wind cools
2. Shall not be known till windwell dries
3. And west's no longer drowned
4. In winds that bring the fruit and rind
5. Of many a hundred falls;
6. Why silk is soft and the stone wounds
7. The child shall question all his days,
8. Why night-time rain and the breast's blood
9. Both quench his thirst he'll have a black reply.

10. When cometh Jack Frost? the children ask.
11. Shall they clasp a comet in their fists?
12. Not till, from high and low, their dust
13. Sprinkles in children's eyes a long-last sleep
14. And dusk is crowded with the children's ghosts,
15. Shall a white answer echo from the rooftops.

16. All things are known: the stars' advice
17. Calls some content to travel with the winds,
18. Though what the stars ask as they round
19. Time upon time the towers of the skies
20. Is heard but little till the stars go out.
21. I hear content, and 'Be Content'
22. Ring like a handbell through the corridors,
23. And 'Know no answer,' and I know
24. No answer to the children's cry
25. Of echo's answer and the man of frost
26. And ghostly comets over the raised fists.
