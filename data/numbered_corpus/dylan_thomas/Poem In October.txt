1. It was my thirtieth year to heaven
2. Woke to my hearing from harbour and neighbour wood
3. And the mussel pooled and the heron
4. Priested shore
5. The morning beckon
6. With water praying and call of seagull and rook
7. And the knock of sailing boats on the net webbed wall
8. Myself to set foot
9. That second
10. In the still sleeping town and set forth.

11. My birthday began with the water-
12. Birds and the birds of the winged trees flying my name
13. Above the farms and the white horses
14. And I rose
15. In rainy autumn
16. And walked abroad in a shower of all my days.
17. High tide and the heron dived when I took the road
18. Over the border
19. And the gates
20. Of the town closed as the town awoke.

21. A springful of larks in a rolling
22. Cloud and the roadside bushes brimming with whistling
23. Blackbirds and the sun of October
24. Summery
25. On the hill's shoulder,
26. Here were fond climates and sweet singers suddenly
27. Come in the morning where I wandered and listened
28. To the rain wringing
29. Wind blow cold
30. In the wood faraway under me.

31. Pale rain over the dwindling harbour
32. And over the sea wet church the size of a snail
33. With its horns through mist and the castle
34. Brown as owls
35. But all the gardens
36. Of spring and summer were blooming in the tall tales
37. Beyond the border and under the lark full cloud.
38. There could I marvel
39. My birthday
40. Away but the weather turned around.

41. It turned away from the blithe country
42. And down the other air and the blue altered sky
43. Streamed again a wonder of summer
44. With apples
45. Pears and red currants
46. And I saw in the turning so clearly a child's
47. Forgotten mornings when he walked with his mother
48. Through the parables
49. Of sun light
50. And the legends of the green chapels

51. And the twice told fields of infancy
52. That his tears burned my cheeks and his heart moved in mine.
53. These were the woods the river and sea
54. Where a boy
55. In the listening
56. Summertime of the dead whispered the truth of his joy
57. To the trees and the stones and the fish in the tide.
58. And the mystery
59. Sang alive
60. Still in the water and singingbirds.

61. And there could I marvel my birthday
62. Away but the weather turned around. And the true
63. Joy of the long dead child sang burning
64. In the sun.
65. It was my thirtieth
66. Year to heaven stood there then in the summer noon
67. Though the town below lay leaved with October blood.
68. O may my heart's truth
69. Still be sung
70. On this high hill in a year's turning.
