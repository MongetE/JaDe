1. LIKE some vision olden
2. Of far other time,
3. When the age was golden,
4. In the young world's prime
5. Is thy soft pipe ringing,
6. O lonely shepherd boy,
7. What song art thou singing,
8. In thy youth and joy?

9. Or art thou complaining
10. Of thy lowly lot,
11. And thine own disdaining
12. Dost ask what thou hast not?
13. Of the future dreaming,
14. Weary of the past,
15. For the present scheming,
16. All but what thou hast.

17. No, thou art delighting
18. In thy summer home;
19. Where the flowers inviting
20. Tempt the bee to roam;
21. Where the cowslip bending,
22. With its golden bells,
23. Of each glad hour's ending
24. With a sweet chime tells.

25. All wild creatures love him
26. When he is alone,
27. Every bird above him
28. Sings its softest tone.
29. Thankful to high Heaven,
30. Humble in thy joy,
31. Much to thee is given,
32. Lowly shepherd boy.
