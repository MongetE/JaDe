1. IT was a wild and untrain'd bower,
2. Enough to screen from April shower,
3. Or shelter from June's hotter hour,
4. Tapestried with starry jessamines,
5. The summer's gold and silver mines;
6. With a moss seat, and its turf set
7. With crowds of the white violet.
8. And close beside a fountain play'd,
9. Dim, cool, from its encircling shade;
10. And lemon trees grew round, as pale
11. As never yet to them the gale
12. Had brought a message from the sun
13. To say their summer task was done.
14. It was a very solitude
15. For love in its despairing mood,
16. With just enough of breath and bloom,
17. With just enough of calm and gloom,
18. To suit a heart where love has wrought
19. His wasting work, with saddest thought;
20. Where all its sickly fantasies
21. May call up suiting images:
22. With flowers like hopes that spring and fade
23. As only for a mockery made,
24. And shadows of the boughs that fall
25. Like sorrow drooping over all.

26. And LEILA , loveliest! can it be
27. Such destiny is made for thee?
28. Yes, it is written on thy brow
29. The all thy lip may not avow,--
30. All that in woman's heart can dwell,
31. Save by a blush unutterable.
32. Alas! that ever RAYMOND came
33. To light thy cheek and heart to flame,--
34. A hidden fire, but not the less
35. Consuming in its dark recess.

36. She had leant by his couch of pain,
37. When throbbing pulse and bursting vein
38. Fierce spoke the fever, when fate near
39. Rode on the tainted atmosphere;
40. And though that parch'd lip spoke alone
41. Of other love, in fondest tone,
42. And though the maiden knew that death
43. Might be upon his lightest breath,
44. Yet never by her lover's side
45. More fondly watch'd affianced bride,--
46. With pain or fear more anxious strove,
47. Than LEILA watch'd another's love.

48. But he was safe!--that very day
49. Farewell, it had been her's to say;
50. And he was gone to his own land,
51. To seek another maiden's hand.

52. Who that had look'd on her that morn,
53. Could dream of all her heart had borne;
54. Her cheek was red, but who could know
55. 'Twas flushing with the strife below;--
56. Her eye was bright, but who could tell
57. It shone with tears she strove to quell;--
58. Her voice was gay, her step was light;
59. And, beaming, beautiful, and bright,
60. It was as if life could confer
61. Nothing but happiness on her.
62. Ah! who could think that all so fair
63. Was semblance, and but misery there.

64. 'Tis strange with how much power and pride
65. The softness is of love allied;
66. How much of power to force the breast
67. To be in outward show at rest,--
68. How much of pride that never eye
69. May look upon its agony!
70. Ah! little will the lip reveal
71. Of all the burning heart can feel.

72. But this was past, and she was now
73. With clasped hands prest to her brow,
74. And head bow'd down upon her knee,
75. And heart-pulse throbbing audibly,
76. And tears that gush'd like autumn rain,
77. The more for that they gush'd in vain.
78. Oh! why should woman ever love,
79. Trusting to one false star above;
80. And fling her little chance away
81. Of sunshine for its treacherous ray.

82. At first ELVIRA had not sought
83. To break upon her lonely thought.
84. But it was now the vesper time,
85. And she return'd not at the chime
86. Of holy bells,--she knew the hour:--
87. At last they search'd her favourite bower;
88. Beside the fount they found the maid
89. On head bow'd down, as if she pray'd;
90. Her long black hair fell like a veil,
91. Making her pale brow yet more pale.
92. 'Twas strange to look upon her face,
93. Then turn and see its shadowy trace
94. Within the fountain; one like stone,
95. So cold, so colourless, so lone,--
96. A statue nymph, placed there to show
97. How far the sculptor's art could go.
98. The other, and that too the shade,
99. In light and crimson warmth array'd;
100. For the red glow of day declining,
101. Was now upon the fountain shining,
102. And the shape in its mirror bright
103. Of sparkling waves caught warmth and light.

104. ELVIRA spoke not, though so near,
105. Her words lay mute in their own fear:
106. At last she whisper'd LEILA'S name,--
107. No answer from the maiden came.
108. She took one cold hand in her own,
109. Started, and it dropp'd lifeless down!
110. She gazed upon the fixed eye,
111. And read in it mortality.

112. And lingers yet that maiden's tale
113. A legend of the lemon vale:
114. They say that never from that hour
115. Has flourish'd there a single flower,--
116. The jasmine droop'd, the violets died,
117. Nothing grew by that fountain side,
118. Save the pale pining lemon trees,
119. And the dark weeping cypresses.--
120. And now when to the twilight star
121. The lover wakes his lone guitar,
122. Or maiden bids a song impart
123. All that is veil'd in her own heart,
124. The wild and mournful tale they tell
125. Of her who loved, alas! too well.--

126. And where was RAYMOND , where was he?
127. Borne homeward o'er the rapid sea,
128. While sunny days and favouring gales
129. Brought welcome speed to the white sails,--
130. With bended knee, and upraised hand,
131. He stood upon his native land,
132. With all that happiness can be
133. When resting on futurity.
134. On, on he went, and o'er the plain
135. He rode an armed knight again;
136. He urged his steed with hand and heel,
137. It bounded concious of the steel,
138. And never yet to RAYMOND'S eye
139. Spread such an earth, shone such a sky,
140. Blew such sweet breezes o'er his brow,
141. As those his native land had now.

142. He thought upon young EVA'S name,
143. And felt that she was still the same;
144. He thought on AMIRALD , his child
145. Had surely his dark cares beguiled;
146. He thought upon the welcome sweet
147. It would be his so soon to meet:
148. And never had the star of hope
149. Shone on a lovelier horoscope.

150. And evening shades were on the hour
151. When RAYMOND rode beneath the tower
152. Remember'd well, for ADELINE
153. Had there been his heart's summer queen.
154. Could this be it?--he knew the heath
155. Which, lake-like, spread its walls beneath,--
156. He saw the dark old chesnut wood
157. Which had for ages by it stood;
158. And but for these the place had been
159. As one that he had never seen.
160. The walls were rent, the gates were gone,
161. No red light from the watch tower shone.
162. He enter'd, and the hall was bare,
163. It show'd the spoiler had been there;
164. Even upon the very hearth
165. The green grass found a place of birth.

166. Oh, vanity! that the stone wall
167. May sooner than a blossom fall;
168. The tower in its strength may be
169. Laid low before the willow tree.
170. There stood the wood, subject to all
171. The autumn wind, the winter fall,--
172. There stood the castle which the rain
173. And wind had buffetted in vain,--
174. But one in ruins stood beside
175. The other green in its spring pride.

176. And RAYMOND paced the lonely hall
177. As if he feared his own footfall.
178. It is the very worst, the gloom
179. Of a deserted banquet-room,
180. To see the spider's web outvie
181. The torn and faded tapestry,--
182. To shudder at the cold damp air,
183. Then think how once were burning there
184. The incense vase with odour glowing,
185. The silver lamp its softness throwing
186. O'er cheeks as beautiful and bright
187. As roses bathed in summer light,--
188. How through the portals sweeping came
189. Proud cavalier and high-born dame,
190. With gems like stars 'mid raven curls,
191. And snow-white plumes and wreathed pearls--
192. Gold cups, whose lighted flames made dim
193. The sparkling stones around the brim;--
194. Soft voices answering to the lute,
195. The swelling harp, the sigh-waked flute,--
196. The glancing lightness of the dance,--
197. Then, starting sudden from thy trance,
198. Gaze round the lonely place and see
199. Its silence and obscurity:
200. Then commune with thine heart, and say
201. These are the foot-prints of decay,--
202. And I, even thus shall pass away.

203. And RAYMOND turn'd him to depart,
204. With darken'd brow and heavy heart.
205. Can outrage or can time remove
206. The sting, the scar of slighted love?
207. He could not look upon the scene
208. And not remember ADELINE ,
209. Fair queen of gone festivity,--
210. Oh, where was it, and where was she!

211. At distance short a village lay,
212. And thither RAYMOND took his way,
213. And in its hostel shelter found,
214. While the dark night was closing round.
215. It was a cheerful scene, the hearth
216. Was bright with wood-fire and with mirth,
217. And in the midst a harper bent
218. O'er his companion instrument:
219. 'Twas an old man, his hair was grey,--
220. For winter tracks in snow its way,--
221. But yet his dark, keen eye was bright,
222. With somewhat of its youthful light;
223. Like one whose path of life had made
224. Its course through mingled sheen and shade,
225. But one whose buoyant spirit still
226. Pass'd lightly on through good or ill,--
227. One reckless if borne o'er the sea
228. In storm or in tranquillity;
229. The same to him, as if content
230. Were his peculiar element.
231. 'Tis strange how the heart can create
232. Or colour from itself its fate;
233. We make ourselves our own distress,
234. We are ourselves our happiness.

235. And many a song and many a lay,
236. Had pass'd the cheerful hour away,
237. When one pray'd that he would relate,
238. His tale of the proud ladye's fate,--
239. The lady ADELINE ;--the name
240. Like lightning upon RAYMOND came!
241. And swept the harper o'er his chords
242. As that he paused for minstrel words,
243. Or stay'd till silence should prevail,
244. When thus the old man told the tale.

245. THE PROUD LADYE.

246. OH , what could the ladye's beauty match,
247. An it were not the ladye's pride;
248. An hundred knights from far and near
249. Woo'd at that ladye's side.

250. The rose of the summer slept on her cheek,
251. Its lily upon her breast,
252. And her eye shone forth like the glorious star
253. That rises the first in the west.

254. There were some that woo'd for her land and gold,
255. And some for her noble name,
256. And more that woo'd for her loveliness;
257. But her answer was still the same.

258. 'There is a steep and lofty wall,
259. Where my warders trembling stand,
260. He who at speed shall ride round its height,
261. For him shall be my hand.'

262. Many turn'd away from the deed,
263. The hope of their wooing o'er;
264. But many a young knight mounted the steed
265. He never mounted more.

266. At last there came a youthful knight,
267. From a strange and far countrie,
268. The steed that he rode was white as the foam
269. Upon a stormy sea.

270. And she who had scorn'd the name of love,
271. Now bow'd before its might,
272. And the ladye grew meek as if disdain
273. Were not made for that stranger knight.

274. She sought at first to steal his soul
275. By dance, song, and festival;
276. At length on bended knee she pray'd
277. He would not ride the wall.

278. But gaily the young knight laugh'd at her fears,
279. And flung him on his steed,--
280. There was not a saint in the calendar
281. That she pray'd not to in her need.

282. She dared not raise her eyes to see
283. If heaven had granted her prayer,
284. Till she heard a light step bound to her side,--
285. The gallant knight stood there!

286. And took the ladye ADELINE
287. From her hair a jewell'd band,
288. But the knight repell'd the offer'd gift,
289. And turn'd from the offer'd hand.

290. And deemest thou that I dared this deed,
291. Ladye, for love of thee;
292. The honour that guides the soldier's lance
293. Is mistress enough for me.

294. Enough for me to ride the ring,
295. The victor's crown to wear;
296. But not in honour of the eyes
297. Of any ladye there.

298. I had a brother whom I lost
299. Through thy proud crueltie,
300. And far more was to me his love,
301. Than woman's love can be.

302. I came to triumph o'er the pride
303. Through which that brother fell,
304. I laugh to scorn thy love and thee,
305. And now, proud dame, farewell!

306. And from that hour the ladye pined,
307. For love was in her heart,
308. And on her slumber there came dreams
309. She could not bid depart.

310. Her eye lost all its starry light,
311. Her cheek grew wan and pale,
312. Till she hid her faded loveliness
313. Beneath the sacred veil.

314. And she cut off her long dark hair,
315. And bade the world farewell,
316. And she now dwells a veiled nun
317. In Saint Marie's cell.

318. AND what were RAYMOND'S dreams that night?
319. The morning's gift of crimson light
320. Waked not his sleep, for his pale cheek
321. Did not of aught like slumber speak;
322. Though not upon a morn like this
323. Should RAYMOND turn to aught but bliss.
324. To-day, when EVA will be prest,
325. Ere evening, to his throbbing breast,--
326. To-day, when all his own will be
327. That cheer'd his long captivity.
328. Care to the wind of heaven was flung
329. As the young knight to stirrup sprung.

330. He reach'd the castle; save one, all
331. Rush'd to his welcome in the hall.
332. He gazed, but there no EVA came,
333. Scarce his low voice named EVA'S name!

334. 'Our EVA , she is far away
335. Amid the young, the fair, the gay.
336. At Thoulouse, now the bright resort
337. Of beauty and the Minstrel Court;
338. For this time it is hers to set
339. The victor's brow with violet.
340. Her father,--but you're worn and pale,--
341. Come, the wine cup will aid my tale.'
342. The greeting of the elder knight,
343. The cheerful board, the vintage bright,
344. Not all could chase from RAYMOND'S soul,
345. The cloud that o'er its gladness stole;
346. And soon, pretending toil, he sought
347. A solitude for lonely thought.--
348. 'Tis strange how much of vanity
349. Almost unconciously will be
350. With our best feelings mix'd, and now
351. But that, what shadows RAYMOND'S brow.

352. He had deem'd a declining flower,
353. Pining in solitary bower,
354. He should find EVA , sad and lone,--
355. He sought the cage, the bird had flown,
356. With burnish'd plume, and careless wing,
357. A follower of the sunny Spring.
358. He pictured her the first of all
359. In masque, and dance, and festival,--
360. With cheek at its own praises burning,
361. And eyes but on adorers turning,
362. The lady of the tournament,
363. For whose bright sake the lance was sent;
364. While minstrels borrow'd from her name
365. The beauty which they paid by fame:
366. Beloved! not even his hot brain
367. Dared whisper,--loving too again.

368. But the next morn, and RAYMOND bent
369. His steps to that fair Parliament,
370. While pride and hasty anger strove
371. Against his memory and his love.
372. But leave we him awhile to rave
373. Against the faith which, like the wave,
374. By every grain of sand can be
375. Moved from its own tranquillity,
376. Till settled he that woman's mind
377. Was but a leaf before the wind,--
378. Left to remain, retreat, advance,
379. Without a destiny but chance.--

380. And where is EVA ? on her cheek
381. Is there aught that of love may speak?
382. Amid the music and perfume
383. That, mingling, fill yon stately room
384. A maiden sits, around her chair
385. Stand others who, with graceful care,
386. Bind Indian jewels in her hair.
387. 'Tis EVA ! on one side a stand
388. Of dark wood from the Ethiop's land
389. Is cover'd with all gems that deck
390. A maiden's arm, or maiden's neck:
391. The diamond with its veins of light,
392. The sapphire like a summer night,
393. The ruby rich as it had won
394. A red gift from the setting sun,
395. And white pearls, such as might have been
396. A bridal offering for a queen.

397. On the side opposite were thrown,
398. Rainbow-like mix'd, a sparkling zone,
399. A snow-white veil, a purple vest
400. Embroider'd with a golden crest.
401. Before, the silver mirror's trace
402. Is the sweet shadow of her face,
403. Placed as appealing to her eyes
404. For the truth of the flatteries,
405. With which her gay attendants seek
406. To drive all sadness from her cheek.--
407. She heard them not; she reck'd not how
408. They wreath'd the bright hair o'er her brow,
409. Whate'er its sunny grace might be
410. There was an eye that would not see.
411. They told of words of royal praise,
412. They told of minstrel's moonlight lays,
413. Of youthful knights who swore to die
414. For her least smile, her lightest sigh.
415. But he was gone, her young, her brave,
416. Her heart was with him in the grave.

417. Wearied, for ill the heart may bear
418. Light words in which it has no share,
419. She turn'd to a pale maid, who, mute,
420. Dreaming of song leant o'er her lute;
421. And at her sign, that maiden's words
422. Came echo-like to its sweet chords,--
423. It was a low and silver tone,
424. And very sad, like sorrow's own;
425. She sang of love as it will be,
426. And has been in reality,--
427. Of fond hearts broken and betray'd,
428. Of roses opening but to fade,
429. Of wither'd hope, and wasted bloom,
430. Of the young warrior's early tomb;
431. And the while her dark mournful eye
432. Held with her words deep sympathy.

433. And EVA listen'd;--music's power
434. Is little felt in sunlit hour;
435. But hear its voice when hopes depart,
436. Like swallows, flying from the heart
437. On which the summer's late decline
438. Has set a sadness and a sign;
439. When friends whose commune once we sought
440. For every bosom wish and thought,
441. Have given in our hour of need
442. Such a support as gives the reed,--
443. When we have seen the green grass grow
444. Over what once was life below;
445. How deeply will the spirit feel
446. The lute, the song's sweet-voiced appeal;
447. And how the heart drink in their sighs
448. As echoes they from Paradise.

449. 'Tis done: the last bright gem is set
450. In EVA'S sparkling coronet;
451. A soil on her rich veil appears,--
452. Unsuiting here--and is it tears!

453. Her father met her, he was proud
454. To lead his daughter through the crowd,
455. And see the many eyes that gazed,
456. Then mark the blush their gazing raised;
457. And for his sake, she forced away
458. The clouds that on her forehead lay,
459. The sob rose in her throat, 'twas all,
460. The tears swam, but they dared not fall;
461. And the pale lip put on a smile,
462. Alas it was too sad for guile!

463. A beautiful and festal day
464. Shone summer bright o'er the array,
465. And purple banners work'd in gold,
466. And azure pennons spread their fold,
467. O'er the rich awnings which were round
468. The galleries that hemm'd in the ground,
469. The green and open space, where met
470. The Minstrels of the Violet;
471. And two or three old stately trees
472. Soften'd the sun, skreen'd from the breeze.
473. And there came many a lovely dame,
474. With cheek of rose, and eye of flame;
475. And many a radiant arm was raised,
476. Whose rubies in the sunshine blazed;
477. And many a white veil swept the air
478. Only than what they hid less fair;
479. And placed at his own beauty's feet
480. Found many a youthful knight his seat,
481. And flung his jewell'd cap aside,
482. And wore his scarf with gayer pride,
483. And whisper'd soft and gallant things,
484. And bade the bards' imaginings
485. Whenever love awoke the tone,
486. With their sweet passion plead his own.

487. Beneath an azure canopy,
488. Blue as the sweep of April's sky,
489. Upon a snowy couch reclined
490. Like a white cloud before the wind,
491. Leant EVA :--there was many a tent
492. More royal, more magnificent,
493. With purple, gold, and crimson swelling,
494. But none so like a fairy dwelling:
495. One curtain bore her father's crest,
496. But summer flowers confined the rest;
497. And, at her feet, the ground was strew'd
498. With the June's rainbow multitude:
499. Beside her knelt a page, who bore
500. A vase with jewels sparkling o'er,
501. And in that shining vase was set
502. The prize,--THE GOLDEN VIOLET.

503. Alas for her whom ev'ry eye
504. Worshipp'd like a divinity!
505. Alas for her whose ear was fill'd
506. With flatteries like sweet woods distill'd!

507. Alas for EVA ! bloom and beam,
508. Music and mirth, came like a dream,
509. In which she mingled not,--apart
510. From all in heaviness of heart.
511. There were soft tales pour'd in her ear,
512. She look'd on many a cavalier,
513. Wander'd her eye round the glad scene,
514. It was as if they had not been;--
515. To ear, eye, heart, there only came
516. Her RAYMOND'S image, RAYMOND'S name!

517. There is a flower, a snow-white flower,
518. Fragile as if a morning shower
519. Would end its being, and the earth
520. Forget to what it gave a birth;
521. And it looks innocent and pale,
522. Slight as the least force could avail
523. To pluck it from its bed, and yet
524. Its root in depth and strength is set.
525. The July sun, the autumn rain,
526. Beat on its slender stalk in vain;--
527. Around it spreads, despite of care,
528. Till the whole garden is its share;
529. And other plants must fade and fall
530. Beneath its deep and deadly thrall.
531. This is love's emblem; it is nurst
532. In all unconciousness at first,
533. Too slight, too fair, to wake distrust;
534. No sign how that an after hour
535. Will rue and weep its fatal power.
536. 'Twas thus with EVA ; she had dream'd
537. Of love as his first likeness seem'd,
538. A sweet thought o'er which she might brood,
539. The treasure of her solitude;
540. But tidings of young RAYMOND'S fate
541. Waken'd her from her dream too late,
542. Even her timid love could be
543. The ruling star of destiny.
544. And when a calmer mood prevail'd
545. O'er that whose joy her father hail'd,
546. Too well he saw how day by day
547. Some other emblem of decay
548. Came on her lip, and o'er her brow,
549. Which only she would disallow;
550. The cheek the lightest word could flush
551. Not with health's rose, but the heart's gush
552. Of feverish anxiousness; he caught
553. At the least hope, and vainly sought
554. By change, by pleasure, to dispell
555. Her sorrow from its secret cell.

556. In vain;--what can reanimate
557. A heart too early desolate?
558. It had been his, it could not save,
559. But it could follow to his grave.

560. The trumpets peal'd their latest round,
561. Stole from the flutes a softer sound,
562. Swell'd the harp to each master's hand,
563. As onward came the minstrel band!
564. And many a bright cheek grew more bright,
565. And many a dark eye flash'd with light,
566. As bent the minstrel o'er his lute,
567. And urged the lover's plaining suit,
568. Or swept a louder chord, and gave
569. Some glorious history of the brave.

570. At last from 'mid the crowd one came,
571. Unknown himself, unknown his name,
572. Both knight and bard,--the stranger wore
573. The garb of a young Troubadour;
574. His dark green mantle loosely flung,
575. Conceal'd the form o'er which it hung;
576. And his cap, with its shadowy plume,
577. Hid his face by its raven gloom.
578. Little did EVA'S careless eye
579. Dream that it wander'd RAYMOND by,
580. Though his first tone thrill'd every vein,
581. It only made her turn again,
582. Forget the scene, the song, and dwell
583. But on what memory felt too well.

584. THE SONG OF THE TROUBADOUR.

585. IN some valley low and lone,
586. Where I was the only one
587. Of the human dwellers there,
588. Would I dream away my care:
589. I'd forget how in the world
590. Snakes lay amid roses curl'd,
591. I'd forget my once distress
592. For young Love's insidiousness.
593. False foes, and yet falser friends,
594. Seeming but for their own ends;
595. Pleasures known but by their wings,
596. Yet remember'd by their stings;
597. Gold's decrease, and health's decay,
598. I will fly like these away,
599. To some lovely solitude,
600. Where the nightingale's young brood
601. Lives amid the shrine of leaves,
602. Which the wild rose round them weaves,
603. And my dwelling shall be made
604. Underneath the beech-tree's shade.
605. Twining ivy for the walls
606. Over which the jasmine falls,
607. Like a tapestry work'd with gold
608. And pearls around each emerald fold:
609. And my couches shall be set
610. With the purple violet,
611. And the white ones too, inside
612. Each a blush to suit a bride.
613. That flower which of all that live,
614. Lovers, should be those who give,
615. Primroses, for each appears
616. Pale and wet with many tears.
617. Alas tears and pallid check
618. All too often love bespeak!
619. There the gilderose should fling
620. Silver treasures to the spring,
621. And the bright laburnum's tresess
622. Seeking the young wind's caresses;
623. In the midst an azure lake,
624. Where no oar e'er dips to break
625. The clear bed of its blue rest,
626. Where the halcyon builds her nest;
627. And amid the sedges green,
628. And the water-flag's thick screen,
629. The solitary swan resides;
630. And the bright kingfisher hides,
631. With its colours rich like those
632. Which the bird of India shows.--
633. Once I thought that I would seek
634. Some fair creature, young and meek,
635. Whose most gentle smile would bless
636. My too utter loneliness;
637. But I then remember'd all
638. I had suffer'd from Love's thrall,
639. And I thought I 'd not again
640. Enter in the lion's den;
641. But, with my wrung heart now free,
642. So I thought I still will be.
643. Love is like a kingly dome,
644. Yet too often sorrow's home;
645. Sometimes smiles, but oftener tears,
646. Jealousies, and hopes, and fears,
647. A sweet liquor sparkling up,
648. But drank from a poison'd cup.
649. Would you guard your heart from care
650. Love must never enter there.
651. I will dwell with summer flowers,
652. Fit friends for the summer hours,
653. My companions honey-bees,
654. And birds, and buds, and leaves, and trees,
655. And the dew of the twilight,
656. And the thousand stars of night:
657. I will cherish that sweet gift,
658. The least earthly one now left
659. Of the gems of Paradise,
660. Poesy's delicious sighs.
661. Ill may that soft spirit bear
662. Crowds' or cities' healthless air;
663. Was not her sweet breathing meant
664. To echo the low murmur sent
665. By the flowers, and by the rill,
666. When all save the wind is still?
667. As if to tell of those fair things
668. High thoughts, pure imaginings,
669. That recall how bright, how fair,
670. In our other state we were.
671. And at last, when I have spent
672. A calm life in mild content,
673. May my spirit pass away
674. As the early leaves decay:
675. Spring shakes her gay coronal,
676. One sweet breath, and then they fall.
677. Only let the red-breast bring
678. Moss to strew me with, and sing,
679. One low mournful dirge to tell
680. I have bid the world farewell.

681. AND praise rang forth, the prize is won,
682. Young minstrel, thou hast equal none!
683. They led him to the lady's seat,
684. And knelt he down at EVA'S feet;
685. She bent his victor brow to deck,
686. And, fainting, sunk upon his neck!
687. The cap and plume aside were thrown,
688. 'Twas as the grave restored its own,
689. And sent its victim forth to share
690. Light, life, and hope, and sun, and air.

691. That day the feast spread gay and bright
692. In honour of the youthful knight,
693. And it was EVA'S fairy hand
694. Met RAYMOND'S in the saraband,
695. And it was EVA'S ear that heard
696. Many a low and love-tuned word.--
697. And life seem'd as a sunny stream,
698. And hope awaked as from a dream;
699. But what has minstrel left to tell
700. When love has not an obstacle?
701. My lute is hush'd, and mute its chords,
702. The heart and happiness have no words!

703. MY tale is told, the glad sunshine
704. Fell over its commencing line,--
705. It was a morn in June, the sun
706. Was blessing all it shone upon,
707. The sky was clear as not a cloud
708. Were ever on its face allow'd;
709. The hill whereon I stood was made
710. A pleasant place of summer shade
711. By the green elms which seem'd as meant
712. To make the noon a shadowy tent.
713. I had been bent half sleep, half wake,
714. Dreaming those rainbow dreams that take
715. The spirit prisoner in their chain,
716. Too beautiful to be quite vain,--
717. Enough if they can soothe or cheer
718. One moment's pain or sorrow here.
719. And I was happy; hope and fame
720. Together on my visions came,
721. For memory had just dipp'd her wings
722. In honey dews, and sunlit springs,--
723. My brow burnt with its early wreath,
724. My soul had drank its first sweet breath
725. Of praise, and yet my cheek was flushing,
726. My heart with the full torrent gushing
727. Of feelings whose delighted mood
728. Was mingling joy and gratitude.
729. Scarce possible it seem'd to be
730. That such praise could be meant for me.--
731. Enured to coldness and neglect,
732. My spirit chill'd, my breathing check'd,
733. All that can crowd and crush the mind,
734. Friends even more than fate unkind,
735. And fortunes stamp'd with the pale sign
736. That marks and makes autumn's decline.
737. How could I stand in the sunshine,
738. And marvel not that it was mine?
739. One word, if ever happiness
740. In its most passionate excess
741. Offer'd its wine to human lip,
742. It has been mine that cup to sip.
743. I may not say with what deep dread
744. The words of my first song were said,
745. I may not say how much delight
746. Has been upon my minstrel flight.--
747. 'Tis vain, and yet my heart would say
748. Somewhat to those who made my way
749. A path of light, with power to kill,
750. To check, to crush, but not the will.
751. Thanks for the gentleness that lent
752. My young lute such encouragement,
753. When scorn had turn'd my heart to stone,
754. Oh, their's be thanks and benison!

755. Back to the summer hill again,
756. When first I thought upon this strain,
757. And music rose upon the air,
758. I look'd below, and, gather'd there,
759. Rode soldiers with their breast-plates glancing,
760. Helmets and snow-white feathers dancing,
761. And trumpets at whose martial sound
762. Prouder the war horse trod the ground,
763. And waved their flag with many a name
764. Of battles and each battle fame.
765. And as I mark'd the gallant line
766. Pass through the green lane's serpentine,
767. And as I saw the boughs give way
768. Before the crimson pennons' play;
769. To other days my fancy went,
770. Call'd up the stirring tournament,
771. The dark-eyed maiden who for years
772. Kept the vows seal'd by parting tears,
773. While he who own'd her plighted hand
774. Was fighting in the Holy Land.
775. The youthful knight with his gay crest,
776. His ladye's scarf upon a breast
777. Whose truth was kept, come life, come death,--
778. Alas! has modern love such faith?
779. I thought how in the moon-lit hour
780. The minstrel hymn'd his maiden's bower,
781. His helm and sword changed for the lute
782. And one sweet song to urge his suit.
783. Floated around me moated hall,
784. And donjon keep, and frowning wall;
785. I saw the marshall'd hosts advance,
786. I gazed on banner, brand, and lance;
787. The murmur of a low song came
788. Bearing one only worshipp'd name;
789. And my next song, I said, should be
790. A tale of gone-by chivalry.

791. My task is done, the tale is told,
792. The lute drops from my wearied hold;
793. Spreads no green earth, no summer sky
794. To raise fresh visions for my eye,
795. The hour is dark, the winter rain
796. Beats cold and harsh against the pane,
797. Where, spendthrift like, the branches twine,
798. Worn, knotted, of a leafless vine;
799. And the wind howls in gusts around,
800. As omens were in each drear sound,--
801. Omens that bear upon their breath
802. Tidings of sorrow, pain, and death.
803. Thus should it be,--I could not bear
804. The breath of flowers, the sunny air
805. Upon that ending page should be
806. Which ONE will never, never see.
807. Yet who will love it like that one,
808. Who cherish as he would have done,
809. My father! albeit but in vain
810. This clasping of a broken chain,
811. And albeit of all vainest things
812. That haunt with sad imaginings,
813. None has the sting of memory;
814. Yet still my spirit turns to thee,
815. Despite of long and lone regret,
816. Rejoicing it cannot forget.
817. I would not lose the lightest thought
818. With one remembrance of thine fraught,--
819. And my heart said no name, but thine
820. Should be on this last page of mine.

821. My father, though no more, thine ear
822. Censure or praise of mine can hear,
823. It soothes me to embalm thy name
824. With all my hope, my pride, my fame,
825. Treasures of Fancy's fairy hall,--
826. Thy name most precious far of all.

827. My page is wet with bitter tears,--
828. I cannot but think of those years
829. When happiness and I would wait
830. On summer evenings by the gate,
831. And keep o'er the green fields our watch
832. The first sound of thy step to catch,
833. Then run for the first kiss, and word,--
834. An unkind one I never heard.
835. But these are pleasant memories,
836. And later years have none like these:
837. They came with griefs, and pains, and cares,
838. All that the heart breaks while it bears;
839. Desolate as I feel alone
840. I should not weep that thou art gone.
841. Alas! the tears that still will fall
842. Are selfish in their fond recall;--
843. If ever tears could win from Heaven
844. A loved one, and yet be forgiven,
845. Mine surely might; I may not tell
846. The agony of my farewell!
847. A single tear I had not shed,--
848. 'Twas the first time I mourn'd the dead:--
849. It was my heaviest loss, my worst,--
850. My father!--and was thine the first!

851. Farewell! in my heart is a spot
852. Where other griefs and cares come not,
853. Hallow'd by love, by memory kept,
854. And deeply honour'd, deeply wept.
855. My own dead father, time may bring
856. Chance, change, upon his rainbow-wing,
857. But never will thy name depart
858. The household god of thy child's heart,
859. Until thy orphan girl may share
860. The grave where her best feelings are.
861. Never, dear father, love can be,
862. Like the dear love I had for thee!
