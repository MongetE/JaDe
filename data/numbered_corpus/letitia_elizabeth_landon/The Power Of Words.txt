1. 'Tis a strange mystery, the power of words!
2. Life is in them, and death. A word can send
3. The crimson colour hurrying to the cheek.
4. Hurrying with many meanings; or can turn
5. The current cold and deadly to the heart.
6. Anger and fear are in them; grief and joy
7. Are on their sound; yet slight, impalpable:--
8. A word is but a breath of passing air.
