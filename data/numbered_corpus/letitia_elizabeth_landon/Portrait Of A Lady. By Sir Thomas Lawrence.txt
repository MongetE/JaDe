1. LADY , thy lofty brow is fair,
2. Beauty's sign and seal are there;
3. And thy lip is like the rose
4. Closing round the bee's repose;
5. And thine eye is like a star,
6. But blue as the sapphires' are.
7. Beautiful patrician! thou
8. Wearest on thy stately brow
9. All that suits a noble race,
10. All of high-born maiden's grace,--
11. Who is there could look on thee
12. And doubt thy nobility?

13. Round thee satin robe is flung,
14. Pearls upon thy neck are hung,
15. And upon thy arm of snow
16. Rubies like red sun-gifts glow;
17. Yet thou wearest pearl and gem
18. As thou hadst forgotten them.--
19. 'Tis a step, but made to tread
20. O'er Persian web, or flower's head,--
21. Soft hand that might only move
22. In the broider'd silken glove,--
23. Cheek unused to ruder air
24. Than what hot-house rose might bear,--
25. One whom nature only meant
26. To be queen of the tournament,--
27. Courtly fete, and lighted hall,--
28. Grace and ornament of all!
