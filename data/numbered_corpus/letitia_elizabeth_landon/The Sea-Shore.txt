1. I SHOULD like to dwell where the deep blue sea
2. Rock'd to and fro as tranquilly,
3. As if it were willing the halcyon's nest
4. Should shelter through summer its beautiful guest.
5. When a plaining murmur like that of a song,
6. And a silvery line come the waves along:
7. Now bathing—now leaving the gentle shore,
8. Where shining sea-shells lay scattered o'er.

9. And children wandering along the strand,
10. With the eager eye and the busy hand,
11. Heaping the pebbles and green sea-weed,
12. Like treasures laid up for a time of need.
13. Or tempting the waves with their daring feet,
14. To launch, perhaps, some tiny fleet:
15. Mimicking those which bear afar
16. The wealth of trade—and the strength of war.

17. I should love, when the sun-set reddened the foam,
18. To watch the fisherman's boat come home,
19. With his well-filled net and glittering spoil:
20. Well has the noon-tide repaid its toil.
21. While the ships that lie in the distance away
22. Catch on their canvass the crimsoning ray;
23. Like fairy ships in the tales of old,
24. When the sails they spread were purple and gold.

25. Then the deep delight of the starry night,
26. With its shadowy depths and dreamy light:
27. When far away spreads the boundless sea,
28. As if it imaged infinity.
29. Let me hear the winds go singing by,
30. Lulling the waves with their melody:
31. While the moon like a mother watches their sleep,
32. And I ask no home but beside the deep.
