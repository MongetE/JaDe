1. Few, save the poor, feel for the poor:
2. The rich know not how hard
3. It is to be of needful food
4. And needful rest debarred.

5. Their paths are paths of plenteousness,
6. They sleep on silk and down;
7. And never think how heavily
8. The weary head lies down.

9. They know not of the scanty meal,
10. With small pale faces round;
11. No fire upon the cold, damp hearth
12. When snow is on the ground.

13. They never by the window lean,
14. And see the gay pass by;
15. Then take their weary task again,
16. But with a sadder eye.
