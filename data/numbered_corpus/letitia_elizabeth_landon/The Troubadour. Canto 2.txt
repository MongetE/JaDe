1. THE first, the very first; oh! none
2. Can feel again as they have done;
3. In love, in war, in pride, in all
4. The planets of life's coronal,
5. However beautiful or bright,--
6. What can be like their first sweet light?

7. When will the youth feel as he felt,
8. When first at beauty's feet he knelt?

9. As if her least smile could confer
10. A kingdom on its worshipper;
11. Or ever care, or ever fear
12. Had cross'd love's morning hemisphere.
13. And the young bard, the first time praise
14. Sheds its spring sunlight o'er his lays,
15. Though loftier laurel, higher name,
16. May crown the minstrel's noontide fame,
17. They will not bring the deep content
18. Of his lure's first encouragement.
19. And where the glory that will yield
20. The flush and glow of his first field
21. To the young chief? Will RAYMOND ever
22. Feel as he now is feeling?--Never.

23. The sun wept down or ere they gain'd
24. The glen where the chief band remain'd.

25. It was a lone and secret shade,
26. As nature form'd an ambuscade
27. For the bird's nest and the deer's lair,
28. Though now less quiet guests were there.
29. On one side like a fortress stood
30. A mingled pine and chesnut wood;
31. Autumn was falling, but the pine
32. Seem'd as it mock'd all change; no sign
33. Of season on its leaf was seen,
34. The same dark gloom of changeless green.
35. But like the gorgeous Persian bands
36. 'Mid the stern race of northern lands,
37. The chesnut boughs were bright with all
38. That gilds and mocks the autumn's fall.

39. Like stragglers from an army's rear
40. Gradual they grew, near and less near,
41. Till ample space was left to raise,
42. Amid the trees, the watch-fire's blaze;
43. And there, wrapt in their cloaks around,
44. The soldiers scatter'd o'er the ground.

45. One was more crowded than the rest,
46. And to that one was RAYMOND prest;--
47. There sat the chief: kind greetings came
48. At the first sound of RAYMOND'S name.
49. 'Am I not proud that this should be,
50. Thy first field to be fought with me:
51. Years since thy father's sword and mine
52. Together dimm'd their maiden shine.
53. We were sworn brothers; when he fell
54. 'Twas mine to hear his last farewell:
55. And how revenged I need not say,
56. Though few were left to tell that day.--

57. Thy brow is his, and thou wilt wield
58. A sword like his in battle-field.
59. Let the day break, and thou shalt ride
60. Another RAYMOND by my side;
61. And thou shalt win and I confer,
62. To-morrow, knightly brand and spur.'

63. With thoughts of pride, and thoughts of grief,
64. Sat RAYMOND by that stranger chief,
65. So proud to hear his father's fame,
66. So sad to hear that father's name,
67. And then to think that he had known
68. That father by his name alone;
69. And aye his heart within him burn'd
70. When his eye to DE VALENCE turn'd,
71. Mark'd his high step, his warlike mien,--
72. 'And such my father would have been!'

73. A few words of years past away,
74. A few words of the coming day,
75. They parted, not that night for sleep;
76. RAYMOND had thoughts that well might keep
77. Rest from his pillow,--memory, hope,
78. In youth's horizon had full scope
79. To blend and part each varied line
80. Of cloud and clear, of shade and shine.
81. --He rose and wander'd round, the light
82. Of the full moon fell o'er each height;
83. Leaving the wood behind in shade,
84. O'er rock, and glen, and rill it play'd.

85. He follow'd a small stream whose tide
86. Was bank'd by lilies on each side,
87. And there, as if secure of rest,
88. A swan had built her lonely nest;
89. And spread out was each lifted wing,
90. Like snow or silver glittering.
91. Wild flowers grew around the dale,
92. Sweet children of the sun and gale;
93. From every crag the wild vine fell,
94. To all else inaccessible;
95. And where a dark rock rose behind,
96. Their shelter from the northern wind,
97. Grew myrtles with their fragrant leaves,
98. Veil'd with the web the gossamer weaves,
99. So pearly fair, so light, so frail,
100. Like beauty's self more than her veil.--

101. And first to gaze upon the scene,
102. Quiet as there had never been
103. Heavier step than village maid
104. With flowers for her nuptial braid,
105. Or louder sound than hermit's prayer,
106. To crush its grass or load its air.
107. Then to look on the armed train,
108. The watch-fire on the wooded plain,
109. And think how with the morrow's dawn,
110. Would banner wave, and blade be drawn;
111. How clash of steel, and trumpet's swell,
112. Would wake the echoes of each dell.
113. --And thus it ever is with life,
114. Peace sleeps upon the breast of Strife,
115. But to be waken'd from its rest,
116. Till comes that sleep the last and best.

117. And RAYMOND paused at last, and laid
118. Himself beneath a chesnut's shade,
119. A little way apart from all,
120. That he might catch the waterfall,
121. Whose current swept like music round,--
122. When suddenly another sound
123. Came on the ear; it was a tone,
124. Rather a murmur than a song,
125. As he who breathed deem'd all unknown
126. The words, thoughts, echo bore along.
127. Parting the boughs which hung between,
128. Close, thick, as if a tapestried screen,
129. RAYMOND caught sight of a white plume
130. Waving o'er brow and cheek of bloom;
131. And yet the song was sad and low,
132. As if the chords it waked were woe.

133. SONG OF THE YOUNG KNIGHT.

134. YOUR scarf is bound upon my breast,
135. Your colours dance upon my crest,--
136. They have been soil'd by dust and rain,
137. And they must wear a darker stain.

138. I mark'd thy tears as fast they fell,
139. I saw but heard not thy farewell,
140. I gave my steed the spur and rein,--
141. I dared not look on thee again.

142. My cheek is pale, but not with fears,
143. And I have dash'd aside my tears;
144. This woman's softness of my breast
145. Will vanish when my spear's in rest.

146. I know that farewell was our last,
147. That life and love from me are past;
148. For I have heard the fated sign
149. That speaks the downfall of our line.

150. I slept the soldier's tired sleep;
151. But yet I heard the music sweep,
152. Dim, faint, as when I stood beside
153. The bed whereon my father died.

154. Farewell, sweet love! never again
155. Will thine ear listen to the strain
156. With which so oft at midnight's hour
157. I've waked the silence of thy bower.

158. Farewell! I would not tears should stain
159. Thy fair cheek with their burning rain:
160. Tears, sweet! would an ill offering be
161. To one whose death was worthy thee.

162. RAYMOND thought on that song next day
163. When bleeding that young warrior lay,
164. While his hand, in its death-pang, prest
165. A bright curl to his wounded breast.

166. AND waning stars, and brightening sky,
167. And on the clouds a crimson dye,
168. And fresher breeze, and opening flowers,
169. Tell the approach of morning hours.

170. Oh, how can breath, and light, and bloom,
171. Herald a day of death and doom!
172. With knightly pennons, which were spread
173. Like mirror's for the morning's red,
174. Gather the ranks, while shout and horn
175. Are o'er the distant mountains borne.

176. 'Twas a fair sight, that arm'd array
177. Winding through the deep vale their way,
178. Helmet and breast-plate gleaming in gold,
179. Banners waving their crimson fold,
180. Like clouds of the day-break: hark to the peal
181. Of the war-cry, answer'd by clanging steel!
182. The young chief strokes his courser's neck,
183. The ire himself had provoked to check,
184. Impatient for that battle plain
185. He may reach but never leave again;
186. And with flashing eye and sudden start,
187. He hears the trumpet's stately tone,
188. Like the echo of his beating heart,
189. And meant to rouse his ear alone.
190. And by his side the warrior grey,
191. With hair as white as the plumes that play
192. Over his head, yet spurs he as proud,
193. As keen as the youngest knight of the crowd:
194. And glad and glorious on they ride
195. In strength and beauty, power and pride.
196. And such the morning, but let day
197. Close on that gallant fair array,
198. The moon will see another sight
199. Than that which met the dawning light.--

200. Look on that field,--'tis the battle field!
201. Look on what harvest victory will yield!
202. There the steed and his rider o'erthrown,
203. Crouch together, their warfare is done:
204. The bolt is undrawn, the bow is unbent,
205. And the archer lies like his arrow spent.
206. Deep is the banner of crimson dyed,
207. But not with the red of its morning pride;
208. Torn and trampled with soil and stain,
209. When will it float on the breeze again;--
210. And over the ghastly plain are spread,
211. Pillow'd together, the dying and dead.

212. There lay one with an unclosed eye
213. Set in bright, cold vacancy,
214. While on its fix'd gaze the moonbeam shone,
215. Light mocking the eye whose light was gone;
216. And by his side another lay,
217. The life-blood ebbing fast away,
218. But calm his cheek and calm his eye,
219. As if leant on his mother's bosom to die.
220. Too weak to move, he feebly eyed
221. A wolf and a vulture close to his side,
222. Watching and waiting, himself the prey,
223. While each one kept the other away.

224. Little of this the young warrior deems
225. When, with heart and head all hopes and dreams,
226. He hastes for the battle:--The trumpet's call
227. Waken'd RAYMOND the first of all;
228. His the first step that to stirrup sprung,
229. His the first banner upwards flung;
230. And brow and cheek with his spirit glow'd,
231. When first at DE VALENCE'S side he rode.

232. The quiet glen is left behind,
233. The dark wood lost in the blue sky;
234. When other sounds come on the wind,
235. And other pennons float on high.
236. With snow-white plumes and glancing crest,
237. And standard raised, and spear in rest,
238. On a small river's farther banks
239. Wait their approach Sir HERBERT'S ranks.--
240. One silent gaze, as if each band
241. Could slaughter both with eye and hand.
242. Then peals the war-cry! then the dash
243. Amid the waters! and the crash
244. Of spears,--the falchion's iron ring,--
245. The arrow hissing from the string,
246. Tell they have met. Thus from the height
247. The torrent rushes in its might.

248. With the lightning's speed, the thunder's peal,
249. Flashes the lance, and strikes the steel.
250. Many a steed to the earth is borne,
251. Many a banner trampled and torn;
252. Or ever its brand could strike a blow,
253. Many a gallant arm lies low;--
254. Many a scarf, many a crest,
255. Float with the leaves on the river's breast;
256. And strange it is to see how around
257. Buds and flowers strew the ground,
258. For the banks were cover'd with wild rose trees,
259. Oh! what should they do amid scenes like these.

260. In the blue stream, as it hovered o'er,
261. A hawk was mirror'd, and before
262. Its wings could reach yon pine, which stands
263. A bow-shot off from the struggling bands,
264. The stain of death was on the flood,
265. And the red waters roll'd dark with blood.--
266. RAYMOND'S spear was the first that flew,
267. He the first who dash'd the deep river through;
268. His step the first on the hostile strand,
269. And the first that fell was borne down by his hand.

270. The fight is ended:--the same sun
271. Has seen the battle lost and won;
272. The field is cover'd with dying and dead,
273. With the valiant who stood, and the coward who fled.
274. And a gallant salute the trumpets sound,
275. As the warriors gather from victory around.

276. On a hill that skirted the purple flood,
277. With his peers around, DE VALENCE stood,
278. And with bended knee, and forehead bare,
279. Save its cloud of raven hair,
280. And beautiful as some wild star
281. Come in its glory and light from afar,
282. With his dark eyes flashing stern and bright,
283. And his cheek o'erflooded with crimson light,
284. And the foeman's banner over his head,
285. His first field's trophy proudly spread,
286. Knelt RAYMOND down his boon to name,--
287. The knightly spurs he so well might claim:
288. And a softness stole to DE VALENCE'S eyes,
289. As he bade the new-made knight arise.--
290. From his own belt he took the brand,
291. And gave it into RAYMOND'S hand,
292. And said it might a memory yield
293. Of his father's friend, and his own first field.

294. Pleasant through the darkening night
295. Shines from Clarin's towers the light.
296. Home from the battle the warriors ride,
297. In the soldiers' triumph, and soldiers' pride:
298. The drawbridge is lower'd, and in they pour,
299. Like the sudden rush of a summer shower,
300. While the red torch-light bursts through the gloom,
301. Over banner and breast-plate, helm and plume.

302. Sudden a flood of lustre play'd
303. Over a lofty ballustrade,
304. Music and perfume swept the air,
305. Messengers sweet for the spring to prepare;
306. And like a sunny vision sent
307. For worship and astonishment,
308. Aside a radiant ladye flung
309. The veil that o'er her beauty hung.

310. With stately grace to those below,
311. She bent her gem encircled brow,
312. And bade them welcome in the name
313. Of her they saved, the castle's dame,
314. Who had not let another pay
315. Thanks, greeting to their brave array,--
316. But she had vow'd the battle night
317. To fasting, prayer, and holy rite.

318. On the air the last tones of the music die,
319. The odour passes away like a sigh,
320. The torches flash a parting gleam,
321. And she vanishes as she came, like a dream.
322. But many an eye dwelt on the shade,
323. Till fancy again her form display'd,
324. And still again seem'd many an ear
325. The softness of her voice to hear.

326. And many a heart had a vision that night,
327. Which future years never banish'd quite.

328. And sign and sound of festival
329. Are ringing through that castle hall;
330. Tapers, whose flame send a perfumed cloud,
331. Flash their light o'er a gorgeous crowd;
332. With a thousand colours the tapestry falls
333. Over the carved and gilded walls,
334. And, between, the polish'd oak pannels hear,
335. Like dark mirrors, the image of each one there.
336. At one end the piled up hearth is spread
337. With sparkling embers of glowing red:
338. Above the branching antlers have place,
339. Sign of many a hard won chase;
340. And beneath, in many a polish'd line,
341. The arms of the hunter and warrior shine;
342. And around the fire, like a laurell'd arch,
343. Raised for some victor's triumphal march,
344. The wood is fretted with tracery fair,
345. And green boughs and flowers are waving there.
346. Lamps, like faery planets shine,
347. O'er massive cups of the genial wine,
348. And shed a ray more soft and fair
349. Than the broad red gleam of the torch's glare;
350. And, flitting like a rainbow, plays
351. In beautiful and changing rays,
352. When from the pictured windows fall
353. The colour'd shadows o'er the hall;
354. As every pane some bright hue lent
355. To vary the lighted element.

356. The ladye of the festive board
357. Was ward to the castle's absent lord;
358. The Ladye ADELINE ,--the same
359. Bright vision that with their greeting came
360. Maidens four stood behind her chair,
361. Each one was young, and each one fair;
362. Yet they were but as the stars at night
363. When the mood shines forth in her fullness of light
364. On the knot of her wreathed hair was set
365. A blood-red ruby coronet;
366. But among the midnight cloud of curls
367. That hung o'er her brow were eastern pearls,
368. As if to tell their wealth of snow,
369. How white her forehead could look below.
370. Around her floated a veil of white,
371. Like the silvery rack round the star of twilight;
372. And down to the ground her mantle's fold
373. Spread its length of purple and gold;
374. And sparkling gems were around her arm,
375. That shone like marble, only warm,
376. With the blue veins wandering tide,
377. And the hand with its crimson blush inside.
378. A zone of precious stones embraced
379. The graceful circle of her waist,
380. Sparkling as if they were proud
381. Of the clasp to them allow'd.
382. But yet there was 'mid this excess
383. Of soft and dazzling loveliness,
384. A something in the eye, and hand,
385. And forehead, speaking of command:
386. An eye whose dark flash seem'd allied
387. To even more than beauty's pride,--
388. A hand as only used to wave
389. Its sign to worshipper and slave,--
390. A forehead, but that was too fair
391. To read of aught but beauty there!

392. And RAYMOND had the place of pride,
393. The place so envied by her side,--
394. The victor's seat,--and overhead
395. The banner he had won was spread.
396. His health was pledged!--he only heard
397. The murmur of one silver word;
398. The pageant seem'd to fade away,
399. Vanish'd the board and glad array,
400. The gorgeous hall around grew dim,
401. There shone one only light for him,
402. That radiant form, whose brightness fell
403. In power upon him like a spell,
404. Laid in its strength by Love to reign
405. Despotic over heart and brain.
406. Silent he stood amid the mirth,
407. Oh, love is timid in its birth!
408. Watching her lightest look or stir,
409. As he but look'd and breathed with her.
410. Gay words were passing, but he leant
411. In silence; yet, one quick glance sent,--
412. His secret is no more his own,
413. When has woman her power not known?

414. The feast broke up:--that midnight shade
415. Heard many a gentle serenade
416. Beneath the ladye's lattice. One
417. Breathed after all the rest were gone.

418. SERENADE.

419. SLEEP , ladye! for the moonlit hour,
420. Like peace, is shining on thy bower;
421. It is so late, the nightingale
422. Has ended even his love tale.

423. Sleep, ladye! 'neath thy turret grows,
424. Cover'd with flowers, one pale white rose;
425. I envy its sweet sighs, they steep
426. The perfumed airs that lull thy sleep.

427. Perchance, around thy chamber floats
428. The music of my lone lute notes,--
429. Oh, may they on thine eyelids fall,
430. And make thy slumbers musical!

431. Sleep, ladye! to thy rest be given
432. The gleamings of thy native heaven,
433. And thoughts of early paradise,
434. The treasures of thy sleeping eyes.

435. I NEED not say whose was the song
436. The sighing night winds bore along.
437. RAYMOND had left the maiden's side
438. As one too dizzy with the tide
439. To breast the stream, or strive, or shrink,
440. Enough for him to feel, not think;
441. Enough for him the dim sweet fear,
442. The twilight of the heart, or ere
443. Awakening hope has named the name
444. Of love, or blown its spark to flame.

445. Restlessness, but as the winds range
446. From leaf to leaf, from flower to flower;
447. Changefulness, but as rainbows change,
448. From colour'd sky to sunlit hour.
449. Ay, well indeed may minstrel sing,--
450. What have the heart and year like spring?

451. Her vow was done: the castle dame
452. Next day to join the revellers came;
453. And never had a dame more gay
454. O'er hall or festival held sway.
455. And youthful knight, and ladye fair,
456. And juggler quaint, and minstrel rare,
457. And mirth, and crowds, and music, all
458. Of pleasure gather'd at her call.

459. And RAYMOND moved as in a dream
460. Of song and odour, bloom and beam,
461. As he dwelt in a magic bower,
462. Charm'd from all by fairy power.
463. --And ADELINE rode out that morn,
464. With hunting train, and hawk, and horn;
465. And broider'd rein, and curb of gold,
466. And housings with their purple fold
467. Decked the white steed o'er which she leant
468. Graceful as a young cypress, bent
469. By the first summer wind: she wore
470. A cap the heron plume waved o'er,
471. And round her wrist a golden band,
472. Which held the falcon on her hand.
473. The bird's full eye, so clear, so bright,
474. Match'd not her own's dark flashing light.

475. And RAYMOND , as he watch'd the dyes
476. Of her cheek rich with exercise,
477. Could almost deem her beauty's power
478. Was now in its most potent hour;
479. But when at night he saw her glance
480. The gayest of the meteor dance,
481. The jewels in her braided hair,
482. Her neck, her arms of ivory bare,
483. The silver veil, the broider'd vest,--
484. Look'd she not then her loveliest?
485. Ah, every change of beauty's face
486. And beauty's shape has its own grace!
487. That night his heart throbb'd when her hand
488. Met his touch in the saraband:
489. That night her smile first bade love live
490. On the sweet life that hope can give.--

491. Beautiful, but thrice wayward, wild,
492. Capricious as a petted child,
493. She was all chance, all change; but now
494. A smile is on her radiant brow,--
495. A moment and that smile is fled,
496. Coldness and scorn are there instead.

497. Ended the dance, and ADELINE
498. Flung herself, like an eastern queen,
499. Upon the cushions which were laid
500. Amid a niche of that gay hall,
501. Hid from the lamps; around it play'd
502. The softness of the moonlight fall.
503. And there the gorgeous shapes past by
504. But like a distant pageantry,
505. In which you have yourself no share,
506. For all its pride, and pomp, and care.

507. She pass'd her hand across the chords
508. Of a lute near, and with soft words
509. Answer'd; then said, 'no, thou shalt sing
510. Some legend of the fair and brave.'
511. To RAYMOND'S hand the lute she gave,
512. Whose very soul within him burn'd
513. When her dark eye on his was turn'd:
514. One moment's pause, it slept not long,--
515. His spirit pour'd itself in song.

516. ELENORE.

517. THE lady sits in her lone bower,
518. With cheek wan as the white rose flower
519. That blooms beside, 'tis pale and wet
520. As that rose with its dew pearls set.

521. Her cheek burns with a redder dye,
522. Flashes light from her tearful eye;
523. She has heard pinions beat the air,
524. She sees her white dove floating there;
525. And well she knows its faithful wing,
526. The treasure of her heart will bring;
527. And takes the gentle bird its stand
528. Accustom'd on the maiden's hand,
529. With glancing eye and throbbing breast,
530. As if rejoicing in its rest.
531. She read the scroll,--'dear love, to-night
532. By the lake, all is there for flight
533. What time the moon is down;--oh, then
534. My own life shall we meet again!'
535. One upward look of thankfulness,
536. One pause of joy, one fond caress
537. Of her soft lips, as to reward
538. The messenger of EGINHARD.

539. That night in her proud father's hall
540. She shone the fairest one of all;
541. For like the cloud of evening came
542. Over her cheek the sudden flame,
543. And varying as each moment brought
544. Some hasty change of secret thought;
545. As if its colour would confess
546. The conscious heart's inmost recess.
547. And the clear depths of her dark eye
548. Were bright with troubled brilliancy,
549. Yet the lids droop'd as with the tear
550. Which might oppress but not appear.
551. And flatteries, and smile and sigh
552. Loaded the air as she past by.

553. It sparkled, but her jewell'd vest
554. Was crost above a troubled breast:
555. Her curls, with all their sunny glow,
556. Were braided o'er an aching brow:
557. But well she knew how many sought
558. To gaze upon her secret thought;--
559. And Love is proud,--she might not brook
560. That other's on her heart should look.
561. But there she sate, cold, pale, and high,
562. Beneath her purple canopy;
563. And there was many a mutter'd word,
564. And one low whisper'd name was heard,--
565. The name of EGINHARD ,--that name
566. Like some forbidden secret came.

567. The theme went, that he dared to love
568. One like a star his state above;
569. Here to the princess turn'd each eye,--
570. And it was said, he did not sigh
571. With love that pales the pining cheek,
572. And leaves the slighted heart to break.
573. And then a varying tale was told,
574. How a page had betray'd for gold;
575. But all was rumour light and vain,
576. That all might hear, but none explain.

577. Like one that seeks a festival,
578. Early the princess left the hall;
579. Yet said she, sleep dwelt on her eyes,
580. That she was worn with revelries.
581. And hastily her maidens' care
582. Unbinds the jewels from her hair.
583. Odours are round her chamber strown,
584. And ELENORE is left alone.

585. With throbbing heart, whose pulses beat
586. Louder than fall her ivory feet,
587. She rises from her couch of down;
588. And, hurriedly, a robe is thrown
589. Around her form, and her own hand
590. Lets down her tresses golden band.
591. Another moment she has shred
592. Those graceful tresses from her head.
593. There stands a plate of polish'd steel,
594. She folds her cloak as to conceal
595. Her strange attire, for she is drest
596. As a young page in dark green vest.
597. Softly she steps the balustrade,
598. Where myrtle, rose, and hyacinth made
599. A passage to the garden shade.

600. It was a lovely summer night,
601. The air was incense-fill'd, the light
602. Was dim and tremulous, a gleam,
603. When a star, mirror'd on the stream,
604. Sent a ray round just to reveal
605. How gales from flower to flower steal.
606. 'It was on such a night as this,
607. When even a single breath is bliss,
608. Such a soft air, such a mild heaven,
609. My vows to EGINHARD were given.'
610. Sigh'd ELENORE , 'Oh, might it be
611. A hope, a happy augury!'

612. She reach'd the lake,--a blush, a smile,
613. Contended on her face the while;
614. And safely in a little cove,
615. Shelter'd by willow trees above,
616. An ambuscade from all secured,
617. Her lover's little boat lay moor'd.--
618. One greeting word, with muffled oar,
619. And silent lip, they left that shore.

620. It was most like a phantom dream
621. To see that boat flit o'er the stream,
622. So still, that but yet less and less
623. It grew, it had seem'd motionless.
624. And then the silent lake, the trees
625. Visible only when the breeze
626. Aside the shadowy branches threw,
627. And let one single star shine through,
628. While the faint glimmer scarcely gave
629. To view the wanderers of the wave.

630. The breeze has borne the clouds away
631. That veil'd the blushes of young day;
632. The lark has sung his morning song;--
633. Surely the princess slumbers long.
634. And now it is the accustom'd hour
635. Her royal father seeks her bower,
636. When her soft voice and gentle lute,
637. The snowfall of her fairy foot,
638. The flowers she has cull'd, with dew
639. Yet moist upon each rainbow hue;
640. The fruits with bloom upon their cheek,
641. Fresh as the morning's first sun streak;
642. Each, all conspired to wile away
643. The weariness of royal sway.

644. But she is gone: there hangs her lute,
645. And there it may hang lone and mute:
646. The flowers may fade, for who is there
647. To triumph now if they are fair:
648. There are her gems,--oh, let them twine
649. An offering round some sainted shrine!
650. For she who wore them may not wear
651. Again those jewels in her hair.

652. At first the monarch's rage was wild;
653. But soon the image of his child,
654. In tenderness rose on his heart,
655. How could he bear from it to part?
656. And anger turn'd to grief: in vain
657. Ambition had destroy'd the chain
658. With which love had bound happiness.
659. In vain remorse, in vain redress,--
660. Fruitless all search. And years past o'er,
661. No tidings came of ELENORE,
662. Although the king would have laid down
663. His golden sceptre, purple crown,
664. His pomp, his power, but to have prest
665. His child one moment to his breast.

666. And where was ELENORE ? her home
667. Was now beneath the forest dome;--
668. A hundred knights had watch'd her hall,
669. Her guards were now the pine trees tall:
670. For harps waked with the minstrel tale,
671. Sang to her sleep the nightingale:
672. For silver vases, where were blent
673. Rich perfumes from Arabia sent,
674. Were odours when the wild thyme flower
675. Wafted its sweets on gale and shower:
676. For carpets of the purple loom
677. The violets spread their cloud of bloom,
678. Starr'd with primroses; and around
679. Boughs like green tapestry swept the ground.
680. --And there they dwelt apart from all
681. That gilds and mocks ambition's thrall;
682. Apart from cities, crowds, and care,
683. Hopes that deceive, and toils that wear;
684. For they had made themselves a world
685. Like that or ever man was hurl'd
686. From his sweet Eden, to begin
687. His bitter course of grief and sin.--
688. And they were happy; EGINHARD
689. Had won the prize for which he dared
690. Dungeon and death; but what is there
691. That the young lover will not dare?
692. And she, though nurtured as a flower,
693. The favourite bud of a spring bower,

694. Daughter of palaces, yet made
695. Her dwelling place in the green shade;
696. Happy, as she remember'd not
697. Her royal in her peasant lot,--
698. With gentle cares, and smiling eyes
699. As love could feel no sacrifice.
700. Happy her ivory brow to lave
701. Without a mirror but the wave,
702. As one whose sweetness could dispense
703. With all save its own excellence;--
704. A fair but gentle creature, meant
705. For heart, and hearth, and home content.

706. It was at night the chase was over,
707. And ELENORE sat by her lover,--
708. Her lover still, though years had fled
709. Since their first word of love was said,--

710. When one sought, at that darksome hour,
711. The refuge of their lonely bower,
712. A hunter, who, amid the shade,
713. Had from his own companions stray'd.
714. And ELENORE gazed on his face,
715. And knew her father! In the chase
716. Often the royal mourner sought
717. A refuge from his one sad thought.
718. He knew her not,--the lowly mien,
719. The simple garb of forest green,
720. The darken'd brow, which told the spoil
721. The sun stole from her daily toil,
722. The cheek where woodland health had shed
723. The freshness of its morning red,--
724. All was so changed. She spread the board,
725. Her hand the sparkling wine cup pour'd;

726. And then around the hearth they drew,
727. And cheerfully the woodfire threw
728. Its light around.--Bent o'er her wheel
729. Scarcely dared ELENORE to steal
730. A look, half tenderness, half fear,
731. Yet seem'd he as he loved to hear
732. Her voice, as if it had a tone
733. Breathing of days and feelings gone.

734. 'Ah! surely,' thought she, 'Heaven has sent
735. My father here, as that it meant,
736. Our years of absence ended now!'
737. She gazed upon his soften'd brow;
738. And the next moment, all revealing,
739. ELENORE at his feet is kneeling!--
740. Need I relate that, reconciled,
741. The father bless'd his truant child.

742. WHERE is the heart that has not bow'd
743. A slave, eternal Love, to thee:
744. Look on the cold, the gay, the proud,
745. And is there one among them free?
746. The cold, the proud,--oh! Love has turn'd
747. The marble till with fire it burn'd;
748. The gay, the young,--alas that they
749. Should ever bend beneath thy sway!
750. Look on the cheek the rose might own,
751. The smile around like sunshine thrown;
752. The rose, the smile, alike are thine,
753. To fade and darken at thy shrine.

754. And what must love be in a heart
755. All passion's fiery depths concealing,
756. Which has in its minutest part
757. More than another's whole of feeling.

758. And RAYMOND'S heart; love's morning sun
759. On fitter altar never shone;
760. Loving with all the snow-white truth,
761. That is found but in early youth;
762. Freshness of feeling as of flower,
763. That lives not more than spring's first hour;
764. And loving with that wild devotion,
765. That deep and passionate emotion,
766. With which the minstrel soul is thrown
767. On all that it would make its own.

768. And RAYMOND loved; the veriest slave
769. That e'er his life to passion gave:
770. Upon his ear no murmur came
771. That seem'd not echoing her name;
772. The lightest colour on her cheek
773. Was lovelier than the morning break.
774. He gazed upon her as he took
775. His sense of being from her look:--
776. Sometimes it was idolatry,
777. Like homage to some lovely star,
778. Whose beauty though for hope too high,
779. He yet might worship from afar.
780. At other times his heart would swell
781. With tenderness unutterable:
782. He would have borne her to an isle
783. Where May and June had left their smile;
784. And there, heard but by the lone gale,
785. He would have whisper'd his love tale;
786. And without change, or cloud, or care,
787. Have kept his bosom's treasure there.
788. And then, with all a lover's pride,
789. He thought it shame such gem to hide:
790. And imaged he a courtly scene
791. Of which she was the jewell'd queen,--
792. The one on whom each glance was bent,
793. The beauty of the tournament,
794. The magnet of the festival,
795. The grace, the joy, the life of all,--
796. But she, alas for her false smile!
797. ADELINE loved him not the while.

798. And is it thus that woman's heart
799. Can trifle with its dearest part,
800. Its own pure sympathies?--can fling
801. The poison'd arrow from the string
802. In utter heartlessness around,
803. And mock, or think not of the wound?
804. And thus can woman barter all
805. That makes and gilds her gentle thrall,--
806. The blush which should be like the one
807. White violets hide from the sun,--
808. The soft, low sighs, like those which breathe
809. In secret from a twilight wreath,--
810. The smile like a bright lamp, whose shine
811. Is vow'd but only to one shrine;
812. All these sweet spells,--and can they be
813. Weapons of reckless vanity?
814. And woman, in whose gentle heart
815. From all save its sweet self apart,
816. Love should dwell with that purity
817. Which but in woman's love can be:
818. A sacred fire, whose flame was given
819. To shed on earth the light of heaven,--
820. That she can fling her wealth aside
821. In carelessness, or sport, or pride!

822. It was not form'd for length of bliss,
823. A dream so fond, so false as this;
824. Enough for ADELINE to win
825. The heart she had no pleasure in,--
826. Enough that bright eyes turn'd in vain
827. On him who bow'd beneath her chain:--
828. Then came the careless word and look,
829. All the fond soul so ill can brook,
830. The jealous doubt, the burning pain,
831. That rack the lover's heart and brain;
832. The fear that will not own it fear,
833. The hope that cannot disappear;
834. Faith clinging to its visions past,
835. And trust confiding to the last.
836. And thus it is: ay, let Love throw
837. Aside his arrows and his bow;
838. But let him not with one spell part,
839. The veil that binds his eyes and heart.
840. Woe for Love when his eyes shall be
841. Open'd upon reality!

842. One day a neighbouring baron gave
843. A revel to the fair and brave,--
844. And knights upon their gallant steeds,
845. And ladies on their palfreys gray,
846. All shining in their gayest weeds,
847. Held for the festival their way.

848. A wanderer on far distant shores,
849. That baron, had brought richest stores
850. To his own hall, and much of rare
851. And foreign luxury was there:
852. Pages, with colour'd feathers, fann'd
853. The odours of Arabia's land;
854. The carpets strewn around each room
855. Were all of Persia's purple loom;
856. And dark slaves waited on his guests,
857. Each habited in Moorish vests,
858. With turbann'd brows, and bands of gold
859. Around their arms and ancles roll'd.
860. And gazed the guests o'er many a hoard,
861. Like Sinbad's, from his travel stored.
862. They look'd upon the net work dome,
863. Where found the stranger birds a home,
864. With rainbow wings and gleaming eyes,
865. Seen only beneath Indian skies.
866. At length they stood around the ring,
867. Where stalk'd, unchain'd, the forest king,
868. With eyes of fire and mane erect,
869. As if by human power uncheck'd.

870. Full ill had RAYMOND'S spirit borne
871. The wayward mood, the careless scorn,
872. With which his mistress had that day
873. Trifled his happiness away.--
874. His very soul within him burn'd,
875. When, as in chance, her dark eye turn'd
876. On him, she spoke in reckless glee,--
877. ''Is there a knight who, for love of me,
878. Into the court below will spring,
879. And bear from the lion the glove I fling?'

880. A shriek!--a pause,--then loud acclaim
881. Rose to the skies with RAYMOND'S name.
882. Oh, worthy of a lady's love!
883. RAYMOND has borne away the glove.
884. He laid the prize at the maiden's feet,
885. Then turn'd from the smile he dared not meet:
886. A moment more he is on the steed,
887. The spur has urged to its utmost speed,
888. As that he could fly from himself, and all
889. The misery of his spirit's thrall.

890. The horse sank down, and RAYMOND then
891. Started to see the foaming rein,
892. The drops that hung on the courser's hide,
893. And the rowel's red trace on its panting side;
894. And deep shame mingled with remorse,
895. As he brought the cool stream to his fallen horse.

896. The spot where he paused was a little nook,
897. Like a secret page in nature's book,--
898. Around were steeps where the wild vine
899. Hung, wreathed in many a serpentine,
900. Wearing each the colour'd sign
901. Of the autumn's pale decline.
902. Like a lake in the midst was spread
903. A grassy sweep of softest green,
904. Smooth, flower-dropt, as no human tread
905. Upon its growth had ever been.
906. Limes rose around, but lost each leaf,
907. Like hopes luxuriant but brief;
908. And by their side the sycamore
909. Grew prouder of its scarlet store:
910. The air was of that cold clear light
911. That heralds in an autumn night,--
912. The amber west had just a surge
913. Of crimson on its utmost verge;
914. And on the east were piled up banks
915. Where darkness gather'd with her ranks
916. Of clouds, and in the midst a zone
917. Of white with transient brightness shone
918. From the young moon, who scarcely yet
919. Had donn'd her lighted coronet.

920. With look turn'd to the closing day,
921. As he watch'd every hue decay,
922. Sat RAYMOND ; and a passer by
923. Had envied him his reverie;--
924. But nearer look had scann'd his brow,
925. And started at its fiery glow,
926. As if the temples' burning swell
927. Had made their pulses visible.

928. Too glazed, too fix'd, his large eyes shone
929. To see aught that they gazed upon.
930. Not his the paleness that may streak
931. The lover's or the minstrel's cheek,
932. As it had its wan colour caught
933. From moods of melancholy thought;
934. 'Twas that cold, dark, unearthly shade,
935. But for a corpse's death look made;
936. Speaking that desperateness of pain,
937. As one more pang, and the rack'd brain
938. Would turn to madness; one more grief,
939. And the swoln heart breaks for relief.

940. Oh, misery! to see the tomb
941. Close over all our world of bloom;
942. To look our last in the dear eyes
943. Which made our light of paradise;
944. To know that silent is the tone
945. Whose tenderness was all our own;
946. To kiss the cheek which once had burn'd
947. At the least glance, and find it turn'd
948. To marble; and then think of all
949. Of hope, that memory can recall.
950. Yes, misery! but even here
951. There is a somewhat left to cheer,
952. A gentle treasuring of sweet things
953. Remembrance gathers from the past,
954. The pride of faithfulness, which clings
955. To love kept sacred to the last.
956. And even if another's love
957. Has touch'd the heart to us above
958. The treasures of the east, yet still
959. There is a solace for the ill.

960. Those who have known love's utmost spell
961. Can feel for those who love as well;
962. Can half forget their own distress,
963. To share the loved one's happiness.
964. Oh, but to know our heart has been,
965. Like the toy of an Indian queen,
966. Torn, trampled, without thought or care,--
967. Where is despair like this despair!--

968. ll night beneath an oak he lay,
969. Till nature blush'd bright into day;
970. When, at a trumpet's sudden sound,
971. Started his courser from the ground:
972. And his loud neigh waked RAYMOND'S dream,
973. And, gazing round, he saw the gleam
974. Of arms upon a neighbouring height,
975. Where helm and cuirass stream'd in light.

976. As RAYMOND rose from his unrest
977. He knew DE VALENCE'S falcon crest;
978. And the red cross that shone like a glory afar,
979. Told the warrior was vow'd to the holy war.

980. Ay, this,' thought RAYMOND , 'is the strife
981. To make my sacrifice of life;
982. What is it now to me that fame
983. Shall brighten over RAYMOND'S name;
984. There is no gentle heart to bound,
985. No cheek to mantle at the sound:
986. Lady's favour no more I wear,--
987. My heart, my helm--oh! what are there?
988. A blighted hope, a wither'd rose.
989. Surely this warfare is for those
990. Who only of the victory crave
991. A holy but a nameless grave.'

992. Short greeting past; DE VALENCE read
993. All that the pale lip left unsaid;
994. On the wan brow, in the dimm'd eye,
995. The whole of youth's despondency,
996. Which at the first shock it has known
997. Deems its whole world of hope o'erthrown.
998. And it was fix'd, that at Marseilles,
999. Where the fleet waited favouring gales,
1000. RAYMOND should join the warrior train,
1001. Leagued 'gainst the infidels of Spain.

1002. They parted:--Over RAYMOND'S thought
1003. Came sadness mingled too with shame;
1004. When suddenly his memory brought
1005. The long forgotten EVA'S name.
1006. Oh! Love is like the mountain tide,
1007. Sweeping away all things beside,
1008. Till not another trace appears
1009. But its own joys, and griefs, and fears.
1010. He took her cross, he took her chain
1011. From the heart where they still had lain;
1012. And that heart felt as if its fate
1013. Had sudden grown less desolate,
1014. In thus remembering love that still
1015. Would share and sooth in good and ill.

1016. He spurr'd his steed; but the night fall
1017. Had darken'd ere he reach'd the hall;
1018. And gladly chief and vassal train
1019. Welcomed the youthful knight again.
1020. And many praised his stately tread,
1021. His face with darker manhood spread;
1022. But of those crowding round him now,
1023. Who mark'd the paleness of his brow,
1024. But one, who paused till they were past,
1025. Who look'd the first but spoke the last:
1026. Her welcome in its timid fear
1027. Fell almost cold on RAYMOND'S ear;
1028. A single look,--he felt he gazed
1029. Upon a gentle child no more,
1030. The blush that like the lightning blazed,
1031. The cheek then paler than before,
1032. A something of staid maiden grace,
1033. A cloud of thought upon her face;
1034. She who had been, in RAYMOND'S sight,
1035. A plaything, fancy, and delight,--
1036. Was changed: the depth of her blue eye
1037. Spoke to him now of sympathy,
1038. And seem'd her melancholy tone
1039. A very echo of his own;
1040. And that pale forehead, surely care
1041. Has graved an early lesson there.

1042. They roved through many a garden scene,
1043. Where other, happier days had been;
1044. And soon had RAYMOND told his all
1045. Of hopes, like stars but bright to fall;
1046. Of feelings blighted, changed, and driven
1047. Like exiles from their native heaven;
1048. And of an aimless sword, a lute
1049. Whose chords were now uncharm'd and mute.
1050. But EVA'S tender blandishing
1051. Was as the April rays, that fling
1052. A rainbow till the thickest rain
1053. Melts into blue and light again.

1054. There is a feeling in the heart
1055. Of woman which can have no part
1056. In man; a self devotedness,
1057. As victims round their idols press,
1058. And asking nothing, but to show
1059. How far their zeal and faith can go.
1060. Pure as the snow the summer sun
1061. Never at noon hath look'd upon,--
1062. Deep as is the diamond wave,
1063. Hidden in the desart cave,--
1064. Changeless as the greenest leaves
1065. Of the wreath the cypress weaves,--
1066. Hopeless often when most fond,
1067. Without hope or fear beyond
1068. Its own pale fidelity,--
1069. And this woman's love can be!

1070. And RAYMOND although not again
1071. Dreaming of passion's burning chain,
1072. Yet felt that life had still dear things
1073. To which the lingering spirit clings.
1074. More dear, more lovely EVA shone
1075. In thinking of that faithless one;
1076. And read he not upon the cheek
1077. All that the lip might never speak,
1078. All the heart cherish'd yet conceal'd,
1079. Scarce even to itself reveal'd.
1080. And RAYMOND , though with heart so torn
1081. By anger, agony, and scorn,
1082. Might ill bear even with love's name,
1083. Yet felt the maiden's hidden flame
1084. Come like the day-star in the east,
1085. When every other light has ceased;
1086. Sent from the bosom of the night
1087. To harbinger the morning light.

1088. Again they parted: she to brood
1089. O'er dreaming hopes in solitude,
1090. And every pitying saint to pray
1091. For RAYMOND on the battle day.
1092. And he no longer deem'd the field
1093. But death to all his hopes could yield.
1094. To other, softer dreams allied,
1095. He thought upon the warrior's pride.
1096. But as he pass'd the castle gate
1097. He left so wholly desolate,
1098. His throbbing pulse, his burning brain,
1099. The sudden grasp upon the rein,
1100. The breast and lip that gasp'd for air,
1101. Told Love's shaft was still rankling there.

1102. That night, borne o'er the bounding seas,
1103. The vessel swept before the breeze,
1104. Loaded the air, the war-cry's swell,
1105. Woe to the Moorish infidel;
1106. And raising their rich hymn, a band
1107. Of priests were kneeling on the strand,
1108. To bless the parting ship, and song
1109. Came from the maidens ranged along
1110. The sea wall, and who incense gave,
1111. And flowers, like offerings to the wave
1112. That bore the holy and the brave.

1113. And RAYMOND felt his spirit rise,
1114. And burn'd his cheek, and flash'd his eyes
1115. With something of their ancient light,
1116. While plume and pennon met his sight;
1117. While o'er the deep swept the war-cry,
1118. And peal'd the trumpet's voice on high,
1119. While the ship rode the waves as she
1120. Were mistress of their destiny.
1121. And muster'd on the deck the band,
1122. Till died the last shout from the strand;
1123. But when the martial pomp was o'er,
1124. And, like the future, dim the shore
1125. On the horizon hung, again
1126. Closed RAYMOND'S memory, like a chain
1127. The spirit struggles with in vain.

1128. The sky with its delicious blue,
1129. The stars like visions wandering through:
1130. Surely, if Fate had treasured there
1131. Her rolls of life, they must be fair;
1132. The mysteries their glories hide
1133. Must be but of life's brightest side;
1134. It cannot be that Fate would write
1135. Her dark decrees in lines of light.
1136. And RAYMOND mused upon the hour
1137. When, comrade of the star and flower,
1138. He watch'd beside his lady's bower;
1139. He number'd every hope and dream,
1140. Like blooms that threw upon life's stream
1141. Colours of beauty, and then thought
1142. On knowledge, all too dearly bought;
1143. Feelings lit up in waste to burn,
1144. Hopes that seem but shadows fair,
1145. All that the heart so soon must learn,
1146. All that it finds so hard to bear.

1147. The young moon's vestal lamp that hour
1148. Seem'd pale as that it pined for love;
1149. No marvel such a night had power,
1150. So calm below, so fair above,
1151. To wake the spirit's finest chords
1152. Till minstrel thoughts found minstrel words.

1153. THE LAST SONG.

1154. IT is the latest song of mine
1155. That ever breathes thy name,
1156. False idol of a dream-raised shrine,
1157. Thy very thought is shame,--
1158. Shame that I could my sprit bow
1159. To one so very false as thou.

1160. I had past years where the green wood
1161. Makes twilight of the noon,
1162. And I had watch'd the silver flood
1163. Kiss'd by the rising moon;
1164. And gazed upon the clear midnight
1165. In all its luxury of light.

1166. And, thrown where the blue violets dwell,
1167. I would pass hours away,
1168. Musing o'er some old chronicle
1169. Fill'd with a wild love lay;
1170. Till beauty seem'd to me a thing
1171. Made for all nature's worshipping.

1172. saw thee, and the air grew bright
1173. In thy clear eyes' sunshine;
1174. I oft had dream'd of shapes of light,
1175. But not of shape like thine.
1176. My heart bow'd down,--I worshipp'd thee,
1177. A woman and a deity.

1178. I may not say how thy first look
1179. Turn'd my whole soul to flame,
1180. I read it as a glorious book
1181. Fill'd with high deeds of fame;
1182. I felt a hero's spirit rise,
1183. Unknown till lighted at thine eyes.

1184. False look, false hope, and falsest love!
1185. All meteors sent to me
1186. To show how they the heart could move,
1187. And how deceiving be:
1188. They left me, darken'd, crush'd, alone,
1189. My bosom's household gods o'erthrown.

1190. The world itself was changed, and all
1191. That I had loved before
1192. Seem'd as if gone beyond recall,
1193. And I could hope no more;
1194. The sear of fire, the dint of steel,
1195. Are easier than Love's wounds to heal.

1196. But this is past, and I can cope
1197. With what I'd fain forget;
1198. I have a sweet, a gentle hope
1199. That lingers with me yet,--
1200. A hope too fair, too pure to be
1201. Named in the words that speak of thee.

1202. Henceforth within the last recess
1203. Of my heart shall remain
1204. Thy name in all its bitterness,
1205. But never named again;
1206. The only memory of that heart
1207. Will be to think how false thou art.

1208. And yet I fain would name thy name,
1209. My heart's now gentle queen,
1210. E'en as they burn the perfumed flame
1211. Where the plague spot has been;
1212. Methinks that it will cleanse away
1213. The ills that on my spirit prey.

1214. Sweet EVA ! the last time I gazed
1215. Upon thy deep blue eyes,
1216. The cheek whereon my look had raised
1217. A blush's crimson dyes,
1218. I marvell'd, love, this heart of mine
1219. Had worshipp'd at another shrine.

1220. I will think of thee when the star,
1221. That lit our own fair river,
1222. Shines in the blue sky from afar,
1223. As beautiful as ever;
1224. That twilight star, sweet love, shall be
1225. A sign and seal with thee and me!
