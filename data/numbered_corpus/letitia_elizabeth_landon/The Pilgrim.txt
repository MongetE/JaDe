1. Vain folly of another age,
2. This wandering over earth,
3. To find the peace by some dark sin
4. Banish'd our household hearth.

5. On Lebanon the dark green pines
6. Wave over sacred ground,
7. And Carmel's consecrated rose
8. Springs from a hallow'd mound.

9. Glorious the truth they testify,
10. And blessed is their name;
11. But even in such a sacred spot,
12. Are sin and woe the same.

13. O pilgrim! with each toilsome step,
14. Vain every weary day;
15. There is no charm in soil or shrine,
16. To wash thy guilt away.

17. Return, with prayer and tear, return
18. To those who weep at home;
19. To dry their tears will more avail,
20. Than o'er a world to roam.

21. There's hope for one who leaves with shame,
22. The guilt that lured before;
23. Remember, He who said, 'Repent,'
24. Said also, 'Sin no more.'

25. Return, and in thy daily round
26. Of duty and of love,
27. Thou best wilt find that patient faith
28. Which lifts the soul above.

29. In ev'ry innocent prayer, each child
30. Lisps at his father's knee: -
31. If thine has been to teach that prayer,
32. There will be hope for thee.

33. There is a small white church, that stands
34. Beside thy father's grave,
35. There kneel and pour those earnest prayers,
36. That sanctify and save.

37. Around thee draw thine own home-ties,
38. And, with a chasten'd mind,
39. In meek well-doing seek that peace,
40. No wandering will find.

41. In charity and penitence,
42. Thy sin will be forgiven: -
43. Pilgrim, the heart is the true shrine,
44. Whence prayers ascend to Heaven.
