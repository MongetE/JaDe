1. AND there the island lay, the waves around
2. Had never known a storm; for the north wind
3. Was charm'd from coming, and the only airs
4. That blew brought sunshine on their azure wings,
5. Or tones of music from the sparry caves,
6. Where the sea-maids make lutes of the pink conch.
7. These were sea breezes,--those that swept the land
8. Brought other gifts,--sighs from blue violets,
9. Or from June's sweet Sultana, the bright rose,
10. Stole odours. On the silver mirror's face
11. Was but a single ripple that was made
12. By a flamingo's beak, whose scarlet wings
13. Shone like a meteor on the stream: around,
14. Upon the golden sands, were coral plants,
15. And shells of many colours, and sea weeds,
16. Whose foliage caught and chain'd the Nautilus,
17. Where lay they as at anchor. On each side
18. Were grottoes, like fair porticoes with steps
19. Of the green marble; and a lovely light,
20. Like the far radiance of a thousand lamps,
21. Half-shine, half-shadow, or the glorious track
22. Of a departing star but faintly seen
23. In the dim distance, through those caverns shone,
24. And play'd o'er the tall trees which seem'd to hide
25. Gardens, where hyacinths rang their soft bells
26. To call the bees from the anemone,
27. Jealous of their bright rivals' golden wealth.
28. --Amid those arches floated starry shapes,
29. Just indistinct enough to make the eye
30. Dream of surpassing beauty; but in front,
31. Borne on a car of pearl, and drawn by swans,
32. There lay a lovely figure,--she was queen
33. Of the Enchanted Island, which was raised
34. From ocean's bosom but to pleasure her:
35. And spirits, from the stars, and from the sea,
36. The beautiful mortal had them for her slaves.

37. She was the daughter of a king, and loved
38. By a young Ocean Spirit from her birth,--
39. He hover'd o'er her in her infancy,
40. And bade the rose grow near her, that her cheek
41. Might catch its colour,--lighted up her dreams
42. With fairy wonders, and made harmony
43. The element in which she moved; at last,
44. When that she turn'd away from earthly love,
45. Enamour'd of her visions, he became
46. Visible with his radiant wings, and bore
47. His bride to the fair island.
