1. DIVINEST art, the stars above
2. Were fated on thy birth to shine;
3. Oh, born of beauty and of love,
4. What early poetry was thine!

5. The softness of Ionian night
6. Upon Ionian summer lay,
7. One planet gave its vesper light,
8. Enough to guide a lover's way;
9. And gave the fountain as it played
10. The semblance of a silvery shower,
11. And as its waters fell, they made
12. A music meet for such an hour;

13. That, and the tones the gentle wind
14. Won from the leaf, as from a lute,
15. In natural melody combined,
16. Now that all ruder sound was mute;
17. And odours floated on the air,
18. As many a nymph had just unbound
19. The wreath that bound their raven hair,
20. And flung the fragrant tresses round.

21. Pillowed on violet leaves, which prest
22. Filled the sweet chamber with their sighs,
23. Lulled by the lyre's low notes to rest,
24. A Grecian youth in slumber lies;
25. And at his side a maiden stands,
26. The dark hair braided on her brow,
27. The lute within her slender hands,
28. But hushed is all its music now.

29. She would not wake him from his dreams,
30. Although she has so much to say,
31. Although the morning's earliest beams
32. Will see her warrior torn away.
33. How fond and earnest is the gaze
34. Upon these sleeping features thrown,
35. She who yet never dared to raise
36. Her timid eyes to meet his own.

37. She bends her lover's rest above,
38. Thoughtful with gentle hopes and fears,
39. And that unutterable love
40. Which never yet spoke but in tears;
41. She would not that those tears should fall
42. Upon the cherished sleeper's face,
43. She turns, and sees upon the wall
44. Its imaged shade, its perfect grace;
45. With eager hand she marked each line,
46. The shadowy brow, the arching head,

47. Till some creative power divine,
48. Love's likeness o'er love's shadow spread:
49. Since then, what passion and what power
50. Has dwelt upon the painter's art;
51. How has it soothed the absent hour,
52. With looks that wear life's loveliest part.

53. Oh, painter of our English isle,
54. Whose name is now upon my line,
55. Who gave to beauty's blush and smile
56. All that could make them most divine;
57. The fair Ionian's ancient claim
58. Was never paid, till paid by thee,
59. And thou didst honour to her name,
60. By showing what her sex can be.
