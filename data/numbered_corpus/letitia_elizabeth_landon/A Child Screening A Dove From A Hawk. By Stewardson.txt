1. AY, screen thy favourite dove, fair child,
2. Ay, screen it if you may,--
3. Yet I misdoubt thy trembling hand
4. Will scare the hawk away.

5. That dove will die, that child will weep,--
6. Is this their destinie?
7. Ever amid the sweets of life
8. Some evil thing must be.

9. Ay, moralize,--is it not thus
10. We've mourn'd our hope and love?
11. Alas! there's tears for every eye,
12. A hawk for every dove!
