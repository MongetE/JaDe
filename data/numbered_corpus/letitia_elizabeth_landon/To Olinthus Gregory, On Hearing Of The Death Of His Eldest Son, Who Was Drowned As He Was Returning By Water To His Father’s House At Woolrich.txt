1. IS there a spot where Pity's foot,
2. Although unsandalled, fears to tread,
3. A silence where her voice is mute,
4. Where tears, and only tears, are shed?
5. It is the desolated home
6. Where Hope was yet a recent guest,
7. Where Hope again may never come,
8. Or come, and only speak of rest.

9. They gave my hand the pictured scroll,
10. And bade me only fancy there
11. A parent's agony of soul,
12. A parent's long and last despair;
13. The sunshine on the sudden wave,
14. Which closed above the youthful head,
15. Mocking the green and quiet grave,
16. Which waits the time-appointed dead.

17. I thought upon the lone fire-side,
18. Begirt with all familiar thought,
19. The future, where a father's pride
20. So much from present promise wrought:
21. The sweet anxiety of fears,
22. Anxious from love's excess alone,
23. The fond reliance upon years
24. More precious to us than our own:

25. All pastâ€”then weeping words there came
26. From out a still and darkened room,
27. They could not bear to name a name
28. Written so newly on the tomb.
29. They said he was so good and kind,
30. The voices sank, the eyes grew dim;
31. So much of love he left behind,
32. So much of life had died with him.

33. Ah, pity for the long beloved,
34. Ah, pity for the early dead;
35. The young, the promising, removed
36. Ere life a light or leaf had shed.
37. Nay, rather pity those whose doom
38. It is to wait and weep behind,
39. The father, who within the tomb
40. Sees all life held most dear enshrined.
