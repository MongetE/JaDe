1. She lay upon a bank, the favourite haunt
2. Of the spring wind in its first sunshine hour,
3. For the luxuriant strawberry blossoms spread
4. Like a snow-shower there, and violets
5. Bow'd down their purple vases of perfume
6. About her pillow,--link'd in a gay band
7. Floated fantastic shapes, these were her guards,
8. Her lithe and rainbow elves.


9. WE have been o'er land and sea,
10. Seeking lovely dreams for thee,--
11. Where is there we have not been
12. Gathering gifts for our sweet queen?
13. We are come with sound and sight
14. Fit for fairy's sleep to-night,--
15. First around thy couch shall sweep
16. Odours, such as roses weep
17. When the earliest spring rain
18. Calls them into life again;
19. Next upon thine ear shall float
20. Many a low and silver note,
21. Stolen from a dark-eyed maid
22. When her lover's serenade,
23. Rising as the stars grew dim,
24. Waken'd her from thoughts of him.
25. There shall steal o'er lip and cheek
26. Gales, but all too light to break
27. Thy soft rest,--such gales as hide
28. All day orange-flowers inside,
29. Or that, while hot noontide, dwell
30. In the purple hyacinth bell;
31. And before thy sleeping eyes
32. Shall come glorious pageantries,--
33. Palaces of gems and gold,
34. Such as dazzle to behold,--
35. Gardens, in which every tree
36. Seems a world of bloom to be,--
37. Fountains, whose clear waters show
38. The white pearls that lie below.--
39. During slumber's magic reign
40. Other times shall live again;
41. First thou shalt be young and free
42. In thy days of liberty,--
43. Then again be woo'd and won
44. By thy stately OBERON .
45. Or thou shalt descend to earth,
46. And see all of mortal birth.

47. No, that world's too full of care
48. For e'en dreams to linger there.
49. But, behold, the sun is set,
50. And the diamond coronet
51. Of the young moon is on high
52. Waiting for our revelry;
53. And the dew is on the flower,
54. And the stars proclaim our hour;
55. Long enough thy rest has been,
56. Wake, TITANIA , wake our queen!
