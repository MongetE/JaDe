1. LITTLE the present careth for the past,
2. Too little—'tis not well!
3. For careless ones we dwell
4. Beneath the mighty shadow it has cast.

5. Its blessings are around our daily path,
6. We share its mighty spoil,
7. We live on its great toil,
8. And yet how little gratitude it hath.

9. Look on these temples, they were as a shrine
10. From whence to the far north
11. The human mind went forth,
12. The moral sunshine of a world divine—

13. That inward world which maketh of our clay
14. Its temporary home;
15. From whence those lightnings come,
16. That kindle from a far and better day.

17. The light that is of heaven shone there the first
18. The elements of art,
19. Mankind's diviner part;
20. There was young science in its cradle nurst.

21. Mighty the legacies by mind bequeathed,
22. For glorious were its pains
23. Amid those giant fanes,
24. And mighty were the triumphs it achieved

25. A woman's triumph mid them is imprest
26. One who upon the scroll
27. Flung the creative soul,
28. Disdainful of life's flowers and of its rest.

29. Vast was the labour, vast the enterprise,
30. For she was of a race
31. Born to the lowest place,
32. Earth-insects, lacking wings whereon to rise.

33. How must that youthful cheek have lost its bloom,
34. How many a dream above
35. Of early hope and love
36. Must that young heart have closed on like a tomb.

37. Such throw life's flowers behind them, and aspire
38. To ask the stars their lore
39. And from each ancient store
40. Seek food to stay the mind's consuming fire.

41. Her triumph was complete and long, the chords
42. She struck are yet alive;
43. Not vainly did she strive
44. To leave her soul immortal on her words.

45. A great example has she left behind,
46. A lesson we should take,
47. Whose first task is to wake
48. The general wish to benefit our kind.

49. Our sword has swept o'er India; there remains
50. A nobler conquest far,
51. The mind's ethereal war,
52. That but subdues to civilize its plains.

53. Let us pay back the past, the debt we owe,
54. Let us around dispense
55. Light, hope, intelligence,
56. Till blessings track our steps where'er we go.

57. O England, thine be the deliverer's meed,
58. Be thy great empire known
59. By hearts made all thine own,
60. By thy free laws and thy immortal creed.
