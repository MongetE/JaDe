1. He lived at Dingle Bank - he did; -
2. He lived at Dingle Bank;
3. And in his garden was one Quail,
4. Four tulips and a Tank:
5. And from his window he could see
6. The otion and the River Dee.

7. His house stood on a Cliff, - it did,
8. Its aspic it was cool;
9. And many thousand little boys
10. Resorted to his school,
11. Where if of progress they could boast
12. He gave them heaps of buttered toast.

13. But he grew rabid-wroth, he did,
14. If they neglected books,
15. And dragged them to adjacent Cliffs
16. With beastly Button Hooks,
17. And there with fatuous glee he threw
18. Them down into the ocean blue.

19. And in the sea they sway, they did, -
20. All playfully about,
21. And some eventually became
22. Sponges, or speckled trout: -
23. But Liverpool doth all bewail
24. Their Fate; - likewise his Garden Quail.
