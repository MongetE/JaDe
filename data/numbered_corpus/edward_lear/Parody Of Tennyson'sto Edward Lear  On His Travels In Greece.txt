1. Delirious Bulldogs; -- echoing calls
2. My daughter, -- green as summer grass; --
3. The long supine Plebeian ass,
4. The nasty crockery boring falls; --

5. Tom-Moory Pathos; -- all things bare, --
6. With such a turket! such a hen!
7. And scrambling forms of distant men,
8. O! ain't you glad you were not there!
