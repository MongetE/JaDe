1. There lived an old man in the kingdom of Tess,
2. Who invented a purely original dress;
3. And when it was perfectly made and complete,
4. He opened the door, and walked into the street.

5. By way of a hat, he'd a loaf of Brown Bread,
6. In the middle of which he inserted his head;--
7. His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,
8. The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;--
9. His Drawers were of Rabit-skins, -- but it is not known whose;--
10. His Waistcoat and Trowsers were made of Pork Chops;--
11. His Buttons were Jujubes, and Chocolate Drops;--
12. His Coat was all Pancakes with Jam for a border,
13. And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;
14. And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,
15. A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.

16. He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,
17. Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;--
18. And from every long street and dark lane in the town
19. Beasts, Birdles, and Boys in a tumult rushed down.
20. Two Cows and a half ate his Cabbage-leaf Cloak;--
21. Four Apes seized his Girdle, which vanished like smoke;--
22. Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,--
23. And the tails were devour'd by an ancient He Goat;--
24. An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore up his
25. Pork Waistcoat and Trowsers to give to their Puppies;--
26. And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,
27. Ten boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.--
28. He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,
29. Four Scores of fat Pigs came again and again;--
30. They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors,--
31. They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;--
32. And now from the housetops with screechings descend,
33. Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end,
34. They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,--
35. When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;--
36. They speedily flew at his sleeves in trice,
37. And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;--
38. They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall,--
39. Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.

40. And he said to himself as he bolted the door,
41. 'I will not wear a similar dress any more,
42. 'Any more, any more, any morre, never more!'
