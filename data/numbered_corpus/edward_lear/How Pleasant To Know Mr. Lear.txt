1. How pleasant to know Mr. Lear,
2. Who has written such volumes of stuff.
3. Some think him ill-tempered and queer,
4. But a few find him pleasant enough.

5. His mind is concrete and fastidious,
6. His nose is remarkably big;
7. His visage is more or less hideous,
8. His beard it resembles a wig.

9. He has ears, and two eyes, and ten fingers,
10. (Leastways if you reckon two thumbs);
11. He used to be one of the singers,
12. But now he is one of the dumbs.

13. He sits in a beautiful parlour,
14. With hundreds of books on the wall;
15. He drinks a great deal of marsala,
16. But never gets tipsy at all.

17. He has many friends, laymen and clerical,
18. Old Foss is the name of his cat;
19. His body is perfectly spherical,
20. He weareth a runcible hat.

21. When he walks in waterproof white,
22. The children run after him so!
23. Calling out, "He's gone out in his night-
24. Gown, that crazy old Englishman, oh!"

25. He weeps by the side of the ocean,
26. He weeps on the top of the hill;
27. He purchases pancakes and lotion,
28. And chocolate shrimps from the mill.

29. He reads, but he does not speak, Spanish,
30. He cannot abide ginger beer;
31. Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,
32. How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!
