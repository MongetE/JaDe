1. First Part
2. Mr and Mrs Discobbolos
3. Climbed to the top of a wall,
4. And they sat to watch the sunset sky
5. And to hear the Nupiter Piffkin cry
6. And the Biscuit Buffalo call.
7. They took up a roll and some Chamomile tea,
8. And both were as happy as happy could be -
9. Till Mrs Discobbolos said, -
10. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
11. It has just come into my head -
12. Suppose we should happen to fall!!!!!
13. Darling Mr Discobbolos?

14. 'Suppose we should fall down flumpetty
15. Just like two pieces of stone!
16. On to the thorns, - or into the moat!
17. What would become of your new green coat?
18. And might you not break a bone?
19. It never occurred to me before -
20. That perhaps we shall never go down any more!'
21. And Mrs Discobbolos said -
22. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
23. What put it into your head
24. To climb up this wall? - my own
25. Darling Mr Discobbolos?'

26. Mr Discobbolos answered, -
27. 'At first it gave me pain, -
28. And I felt my ears turn perfectly pink
29. When your exclamation made me think
30. We might never get down again!
31. But now I believe it is wiser far
32. To remain for ever just where we are.' -
33. And Mr Discobbolos said,
34. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
35. It has just come into my head -
36. '- We shall never go down again -
37. Dearest Mrs Discobbolos.!'

38. So Mr and Mrs Discobbolos
39. Stood up, and began to sing,
40. 'Far away from hurry and strife
41. Here we will pass the rest of life,
42. Ding a dong, ding dong, ding!
43. We want no knives nor forks nor chairs,
44. No tables nor carpets nor household cares,
45. From worry of life we've fled -
46. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
47. There is no more trouble ahead
48. Sorrow or any such thing -
49. For Mr and Mrs Discobbolos!'


50. Second Part.

51. Mr and Mrs Discobbolos
52. Lived on the top of the wall
53. For twenty years, a month and a day,
54. Till their hair had grown all pearly gray,
55. And their teeth began to fall.
56. They never were ill, or at all dejected,
57. By all admired, and by some respected,
58. Till Mrs Discobbolos said,
59. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
60. It has just come into my head,
61. We have no more room at all -
62. Darling Mr Discobbolos!

63. Look at our six fine boys!
64. And our six sweet girls so fair!
65. Upon this wall they have all been born,
66. And not one of the twelve has happened to fall
67. Through my maternal care!
68. Surely they should not pass their lives
69. Without any chance of husbands or wives!'
70. And Mrs Discobbolos said,
71. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
72. Did it never come into your head
73. That our lives must be lived elsewhere,
74. Dearest Mr Discobbolos?

75. 'They have never been at a ball,
76. Nor have even seen a bazaar!
77. Nor have heard folks say in a tone all hearty,
78. 'What loves of girls (at a garden party)
79. Those Misses Discobbolos are!'
80. Morning and night it drives me wild
81. To think of the fate of each darling child!'
82. But Mr Discobbolos said,
83. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
84. What has come to your fiddledum head!
85. What a runcible goose you are!
86. Octopod Mrs Discobbolos!'

87. Suddenly Mr Discobbolos
88. Slid from the top of the wall;
89. And beneath it he dug a dreadful trench,
90. And filled it with dynamite, gunpowder gench,
91. And aloud he began to call -
92. 'Let the wild bee sing,
93. And the blue bird hum!
94. For the end of your lives has certainly come!'
95. And Mrs Discobbolos said,
96. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
97. We shall presently all be dead,
98. On this ancient runcible wall,
99. Terrible Mr Discobbolos!'

100. Pensively, Mr Discobbolos
101. Sat with his back to the wall;
102. He lighted a match, and fired the train,
103. And the mortified mountain echoed again
104. To the sound of an awful fall!
105. And all the Discobbolos family flew
106. In thousands of bits to the sky so blue,
107. And no one was left to have said,
108. 'Oh! W! X! Y! Z!
109. Has it come into anyone's head
110. That the end has happened to all
111. Of the whole of the Clan Discobbolos?'
