1. Time is a taper waning fast!
2. Use it, man, well whilst it doth last:
3. Lest burning downwards it consume away,
4. Before thou hast commenced the labour of the day.

5. Time is a pardon of a goodly soil!
6. Plenty shall crown thine honest toil:
7. But if uncultivated, rankest weeds
8. Shall choke the efforts of the rising seeds.

9. Time is a leasehold of uncertain date!
10. Granted to thee by everlasting fate.
11. Neglect not thou, ere thy short term expire,
12. To save thy soul from ever-burning fire.
