16. 'Many thoughts of trouble come,
17. 'Like to flies upon a plum!
18. 'All last night, among the trees,

38. 'I was also sad, and thinking,
39. 'When one day I saw you winking,
40. 'And I heard you sniffle-snuffle,
41. 'And I saw your feathers ruffle;
42. 'To myself I sadly said,
43. 'She's neuralgia in her head!
44. 'That dear head has nothing on it!
45. 'Ought she not to wear a bonnet?

50. 'Let us both fly up to town!
51. 'There I'll buy you such a gown!
52. 'Which, completely in the fashion,
53. 'You shall tie a sky-blue sash on.
54. 'And a pair of slippers neat,
55. 'To fit your darling little feet,
56. 'So that you will look and feel,
57. 'Quite galloobious and genteel!
58. 'Jikky wikky bikky see,

62. So they both to London went,
63. Alighting on the Monument,
64. Whence they flew down swiftly -- pop,
65. Into Moses' wholesale shop;
66. There they bought a hat and bonnet,
67. And a gown with spots upon it,
68. A satin sash of Cloxam blue,
69. And a pair of slippers too.
70. Zikky wikky mikky bee,

74. Then when so completely drest,
75. Back they flew and reached their nest.
76. Their children cried, 'O Ma and Pa!
77. 'How truly beautiful you are!'
78. Said they, 'We trust that cold or pain
79. 'We shall never feel again!
80. 'While, perched on tree, or house, or steeple,
81. 'We now shall look like other people.
82. 'Witchy witchy witchy wee,
83. 'Twikky mikky bikky bee,
84. Zikky sikky tee.'
