1. Mrs Jaypher found a wafer
2. Which she stuck upon a note;
3. This she took and gave the cook.
4. Then she went and bought a boat,
5. Which she paddled down the stream,
6. Shouting, 'Ice produces cream,
7. Beer when churned produces butter!
8. Henceforth all the words I utter
9. Distant ages thus shall note -
10. 'From the Jaypher Wisdom-Boat.''


11. Mrs Jaypher said, 'It's safer
12. If you've lemons in your head;
13. First to eat, a pound of meat,
14. And then to go at once to bed.
15. Eating meat is half the battle,
16. Till you hear the Lemons rattle!
17. If you don't, you'll always moan,
18. In a Lemoncolly tone;
19. For there's nothing half so dreadful,
20. as Lemons in your head.
