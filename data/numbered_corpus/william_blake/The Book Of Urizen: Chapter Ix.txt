1. 1. Then the Inhabitants of those Cities:
2. Felt their Nerves change into Marrow
3. And hardening Bones began
4. In swift diseases and torments,
5. In throbbings & shootings & grindings
6. Thro' all the coasts; till weaken'd
7. The Senses inward rush'd shrinking,
8. Beneath the dark net of infection.

9. 2. Till the shrunken eyes clouded over
10. Discernd not the woven hipocrisy
11. But the streaky slime in their heavens
12. Brought together by narrowing perceptions
13. Appeard transparent air; for their eyes
14. Grew small like the eyes of a man
15. And in reptile forms shrinking together
16. Of seven feet stature they remaind

17. 3. Six days they shrunk up from existence
18. And on the seventh day they rested
19. And they bless'd the seventh day, in sick hope:
20. And forgot their eternal life

21. 4. And their thirty cities divided
22. In form of a human heart
23. No more could they rise at will
24. In the infinite void, but bound down
25. To earth by their narrowing perceptions
26. They lived a period of years
27. Then left a noisom body
28. To the jaws of devouring darkness

29. 5. And their children wept, & built
30. Tombs in the desolate places,
31. And form'd laws of prudence, and call'd them
32. The eternal laws of God

33. 6. And the thirty cities remaind
34. Surrounded by salt floods, now call'd
35. Africa: its name was then Egypt.

36. 7. The remaining sons of Urizen
37. Beheld their brethren shrink together
38. Beneath the Net of Urizen;
39. Perswasion was in vain;
40. For the ears of the inhabitants,
41. Were wither'd, & deafen'd, & cold:
42. And their eyes could not discern,
43. Their brethren of other cities.

44. 8. So Fuzon call'd all together
45. The remaining children of Urizen:
46. And they left the pendulous earth:
47. They called it Egypt, & left it.

48. 9. And the salt ocean rolled englob'd.
