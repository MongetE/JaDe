1. In futurity
2. I prophesy see.
3. That the earth from sleep.
4. (Grave the sentence deep)

5. Shall arise and seek
6. For her maker meek:
7. And the desart wild
8. Become a garden mild.

9. In the southern clime,
10. Where the summers prime
11. Never fades away;
12. Lovely Lyca lay.

13. Seven summers old
14. Lovely Lyca told,
15. She had wandered long.
16. Hearing wild birds song.

17. Sweet sleep come to me
18. Underneath this tree;
19. Do father, mother weep.--
20. "Where can Lyca sleep".

21. Lost in desert wild
22. Is your little child.
23. How can Lyca sleep.
24. If her mother weep.

25. If her heart does ake.
26. Then let Lyca wake;
27. If my mother sleep,
28. Lyca shall not weep.

29. Frowning, frowning night,
30. O'er this desert bright.
31. Let thy moon arise.
32. While I close my eyes.

33. Sleeping Lyca lay:
34. While the beasts of prey,
35. Come from caverns deep,
36. View'd the maid asleep

37. The kingly lion stood
38. And the virgin view'd:
39. Then he gambolled round
40. O'er the hallowed ground:

41. Leopards, tygers play,
42. Round her as she lay;
43. While the lion old,
44. Bow'd his mane of gold,

45. And her bosom lick,
46. And upon her neck,
47. From his eyes of flame,
48. Ruby tears there came;

49. While the lioness
50. Loos'd her slender dress,
51. And naked they convey'd
52. To caves the sleeping maid.
