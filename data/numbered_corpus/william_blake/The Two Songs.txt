1. I heard an Angel Singing
2. When the day was springing:
3. "Mercy, pity, and peace,
4. Are the world's release."

5. So he sang all day
6. Over the new-mown hay,
7. Till the sun went down,
8. And the haycocks looked brown.

9. I heard a devil curse
10. Over the heath and the furse:
11. "Mercy vould be no more
12. If there were nobody poor,
13. And pity no more could be
14. If all were happy as ye:
15. And mutual fear brings peace,
16. Misery's increase
17. Are mercy, pity, and peace."

18. At his curse the sun went down,
19. And the heavens gave a frown.
