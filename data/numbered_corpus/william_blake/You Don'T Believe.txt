1. You don't believe -- I won't attempt to make ye:
2. You are asleep -- I won't attempt to wake ye.
3. Sleep on! sleep on! while in your pleasant dreams
4. Of Reason you may drink of Life's clear streams.
5. Reason and Newton, they are quite two things;
6. For so the swallow and the sparrow sings.

7. Reason says `Miracle': Newton says `Doubt.'
8. Aye! that's the way to make all Nature out.
9. `Doubt, doubt, and don't believe without experiment':
10. That is the very thing that Jesus meant,
11. When He said `Only believe! believe and try!
12. Try, try, and never mind the reason why!'
