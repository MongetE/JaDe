1. Pity would be no more
2. If we did not make somebody Poor;
3. And Mercy no more could be
4. If all were as happy as we.

5. And mutual fear brings peace,
6. Till the selfish loves increase:
7. Then Cruelty knits a snare,
8. And spreads his baits with care.

9. He sits down with holy fears,
10. And waters the grounds with tears;
11. Then Humility takes its root
12. Underneath his foot.

13. Soon spreads the dismal shade
14. Of Mystery over his head;
15. And the Catterpiller and Fly
16. Feed on the Mystery.

17. And it bears the fruit of Deceit,
18. Ruddy and sweet to eat;
19. And the Raven his nest has made
20. In its thickest shade.

21. The Gods of the earth and sea
22. Sought thro' Nature to find this Tree;
23. But their search was all in vain:
24. There grows one in the Human Brain.
