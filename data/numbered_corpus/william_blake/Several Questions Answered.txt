3. What is it women do in men require?
4. The lineaments of Gratified Desire.

5. The look of love alarms
6. Because 'tis fill'd with fire;
7. But the look of soft deceit

9. Soft Deceit & Idleness,

12. Dot the winged life destroy;
13. But he who kisses the joy as it flies
14. Lives in Eternity's sunrise.
