1. Earth raised up her head
2. From the darkness dread and drear,
3. Her light fled,
4. Stony, dread,
5. And her locks covered with grey despair.

6. 'Prisoned on watery shore,
7. Starry jealousy does keep my den
8. Cold and hoar;
9. Weeping o're,
10. I hear the father of the ancient men.

11. 'Selfish father of men!
12. Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!
13. Can delight,
14. Chained in night,
15. The virgins of youth and morning bear?


16. 'Does spring hide its joy,
17. When buds and blossoms grow?
18. Does the sower
19. Sow by night,
20. Or the plowman in darkness plough?

21. 'Break this heavy chain,
22. That does freeze my bones around!
23. Selfish, vain,
24. Eternal bane,
25. That free love with bondage bound.'
