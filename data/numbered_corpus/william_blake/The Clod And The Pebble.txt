1. 'Love seeketh not itself to please,
2. Nor for itself hath any care,
3. But for another gives its ease,
4. And builds a heaven in hell's despair.'

5. So sung a little clod of clay,
6. Trodden with the cattle's feet;
7. But a pebble of the brook
8. Warbled out these meters meet:

9. 'Love seeketh only Self to please,
10. To bind another to its delight,
11. Joys in another's loss of ease,
12. And builds a hell in heaven's despite.'
