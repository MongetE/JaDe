11. Then the perilous path was planted,

39. Without contraries is no progres-
40. sion. Attraction and repulsion, rea-
41. son and energy, love and hate, are
42. necessary to human existence.

43. From these contraries spring what
44. the religious call Good and Evil.
45. Good is the passive that obeys reason;
46. Evil is the active springing from
47. Energy.

48. Good is heaven. Evil is hell.

50. THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL

51. All Bibles or sacred codes have been
52. the cause of the following errors : —

53. 1. That man has two real existing
54. principles, viz., a Body and a Soul.

55. 2. That Energy, called Evil, is alone
56. from the Body ; and that Reason, called
57. Good, is alone from the Soul.

58. 3. That God will torment man in
59. Eternity for following his Energies.

60. But the following contraries to
61. these are true : —

62. 1 . Man has no Body distinct from his
63. Soul. For that called Body is a por-
64. tion of Soul discerned by the five senses,
65. the chief inlets of Soul in this age.

66. 2 . Energy is the only life , and is from
67. the Body; and Reason is the bound
68. or outward circumference of Energy.

69. 8



70. HEAVEN AND HELL

71. 3. Energy is Eternal Delight.

72. Those who restrain desire, do so
73. because theirs is weak enough to be
74. restrained; and the restrainer or
75. reason usurps its place and governs
76. the unwilling.

77. And being restrained, it by degrees
78. becomes passive, till it is only the
79. shadow of desire.

80. The history of this is written in
81. Paradise Lost, and the Governor or
82. Reason is called Messiah.

83. And the original Archangel or pos-
84. sessor of the command of the heavenly
85. host is called the Devil, or Satan, and
86. his children are called Sin and Death.

87. But in the book of Job, Milton's
88. Messiah is called Satan.

89. For this history has been adopted by
90. both parties.

91. It indeed appeared to Reason as if

92. 9



93. THE MARRIAGE OF

94. desire was cast out, but the Devil's
95. account is, that the Messiah fell, and
96. formed a heaven of what he stole from
97. the abyss.

98. This is shown in the Gospel, where
99. he prays to the Father to send the
100. Comforter or desire that Reason may
101. have ideas to build on, the Jehovah
102. of the Bible being no other than he
103. who dwells in flaming fire. Know
104. that after Christ's death he became
105. Jehovah.

106. But in Milton, the Father is Destiny,
107. the Son a ratio of the five senses, and
108. the Holy Ghost vacuum !

109. Note. — The reason Milton wrote
110. in fetters when he wrote of Angels
111. and God, and at Uberty when of
112. Devils and Hell, is because he was
113. a true poet, and of the Devil's party
114. without knowing it.







115. HEAVEN AND HELL



116. A MEMORABLE FANCY

117. As I was walking among the fires
118. of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments
119. of Genius, which to Angels look like
120. torment and insanity, I collected some
121. of their proverbs, thinking that as the
122. sayings used in a nation mark its
123. character, so the proverbs of Hell show
124. the nature of infernal wisdom better
125. than any description of buildings or
126. garments.

127. When I came home, on the abyss
128. of the five senses, where a flat-sided
129. steep frowns over the present world, I
130. saw a mighty Devil folded in black
131. clouds hovering on the sides of the
132. rock; with corroding fires he wrote
133. the following sentence now perceived
134. by the minds of men, and read by
135. them on earth : —

155. Dip him in the river who loves

166. The hours of folly are measured by

185. The pride of the peacock is the

187. The lust of the goat is the bounty

190. of God.

191. The nakedness of woman is the
192. work of God.

193. Excess of sorrow laughs, excess of
194. joy weeps.

195. The roaring of lions, the howling of
196. wolves, the raging of the stormy sea,
197. and the destructive sword, are por-
198. tions of Eternity too great for the eye
199. of man.

200. The fox condemns the trap, not
201. himself.

202. Joys impregnate, sorrows bring

230. The fox provides for himself, but
231. God provides for the lion.

232. Think in the morning, act in the

235. He who has suffered you to impose

237. As the plough follows words, so

263. When thou seest an eagle, thou
264. seest a portion of Genius. Lift up thy

266. As the caterpillar chooses the fairest

297. Where man is not, nature is barren.

298. Truth can never be told so as to be

300. Enough! or Too much.

301. The ancient poets animated all sen-
302. sible objects with Gods or Geniuses,
303. calling them by the names and adorn-
304. ing them with properties of woods,
305. rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, na-
306. tions, and whatever their enlarged
307. and numerous senses could perceive.
308. And particularly they studied the
309. Genius of each city and country,
310. placing it under its mental deity. Till
311. a system was formed, which some
312. took advantage of and enslaved the
313. vulgar by attempting to realize or
314. abstract the mental deities from their
315. objects. Thus began Priesthood.





316. HEAVEN AND HELL

317. Choosing forms of worship from
318. poetic tales. And at length they pro-
319. nounced that the Gods had ordered
320. such things. Thus men forgot that
321. all deities reside in the human breast.







322. THE MARRIAGE OF



323. A MEMORABLE FANCY

324. The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel
325. dined with me, and I asked them how
326. they dared so roundly to assert that
327. God spoke to them, and whether they
328. did not think at the time that they
329. would be misunderstood, and so be
330. the cause of imposition.

331. Isaiah answered: 'I saw no God,
332. nor heard any, in a finite organical
333. perception: but my senses discovered
334. the infinite in everything; and as I
335. was then persuaded, and remained
336. confirmed, that the voice of honest
337. indignation is the voice of God, I cared
338. not for consequences, but wrote.'*

339. Then I asked: 'Does a firm per-
340. suasion that a thing is so, make it
341. so?'

342. He replied: 'All poets believe that





343. HEAVEN AND HELL

344. it does, and in ages of imagination
345. this firm persuasion removed moun-
346. tains; but many are not capable of a
347. firm persuasion of anything.'

348. Then Ezekiel said : ' The philosophy
349. of the East taught the first principles
350. of human perception; some nations
351. held one principle for the origin, and
352. some another. We of Israel taught
353. that the Poetic Genius (as you now
354. call it) was the first principle, and all
355. the others merely derivative, which
356. was the cause of our despising the
357. Priests and Philosophers of other
358. countries, and prophesying that all
359. Gods would at last be proved to origi-
360. nate in ours, and to be the tributaries
361. of the Poetic Genius. It was this that
362. our great poet King David desired so
363. fervently, and invokes so pathetically,
364. saying by this he conquers enemies
365. and governs kingdoms; and we so
366. loved our Ggd that we cursed in His

367. i3



368. THE MARRIAGE OF

369. name all the deities of surrounding
370. nations, and asserted that they had
371. rebelled. From these opinions the
372. vulgar came to think that all nations
373. would at last be subject to the Jews.

374. 'This,' said he, 'like all firm per-
375. suasions, is come to pass, for all
376. nations believe the Jews' code, and
377. worship the Jews' God; and what
378. greater subjection can be?'

379. I heard this with some wonder, and
380. must confess my own conviction.
381. After dinner I asked Isaiah to favour
382. the world with his lost works; he said
383. none of equal value was lost. Ezekiel
384. said the same of his.

385. I also asked Isaiah what made him
386. go naked and barefoot three years.
387. He answered: 'The same that made
388. our friend Diogenes the Grecian.'

389. I then asked Ezekiel why he ate
390. dung, and lay so long on his right and





391. HEAVEN AND HELL

392. left side. He answered: 'The desire
393. of raising other men into a perception
394. of the infinite. This the North Ameri-
395. can tribes practise. And is he honest
396. who resists his genius or conscience,
397. only for the sake of present ease or
398. gratification?'

399. The ancient tradition that the world
400. will be consumed in fire at the end of
401. six thousand years is true, as I have
402. heard from Hell.

403. For the cherub with his flaming
404. sword is hereby commanded to leave
405. his guard at [the] tree of life, and
406. when he does, the whole creation will
407. be consumed and appear infinite and
408. holy, whereas it now appears finite
409. and corrupt.

410. This will come to pass by an im-
411. provement of sensual enjoyment.

412. But first the notion that man has





413. THE MARRIAGE OF

414. a body distinct from his soul is to be
415. expunged; this I shall do by printing
416. in the infernal method by corrosives,
417. which in Hell are salutary and medici-
418. nal, melting apparent surfaces away,
419. and displaying the infinite which was
420. hid.

421. If the doors of perception were
422. cleansed everything would appear to
423. man as it is, infinite.

424. For man has closed himself up, till
425. he sees all things through narrow
426. chinks of his cavern.







427. HEAVEN AND HELL



428. A MEMORABLE FANCY

429. I was in a printing-house in Hell,
430. and saw the method in which knowl-
431. edge is transmitted from generation
432. to generation.

433. In the first chamber was a dragon-
434. man, clearing away the rubbish from
435. a cave's mouth; within, a number of
436. dragons were hollowing the cave.

437. In the second chamber was a viper
438. folding round the rock and the cave,
439. and others adorning it with gold, silver,
440. and precious stones.

441. In the third chamber was an eagle
442. with wings and feathers of air; he
443. caused the inside of the cave to be
444. infinite; around were numbers of
445. eagle-like men, who built palaces in
446. the immense cliffs.

447. In the fourth chamber were lions





448. THE MARRIAGE OF

449. of flaming fire raging around and
450. melting the metals into living fluids.

451. In the fifth chamber were unnamed
452. forms, which cast the metals into the
453. expanse.

454. There they were received by men
455. who occupied the sixth chamber, and
456. took the forms of books, and were
457. arranged in libraries.

458. The Giants who formed this world
459. into its sensual existence and now
460. seem to live in it in chains are in
461. truth the causes of its life and the
462. sources of all activity, but the chains
463. are the cunning of weak and tame
464. minds, which have power to resist
465. energy, according to the proverb,
466. 'The weak in courage is strong in
467. cunning.'

468. Thus one portion of being is the





469. HEAVEN AND HELL

470. Prolific, the other the Devouring. To
471. the devourer it seems as if the pro-
472. ducer was in his chains; but it is not
473. so, he only takes portions of existence,
474. and fancies that the whole.

475. But the Prolific would cease to be
476. prolific unless the Devourer as a sea
477. received the excess of his delights.

478. Some will say, 'Is not God alone
479. the Prolific?' I answer: 'God only
480. acts and is in existing beings or
481. men.'

482. These two classes of men are always
483. upon earth, and they should be ene-
484. mies: whoever tries to reconcile them
485. seeks to destroy existence.

486. Religion is an endeavour to recon-
487. cile the two.

488. Note. — Jesus Christ did not wish
489. to unite but to separate them, as in
490. the parable of sheep and goats; and





491. THE MARRIAGE OF

492. He says : ' I came not to send peace,
493. but a sword.'

494. Messiah, or Satan, or Tempter, was
495. formerly thought to be one of the
496. antediluvians who are our Energies.







497. HEAVEN AND HELL



498. A MEMORABLE FANCY

499. An Angel came to me and said: '0
500. pitiable foolish young man! hor-
501. rible, dreadful state! Consider the
502. hot burning dungeon thou art prepar-
503. ing for thyself to all Eternity, to which
504. thou art going in such career.'

505. I said : ' Perhaps you will be willing
506. to show me my eternal lot, and we
507. will contemplate together upon it, and
508. see whether your lot or mine is most
509. desirable.'*

510. So he took me through a stable, and
511. through a church, and down into the
512. church vault, at the end of v/hich was
513. a mill; through the mill we went, and
514. came to a cave; down the winding
515. cavern we groped our tedious way,
516. till a void boundless as a nether sky
517. appeared beneath us, and we held by





518. THE MARRIAGE OF

519. the roots of trees, and hung over this
520. immensity; but I said: 'If you please,
521. we will commit ourselves to this void,
522. and see whether Providence is here
523. also; if you will not, I will.' But he
524. answered : ' Do not presume, young
525. man; but as we here remain, behold
526. thy lot, which will soon appear when
527. the darkness passes away.'

528. So I remained with him sitting in
529. the twisted root of an oak; he was
530. suspended in a fungus, which hung
531. with the head downward into the
532. deep.

533. By degrees we beheld the infinite
534. abyss, fiery as the smoke of a burning
535. city; beneath us at an immense dis-
536. tance was the sun, black but shining;
537. round it were fiery tracks on which
538. revolved vast spiders, crawling after
539. their prey, which flew, or rather
540. swum, in the infinite deep, in the most





541. HEAVEN AND HELL

542. terrific shapes of animals sprung from
543. corruption; and the air was full of
544. them, and seemed composed of them.
545. These are Devils, and are called powers
546. of the air. I now asked my com-
547. panion which was my eternal lot.
548. He said: 'Between the black and
549. white spiders.''

550. But now, from between the black
551. and white spiders, a cloud and fire
552. burst and rolled through the deep,
553. blackening all beneath so that the
554. nether deep grew black as a sea, and
555. rolled with a terrible noise. Beneath
556. us was nothing now to be seen but a
557. black tempest, till looking East be-
558. tween the clouds and the waves, we
559. saw a cataract of blood mixed with
560. fire, and not many stones' throw from
561. us appeared and sunk again the scaly
562. fold of a monstrous serpent. At last
563. to the East, distant about three degrees,
564. appeared a fiery crest above the waves ;





565. THE MARRIAGE OF

566. slowly it reared like a ridge of golden
567. rocks, till we discovered two globes
568. of crimson fire, from which the sea
569. fled away in clouds of smoke; and
570. now we saw it was the head of Le-
571. viathan. His forehead was divided
572. into streaks of green and purple, like
573. those on a tiger's forehead; soon we
574. saw his mouth and red gills hang just
575. above the raging foam, tinging the
576. black deeps with beams of blood, ad-
577. vancing toward us with all the fury
578. of a spiritual existence.

579. My friend the Angel climbed up
580. from his station into the mill. I
581. remained alone, and then this ap-
582. pearance was no more; but I found
583. myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside
584. a river by moonlight, hearing a harper
585. who sung to the harp; and his theme
586. was: 'The man who never alters his
587. opinion is like standing water, and
588. breeds reptiles of the mind.'





589. HEAVEN AND HELL

590. But I arose, and sought for the
591. mill, and there I found my Angel,
592. who, surprised, asked me how I
593. escaped.

594. I answered: 'All that we saw was
595. owing to your metaphysics; for when
596. you ran away, I found myself on a
597. bank by moonlight, hearing a harper.
598. But now we have seen my eternal
599. lot, shall I show you yours?' He
600. laughed at my proposal; but I by
601. force suddenly caught him in my
602. arms, and flew Westerly through the
603. night, till we were elevated above the
604. earth's shadow; then I flung myself
605. with him directly into the body of the
606. sun; here I clothed myself in white,
607. and taking in my hand Swedenborg*s
608. volumes, sunk from the glorious clime,
609. and passed all the planets till we came
610. to Saturn. Here I stayed to rest, and
611. then leaped into the void between
612. Saturn and the fixed stars.





613. THE MARRIAGE OF

614. 'Here,' said I, 'is your lot; in this
615. space, if space it may be called.'
616. Soon we saw the stable and the church,
617. and I took him to the altar and opened
618. the Bible, and lo! it was a deep pit,
619. into which I descended, driving the
620. Angel before me. Soon we saw seven
621. houses of brick. One we entered. In
622. it were a number of monkeys, baboons,
623. and all of that species, chained by the
624. middle, grinning and snatching at one
625. another, but withheld by the shortness
626. of their chains. However, I saw that
627. they sometimes grew numerous, and
628. then the weak were caught by the
629. strong, and with a grinning aspect,
630. first coupled with and then devoured
631. by plucking off first one Umb and then
632. another till the body was left a help-
633. less trunk; this, after grinning and
634. kissing it with seeming fondness, they
635. devoured too. And here and there I
636. saw one savourily picking the fiesh off





637. HEAVEN AND HELL

638. his own tail. As the stench terribly
639. annoyed us both, we went into the
640. mill; and I in my hand brought the
641. skeleton of a body, which in the mill
642. was Aristotle's Analytics.

643. So the Angel said; 'Thy phantasy
644. has imposed upon me, and thou ought-
645. est to be ashamed.'

646. I answered: 'We impose on one
647. another, and it is but lost time to con-
648. verse with you whose works are only
649. Analytics.'*

650. 'I have always found that Angels
651. have the vanity to speak of them-
652. selves as the only wise; this they do
653. with a confident insolence sprouting
654. from systematic reasoning.

655. 'Thus Swedenborg boasts that what
656. he writes is new ; though it is only the
657. contents or index of already published
658. books.





659. THE MARRIAGE OF

660. 'A man carried a monkey about
661. for a show, and because he was a Uttle
662. wiser than the monkey, grew vain,
663. and conceived himself as much wiser
664. than seven men. It is so with
665. Swedenborg; he shows the folly of
666. churches, and exposes hypocrites, till
667. he imagines that all are religious, and
668. himself the single one on earth that
669. ever broke a net.

670. 'Now hear a plain fact: Sweden-
671. borg has not written one new truth.
672. Now hear another: he has written all
673. the old falsehoods.

674. 'And now hear the reason: he con-
675. versed with Angels who are all re-
676. ligious, and conversed not with Devils
677. who all hate reUgion, for he was
678. incapable through his conceited no-
679. tions.

680. 'Thus Swedenborg's writings are
681. a recapitulation of all superficial





682. HEAVEN AND HELL

683. opinions, and an analysis of the more
684. sublime, but no further.

685. 'Have now another plain fact: any
686. man of mechanical talents may from
687. the writings of Paracelsus or Jacob
688. Behmen produce ten thousand volumes
689. of equal value with Swedenborg's, and
690. from those of Dante or Shakespeare an
691. infinite number.

692. 'But when he has done this, let
693. him not say that he knows better than
694. his master, for he only holds a candle
695. in sunshine.'







696. THE MARRIAGE OF



697. A MEMORABLE FANCY

698. Once I saw a Devil in a flame of
699. fire, who arose before an Angel that
700. sat on a cloud, and the Devil uttered
701. these words: 'The worship of God is,
702. honouring His gifts in other men each
703. according to his genius, and loving
704. the greatest men best. Those who
705. envy or calumniate great men hate
706. God, for there is no other God.'

707. The Angel hearing this became
708. almost blue, but mastering himself he
709. grew yellow, and at last white-pink
710. and smiling, and then replied: 'Thou
711. idolater, is not God One? and is not
712. He visible in Jesus Christ? and has
713. not Jesus Christ given His sanction to
714. the law of ten commandments? and
715. are not all other men fools, sinners,
716. and nothings?'





717. HEAVEN AND HELL

718. The Devil answered: 'Bray a fool
719. in a mortar with wheat, yet shall not
720. his folly be beaten out of him. If
721. Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you
722. ought to love Him in the greatest
723. degree. Now hear how He has given
724. His sanction to the law of ten com-
725. mandments. Did He not mock at the
726. Sabbath, and so mock the Sabbath's
727. God? murder those who were mur-
728. dered because of Him? turn away the
729. law from the woman taken in adultery,
730. steal the labour of others to support
731. Him? bear false witness when He
732. omitted making a defence before
733. Pilate? covet when He prayed for His
734. disciples, and when He bid them
735. shake off the dust of their feet against
736. such as refused to lodge them? I tell
737. you, no virtue can exist without break-
738. ing these ten commandments. Jesus
739. was all virtue, and acted from im-
740. pulse, not from rules.'





741. THE MARRIAGE OF

742. When he had so spoken, I beheld
743. the Angel, who stretched out his arms
744. embracing the flame of fire, and he
745. was consumed, and arose as Elijah.

746. Note. — This Angel, who is now
747. become a Devil, is my particular
748. friend; we often read the Bible to-
749. gether in its infernal or diabolical
750. sense, which the world shall have if
751. they behave well.

752. I have also the Bible of Hell, which
753. the world shall have whether they
754. will or no.

755. One law for the lion and ox is Op-
756. pression.

758. A SONG OF LIBERTY

759. 1. The Eternal Female groan'd; it
760. was heard over all the earth:

761. 2. Albion's coast is sick silent; the
762. American meadows faint.

763. 3. Shadows of prophecy shiver
764. along by the lakes and the rivers, and
765. mutter across the ocean. France,
766. rend down thy dungeon!

767. 4. Golden Spain, burst the barriers
768. of old Rome !

769. 5. Cast thy keys, Rome, into
770. the deep — down falling, even to
771. eternity down falling;

772. 6. And weep!

773. 7. In her trembling hands she took

780. 9. Flagg'd with grey-browM snows
781. and thunderous visages, the jealous
782. wings wavM over the deep.

783. 10. The speary hand burn'd aloft;
784. unbuckled was the shield; forth went
785. the hand of jealousy among the flam-
786. ing hair, and hurl'd the new-born
787. wonder through the starry night.

788. 11. The fire, the fire is falling !

789. 12. Look up! look up! citizen
790. of London, enlarge thy countenance!
791. O Jew, leave counting gold; return to
792. thy oil and wine! African, black
793. African! (Go, winged thought, widen
794. his forehead.)

795. 13. The fiery limbs, the flaming hair
796. shot like the sinking sun into the
797. Western sea.

798. 14. WakM from his eternal sleep,
799. the hoary element roaring fled away.





800. HEAVEN AND HELL

801. 15. Down rush'd, beating his wings
802. in vain, the jealous king, his grey-
803. brow'd councillors, thunderous war-
804. riors, curl'd veterans, among helms
805. and shields, and chariots, horses, ele-
806. phants, banners, castles, slings, and
807. rocks.

808. 16. Falling, rushing, ruining;
809. buried in the ruins, on Urthona's
810. dens.

811. 17. All night beneath the ruins;
812. then their sullen flames, faded, emerge
813. round the gloomy king.

814. 18. With thunder and fire, leading
815. his starry hosts through the waste
816. wilderness, he promulgates his ten
817. commandments, glancing his beamy
818. eyelids over the deep in dark dismay.

819. 19. Where the Son of Fire in his

825. dust, loosing the eternal horses from
826. the dens of night, crying: 'Empire is
827. no more! and now the lion and wolf
828. shall cease.'







829. HEAVEN AND HELL



830. CHORUS

831. Let the Priests of the Raven of
832. Dawn, no longer in deadly black, with
833. hoarse note curse the Sons of Joy.
834. Nor his accepted brethren whom,
835. tyrant, he calls free, lay the bound or

838. but acts not !

839. For everything that lives is holy.
