1. TO my friend Butts I write
2. My first vision of light,
3. On the yellow sands sitting.
4. The sun was emitting
5. His glorious beams
6. From Heaven’s high streams.
7. Over sea, over land,
8. My eyes did expand
9. Into regions of air,
10. Away from all care;
11. Into regions of fire,
12. Remote from desire;
13. The light of the morning
14. Heaven’s mountains adorning:
15. In particles bright,
16. The jewels of light
17. Distinct shone and clear.
18. Amaz’d and in fear
19. I each particle gazèd,
20. Astonish’d, amazèd;
21. For each was a Man
22. Human-form’d. Swift I ran,
23. For they beckon’d to me,
24. Remote by the sea,
25. Saying: ‘Each grain of sand,
26. Every stone on the land,
27. Each rock and each hill,
28. Each fountain and rill,
29. Each herb and each tree,
30. Mountain, hill, earth, and sea,
31. Cloud, meteor, and star,
32. Are men seen afar.’
33. I stood in the streams
34. Of Heaven’s bright beams,
35. And saw Felpham sweet
36. Beneath my bright feet,
37. In soft Female charms;
38. And in her fair arms
39. My Shadow I knew,
40. And my wife’s Shadow too,
41. And my sister, and friend.
42. We like infants descend
43. In our Shadows on earth,
44. Like a weak mortal birth.
45. My eyes, more and more,
46. Like a sea without shore,
47. Continue expanding,
48. The Heavens commanding;
49. Till the jewels of light,
50. Heavenly men beaming bright,
51. Appear’d as One Man,
52. Who complacent began
53. My limbs to enfold
54. In His beams of bright gold;
55. Like dross purg’d away
56. All my mire and my clay.
57. Soft consum’d in delight,
58. In His bosom sun-bright
59. I remain’d. Soft He smil’d,
60. And I heard His voice mild,
61. Saying: ‘This is My fold,
62. O thou ram horn’d with gold,
63. Who awakest from sleep
64. On the sides of the deep.
65. On the mountains around
66. The roarings resound
67. Of the lion and wolf,
68. The loud sea, and deep gulf.
69. These are guards of My fold,
70. O thou ram horn’d with gold!’
71. And the voice faded mild;
72. I remain’d as a child;
73. All I ever had known
74. Before me bright shone:
75. I saw you and your wife
76. By the fountains of life.
77. Such the vision to me
78. Appear’d on the sea.
