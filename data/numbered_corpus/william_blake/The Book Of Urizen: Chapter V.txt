1. 1. In terrors Los shrunk from his task:
2. His great hammer fell from his hand:
3. His fires beheld, and sickening,
4. Hid their strong limbs in smoke.
5. For with noises ruinous loud;
6. With hurtlings & clashings & groans
7. The Immortal endur'd his chains,
8. Tho' bound in a deadly sleep.

9. 2. All the myriads of Eternity:
10. All the wisdom & joy of life:
11. Roll like a sea around him,
12. Except what his little orbs
13. Of sight by degrees unfold.

14. 3. And now his eternal life
15. Like a dream was obliterated

16. 4. Shudd'ring, the Eternal Prophet smote
17. With a stroke, from his north to south region
18. The bellows & hammer are silent now
19. A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice
20. Siez'd; a cold solitude & dark void
21. The Eternal Prophet & Urizen clos'd

22. 5. Ages on ages rolld over them
23. Cut off from life & light frozen
24. Into horrible forms of deformity
25. Los suffer'd his fires to decay
26. Then he look'd back with anxious desire
27. But the space undivided by existence
28. Struck horror into his soul.

29. 6. Los wept obscur'd with mourning:
30. His bosom earthquak'd with sighs;
31. He saw Urizen deadly black,
32. In his chains bound, & Pity began,

33. 7. In anguish dividing & dividing
34. For pity divides the soul
35. In pangs eternity on eternity
36. Life in cataracts pourd down his cliffs
37. The void shrunk the lymph into Nerves
38. Wand'ring wide on the bosom of night
39. And left a round globe of blood
40. Trembling upon the Void
41. Thus the Eternal Prophet was divided
42. Before the death-image of Urizen
43. For in changeable clouds and darkness
44. In a winterly night beneath,
45. The Abyss of Los stretch'd immense:
46. And now seen, now obscur'd, to the eyes
47. Of Eternals, the visions remote
48. Of the dark seperation appear'd.
49. As glasses discover Worlds
50. In the endless Abyss of space,
51. So the expanding eyes of Immortals
52. Beheld the dark visions of Los,
53. And the globe of life blood trembling

54. 8. The globe of life blood trembled
55. Branching out into roots;
56. Fib'rous, writhing upon the winds;
57. Fibres of blood, milk and tears;
58. In pangs, eternity on eternity.
59. At length in tears & cries imbodied
60. A female form trembling and pale
61. Waves before his deathy face

62. 9. All Eternity shudderd at sight
63. Of the first female now separate
64. Pale as a cloud of snow
65. Waving before the face of Los

66. 10. Wonder, awe, fear, astonishment,
67. Petrify the eternal myriads;
68. At the first female form now separate
69. They call'd her Pity, and fled

70. 11. "Spread a Tent, with strong curtains around them
71. "Let cords & stakes bind in the Void
72. That Eternals may no more behold them"

73. 12. They began to weave curtains of darkness
74. They erected large pillars round the Void
75. With golden hooks fastend in the pillars
76. With infinite labour the Eternals
77. A woof wove, and called it Science
