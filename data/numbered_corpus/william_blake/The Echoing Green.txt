1. The sun does arise,
2. And make happy the skies;
3. The merry bells ring
4. To welcome the spring;
5. The skylark and thrush,
6. The birds of the bush,
7. Sing louder around
8. To the bell's cheerful sound,
9. While our sports shall be seen
10. On the Echoing Green.

11. Old John with white hair,
12. Does laugh away care,
13. Sitting under the oak,
14. Among the old folk.
15. They laugh at our play,
16. And soon they all say:
17. 'Such, such were the joys
18. When we all, girls and boys,
19. In our youth time were seen
20. On the Echoing Green.'

21. Till the little ones, weary,
22. No more can be merry;
23. The sun does descend,
24. And our sports have an end.
25. Round the laps of their mothers
26. Many sisters and brother,
27. Like birds in their nest,
28. Are ready for rest,
29. And sport no more seen
30. On the darkening Green.
