1. Whate'er is Born of Mortal Birth
2. Must be consumed with the Earth
3. To rise from Generation free:
4. Then what have I to do with thee?
5. The Sexes sprung from Shame & Pride,
6. Blow'd in the morn, in evening died;
7. But Mercy chang'd Death into Sleep;
8. The Sexes rose to work & weep.

9. Thou, Mother of my Mortal part,
10. With cruelty didst mould my Heart,
11. And with false self-deceiving tears
12. Didst bind my Nostrils, Eyes, & Ears:

13. Didst close my Tongue in senseless clay,
14. And me to Mortal Life betray.
15. The Death of Jesus set me free:
16. Then what have I to do with thee?
