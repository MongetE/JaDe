2. 1. Los smitten with astonishment
3. Frightend at the hurtling bones

4. 2. And at the surging sulphureous
5. Perturbed Immortal mad raging

6. 3. In whirlwinds & pitch & nitre
7. Round the furious limbs of Los

8. 4. And Los formed nets & gins
9. And threw the nets round about

10. 5. He watch'd in shuddring fear
11. The dark changes & bound every change
12. With rivets of iron & brass;

13. 6. And these were the changes of Urizen.

15. 1. Ages on ages roll'd over him!
16. In stony sleep ages roll'd over him!
17. Like a dark waste stretching chang'able
18. By earthquakes riv'n, belching sullen fires
19. On ages roll'd ages in ghastly
20. Sick torment; around him in whirlwinds
21. Of darkness the eternal Prophet howl'd
22. Beating still on his rivets of iron
23. Pouring sodor of iron; dividing
24. The horrible night into watches.

25. 2. And Urizen (so his eternal name)
26. His prolific delight obscurd more & more
27. In dark secresy hiding in surgeing
28. Sulphureous fluid his phantasies.
29. The Eternal Prophet heavd the dark bellows,
30. And turn'd restless the tongs; and the hammer
31. Incessant beat; forging chains new & new
32. Numb'ring with links. hours, days & years

33. 3. The eternal mind bounded began to roll
34. Eddies of wrath ceaseless round & round,
35. And the sulphureous foam surgeing thick
36. Settled, a lake, bright, & shining clear:
37. White as the snow on the mountains cold.

38. 4. Forgetfulness, dumbness, necessity!
39. In chains of the mind locked up,
40. Like fetters of ice shrinking together
41. Disorganiz'd, rent from Eternity,
42. Los beat on his fetters of iron;
43. And heated his furnaces & pour'd
44. Iron sodor and sodor of brass

45. 5. Restless turnd the immortal inchain'd
46. Heaving dolorous! anguish'd! unbearable
47. Till a roof shaggy wild inclos'd
48. In an orb, his fountain of thought.

49. 6. In a horrible dreamful slumber;
50. Like the linked infernal chain;
51. A vast Spine writh'd in torment
52. Upon the winds; shooting pain'd
53. Ribs, like a bending cavern
54. And bones of solidness, froze
55. Over all his nerves of joy.
56. And a first Age passed over,
57. And a state of dismal woe.
58. 7. From the caverns of his jointed Spine,
59. Down sunk with fright a red
60. Round globe hot burning deep
61. Deep down into the Abyss:
62. Panting: Conglobing, Trembling
63. Shooting out ten thousand branches
64. Around his solid bones.
65. And a second Age passed over,
66. And a state of dismal woe.
67. 8. In harrowing fear rolling round;
68. His nervous brain shot branches
69. Round the branches of his heart.
70. On high into two little orbs
71. And fixed in two little caves
72. Hiding carefully from the wind,
73. His Eyes beheld the deep,
74. And a third Age passed over:
75. And a state of dismal woe.
76. 9. The pangs of hope began,
77. In heavy pain striving, struggling.
78. Two Ears in close volutions.
79. From beneath his orbs of vision
80. Shot spiring out and petrified
81. As they grew. And a fourth Age passed
82. And a state of dismal woe.
83. 10. In ghastly torment sick;
84. Hanging upon the wind;
85. Two Nostrils bent down to the deep.
86. And a fifth Age passed over;
87. And a state of dismal woe.
88. 11. In ghastly torment sick;
89. Within his ribs bloated round,
90. A craving Hungry Cavern;
91. Thence arose his channeld Throat,
92. And like a red flame a Tongue
93. Of thirst & of hunger appeard.
94. And a sixth Age passed over:
95. And a state of dismal woe.
96. 12. Enraged & stifled with torment
97. He threw his right Arm to the north
98. His left Arm to the south
99. Shooting out in anguish deep,
100. And his Feet stampd the nether Abyss
101. In trembling & howling & dismay.
102. And a seventh Age passed over:
103. And a state of dismal woe.
