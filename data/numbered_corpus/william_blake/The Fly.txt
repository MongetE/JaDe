1. Little Fly,
2. Thy summer's play
3. My thoughtless hand
4. Has brushed away.

5. Am not I
6. A fly like thee?
7. Or art not thou
8. A man like me?

9. For I dance
10. And drink, and sing,
11. Till some blind hand
12. Shall brush my wing.

13. If thought is life
14. And strength and breath
15. And the want
16. Of thought is death;

17. Then am I
18. A happy fly,
19. If I live,
20. Or if I die.
