1. I rose up at the dawn of day--
2. `Get thee away! get thee away!
3. Pray'st thou for riches? Away! away!
4. This is the Throne of Mammon grey.'

5. Said I: This, sure, is very odd;
6. I took it to be the Throne of God.
7. For everything besides I have:
8. It is only for riches that I can crave.

9. I have mental joy, and mental health,
10. And mental friends, and mental wealth;
11. I've a wife I love, and that loves me;
12. I've all but riches bodily.

13. I am in God's presence night and day,
14. And He never turns His face away;
15. The accuser of sins by my side doth stand,
16. And he holds my money-bag in his hand.

17. For my worldly things God makes him pay,
18. And he'd pay for more if to him I would pray;
19. And so you may do the worst you can do;
20. Be assur'd, Mr. Devil, I won't pray to you.

21. Then if for riches I must not pray,
22. God knows, I little of prayers need say;
23. So, as a church is known by its steeple,
24. If I pray it must be for other people.

25. He says, if I do not worship him for a God,
26. I shall eat coarser food, and go worse shod;
27. So, as I don't value such things as these,
28. You must do, Mr. Devil, just as God please.
