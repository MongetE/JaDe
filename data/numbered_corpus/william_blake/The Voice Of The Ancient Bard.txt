1. Youth of delight, come hither,
2. And see the opening morn,
3. Image of truth new born.
4. Doubt is fled, & clouds of reason,
5. Dark disputes & artful teazing.
6. Folly is an endless maze,
7. Tangled roots perplex her ways.
8. How many have fallen there!
9. They stumble all night over bones of the dead,
10. And feel they know not what but care,
11. And wish to lead others, when they should be led.
