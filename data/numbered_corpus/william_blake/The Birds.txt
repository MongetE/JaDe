1. He. Where thou dwellest, in what grove,
2. Tell me Fair One, tell me Love;
3. Where thou thy charming nest dost build,
4. O thou pride of every field!
5. She. Yonder stands a lonely tree,
6. There I live and mourn for thee;
7. Morning drinks my silent tear,
8. And evening winds my sorrow bear.

9. He. O thou summer's harmony,
10. I have liv'd and mourn'd for thee;
11. Each day I mourn along the wood,
12. And night hath heard my sorrows loud.

13. She. Dost thou truly long for me?
14. And am I thus sweet to thee?
15. Sorrow now is at an end,
16. O my Lover and my Friend!

17. He. Come, on wings of joy we'll fly
18. To where my bower hangs on high;
19. Come, and make thy calm retreat
20. Among green leaves and blossoms sweet.
