1. A flower was offered to me,
2. Such a flower as May never bore;
3. But I said 'I've a pretty rose tree,'
4. And I passed the sweet flower o'er.

5. Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
6. To tend her by day and by night;
7. But my rose turned away with jealousy,
8. And her thorns were my only delight.
