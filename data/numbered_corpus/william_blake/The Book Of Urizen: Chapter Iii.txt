1. 1. The voice ended, they saw his pale visage
2. Emerge from the darkness; his hand
3. On the rock of eternity unclasping
4. The Book of brass. Rage siez'd the strong

5. 2. Rage, fury, intense indignation
6. In cataracts of fire blood & gall
7. In whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke:
8. And enormous forms of energy;
9. All the seven deadly sins of the soul
10. In living creations appear'd
11. In the flames of eternal fury.

12. 3. Sund'ring, dark'ning, thund'ring!
13. Rent away with a terrible crash
14. Eternity roll'd wide apart
15. Wide asunder rolling
16. Mountainous all around
17. Departing; departing; departing:
18. Leaving ruinous fragments of life
19. Hanging frowning cliffs & all between
20. An ocean of voidness unfathomable.

21. 4. The roaring fires ran o'er the heav'ns
22. In whirlwinds & cataracts of blood
23. And o'er the dark desarts of Urizen
24. Fires pour thro' the void on all sides
25. On Urizens self-begotten armies.

26. 5. But no light from the fires. all was darkness
27. In the flames of Eternal fury

28. 6. In fierce anguish & quenchless flames
29. To the desarts and rocks He ran raging
30. To hide, but He could not: combining
31. He dug mountains & hills in vast strength,
32. He piled them in incessant labour,
33. In howlings & pangs & fierce madness
34. Long periods in burning fires labouring
35. Till hoary, and age-broke, and aged,
36. In despair and the shadows of death.

37. 7. And a roof, vast petrific around,
38. On all sides He fram'd: like a womb;
39. Where thousands of rivers in veins
40. Of blood pour down the mountains to cool
41. The eternal fires beating without
42. From Eternals; & like a black globe
43. View'd by sons of Eternity, standing
44. On the shore of the infinite ocean
45. Like a human heart strugling & beating
46. The vast world of Urizen appear'd.

47. 8. And Los round the dark globe of Urizen,
48. Kept watch for Eternals to confine,
49. The obscure separation alone;
50. For Eternity stood wide apart,
51. As the stars are apart from the earth

52. 9. Los wept howling around the dark Demon:
53. And cursing his lot; for in anguish,
54. Urizen was rent from his side;
55. And a fathomless void for his feet;
56. And intense fires for his dwelling.

57. 10. But Urizen laid in a stony sleep
58. Unorganiz'd, rent from Eternity

59. 11. The Eternals said: What is this? Death
60. Urizen is a clod of clay.

61. 12. Los howld in a dismal stupor,
62. Groaning! gnashing! groaning!
63. Till the wrenching apart was healed

64. 13. But the wrenching of Urizen heal'd not
65. Cold, featureless, flesh or clay,
66. Rifted with direful changes
67. He lay in a dreamless night

68. 14. Till Los rouz'd his fires, affrighted
69. At the formless unmeasurable death.
