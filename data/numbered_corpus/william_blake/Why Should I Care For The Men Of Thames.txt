1. Why should I care for the men of thames
2. Or the cheating waves of charter'd streams
3. Or shrink at the little blasts of fear
4. That the hireling blows into my ear

5. Tho born on the cheating banks of Thames
6. Tho his waters bathed my infant limbs
7. The Ohio shall wash his stains from me
8. I was born a slave but I go to be free.
