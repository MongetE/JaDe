1. O Autumn, laden with fruit, and stain√®d
2. With the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit
3. Beneath my shady roof; there thou may'st rest,
4. And tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe,
5. And all the daughters of the year shall dance!
6. Sing now the lusty song of fruits and flowers.
7. `The narrow bud opens her beauties to
8. The sun, and love runs in her thrilling veins;
9. Blossoms hang round the brows of Morning, and
10. Flourish down the bright cheek of modest Eve,
11. Till clust'ring Summer breaks forth into singing,
12. And feather'd clouds strew flowers round her head.

13. `The spirits of the air live on the smells
14. Of fruit; and Joy, with pinions light, roves round
15. The gardens, or sits singing in the trees.'
16. Thus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat;
17. Then rose, girded himself, and o'er the bleak
18. Hills fled from our sight; but left his golden load.
