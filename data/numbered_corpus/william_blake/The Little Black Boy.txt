1. My mother bore me in the southern wild,
2. And I  am black, but oh my soul is white!
3. White as an angel is the English child,
4. But I am black, as if bereaved of light.

5. My mother taught me underneath a tree,
6. And, sitting down before the heat of day,
7. She took me on her lap and kissed me,
8. And, pointed to the east, began to say:

9. 'Look on the rising sun: there God does live,
10. And gives His light, and gives His heat away,
11. And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
12. Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.

13. 'And we are put on earth a little space,
14. That we may learn to bear the beams of love
15. And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
16. Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.

17. 'For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,
18. The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,
19. Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care
20. And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice','

21. Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;
22. And thus I say to little English boy.
23. When I from black and he from white cloud free,
24. And round the tent of God like lambs we joy

25. I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
26. To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
27. And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,
28. And be like him, and he will then love me.
