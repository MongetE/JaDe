1. 1. But Los saw the Female & pitied
2. He embrac'd her, she wept, she refus'd
3. In perverse and cruel delight
4. She fled from his arms, yet he followd

5. 2. Eternity shudder'd when they saw,
6. Man begetting his likeness,
7. On his own divided image.

8. 3. A time passed over, the Eternals
9. Began to erect the tent;
10. When Enitharmon sick,
11. Felt a Worm within her womb.

12. 4. Yet helpless it lay like a Worm
13. In the trembling womb
14. To be moulded into existence

15. 5. All day the worm lay on her bosom
16. All night within her womb
17. The worm lay till it grew to a serpent
18. With dolorous hissings & poisons
19. Round Enitharmons loins folding,

20. 6. Coild within Enitharmons womb
21. The serpent grew casting its scales,
22. With sharp pangs the hissings began
23. To change to a grating cry,
24. Many sorrows and dismal throes,
25. Many forms of fish, bird & beast,
26. Brought forth an Infant form
27. Where was a worm before.

28. 7. The Eternals their tent finished
29. Alarm'd with these gloomy visions
30. When Enitharmon groaning
31. Produc'd a man Child to the light.

32. 8. A shriek ran thro' Eternity:
33. And a paralytic stroke;
34. At the birth of the Human shadow.

35. 9. Delving earth in his resistless way;
36. Howling, the Child with fierce flames
37. Issu'd from Enitharmon.

38. 10. The Eternals, closed the tent
39. They beat down the stakes the cords
40. Stretch'd for a work of eternity;
41. No more Los beheld Eternity.

42. 11. In his hands he seiz'd the infant
43. He bathed him in springs of sorrow
44. He gave him to Enitharmon.
