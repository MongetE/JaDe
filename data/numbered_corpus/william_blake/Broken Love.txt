1. MY Spectre around me night and day
2. Like a wild beast guards my way;
3. My Emanation far within
4. Weeps incessantly for my sin.

5. ‘A fathomless and boundless deep,
6. There we wander, there we weep;
7. On the hungry craving wind
8. My Spectre follows thee behind.

9. ‘He scents thy footsteps in the snow
10. Wheresoever thou dost go,
11. Thro’ the wintry hail and rain.
12. When wilt thou return again?

13. ’Dost thou not in pride and scorn
14. Fill with tempests all my morn,
15. And with jealousies and fears
16. Fill my pleasant nights with tears?

17. ‘Seven of my sweet loves thy knife
18. Has bereavèd of their life.
19. Their marble tombs I built with tears,
20. And with cold and shuddering fears.

21. ‘Seven more loves weep night and day
22. Round the tombs where my loves lay,
23. And seven more loves attend each night
24. Around my couch with torches bright.

25. ‘And seven more loves in my bed
26. Crown with wine my mournful head,
27. Pitying and forgiving all
28. Thy transgressions great and small.

29. ‘When wilt thou return and view
30. My loves, and them to life renew?
31. When wilt thou return and live?
32. When wilt thou pity as I forgive?’

33. ‘O’er my sins thou sit and moan:
34. Hast thou no sins of thy own?
35. O’er my sins thou sit and weep,
36. And lull thy own sins fast asleep.

37. ‘What transgressions I commit
38. Are for thy transgressions fit.
39. They thy harlots, thou their slave;
40. And my bed becomes their grave.

41. ‘Never, never, I return:
42. Still for victory I burn.
43. Living, thee alone I’ll have;
44. And when dead I’ll be thy grave.

45. ‘Thro’ the Heaven and Earth and Hell
46. Thou shalt never, quell:
47. I will fly and thou pursue:
48. Night and morn the flight renew.’

49. ‘Poor, pale, pitiable form
50. That I follow in a storm;
51. Iron tears and groans of lead
52. Bind around my aching head.

53. ‘Till I turn from Female love
54. And root up the Infernal Grove,
55. I shall never worthy be
56. To step into Eternity.

57. ‘And, to end thy cruel mocks,
58. Annihilate thee on the rocks,
59. And another form create
60. To be subservient to my fate.

61. ‘Let us agree to give up love,
62. And root up the Infernal Grove;
63. Then shall we return and see
64. The worlds of happy Eternity.

65. ‘And throughout all Eternity
66. I forgive you, you forgive me.
67. As our dear Redeemer said:
68. “This the Wine, and this the Bread.”’
