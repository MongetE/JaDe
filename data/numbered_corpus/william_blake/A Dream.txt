1. Once a dream did weave a shade
2. O'er my angel-guarded bed,
3. That an emmet lost its way
4. Where on grass methought I lay.

5. Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
6. Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
7. Over many a tangle spray,
8. All heart-broke, I heard her say:

9. 'Oh my children! do they cry,
10. Do they hear their father sigh?
11. Now they look abroad to see,
12. Now return and weep for me.'

13. Pitying, I dropped a tear:
14. But I saw a glow-worm near,
15. Who replied, 'What wailing wight
16. Calls the watchman of the night?

17. 'I am set to light the ground,
18. While the beetle goes his round:
19. Follow now the beetle's hum;
20. Little wanderer, hie thee home! '
