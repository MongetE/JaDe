1. The little boy lost in the lonely fen,
2. Led by the wandering light,
3. Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,
4. Appeared like his father, in white.

5. He kissed the child, and by the hand led,
6. And to his mother brought,
7. Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,
8. The little boy weeping sought.
