1. AFRICA

2. I will sing you a song of Los. the Eternal Prophet:
3. He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity.
4. In heart-formed Africa.
5. Urizen faded! Ariston shudderd!
6. And thus the Song began

7. Adam stood in the garden of Eden:
8. And Noah on the mountains of Ararat;
9. They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations
10. By the hands of the children of Los.

11. Adam shudderd! Noah faded! black grew the sunny African
12. When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East:
13. (Night spoke to the Cloud!
14. Lo these Human form'd spirits in smiling hipocrisy. War
15. Against one another; so let them War on; slaves to the eternal Elements)
16. Noah shrunk, beneath the waters;
17. Abram fled in fires from Chaldea;
18. Moses beheld upon Mount Sinai forms of dark delusion:

19. To Trismegistus. Palamabron gave an abstract Law:
20. To Pythagoras Socrates & Plato.

21. Times rolled on o'er all the sons of Har, time after time
22. Orc on Mount Atlas howld, chain'd down with the Chain of Jealousy
23. Then Oothoon hoverd over Judah & Jerusalem
24. And Jesus heard her voice (a man of sorrows) he recievd
25. A Gospel from wretched Theotormon.

26. The human race began to wither, for the healthy built
27. Secluded places, fearing the joys of Love
28. And the disease'd only propagated:
29. So Antamon call'd up Leutha from her valleys of delight:
30. And to Mahomet a loose Bible gave.
31. But in the North, to Odin, Sotha gave a Code of War,
32. Because of Diralada thinking to reclaim his joy.

33. These were the Churches: Hospitals: Castles: Palaces:
34. Like nets & gins & traps to catch the joys of Eternity
35. And all the rest a desart;
36. Till like a dream Eternity was obliterated & erased.

37. Since that dread day when Har and Heva fled.
38. Because their brethren & sisters liv'd in War & Lust;
39. And as they fled they shrunk
40. Into two narrow doleful forms:
41. Creeping in reptile flesh upon
42. The bosom of the ground:
43. And all the vast of Nature shrunk
44. Before their shrunken eyes.

45. Thus the terrible race of Los & Enitharmon gave
46. Laws & Religions to the sons of Har binding them more
47. And more to Earth: closing and restraining:
48. Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete
49. Urizen wept & gave it into the hands of Newton & Locke

50. Clouds roll heavy upon the Alps round Rousseau & Voltaire:
51. And on the mountains of Lebanon round the deceased Gods
52. Of Asia; & on the deserts of Africa round the Fallen Angels
53. The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent


54. ASIA

55. The Kings of Asia heard
56. The howl rise up from Europe!
57. And each ran out from his Web;
58. From his ancient woven Den;
59. For the darkness of Asia was startled
60. At the thick-flaming, thought-creating fires of Orc.

61. And the Kings of Asia stood
62. And cried in bitterness of soul.

63. Shall not the King call for Famine from the heath?
64. Nor the Priest, for Pestilence from the fen?
65. To restrain! to dismay! to thin!
66. The inhabitants of mountain and plain;
67. In the day, of full-feeding prosperity;
68. And the night of delicious songs.

69. Shall not the Councellor throw his curb
70. Of Poverty on the laborious?
71. To fix the price of labour;
72. To invent allegoric riches:

73. And the privy admonishers of men
74. Call for fires in the City
75. For heaps of smoking ruins,
76. In the night of prosperity & wantonness

77. To turn man from his path,
78. To restrain the child from the womb,

79. To cut off the bread from the city,
80. That the remnant may learn to obey.
81. That the pride of the heart may fail;
82. That the lust of the eyes may be quench'd:
83. That the delicate ear in its infancy

84. May be dull'd; and the nostrils clos'd up;
85. To teach mortal worms the path
86. That leads from the gates of the Grave.

87. Urizen heard them cry!
88. And his shudd'ring waving wings
89. Went enormous above the red flames
90. Drawing clouds of despair thro' the heavens
91. Of Europe as he went:
92. And his Books of brass iron & gold
93. Melted over the land as he flew,

94. Heavy-waving, howling, weeping.

95. And he stood over Judea:
96. And stay'd in his ancient place:
97. And stretch'd his clouds over Jerusalem;

98. For Adam, a mouldering skeleton
99. Lay bleach'd on the garden of Eden;
100. And Noah as white as snow
101. On the mountains of Ararat.

102. Then the thunders of Urizen bellow'd aloud
103. From his woven darkness above.

104. Orc raging in European darkness
105. Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps
106. Like a serpent of fiery flame!
107. The sullen Earth
108. Shrunk!

109. Forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones
110. Join: shaking convuls'd the shivring clay breathes
111. And all flesh naked stands: Fathers and Friends;
112. Mothers Kings & Warriors:

113. The Grave shrieks with delight, & shakes
114. Her hollow womb, & clasps the solid stem:
115. Her bosom swells with wild desire:
116. And milk & blood & glandous wine.
