1. Sleep, sleep, beauty bright,
2. Dreaming in the joys of night;
3. Sleep, sleep; in thy sleep
4. Little sorrows sit and weep.

5. Sweet babe, in thy face
6. Soft desires I can trace,
7. Secret joys and secret smiles,
8. Little pretty infant wiles.

9. As thy softest limbs I feel
10. Smiles as of the morning steal
11. O'er thy cheek, and o'er thy breast
12. Where thy little heart doth rest.

13. O the cunning wiles that creep
14. In thy little heart asleep!
15. When thy little heart doth wake,
16. Then the dreadful night shall break.
