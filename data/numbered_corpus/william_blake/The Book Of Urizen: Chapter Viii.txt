1. 1. Urizen explor'd his dens
2. Mountain, moor, & wilderness,
3. With a globe of fire lighting his journey
4. A fearful journey, annoy'd
5. By cruel enormities: forms
6. Of life on his forsaken mountains

7. 2. And his world teemd vast enormities
8. Frightning; faithless; fawning
9. Portions of life; similitudes
10. Of a foot, or a hand, or a head
11. Or a heart, or an eye, they swam mischevous
12. Dread terrors! delighting in blood

13. 3. Most Urizen sicken'd to see
14. His eternal creations appear
15. Sons & daughters of sorrow on mountains
16. Weeping! wailing! first Thiriel appear'd
17. Astonish'd at his own existence
18. Like a man from a cloud born, & Utha
19. From the waters emerging, laments!
20. Grodna rent the deep earth howling
21. Amaz'd! his heavens immense cracks
22. Like the ground parch'd with heat; then Fuzon
23. Flam'd out! first begotten, last born.
24. All his eternal sons in like manner
25. His daughters from green herbs & cattle
26. From monsters, & worms of the pit.

27. 4. He in darkness clos'd, view'd all his race,
28. And his soul sicken'd! he curs'd
29. Both sons for he saw
30. That no flesh nor spirit could keep
31. His iron laws one moment.

32. 5. For he saw that life liv'd upon death
33. The Ox in the slaughter house moans
34. The Dog at the wintry door
35. And he wept, & he called it Pity
36. And his tears flowed down on the winds

37. 6. Cold he wander'd on high, over their cities
38. In weeping & pain & woe!
39. And where-ever he wanderd in sorrows
40. Upon the aged heavens
41. A cold shadow follow'd behind him
42. Like a spiders web, moist, cold, & dim
43. Drawing out from his sorrowing soul
44. The dungeon-like heaven dividing.
45. Where ever the footsteps of Urizen
46. Walk'd over the cities in sorrow.

47. 7. Till a Web dark & cold, throughout all
48. The tormented element stretch'd
49. From the sorrows of Urizens soul
50. And the Web is a Female in embrio
51. None could break the Web, no wings of fire.

52. 8. So twisted the cords, & so knotted
53. The meshes: twisted like to the human brain

54. 9. And all calld it, The Net of Religion
