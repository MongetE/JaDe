1. My silks and fine array,
2. My smiles and languish'd air,
3. By love are driv'n away;
4. And mournful lean Despair
5. Brings me yew to deck my grave;
6. Such end true lovers have.

7. His face is fair as heav'n
8. When springing buds unfold;
9. O why to him was't giv'n
10. Whose heart is wintry cold?
11. His breast is love's all-worshipp'd tomb,
12. Where all love's pilgrims come.

13. Bring me an axe and spade,
14. Bring me a winding sheet;
15. When I my grave have made
16. Let winds and tempests beat:
17. Then down I'll lie as cold as clay.
18. True love doth pass away!
