1. Sleep! sleep! beauty bright,
2. Dreaming o'er the joys of night;
3. Sleep! sleep! in thy sleep
4. Little sorrows sit and weep.

5. Sweet Babe, in thy face
6. Soft desires I can trace,
7. Secret joys and secret smiles,
8. Little pretty infant wiles.

9. As thy softest limbs I feel,
10. Smiles as of the morning steal
11. O'er thy cheek, and o'er thy breast
12. Where thy little heart does rest.

13. O! the cunning wiles that creep
14. In thy little heart asleep.
15. When thy little heart does wake
16. Then the dreadful lightnings break,

17. From thy cheek and from thy eye,
18. O'er the youthful harvests nigh.
19. Infant wiles and infant smiles
20. Heaven and Earth of peace beguiles.
