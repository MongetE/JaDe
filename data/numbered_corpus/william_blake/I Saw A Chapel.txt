1. I saw a chapel all of gold
2. That none did dare to enter in,
3. And many weeping stood without,
4. Weeping, mourning, worshipping.

5. I saw a serpent rise between
6. The white pillars of the door,
7. And he forc'd and forc'd and forc'd,
8. Down the golden hinges tore.

9. And along the pavement sweet,
10. Set with pearls and rubies bright,
11. All his slimy length he drew
12. Till upon the altar white

13. Vomiting his poison out
14. On the bread and on the wine.
15. So I turn'd into a sty
16. And laid me down among the swine.
