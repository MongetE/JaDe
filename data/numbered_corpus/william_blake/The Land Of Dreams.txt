1. Awake, awake, my little boy!
2. Thou wast thy mother's only joy;
3. Why dost thou weep in thy gentle sleep?
4. Awake! thy father does thee keep.

5. 'O, what land is the Land of Dreams?
6. What are its mountains, and what are its streams?
7. O father! I saw my mother there,
8. Among the lilies by waters fair.

9. 'Among the lambs, cloth? d in white,
10. She walk'd with her Thomas in sweet delight.
11. I wept for joy, like a dove I mourn;
12. O! when shall I again return? '

13. Dear child, I also by pleasant streams
14. Have wander'd all night in the Land of Dreams;
15. But tho' calm and warm the waters wide,
16. I could not get to the other side.

17. 'Father, O father! what do we here
18. In this land of unbelief and fear?
19. The Land of Dreams is better far
20. Above the light of the morning star.'
