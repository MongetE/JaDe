1. I wandered through each chartered street,
2. Near where the chartered Thames does flow,
3. A mark in every face I meet,
4. Marks of weakness, marks of woe.

5. In every cry of every man,
6. In every infant's cry of fear,
7. In every voice, in every ban,
8. The mind-forged manacles I hear:

9. How the chimney-sweeper's cry
10. Every blackening church appals,
11. And the hapless soldier's sigh
12. Runs in blood down palace-walls.

13. But most, through midnight streets I hear
14. How the youthful harlot's curse
15. Blasts the new-born infant's tear,
16. And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse.
