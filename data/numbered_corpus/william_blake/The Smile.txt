1. There is a Smile of Love
2. And there is a Smile of Deceit
3. And there is a Smile of Smiles
4. In which these two Smiles meet

5. And there is a Frown of Hate
6. And there is a Frown of disdain
7. And there is a Frown of Frowns
8. Which you strive to forget in vain

9. For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core
10. And it sticks in the deep Back bone
11. And no Smile that ever was smild
12. But only one Smile alone

13. That betwixt the Cradle & Grave
14. It only once Smild can be
15. But when it once is Smild
16. Theres an end to all Misery
