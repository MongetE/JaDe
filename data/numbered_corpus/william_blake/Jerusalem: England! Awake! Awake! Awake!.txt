1. England! awake! awake! awake!
2. Jerusalem thy Sister calls!
3. Why wilt thou sleep the sleep of death
4. And close her from thy ancient walls?

5. Thy hills and valleys felt her feet
6. Gently upon their bosoms move:
7. Thy gates beheld sweet Zion's ways:
8. Then was a time of joy and love.

9. And now the time returns again:
10. Our souls exult, and London's towers
11. Receive the Lamb of God to dwell
12. In England's green and pleasant bowers.
