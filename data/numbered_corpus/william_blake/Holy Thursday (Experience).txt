1. Is this a holy thing to see.
2. In a rich and fruitful land.
3. Babes reduced to misery.
4. Fed with cold and usurous hand?

5. Is that trembling cry a song?
6. Can it be a song of joy?
7. And so many children poor?
8. It is a land of poverty!

9. And their sun does never shine.
10. And their fields are bleak & bare.
11. And their ways are fill'd with thorns
12. It is eternal winter there.

13. For where-e'er the sun does shine.
14. And where-e'er the rain does fall:
15. Babe can never hunger there,
16. Nor poverty the mind appall.
