1. i

2. My spectre around me night and day
3. Like a wild beast guards my way;
4. My Emanation far within
5. Weeps incessantly for my sin.

6. ii

7. `A fathomless and boundless deep,
8. There we wander, there we weep;
9. On the hungry craving wind
10. My Spectre follows thee behind.

11. iii

12. `He scents thy footsteps in the snow,
13. Wheresoever thou dost go,
14. Thro' the wintry hail and rain.
15. When wilt thou return again?

16. iv

17. `Dost thou not in pride and scorn
18. Fill with tempests all my morn,
19. And with jealousies and fears
20. Fill my pleasant nights with tears?

21. v

22. `Seven of my sweet loves thy knife
23. Has bereav√®d of their life.
24. Their marble tombs I built with tears,
25. And with cold and shuddering fears.

26. vi

27. `Seven more loves weep night and day
28. Round the tombs where my loves lay,
29. And seven more loves attend each night
30. Around my couch with torches bright.

31. vii

32. `And seven more loves in my bed
33. Crown with wine my mournful head,
34. Pitying and forgiving all
35. Thy transgressions great and small.

36. viii

37. `When wilt thou return and view
38. My loves, and them to life renew?
39. When wilt thou return and live?
40. When wilt thou pity as I forgive?'

41. a

42. `O'er my sins thou sit and moan:
43. Hast thou no sins of thy own?
44. O'er my sins thou sit and weep,
45. And lull thy own sins fast asleep.

46. b

47. `What transgressions I commit
48. Are for thy transgressions fit.
49. They thy harlots, thou their slave;
50. And my bed becomes their grave.

51. ix

52. `Never, never, I return:
53. Still for victory I burn.
54. Living, thee alone I'll have;
55. And when dead I'll be thy grave.

56. x

57. `Thro' the Heaven and Earth and Hell
58. Thou shalt never, never quell:
59. I will fly and thou pursue:
60. Night and morn the flight renew.'

61. c

62. `Poor, pale, pitiable form
63. That I follow in a storm;
64. Iron tears and groans of lead
65. Bind around my aching head.

66. xi

67. `Till I turn from Female love
68. And root up the Infernal Grove,
69. I shall never worthy be
70. To step into Eternity.

71. xii

72. `And, to end thy cruel mocks,
73. Annihilate thee on the rocks,
74. And another form create
75. To be subservient to my fate.

76. xiii

77. `Let us agree to give up love,
78. And root up the Infernal Grove;
79. Then shall we return and see
80. The worlds of happy Eternity.

81. xiv

82. `And throughout all Eternity
83. I forgive you, you forgive me.
84. As 1000 our dear Redeemer said:
85. "This the Wine, and this the Bread."'
