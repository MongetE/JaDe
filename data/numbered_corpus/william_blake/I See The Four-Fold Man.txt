1. I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep
2. And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow.
3. I see the Past, Present and Future existing all at once
4. Before me. O Divine Spirit, sustain me on thy wings,
5. That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose;
6. For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in dismal steel, their terrors hang
7. Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents
8. Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations.

9. I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe
10. And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire,
11. Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth
12. In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works
13. Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
14. Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
15. Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace.
