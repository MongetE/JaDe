1. The bell struck one, and shook the silent tower;
2. The graves give up their dead: fair Elenor
3. Walk'd by the castle gate, and lookèd in.
4. A hollow groan ran thro' the dreary vaults.
5. She shriek'd aloud, and sunk upon the steps,
6. On the cold stone her pale cheeks. Sickly smells
7. Of death issue as from a sepulchre,
8. And all is silent but the sighing vaults.

9. Chill Death withdraws his hand, and she revives;
10. Amaz'd, she finds herself upon her feet,
11. And, like a ghost, thro' narrow passages
12. Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands.

13. Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones
14. And grinning skulls, and corruptible death
15. Wrapp'd in his shroud; and now fancies she hears
16. Deep sighs, and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding.

17. At length, no fancy but reality
18. Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet
19. Of one that fled, approaches--Ellen stood
20. Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear.

21. The wretch approaches, crying: `The deed is done;
22. Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send;
23. It is my life--send it to Elenor:--
24. He's dead, and howling after me for blood!

25. `Take this,' he cried; and thrust into her arms
26. A wet napkin, wrapp'd about; then rush'd
27. Past, howling: she receiv'd into her arms
28. Pale death, and follow'd on the wings of fear.

29. They pass'd swift thro' the outer gate; the wretch,
30. Howling, leap'd o'er the wall into the moat,
31. Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen pass'd the bridge,
32. And heard a gloomy voice cry `Is it done?'

33. As the deer wounded, Ellen flew over
34. The pathless plain; as the arrows that fly
35. By night, destruction flies, and strikes in darkness.
36. She fled from fear, till at her house arriv'd.

37. Her maids await her; on her bed she falls,
38. That bed of joy, where erst her lord hath press'd:
39. `Ah, woman's fear!' she cried; `ah, cursèd duke!
40. Ah, my dear lord! ah, wretched Elenor!

41. `My lord was like a flower upon the brows
42. Of lusty May! Ah, life as frail as flower!
43. O ghastly death! withdraw thy cruel hand,
44. Seek'st thou that flow'r to deck thy horrid temples?

45. `My lord was like a star in highest heav'n
46. Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness;
47. My lord was like the opening eyes of day
48. When western winds creep softly o'er the flowers;

49. `But he is darken'd; like the summer's noon
50. Clouded; fall'n like the stately tree, cut down;
51. The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves.
52. O Elenor, weak woman, fill'd with woe!'

53. Thus having spoke, she raisèd up her head,
54. And saw the bloody napkin by her side,
55. Which in her arms she brought; and now, tenfold
56. More terrifièd, saw it unfold itself.

57. Her eyes were fix'd; the bloody cloth unfolds,
58. Disclosing to her sight the murder'd head
59. Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted
60. With gory blood; it groan'd, and thus it spake:

61. `O Elenor, I am thy husband's head,
62. Who, sleeping on the stones of yonder tower,
63. Was 'reft of life by the accursèd duke!
64. A hirèd villain turn'd my sleep to death!

65. `O Elenor, beware the cursèd duke;
66. O give not him thy hand, now I am dead;
67. He seeks thy love; who, coward, in the night,
68. Hirèd a villain to bereave my life.'

69. She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffen'd to stone;
70. She took the gory head up in her arms;
71. She kiss'd the pale lips; she had no tears to shed;
72. She hugg'd it to her breast, and groan'd her last.
