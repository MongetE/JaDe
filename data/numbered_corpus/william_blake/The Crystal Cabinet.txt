1. The Maiden caught me in the wild,
2. Where I was dancing merrily;
3. She put me into her Cabinet,
4. And lock'd me up with a golden key.

5. This cabinet is form'd of gold
6. And pearl and crystal shining bright,
7. And within it opens into a world
8. And a little lovely moony night.

9. Another England there I saw
10. Another London with its Tower,
11. Another Thames and other hills,
12. And another pleasant Surrey bower.

13. Another Maiden like herself,
14. Translucent, lovely, shining clear,
15. Threefold each in the other clos'd
16. O, what a pleasant trembling fear!

17. O, what a smile! a threefold smile
18. Fill'd me, that like a flame I burn'd;
19. I bent to kiss the lovely Maid,
20. And found a threefold kiss return'd.

21. I strove to seize the inmost form
22. With ardor fierce and hands of flame,
23. But burst the Crystal Cabinet,
24. And like a weeping Babe became--

25. A weeping Babe upon the wild,
26. And weeping Woman pale reclin'd,
27. And in the outward air again,
28. I fill'd with woes the passing wind.
