1. O holy virgin! clad in purest white,
2. Unlock heav'n's golden gates, and issue forth;
3. Awake the dawn that sleeps in heaven; let light
4. Rise from the chambers of the east, and bring
5. The honey'd dew that cometh on waking day.
6. O radiant morning, salute the sun
7. Rous'd like a huntsman to the chase, and with
8. Thy buskin'd feet appear upon our hills.
