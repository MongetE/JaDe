1. Ah Sunflower, weary of time,
2. Who countest the steps of the sun;
3. Seeking after that sweet golden clime
4. Where the traveller's journey is done;

5. Where the Youth pined away with desire,
6. And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,
7. Arise from their graves, and aspire
8. Where my Sunflower wishes to go!
