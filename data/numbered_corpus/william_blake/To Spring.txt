1. O thou with dewy locks, who lookest down
2. Thro' the clear windows of the morning, turn
3. Thine angel eyes upon our western isle,
4. Which in full choir hails thy approach, O Spring!

5. The hills tell each other, and the listening
6. Valleys hear; all our longing eyes are turned
7. Up to thy bright pavilions: issue forth,
8. And let thy holy feet visit our clime.

9. Come o'er the eastern hills, and let our winds
10. Kiss thy perfumed garments; let us taste
11. Thy morn and evening breath; scatter thy pearls
12. Upon our love-sick land that mourns for thee.

13. O deck her forth with thy fair fingers; pour
14. Thy soft kisses on her bosom; and put
15. Thy golden crown upon her languished head,
16. Whose modest tresses were bound up for thee.
