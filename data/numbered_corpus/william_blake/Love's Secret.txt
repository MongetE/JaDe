1. Never seek to tell thy love,
2. Love that never told can be;
3. For the gentle wind does move
4. Silently, invisibly.

5. I told my love, I told my love,
6. I told her all my heart;
7. Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears,
8. Ah! she did depart!

9. Soon as she was gone from me,
10. A traveler came by,
11. Silently, invisibly
12. He took her with a sigh.
