1. I went to the Garden of Love,
2. And saw what I never had seen;
3. A Chapel was built in the midst,
4. Where I used to play on the green.

5. And the gates of this Chapel were shut
6. And 'Thou shalt not,' writ over the door;
7. So I turned to the Garden of Love
8. That so many sweet flowers bore.

9. And I saw it was filled with graves,
10. And tombstones where flowers should be;
11. And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
12. And binding with briars my joys and desires.
