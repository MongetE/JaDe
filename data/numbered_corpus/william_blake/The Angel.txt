1. I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean?
2. And that I was a maiden Queen
3. Guarded by an Angel mild:
4. Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!

5. And I wept both night and day,
6. And he wiped my tears away;
7. And I wept both day and night,
8. And hid from him my heart's delight.

9. So he took his wings, and fled;
10. Then the morn blushed rosy red.
11. I dried my tears, and armed my fears
12. With ten-thousand shields and spears.

13. Soon my Angel came again;
14. I was armed, he came in vain;
15. For the time of youth was fled,
16. And grey hairs were on my head.
