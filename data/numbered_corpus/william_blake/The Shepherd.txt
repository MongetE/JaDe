1. How sweet is the shepherd's sweet lot!
2. From the morn to the evening he strays;
3. He shall follow his sheep all the day,
4. And his tongue shall be filled with praise.

5. For he hears the lambs' innocent call,
6. And he hears the ewes' tender reply;
7. He is watchful while they are in peace,
8. For they know when their shepherd is nigh.
