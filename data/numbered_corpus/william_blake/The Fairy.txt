1. ‘COME hither, my Sparrows,
2. My little arrows.
3. If a tear or a smile
4. Will a man beguile,
5. If an amorous delay
6. Clouds a sunshiny day,
7. If the step of a foot
8. Smites the heart to its root,
9. 'Tis the marriage-ring…
10. Makes each fairy a king.'

11. So a Fairy sung.
12. From the leaves I sprung;
13. He leap'd from the spray
14. To flee away;
15. But in my hat caught,
16. He soon shall be taught.
17. Let him laugh, let him cry,
18. He's my Butterfly;
19. For I've pull'd out the sting
20. Of the marriage-ring.
