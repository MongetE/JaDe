1. 1. Earth was not: nor globes of attraction
2. The will of the Immortal expanded
3. Or contracted his all flexible senses.
4. Death was not, but eternal life sprung

5. 2. The sound of a trumpet the heavens
6. Awoke & vast clouds of blood roll'd
7. Round the dim rocks of Urizen, so nam'd
8. That solitary one in Immensity

9. 3. Shrill the trumpet: & myriads of Eternity,
10. Muster around the bleak desarts
11. Now fill'd with clouds, darkness & waters
12. That roll'd perplex'd labring & utter'd
13. Words articulate, bursting in thunders
14. That roll'd on the tops of his mountains

15. 4. From the depths of dark solitude. From
16. The eternal abode in my holiness,
17. Hidden set apart in my stern counsels
18. Reserv'd for the days of futurity,
19. I have sought for a joy without pain,
20. For a solid without fluctuation
21. Why will you die O Eternals?
22. Why live in unquenchable burnings?

23. 5. First I fought with the fire; consum'd
24. Inwards, into a deep world within:
25. A void immense, wild dark & deep,
26. Where nothing was: Natures wide womb
27. And self balanc'd stretch'd o'er the void
28. I alone, even I! the winds merciless
29. Bound; but condensing, in torrents
30. They fall strong I repell'd
31. The vast waves, & arose on the waters
32. A wide world of solid obstruction

33. 6. Here alone I in books formd of metals
34. Have written the secrets of wisdom
35. The secrets of dark contemplation
36. By fightings and conflicts dire,
37. With terrible monsters Sin-bred:
38. Which the bosoms of all inhabit;
39. Seven deadly Sins of the soul.

40. 7. Lo! I unfold my darkness: and on
41. This rock, place with strong hand the Book
42. Of eternal brass, written in my solitude.

43. 8. Laws of peace, of love, of unity:
44. Of pity, compassion, forgiveness.
45. Let each chuse one habitation:
46. His ancient infinite mansion:
47. One command, one joy, one desire,
48. One curse, one weight, one measure
49. One King, one God, one Law.
