1. When voices of children are heard on the green
2. And laughing is heard on the hill,
3. My heart is at rest within my breast
4. And everything else is still

5. Then come home my children the sun is gone down
6. And the dews of night arise
7. Come come leave off play, and let us away
8. Till the morning appears in the skies

9. No no let us play, for it is yet day
10. And we cannot go to sleep
11. Besides in the sky, the little birds fly
12. And the hills are all covered with sheep

13. Well well go & play till the light fades away
14. And then go home to bed
15. The little ones leaped & shouted & laugh'd
16. And all the hills echoed
