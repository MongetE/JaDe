1. The wild winds weep
2. And the night is a-cold;
3. Come hither, Sleep,
4. And my griefs infold:
5. But lo! the morning peeps
6. Over the eastern steeps,
7. And the rustling birds of dawn
8. The earth do scorn.

9. Lo! to the vault
10. Of paved heaven,
11. With sorrow fraught
12. My notes are driven:
13. They strike the ear of night,
14. Make weep the eyes of day;
15. They make mad the roaring winds,
16. And with tempests play.

17. Like a fiend in a cloud,
18. With howling woe,
19. After night I do crowd,
20. And with night will go;
21. I turn my back to the east,
22. From whence comforts have increas'd;
23. For light doth seize my brain
24. With frantic pain.
