1. O Winter! bar thine adamantine doors:
2. The north is thine; there hast thou built thy dark
3. Deep-founded habitation. Shake not thy roofs,
4. Nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car.'
5. He hears me not, but o'er the yawning deep
6. Rides heavy; his storms are unchain'd, sheathèd
7. In ribbèd steel; I dare not lift mine eyes,
8. For he hath rear'd his sceptre o'er the world.

9. Lo! now the direful monster, whose 1000 skin clings
10. To his strong bones, strides o'er the groaning rocks:
11. He withers all in silence, and in his hand
12. Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life.

13. He takes his seat upon the cliffs,--the mariner
14. Cries in vain. Poor little wretch, that deal'st
15. With storms!--till heaven smiles, and the monster
16. Is driv'n yelling to his caves beneath mount Hecla.
