1. Piping down the valleys wild
2. Piping songs of pleasant glee
3. On a cloud I saw a child.
4. And he laughing said to me.

5. Pipe a song about a Lamb:
6. So I piped with merry chear,
7. Piper, pipe that song again--
8. So I piped, he wept to hear.

9. Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe
10. Sing thy songs of happy chear,
11. So I sung the same again
12. While he wept with joy to hear

13. Piper sit thee down and write
14. In a book that all may read--
15. So he vanished from my sight
16. And I pluck'd a hollow reed.

17. And I made a rural pen,
18. And I stained the water clear,
19. And I wrote my happy songs,
20. Every child may joy to hear.
