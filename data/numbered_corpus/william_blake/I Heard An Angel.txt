1. I heard an Angel singing
2. When the day was springing,
3. 'Mercy, Pity, Peace
4. Is the world's release.'

5. Thus he sung all day
6. Over the new mown hay,
7. Till the sun went down
8. And haycocks looked brown.

9. I heard a Devil curse
10. Over the heath and the furze,
11. 'Mercy could be no more,
12. If there was nobody poor,

13. And pity no more could be,
14. If all were as happy as we.'
15. At his curse the sun went down,
16. And the heavens gave a frown.

17. Down pour'd the heavy rain
18. Over the new reap'd grain ...
19. And Miseries' increase
20. Is Mercy, Pity, Peace.
