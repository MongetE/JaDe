1. Truly My Satan thou art but a Dunce
2. And dost not know the Garment from the Man
3. Every Harlot was a Virgin once
4. Nor canst thou ever change Kate into Nan

5. Tho thou art Worship'd by the Names Divine
6. Of Jesus & Jehovah thou art still
7. The Son of Morn in weary Nights decline
8. The lost Travellers Dream under the Hill
