1. To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
2. All pray in their distress,
3. And to these virtues of delight
4. Return their thankfulness.

5. For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
6. Is God our Father dear;
7. And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,
8. Is man, his child and care.

9. For Mercy has a human heart
10. Pity, a human face;
11. And Love, the human form divine;
12. And Peace, the human dress.

13. Then every man, of every clime,
14. That prays in his distress,
15. Prays to the human form divine:
16. Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.

17. And all must love the human form,
18. In heathen, Turk, or Jew.
19. Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,
20. There God is dwelling too.
