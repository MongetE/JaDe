1. Whether on Ida's shady brow,
2. Or in the chambers of the East,
3. The chambers of the sun, that now
4. From ancient melody have ceas'd;

5. Whether in Heav'n ye wander fair,
6. Or the green corners of the earth,
7. Or the blue regions of the air,
8. Where the melodious winds have birth;

9. Whether on crystal rocks ye rove,
10. Beneath the bosom of the sea
11. Wand'ring in many a coral grove,
12. Fair Nine, forsaking Poetry!

13. How have you left the ancient love
14. That bards of old enjoy'd in you!
15. The languid strings do scarcely move!
16. The sound is forc'd, the notes are few!
