1. Hear the voice of the Bard!
2. Who Present, Past, & Future sees
3. Whose ears have heard
4. The Holy Word,
5. That walk'd among the ancient trees.

6. Calling the lapsed Soul
7. And weeping in the evening dew;
8. That might controll.
9. The starry pole;
10. And fallen fallen light renew!

11. O Earth O Earth return!
12. Arise from out the dewy grass;
13. Night is worn,
14. And the morn
15. Rises from the slumbrous mass.

16. Turn away no more:
17. Why wilt thou turn away
18. The starry floor
19. The watery shore
20. Is given thee till the break of day.
