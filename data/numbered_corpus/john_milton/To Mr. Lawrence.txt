1. Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,
2. Now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire,
3. Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
4. Help waste a sullen day, what may be won
5. From the hard season gaining? Time will run
6. On smoother, till Favonius reinspire
7. The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire
8. The lily and rose, that neither sowed nor spun.
9. What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
10. Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise
11. To hear the lute well touched, or artful voice
12. Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?
13. He who of those delights can judge, and spare
14. To interpose them oft, is not unwise.
