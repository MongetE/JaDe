1. Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song
2. First taught our English music how to span
3. Words with just note and accent, not to scan
4. With Midas’ ears, committing short and long,
5. Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,
6. With praise enough for Envy to look wan;
7. To after age thou shalt be writ the man
8. That with smooth air couldst humour best our tongue.
9. Thou honour’st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing
10. To honour thee, the priest of Phœbus’ quire,
11. That tunest their happiest lines in hymn or story.
12. Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher
13. Than his Casella, whom he wooed to sing,
14. Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.
