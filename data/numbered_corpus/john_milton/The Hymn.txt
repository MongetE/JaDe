1. It was the winter wild,
2. While the heaven-born Child
3. All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;
4. Nature in awe to Him
5. Had doffed her gaudy trim,
6. With her great Master so to sympathize:
7. It was no season then for her
8. To wanton with the sun, her lusty paramour.

9. Only with speeches fair
10. She woos the gentle air
11. To hide her guilty front with innocent snow,
12. And on her naked shame,
13. Pollute with sinful blame,
14. The saintly veil of maiden white to throw,
15. Confounded that her Maker's eyes
16. Should look so near upon her foul deformities.

17. But He, her fears to cease,
18. Sent down the meek-eyed Peace;
19. She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding
20. Down through the turning sphere,
21. His ready harbinger,
22. With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;
23. And waving wide her myrtle wand,
24. She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.

25. Nor war, or battle's sound
26. Was heard the world around:
27. The idle spear and shield were high uphung,
28. The hooked chariot stood
29. Unstained with hostile blood,
30. The trumpet spake not to the armed throng;
31. And kings sat still with awful eye,
32. As if they surely knew their sov'reign Lord was by.

33. But peaceful was the night,
34. Wherein the Prince of Light
35. His reign of peace upon the earth began:
36. The winds with wonder whist
37. Smoothly the waters kist,
38. Whisp'ring new joys to the mild ocean,
39. Who now hath quite forgot to rave,
40. While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.

41. The stars with deep amaze
42. Stand fixed in steadfast gaze,
43. Bending one way their precious influence,
44. And will not take their flight,
45. For all the morning light,
46. Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;
47. But in their glimmering orbs did glow,
48. Until their Lord Himself bespake, and bid them go.

49. And though the shady gloom
50. Had given day her room,
51. The sun himself withheld his wonted speed,
52. And hid his head for shame,
53. As his inferior flame
54. The new-enlightened world no more should need;
55. He saw a greater sun appear
56. Than his bright throne, or burning axletree could bear.

57. The shepherds on the lawn,
58. Or ere the point of dawn,
59. Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;
60. Full little thought they then
61. That the mighty Pan
62. Was kindly come to live with them below;
63. Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,
64. Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.

65. When such music sweet
66. Their hearts and ears did greet,
67. As never was by mortal finger strook,
68. Divinely-warbled voice
69. Answering the stringed noise,
70. As all their souls in blissful rapture took:
71. The air such pleasure loth to lose,
72. With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.

73. Nature that heard such sound,
74. Beneath the hollow round
75. Of Cynthia's seat, the airy region thrilling,
76. Now was almost won
77. To think her part was done,
78. And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;
79. She knew such harmony alone
80. Could hold all heav'n and earth in happier union.

81. At last surrounds their sight
82. A globe of circular light,
83. That with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed;
84. The helmed Cherubim,
85. And sworded Seraphim,
86. Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed,
87. Harping in loud and solemn quire,
88. With unexpressive notes to Heaven's new-born Heir.

89. Such music (as 'tis said)
90. Before was never made,
91. But when of old the sons of morning sung,
92. While the Creator great
93. His constellations set,
94. And the well-balanced world on hinges hung,
95. And cast the dark foundations deep,
96. And bid the welt'ring waves their oozy channel keep.

97. Ring out, ye crystal spheres,
98. Once bless our human ears,
99. If ye have power to touch our senses so;
100. And let your silver chime
101. Move in melodious time,
102. And let the base of heav'n's deep organ blow;
103. And with your ninefold harmony
104. Make up full consort to th' angelic symphony.

105. For if such holy song
106. Enwrap our fancy long,
107. Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,
108. And speckled Vanity
109. Will sicken soon and die,
110. And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;
111. And Hell itself will pass away,
112. And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.

113. Yea Truth and Justice then
114. Will down return to men,
115. Orbed in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,
116. Mercy will sit between,
117. Throned in celestial sheen,
118. With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;
119. And Heav'n, as at some festival,
120. Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.

121. But wisest Fate says No,
122. This must not yet be so,
123. The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy
124. That on the bitter cross
125. Must redeem our loss;
126. So both Himself and us to glorify;
127. Yet first, to those ychained in sleep
128. The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep;

129. With such a horrid clang
130. As on mount Sinai rang,
131. While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake:
132. The aged Earth aghast,
133. With terror of that blast,
134. Shall from the surface to the centre shake;
135. When at the world's last session,
136. The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread His throne.

137. And then at last our bliss
138. Full and perfect is,
139. But now begins; for from this happy day
140. The old Dragon under ground,
141. In straiter limits bound,
142. Not half so far casts his usurped sway;
143. And wroth to see his kingdom fail,
144. Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.

145. The oracles are dumb,
146. No voice or hideous hum
147. Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
148. Apollo from his shrine
149. Can no more divine,
150. With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
151. No nightly trance or breathed spell
152. Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.

153. The lonely mountains o'er,
154. And the resounding shore,
155. A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;
156. From haunted spring, and dale
157. Edged with popular pale,
158. The parting genius is with sighing sent;
159. With flow'r-inwoven tresses torn
160. The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.

161. In consecrated earth,
162. And on the holy hearth,
163. The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;
164. In urns and altars round,
165. A drear and dying sound
166. Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;
167. And the chill marble seems to sweat,
168. While each peculiar Pow'r forgoes his wonted seat.

169. Peor and Baalim
170. Forsake their temples dim,
171. With that twice-battered God of Palestine;
172. And mooned Ashtaroth,
173. Heav'n's queen and mother both,
174. Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;
175. The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn,
176. In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.

177. And sullen Moloch fled,
178. Hath left in shadows dread
179. His burning idol all of blackest hue;
180. In vain with cymbals' ring
181. They call the grisly king,
182. In dismal dance about the furnace blue;
183. The brutish gods of Nile as fast,
184. Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis haste.

185. Nor is Osiris seen
186. In Memphian grove or green,
187. Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud:
188. Nor can he be at rest
189. Within his sacred chest,
190. Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud;
191. In vain with timbrelled anthems dark
192. The sable stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark.

193. He feels from Juda's land
194. The dreaded Infant's hand,
195. The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
196. Nor all the gods beside
197. Longer dare abide,
198. Nor Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
199. Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,
200. Can in His swaddling bands control the damned crew.

201. So when the sun in bed,
202. Curtained with cloudy red,
203. Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,
204. The flocking shadows pale
205. Troop to th' infernal jail,
206. Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave;
207. And the yellow-skirted Fayes
208. Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze.

209. But see, the Virgin blest
210. Hath laid her Babe to rest,
211. Time is our tedious song should here have ending:
212. Heav'n's youngest-teemed star

213. Hath fixed her polished car,
214. Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;
215. And all about the courtly stable
216. Bright-harnessed Angels sit in order serviceable.
