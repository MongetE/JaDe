1. I, who erewhile the happy Garden sung
2. By one man's disobedience lost, now sing
3. Recovered Paradise to all mankind,
4. By one man's firm obedience fully tried
5. Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled
6. In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,
7. And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.
8. Thou Spirit, who led'st this glorious Eremite
9. Into the desert, his victorious field
10. Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence
11. By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,
12. As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,
13. And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds,
14. With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds
15. Above heroic, though in secret done,
16. And unrecorded left through many an age:
17. Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.
18. Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice
19. More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried
20. Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand
21. To all baptized.  To his great baptism flocked
22. With awe the regions round, and with them came
23. From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed
24. To the flood Jordan—came as then obscure,
25. Unmarked, unknown.  But him the Baptist soon
26. Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore
27. As to his worthier, and would have resigned
28. To him his heavenly office.  Nor was long
29. His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized
30. Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove
31. The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice
32. From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.
33. That heard the Adversary, who, roving still
34. About the world, at that assembly famed
35. Would not be last, and, with the voice divine
36. Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom
37. Such high attest was given a while surveyed
38. With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,
39. Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air
40. To council summons all his mighty Peers,
41. Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,
42. A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,
43. With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:—
44. "O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World
45. (For much more willingly I mention Air,
46. This our old conquest, than remember Hell,
47. Our hated habitation), well ye know
48. How many ages, as the years of men,
49. This Universe we have possessed, and ruled
50. In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,
51. Since Adam and his facile consort Eve
52. Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since
53. With dread attending when that fatal wound
54. Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve
55. Upon my head.  Long the decrees of Heaven
56. Delay, for longest time to Him is short;
57. And now, too soon for us, the circling hours
58. This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we
59. Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound
60. (At least, if so we can, and by the head
61. Broken be not intended all our power
62. To be infringed, our freedom and our being
63. In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)—
64. For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed,
65. Destined to this, is late of woman born.
66. His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;
67. But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying
68. All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve
69. Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.
70. Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim
71. His coming, is sent harbinger, who all
72. Invites, and in the consecrated stream
73. Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so
74. Purified to receive him pure, or rather
75. To do him honour as their King.  All come,
76. And he himself among them was baptized—
77. Not thence to be more pure, but to receive
78. The testimony of Heaven, that who he is
79. Thenceforth the nations may not doubt.  I saw
80. The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising
81. Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds
82. Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head
83. A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant);
84. And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,
85. 'This is my Son beloved,—in him am pleased.'
86. His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire
87. He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;
88. And what will He not do to advance his Son?
89. His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,
90. When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;
91. Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems
92. In all his lineaments, though in his face
93. The glimpses of his Father's glory shine.
94. Ye see our danger on the utmost edge
95. Of hazard, which admits no long debate,
96. But must with something sudden be opposed
97. (Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),
98. Ere in the head of nations he appear,
99. Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.
100. I, when no other durst, sole undertook
101. The dismal expedition to find out
102. And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed
103. Successfully: a calmer voyage now
104. Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once
105. Induces best to hope of like success."
106. He ended, and his words impression left
107. Of much amazement to the infernal crew,
108. Distracted and surprised with deep dismay
109. At these sad tidings.  But no time was then
110. For long indulgence to their fears or grief:
111. Unanimous they all commit the care
112. And management of this man enterprise
113. To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt
114. At first against mankind so well had thrived
115. In Adam's overthrow, and led their march
116. From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,
117. Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,
118. Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.
119. So to the coast of Jordan he directs
120. His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,
121. Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,
122. This man of men, attested Son of God,
123. Temptation and all guile on him to try—
124. So to subvert whom he suspected raised
125. To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:
126. But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled
127. The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,
128. Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright
129. Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:—
130. "Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,
131. Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth
132. With Man or men's affairs, how I begin
133. To verify that solemn message late,
134. On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure
135. In Galilee, that she should bear a son,
136. Great in renown, and called the Son of God.
137. Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be
138. To her a virgin, that on her should come
139. The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest
140. O'ershadow her.  This Man, born and now upgrown,
141. To shew him worthy of his birth divine
142. And high prediction, henceforth I expose
143. To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay
144. His utmost subtlety, because he boasts
145. And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng
146. Of his Apostasy.  He might have learnt
147. Less overweening, since he failed in Job,
148. Whose constant perseverance overcame
149. Whate'er his cruel malice could invent.
150. He now shall know I can produce a man,
151. Of female seed, far abler to resist
152. All his solicitations, and at length
153. All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell—
154. Winning by conquest what the first man lost
155. By fallacy surprised.  But first I mean
156. To exercise him in the Wilderness;
157. There he shall first lay down the rudiments
158. Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth
159. To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.
160. By humiliation and strong sufferance
161. His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength,
162. And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;
163. That all the Angels and aethereal Powers—
164. They now, and men hereafter—may discern
165. From what consummate virtue I have chose
166. This perfet man, by merit called my Son,
167. To earn salvation for the sons of men."
168. So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven
169. Admiring stood a space; then into hymns
170. Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,
171. Circling the throne and singing, while the hand
172. Sung with the voice, and this the argument:—
173. "Victory and triumph to the Son of God,
174. Now entering his great duel, not of arms,
175. But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!
176. The Father knows the Son; therefore secure
177. Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,
178. Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce,
179. Allure, or terrify, or undermine.
180. Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,
181. And, devilish machinations, come to nought!"
182. So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.
183. Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days
184. Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,
185. Musing and much revolving in his breast
186. How best the mighty work he might begin
187. Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first
188. Publish his godlike office now mature,
189. One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading
190. And his deep thoughts, the better to converse
191. With solitude, till, far from track of men,
192. Thought following thought, and step by step led on,
193. He entered now the bordering Desert wild,
194. And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,
195. His holy meditations thus pursued:—
196. "O what a multitude of thoughts at once
197. Awakened in me swarm, while I consider
198. What from within I feel myself, and hear
199. What from without comes often to my ears,
200. Ill sorting with my present state compared!
201. When I was yet a child, no childish play
202. To me was pleasing; all my mind was set
203. Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,
204. What might be public good; myself I thought
205. Born to that end, born to promote all truth,
206. All righteous things.  Therefore, above my years,
207. The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;
208. Made it my whole delight, and in it grew
209. To such perfection that, ere yet my age
210. Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast
211. I went into the Temple, there to hear
212. The teachers of our Law, and to propose
213. What might improve my knowledge or their own,
214. And was admired by all.  Yet this not all
215. To which my spirit aspired.  Victorious deeds
216. Flamed in my heart, heroic acts—one while
217. To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;
218. Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth,
219. Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,
220. Till truth were freed, and equity restored:
221. Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first
222. By winning words to conquer willing hearts,
223. And make persuasion do the work of fear;
224. At least to try, and teach the erring soul,
225. Not wilfully misdoing, but unware
226. Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.
227. These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,
228. By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,
229. And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts,
230. O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar
231. To what highth sacred virtue and true worth
232. Can raise them, though above example high;
233. By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.
234. For know, thou art no son of mortal man;
235. Though men esteem thee low of parentage,
236. Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules
237. All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men.
238. A messenger from God foretold thy birth
239. Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold
240. Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne,
241. And of thy kingdom there should be no end.
242. At thy nativity a glorious quire
243. Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung
244. To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,
245. And told them the Messiah now was born,
246. Where they might see him; and to thee they came,
247. Directed to the manger where thou lay'st;
248. For in the inn was left no better room.
249. A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,
250. Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,
251. To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;
252. By whose bright course led on they found the place,
253. Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,
254. By which they knew thee King of Israel born.
255. Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned
256. By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,
257. Before the altar and the vested priest,
258. Like things of thee to all that present stood.'
259. This having heart, straight I again revolved
260. The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ
261. Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes
262. Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake
263. I am—this chiefly, that my way must lie
264. Through many a hard assay, even to the death,
265. Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,
266. Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins'
267. Full weight must be transferred upon my head.
268. Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,
269. The time prefixed I waited; when behold
270. The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,
271. Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come
272. Before Messiah, and his way prepare!
273. I, as all others, to his baptism came,
274. Which I believed was from above; but he
275. Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed
276. Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)—
277. Me him whose harbinger he was; and first
278. Refused on me his baptism to confer,
279. As much his greater, and was hardly won.
280. But, as I rose out of the laving stream,
281. Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence
282. The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;
283. And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice,
284. Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,
285. Me his beloved Son, in whom alone
286. He was well pleased: by which I knew the time
287. Now full, that I no more should live obscure,
288. But openly begin, as best becomes
289. The authority which I derived from Heaven.
290. And now by some strong motion I am led
291. Into this wilderness; to what intent
292. I learn not yet.  Perhaps I need not know;
293. For what concerns my knowledge God reveals."
294. So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,
295. And, looking round, on every side beheld
296. A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.
297. The way he came, not having marked return,
298. Was difficult, by human steps untrod;
299. And he still on was led, but with such thoughts
300. Accompanied of things past and to come
301. Lodged in his breast as well might recommend
302. Such solitude before choicest society.
303. Full forty days he passed—whether on hill
304. Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night
305. Under the covert of some ancient oak
306. Or cedar to defend him from the dew,
307. Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;
308. Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,
309. Till those days ended; hungered then at last
310. Among wild beasts.  They at his sight grew mild,
311. Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk
312. The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;
313. The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.
314. But now an aged man in rural weeds,
315. Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye,
316. Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve
317. Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen,
318. To warm him wet returned from field at eve,
319. He saw approach; who first with curious eye
320. Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:—
321. "Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,
322. So far from path or road of men, who pass
323. In troop or caravan? for single none
324. Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here
325. His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth.
326. I ask the rather, and the more admire,
327. For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late
328. Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford
329. Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son
330. Of God.  I saw and heard, for we sometimes
331. Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth
332. To town or village nigh (nighest is far),
333. Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,
334. What happens new; fame also finds us out."
335. To whom the Son of God:—"Who brought me hither
336. Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek."
337. "By miracle he may," replied the swain;
338. "What other way I see not; for we here
339. Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured
340. More than the camel, and to drink go far—
341. Men to much misery and hardship born.
342. But, if thou be the Son of God, command
343. That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;
344. So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve
345. With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste."
346. He ended, and the Son of God replied:—
347. "Think'st thou such force in bread?  Is it not written
348. (For I discern thee other than thou seem'st),
349. Man lives not by bread only, but each word
350. Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed
351. Our fathers here with manna?  In the Mount
352. Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;
353. And forty days Eliah without food
354. Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.
355. Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust
356. Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?"
357. Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:—
358. "'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate
359. Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,
360. Kept not my happy station, but was driven
361. With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep—
362. Yet to that hideous place not so confined
363. By rigour unconniving but that oft,
364. Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy
365. Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,
366. Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens
367. Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.
368. I came, among the Sons of God, when he
369. Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,
370. To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;
371. And, when to all his Angels he proposed
372. To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,
373. That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,
374. I undertook that office, and the tongues
375. Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies
376. To his destruction, as I had in charge:
377. For what he bids I do.  Though I have lost
378. Much lustre of my native brightness, lost
379. To be beloved of God, I have not lost
380. To love, at least contemplate and admire,
381. What I see excellent in good, or fair,
382. Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.
383. What can be then less in me than desire
384. To see thee and approach thee, whom I know
385. Declared the Son of God, to hear attent
386. Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?
387. Men generally think me much a foe
388. To all mankind.  Why should I? they to me
389. Never did wrong or violence.  By them
390. I lost not what I lost; rather by them
391. I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell
392. Copartner in these regions of the World,
393. If not disposer—lend them oft my aid,
394. Oft my advice by presages and signs,
395. And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,
396. Whereby they may direct their future life.
397. Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain
398. Companions of my misery and woe!
399. At first it may be; but, long since with woe
400. Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof
401. That fellowship in pain divides not smart,
402. Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load;
403. Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.
404. This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,
405. Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more."
406. To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:—
407. "Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies
408. From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,
409. Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come
410. Into the Heaven of Heavens.  Thou com'st, indeed,
411. As a poor miserable captive thrall
412. Comes to the place where he before had sat
413. Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,
414. Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,
415. A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,
416. To all the host of Heaven.  The happy place
417. Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy—
418. Rather inflames thy torment, representing
419. Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;
420. So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.
421. But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King!
422. Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear
423. Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?
424. What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem
425. Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him
426. With all inflictions? but his patience won.
427. The other service was thy chosen task,
428. To be a liar in four hundred mouths;
429. For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.
430. Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles
431. By thee are given, and what confessed more true
432. Among the nations?  That hath been thy craft,
433. By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.
434. But what have been thy answers? what but dark,
435. Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,
436. Which they who asked have seldom understood,
437. And, not well understood, as good not known?
438. Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,
439. Returned the wiser, or the more instruct
440. To fly or follow what concerned him most,
441. And run not sooner to his fatal snare?
442. For God hath justly given the nations up
443. To thy delusions; justly, since they fell
444. Idolatrous.  But, when his purpose is
445. Among them to declare his providence,
446. To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,
447. But from him, or his Angels president
448. In every province, who, themselves disdaining
449. To approach thy temples, give thee in command
450. What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say
451. To thy adorers?  Thou, with trembling fear,
452. Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st;
453. Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold.
454. But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;
455. No more shalt thou by oracling abuse
456. The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,
457. And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice
458. Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere—
459. At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.
460. God hath now sent his living Oracle
461. Into the world to teach his final will,
462. And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell
463. In pious hearts, an inward oracle
464. To all truth requisite for men to know."
465. So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,
466. Though inly stung with anger and disdain,
467. Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:—
468. "Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,
469. And urged me hard with doings which not will,
470. But misery, hath wrested from me.  Where
471. Easily canst thou find one miserable,
472. And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,
473. If it may stand him more in stead to lie,
474. Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?
475. But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;
476. From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure
477. Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.
478. Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,
479. Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,
480. And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;
481. What wonder, then, if I delight to hear
482. Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire
483. Virtue who follow not her lore.  Permit me
484. To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),
485. And talk at least, though I despair to attain.
486. Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,
487. Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest
488. To tread his sacred courts, and minister
489. About his altar, handling holy things,
490. Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice
491. To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet
492. Inspired: disdain not such access to me."
493. To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:—
494. "Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,
495. I bid not, or forbid.  Do as thou find'st
496. Permission from above; thou canst not more."
497. He added not; and Satan, bowling low
498. His gray dissimulation, disappeared,
499. Into thin air diffused: for now began
500. Night with her sullen wing to double-shade
501. The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;
502. And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.
