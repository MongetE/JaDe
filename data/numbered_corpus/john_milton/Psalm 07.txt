1. Aug.  14. 1653.
2. Upon The Words Of Chush The Benjamite Against Him.


3. Lord my God to thee I flie
4. Save me and secure me under
5. Thy protection while I crie
6. Least as a Lion (and no wonder)
7. He hast to tear my Soul asunder
8. Tearing and no rescue nigh.

9. Lord my God if I have thought
10. Or done this, if wickedness
11. Be in my hands, if I have wrought
12. Ill to him that meant me peace,
13. Or to him have render'd less,
14. And fre'd my foe for naught;

15. Let th'enemy pursue my soul
16. And overtake it, let him tread
17. My life down to the earth and roul
18. In the dust my glory dead,
19. In the dust and there out spread
20. Lodge it with dishonour foul.

21. Rise Jehovah in thine ire
22. Rouze thy self amidst the rage
23. Of my foes that urge like fire;
24. And wake for me, their furi' asswage;
25. Judgment here thou didst ingage
26. And command which I desire.

27. So th' assemblies of each Nation
28. Will surround thee, seeking right,
29. Thence to thy glorious habitation
30. Return on high and in their sight.
31. Jehovah judgeth most upright
32. All people from the worlds foundation.

33. Judge me Lord, be judge in this
34. According to my righteousness
35. And the innocence which is
36. Upon me: cause at length to cease
37. Of evil men the wickedness
38. And their power that do amiss.

39. But the just establish fast,
40. Since thou art the just God that tries
41. Hearts and reins.  On God is cast
42. My defence, and in him lies
43. In him who both just and wise
44. Saves th' upright of Heart at last.

45. God is a just Judge and severe,
46. And God is every day offended;
47. If th' unjust will not forbear,
48. His Sword he whets, his Bow hath bended
49. Already, and for him intended
50. The tools of death, that waits him near.

51. (His arrows purposely made he
52. For them that persecute.)  Behold
53. He travels big with vanitie,
54. Trouble he hath conceav'd of old
55. As in a womb, and from that mould
56. Hath at length brought forth a Lie.

57. He dig'd a pit, and delv'd it deep,
58. And fell into the pit he made,
59. His mischief that due course doth keep,
60. Turns on his head, and his ill trade
61. Of violence will undelay'd
62. Fall on his crown with ruine steep.

63. Then will I Jehovah's praise
64. According to his justice raise
65. And sing the Name and Deitie
66. Of Jehovah the most high.
