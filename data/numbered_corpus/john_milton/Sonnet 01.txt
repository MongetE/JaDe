1. I

2. O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy Spray
3. Warbl'st at eeve, when all the Woods are still,
4. Thou with fresh hope the Lovers heart dost fill,
5. While the jolly hours lead on propitious May,
6. Thy liquid notes that close the eye of Day,
7. First heard before the shallow Cuccoo's bill
8. Portend success in love; O if Jove's will
9. Have linkt that amorous power to thy soft lay,
10. Now timely sing, ere the rude Bird of Hate
11. Foretell my hopeles doom in som Grove ny:
12. As thou from yeer to yeer hast sung too late
13. For my relief; yet hadst no reason why,
14. Whether the Muse, or Love call thee his mate,
15. Both them I serve, and of their train am I.
