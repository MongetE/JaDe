1. To Mr Lawrence

2. Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,
3. Now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire,
4. Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
5. Help waste a sullen day, what may be won
6. From the hard season gaining? Time will run
7. On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire
8. The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire
9. The lily and rose, that neither sowed nor spun.
10. What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
11. Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise
12. To hear the lute well touched, or artful voice
13. Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?
14. He who of those delights can judge, and spare
15. To interpose them oft, is not unwise.
