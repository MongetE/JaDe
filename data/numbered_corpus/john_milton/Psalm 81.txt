1. To God our strength sing loud, and clear,
2. Sing loud to God our King,
3. To Jacobs God, that all may hear
4. Loud acclamations ring.
5. Prepare a Hymn, prepare a Song
6. The Timbrel hither bring
7. The cheerfull Psaltry bring along
8. And Harp with pleasant string.
9. Blow, as is wont, in the new Moon
10. With Trumpets lofty sound,
11. Th'appointed time, the day wheron
12. Our solemn Feast comes round.
13. This was a Statute giv'n of old
14. For Israel to observe
15. A Law of Jacobs God, to hold
16. From whence they might not swerve.
17. This he a Testimony ordain'd
18. In Joseph, not to change,
19. When as he pass'd through Aegypt land;
20. The Tongue I heard, was strange.
21. From burden, and from slavish toyle
22. I set his shoulder free;
23. His hands from pots, and mirie soyle
24. Deliver'd were by me.
25. When trouble did thee sore assaile,
26. On me then didst thou call,
27. And I to free thee did not faile,
28. And led thee out of thrall.
29. I answer'd thee in *thunder deep                 *Be Sether ragnam.
30. With clouds encompass'd round;
31. I tri'd thee at the water steep
32. Of Meriba renown'd.
33. Hear O my people, heark'n well,
34. I testifie to thee
35. Thou antient flock of Israel,
36. If thou wilt list to mee,
37. Through out the land of thy abode
38. No alien God shall be
39. Nor shalt thou to a forein God
40. In honour bend thy knee.
41. I am the Lord thy God which brought
42. Thee out of Aegypt land
43. Ask large enough, and I, besought,
44. Will grant thy full demand.
45. And yet my people would not hear,
46. Nor hearken to my voice;
47. And Israel whom I lov'd so dear
48. Mislik'd me for his choice.
49. Then did I leave them to their will
50. And to their wandring mind;
51. Their own conceits they follow'd still
52. Their own devises blind
53. O that my people would be wise
54. To serve me all their daies,
55. And O that Israel would advise
56. To walk my righteous waies.
57. Then would I soon bring down their foes
58. That now so proudly rise,
59. And turn my hand against all those
60. That are their enemies.
61. Who hate the Lord should then be fain
62. To bow to him and bend,
63. But they, His should remain,
64. Their time should have no end.
65. And he would free them from the shock
66. With flower of finest wheat,
67. And satisfie them from the rock
68. With Honey for their Meat.
