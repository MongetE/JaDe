1. What needs my Shakespear for his honour'd Bones,
2. The labour of an age in piled Stones,
3. Or that his hallow'd reliques should be hid
4. Under a Star-ypointing Pyramid?
5. Dear son of memory, great heir of Fame,
6. What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name?
7. Thou in our wonder and astonishment
8. Hast built thy self a live-long Monument.
9. For whilst toth' shame of slow-endeavouring art,
10. Thy easie numbers flow, and that each heart
11. Hath from the leaves of thy unvalu'd Book,
12. Those Delphick lines with deep impression took
13. Then thou our fancy of it self bereaving,
14. Dost make us Marble with too much conceaving;
15. And so Sepulcher'd in such pomp dost lie,
16. That Kings for such a Tomb would wish to die.
