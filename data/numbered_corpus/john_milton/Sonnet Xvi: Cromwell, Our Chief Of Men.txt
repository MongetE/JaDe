1. To the Lord General Cromwell

2. On the Proposals of Certain Ministers of the Committee
3. for the Propagation of the Gospel

4. Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud
5. Not of war only, but detractions rude,
6. Guided by faith and matchless fortitude,
7. To peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed,
8. And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud
9. Hast reared God's trophies, and his work pursued,
10. While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbrued,
11. And Dunbar field resounds thy praises loud,
12. And Worcester's laureate wreath. Yet much remains
13. To conquer still; peace hath her victories
14. No less renowned than war: new foes arise,
15. Threat'ning to bind our souls with secular chains:
16. Help us to save free conscience from the paw
17. Of hireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw.
