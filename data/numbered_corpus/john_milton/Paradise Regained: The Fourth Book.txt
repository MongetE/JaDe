1. Perplexed and troubled at his bad success
2. The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply,
3. Discovered in his fraud, thrown from his hope
4. So oft, and the persuasive rhetoric
5. That sleeked his tongue, and won so much on Eve,
6. So little here, nay lost.  But Eve was Eve;
7. This far his over-match, who, self-deceived
8. And rash, beforehand had no better weighed
9. The strength he was to cope with, or his own.
10. But—as a man who had been matchless held
11. In cunning, over-reached where least he thought,
12. To salve his credit, and for very spite,
13. Still will be tempting him who foils him still,
14. And never cease, though to his shame the more;
15. Or as a swarm of flies in vintage-time,
16. About the wine-press where sweet must is poured,
17. Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound;
18. Or surging waves against a solid rock,
19. Though all to shivers dashed, the assault renew,
20. (Vain battery!) and in froth or bubbles end—
21. So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse
22. Met ever, and to shameful silence brought,
23. Yet gives not o'er, though desperate of success,
24. And his vain importunity pursues.
25. He brought our Saviour to the western side
26. Of that high mountain, whence he might behold
27. Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide,
28. Washed by the southern sea, and on the north
29. To equal length backed with a ridge of hills
30. That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men
31. From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst
32. Divided by a river, off whose banks
33. On each side an Imperial City stood,
34. With towers and temples proudly elevate
35. On seven small hills, with palaces adorned,
36. Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts,
37. Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs,
38. Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes
39. Above the highth of mountains interposed—
40. By what strange parallax, or optic skill
41. Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass
42. Of telescope, were curious to enquire.
43. And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:—
44. "The city which thou seest no other deem
45. Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth
46. So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched
47. Of nations.  There the Capitol thou seest,
48. Above the rest lifting his stately head
49. On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel
50. Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine,
51. The imperial palace, compass huge, and high
52. The structure, skill of noblest architects,
53. With gilded battlements, conspicuous far,
54. Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires.
55. Many a fair edifice besides, more like
56. Houses of gods—so well I have disposed
57. My aerie microscope—thou may'st behold,
58. Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs
59. Carved work, the hand of famed artificers
60. In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold.
61. Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see
62. What conflux issuing forth, or entering in:
63. Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces
64. Hasting, or on return, in robes of state;
65. Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power;
66. Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings;
67. Or embassies from regions far remote,
68. In various habits, on the Appian road,
69. Or on the AEmilian—some from farthest south,
70. Syene, and where the shadow both way falls,
71. Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west,
72. The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea;
73. From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these),
74. From India and the Golden Chersoness,
75. And utmost Indian isle Taprobane,
76. Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed;
77. From Gallia, Gades, and the British west;
78. Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north
79. Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool.
80. All nations now to Rome obedience pay—
81. To Rome's great Emperor, whose wide domain,
82. In ample territory, wealth and power,
83. Civility of manners, arts and arms,
84. And long renown, thou justly may'st prefer
85. Before the Parthian.  These two thrones except,
86. The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight,
87. Shared among petty kings too far removed;
88. These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all
89. The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory.
90. This Emperor hath no son, and now is old,
91. Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired
92. To Capreae, an island small but strong
93. On the Campanian shore, with purpose there
94. His horrid lusts in private to enjoy;
95. Committing to a wicked favourite
96. All public cares, and yet of him suspicious;
97. Hated of all, and hating.  With what ease,
98. Endued with regal virtues as thou art,
99. Appearing, and beginning noble deeds,
100. Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne,
101. Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending,
102. A victor-people free from servile yoke!
103. And with my help thou may'st; to me the power
104. Is given, and by that right I give it thee.
105. Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world;
106. Aim at the highest; without the highest attained,
107. Will be for thee no sitting, or not long,
108. On David's throne, be prophesied what will."
109. To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:—
110. "Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew
111. Of luxury, though called magnificence,
112. More than of arms before, allure mine eye,
113. Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell
114. Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts
115. On citron tables or Atlantic stone
116. (For I have also heard, perhaps have read),
117. Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne,
118. Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold,
119. Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems
120. And studs of pearl—to me should'st tell, who thirst
121. And hunger still.  Then embassies thou shew'st
122. From nations far and nigh!  What honour that,
123. But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear
124. So many hollow compliments and lies,
125. Outlandish flatteries?  Then proceed'st to talk
126. Of the Emperor, how easily subdued,
127. How gloriously.  I shall, thou say'st, expel
128. A brutish monster: what if I withal
129. Expel a Devil who first made him such?
130. Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out;
131. For him I was not sent, nor yet to free
132. That people, victor once, now vile and base,
133. Deservedly made vassal—who, once just,
134. Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well,
135. But govern ill the nations under yoke,
136. Peeling their provinces, exhausted all
137. By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown
138. Of triumph, that insulting vanity;
139. Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured
140. Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed;
141. Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still,
142. And from the daily Scene effeminate.
143. What wise and valiant man would seek to free
144. These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved,
145. Or could of inward slaves make outward free?
146. Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit
147. On David's throne, it shall be like a tree
148. Spreading and overshadowing all the earth,
149. Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash
150. All monarchies besides throughout the world;
151. And of my Kingdom there shall be no end.
152. Means there shall be to this; but what the means
153. Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell."
154. To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:—
155. "I see all offers made by me how slight
156. Thou valuest, because offered, and reject'st.
157. Nothing will please the difficult and nice,
158. Or nothing more than still to contradict.
159. On the other side know also thou that I
160. On what I offer set as high esteem,
161. Nor what I part with mean to give for naught,
162. All these, which in a moment thou behold'st,
163. The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give
164. (For, given to me, I give to whom I please),
165. No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else—
166. On this condition, if thou wilt fall down,
167. And worship me as thy superior Lord
168. (Easily done), and hold them all of me;
169. For what can less so great a gift deserve?"
170. Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:—
171. "I never liked thy talk, thy offers less;
172. Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter
173. The abominable terms, impious condition.
174. But I endure the time, till which expired
175. Thou hast permission on me.  It is written,
176. The first of all commandments, 'Thou shalt worship
177. The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.'
178. And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound
179. To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed
180. For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve,
181. And more blasphemous; which expect to rue.
182. The kingdoms of the world to thee were given!
183. Permitted rather, and by thee usurped;
184. Other donation none thou canst produce.
185. If given, by whom but by the King of kings,
186. God over all supreme?  If given to thee,
187. By thee how fairly is the Giver now
188. Repaid!  But gratitude in thee is lost
189. Long since.  Wert thou so void of fear or shame
190. As offer them to me, the Son of God—
191. To me my own, on such abhorred pact,
192. That I fall down and worship thee as God?
193. Get thee behind me!  Plain thou now appear'st
194. That Evil One, Satan for ever damned."
195. To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:—
196. "Be not so sore offended, Son of God—
197. Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men—
198. If I, to try whether in higher sort
199. Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed
200. What both from Men and Angels I receive,
201. Tetrarchs of Fire, Air, Flood, and on the Earth
202. Nations besides from all the quartered winds—
203. God of this World invoked, and World beneath.
204. Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold
205. To me most fatal, me it most concerns.
206. The trial hath indamaged thee no way,
207. Rather more honour left and more esteem;
208. Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed.
209. Therefore let pass, as they are transitory,
210. The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more
211. Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not.
212. And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined
213. Than to a worldly crown, addicted more
214. To contemplation and profound dispute;
215. As by that early action may be judged,
216. When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st
217. Alone into the Temple, there wast found
218. Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant
219. On points and questions fitting Moses' chair,
220. Teaching, not taught.  The childhood shews the man,
221. As morning shews the day.  Be famous, then,
222. By wisdom; as thy empire must extend,
223. So let extend thy mind o'er all the world
224. In knowledge; all things in it comprehend.
225. All knowledge is not couched in Moses' law,
226. The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote;
227. The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach
228. To admiration, led by Nature's light;
229. And with the Gentiles much thou must converse,
230. Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean'st.
231. Without their learning, how wilt thou with them,
232. Or they with thee, hold conversation meet?
233. How wilt thou reason with them, how refute
234. Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes?
235. Error by his own arms is best evinced.
236. Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount,
237. Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold
238. Where on the AEgean shore a city stands,
239. Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil—
240. Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts
241. And Eloquence, native to famous wits
242. Or hospitable, in her sweet recess,
243. City or suburban, studious walks and shades.
244. See there the olive-grove of Academe,
245. Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird
246. Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long;
247. There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound
248. Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites
249. To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls
250. His whispering stream.  Within the walls then view
251. The schools of ancient sages—his who bred
252. Great Alexander to subdue the world,
253. Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next.
254. There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power
255. Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit
256. By voice or hand, and various-measured verse,
257. AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes,
258. And his who gave them breath, but higher sung,
259. Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called,
260. Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own.
261. Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught
262. In chorus or iambic, teachers best
263. Of moral prudence, with delight received
264. In brief sententious precepts, while they treat
265. Of fate, and chance, and change in human life,
266. High actions and high passions best describing.
267. Thence to the famous Orators repair,
268. Those ancient whose resistless eloquence
269. Wielded at will that fierce democraty,
270. Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece
271. To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne.
272. To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear,
273. From heaven descended to the low-roofed house
274. Of Socrates—see there his tenement—
275. Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced
276. Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth
277. Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools
278. Of Academics old and new, with those
279. Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect
280. Epicurean, and the Stoic severe.
281. These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home,
282. Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight;
283. These rules will render thee a king complete
284. Within thyself, much more with empire joined."
285. To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:—
286. "Think not but that I know these things; or, think
287. I know them not, not therefore am I short
288. Of knowing what I ought.  He who receives
289. Light from above, from the Fountain of Light,
290. No other doctrine needs, though granted true;
291. But these are false, or little else but dreams,
292. Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm.
293. The first and wisest of them all professed
294. To know this only, that he nothing knew;
295. The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits;
296. A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense;
297. Others in virtue placed felicity,
298. But virtue joined with riches and long life;
299. In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease;
300. The Stoic last in philosophic pride,
301. By him called virtue, and his virtuous man,
302. Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing,
303. Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer,
304. As fearing God nor man, contemning all
305. Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life—
306. Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can;
307. For all his tedious talk is but vain boast,
308. Or subtle shifts conviction to evade.
309. Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead,
310. Ignorant of themselves, of God much more,
311. And how the World began, and how Man fell,
312. Degraded by himself, on grace depending?
313. Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry;
314. And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves
315. All glory arrogate, to God give none;
316. Rather accuse him under usual names,
317. Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite
318. Of mortal things.  Who, therefore, seeks in these
319. True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion
320. Far worse, her false resemblance only meets,
321. An empty cloud.  However, many books,
322. Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads
323. Incessantly, and to his reading brings not
324. A spirit and judgment equal or superior,
325. (And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek?)
326. Uncertain and unsettled still remains,
327. Deep-versed in books and shallow in himself,
328. Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys
329. And trifles for choice matters, worth a sponge,
330. As children gathering pebbles on the shore.
331. Or, if I would delight my private hours
332. With music or with poem, where so soon
333. As in our native language can I find
334. That solace?  All our Law and Story strewed
335. With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed,
336. Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon
337. That pleased so well our victor's ear, declare
338. That rather Greece from us these arts derived—
339. Ill imitated while they loudest sing
340. The vices of their deities, and their own,
341. In fable, hymn, or song, so personating
342. Their gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame.
343. Remove their swelling epithetes, thick-laid
344. As varnish on a harlot's cheek, the rest,
345. Thin-sown with aught of profit or delight,
346. Will far be found unworthy to compare
347. With Sion's songs, to all true tastes excelling,
348. Where God is praised aright and godlike men,
349. The Holiest of Holies and his Saints
350. (Such are from God inspired, not such from thee);
351. Unless where moral virtue is expressed
352. By light of Nature, not in all quite lost.
353. Their orators thou then extoll'st as those
354. The top of eloquence—statists indeed,
355. And lovers of their country, as may seem;
356. But herein to our Prophets far beneath,
357. As men divinely taught, and better teaching
358. The solid rules of civil government,
359. In their majestic, unaffected style,
360. Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome.
361. In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt,
362. What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so,
363. What ruins kingdoms, and lays cities flat;
364. These only, with our Law, best form a king."
365. So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now
366. Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent),
367. Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:—
368. "Since neither wealth nor honour, arms nor arts,
369. Kingdom nor empire, pleases thee, nor aught
370. By me proposed in life contemplative
371. Or active, tended on by glory or fame,
372. What dost thou in this world?  The Wilderness
373. For thee is fittest place: I found thee there,
374. And thither will return thee.  Yet remember
375. What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause
376. To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus
377. Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid,
378. Which would have set thee in short time with ease
379. On David's throne, or throne of all the world,
380. Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,
381. When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled.
382. Now, contrary—if I read aught in heaven,
383. Or heaven write aught of fate—by what the stars
384. Voluminous, or single characters
385. In their conjunction met, give me to spell,
386. Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate,
387. Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries,
388. Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death.
389. A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom,
390. Real or allegoric, I discern not;
391. Nor when: eternal sure—as without end,
392. Without beginning; for no date prefixed
393. Directs me in the starry rubric set."
394. So saying, he took (for still he knew his power
395. Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness
396. Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there,
397. Feigning to disappear.  Darkness now rose,
398. As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night,
399. Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both,
400. Privation mere of light and absent day.
401. Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind
402. After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore,
403. Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest,
404. Wherever, under some concourse of shades,
405. Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield
406. From dews and damps of night his sheltered head;
407. But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head
408. The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams
409. Disturbed his sleep.  And either tropic now
410. 'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds
411. From many a horrid rift abortive poured
412. Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire,
413. In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds
414. Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad
415. From the four hinges of the world, and fell
416. On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines,
417. Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks,
418. Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,
419. Or torn up sheer.  Ill wast thou shrouded then,
420. O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st
421. Unshaken!  Nor yet staid the terror there:
422. Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round
423. Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked,
424. Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou
425. Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace.
426. Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair
427. Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey,
428. Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar
429. Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds,
430. And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised
431. To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.
432. And now the sun with more effectual beams
433. Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet
434. From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds,
435. Who all things now behold more fresh and green,
436. After a night of storm so ruinous,
437. Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray,
438. To gratulate the sweet return of morn.
439. Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn,
440. Was absent, after all his mischief done,
441. The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem
442. Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came;
443. Yet with no new device (they all were spent),
444. Rather by this his last affront resolved,
445. Desperate of better course, to vent his rage
446. And mad despite to be so oft repelled.
447. Him walking on a sunny hill he found,
448. Backed on the north and west by a thick wood;
449. Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape,
450. And in a careless mood thus to him said:—
451. "Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God,
452. After a dismal night.  I heard the wrack,
453. As earth and sky would mingle; but myself
454. Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them,
455. As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven,
456. Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath,
457. Are to the main as inconsiderable
458. And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze
459. To man's less universe, and soon are gone.
460. Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light
461. On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent,
462. Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,
463. Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point,
464. They oft fore-signify and threaten ill.
465. This tempest at this desert most was bent;
466. Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st.
467. Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject
468. The perfect season offered with my aid
469. To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong
470. All to the push of fate, pursue thy way
471. Of gaining David's throne no man knows when
472. (For both the when and how is nowhere told),
473. Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt;
474. For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing
475. The time and means?  Each act is rightliest done
476. Not when it must, but when it may be best.
477. If thou observe not this, be sure to find
478. What I foretold thee—many a hard assay
479. Of dangers, and adversities, and pains,
480. Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold;
481. Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round,
482. So many terrors, voices, prodigies,
483. May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign."
484. So talked he, while the Son of God went on,
485. And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:—
486. "Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm
487. Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none.
488. I never feared they could, though noising loud
489. And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs
490. Betokening or ill-boding I contemn
491. As false portents, not sent from God, but thee;
492. Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing,
493. Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting,
494. At least might seem to hold all power of thee,
495. Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God;
496. And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify
497. Me to thy will!  Desist (thou art discerned,
498. And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest."
499. To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:—
500. "Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!
501. For Son of God to me is yet in doubt.
502. Of the Messiah I have heard foretold
503. By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length
504. Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew,
505. And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field,
506. On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born.
507. From that time seldom have I ceased to eye
508. Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,
509. Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;
510. Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all
511. Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest
512. (Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven
513. Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved.
514. Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view
515. And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn
516. In what degree or meaning thou art called
517. The Son of God, which bears no single sense.
518. The Son of God I also am, or was;
519. And, if I was, I am; relation stands:
520. All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought
521. In some respect far higher so declared.
522. Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour,
523. And followed thee still on to this waste wild,
524. Where, by all best conjectures, I collect
525. Thou art to be my fatal enemy.
526. Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek
527. To understand my adversary, who
528. And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent;
529. By parle or composition, truce or league,
530. To win him, or win from him what I can.
531. And opportunity I here have had
532. To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee
533. Proof against all temptation, as a rock
534. Of adamant and as a centre, firm
535. To the utmost of mere man both wise and good,
536. Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory,
537. Have been before contemned, and may again.
538. Therefore, to know what more thou art than man,
539. Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven,
540. Another method I must now begin."
541. So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing
542. Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,
543. Over the wilderness and o'er the plain,
544. Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,
545. The Holy City, lifted high her towers,
546. And higher yet the glorious Temple reared
547. Her pile, far off appearing like a mount
548. Of alablaster, topt with golden spires:
549. There, on the highest pinnacle, he set
550. The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:—
551. "There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright
552. Will ask thee skill.  I to thy Father's house
553. Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best.
554. Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand,
555. Cast thyself down.  Safely, if Son of God;
556. For it is written, 'He will give command
557. Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands
558. They shall uplift thee, lest at any time
559. Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.'"
560. To whom thus Jesus: "Also it is written,
561. 'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'"  He said, and stood;
562. But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell.
563. As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare
564. Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove
565. With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose,
566. Receiving from his mother Earth new strength,
567. Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined,
568. Throttled at length in the air expired and fell,
569. So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud,
570. Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride
571. Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall;
572. And, as that Theban monster that proposed
573. Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured,
574. That once found out and solved, for grief and spite
575. Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep,
576. So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend,
577. And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought
578. Joyless triumphals of his hoped success,
579. Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,
580. Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.
581. So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe
582. Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,
583. Who on their plumy vans received Him soft
584. From his uneasy station, and upbore,
585. As on a floating couch, through the blithe air;
586. Then, in a flowery valley, set him down
587. On a green bank, and set before him spread
588. A table of celestial food, divine
589. Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life,
590. And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,
591. That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired
592. What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired,
593. Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires
594. Sung heavenly anthems of his victory
595. Over temptation and the Tempter proud:—
596. "True Image of the Father, whether throned
597. In the bosom of bliss, and light of light
598. Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined
599. In fleshly tabernacle and human form,
600. Wandering the wilderness—whatever place,
601. Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing
602. The Son of God, with Godlike force endued
603. Against the attempter of thy Father's throne
604. And thief of Paradise!  Him long of old
605. Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast
606. With all his army; now thou hast avenged
607. Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing
608. Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise,
609. And frustrated the conquest fraudulent.
610. He never more henceforth will dare set foot
611. In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke.
612. For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed,
613. A fairer Paradise is founded now
614. For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou,
615. A Saviour, art come down to reinstall;
616. Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be,
617. Of tempter and temptation without fear.
618. But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long
619. Rule in the clouds.  Like an autumnal star,
620. Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down
621. Under his feet.  For proof, ere this thou feel'st
622. Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound)
623. By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell
624. No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues
625. Thy bold attempt.  Hereafter learn with awe
626. To dread the Son of God.  He, all unarmed,
627. Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice,
628. From thy demoniac holds, possession foul—
629. Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly,
630. And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,
631. Lest he command them down into the Deep,
632. Bound, and to torment sent before their time.
633. Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds,
634. Queller of Satan!  On thy glorious work
635. Now enter, and begin to save Mankind."
636. Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek,
637. Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed,
638. Brought on his way with joy.  He, unobserved,
639. Home to his mother's house private returned.

640. THE END
