1. IX

2. Lady that in the prime of earliest youth,
3. Wisely hath shun'd the broad way and the green,
4. And with those few art eminently seen,
5. That labour up the Hill of heav'nly Truth,
6. The better part with Mary and with Ruth,
7. Chosen thou hast, and they that overween,
8. And at thy growing vertues fret their spleen,
9. No anger find in thee, but pity and ruth.
10. Thy care is fixt and zealously attends
11. To fill thy odorous Lamp with deeds of light,
12. And Hope that reaps not shame.  Therefore be sure
13. Thou, when the Bridegroom with his feastfull friends
14. Passes to bliss at the mid hour of night,
15. Hast gain'd thy entrance, Virgin wise and pure.

16. Note: 5 with Ruth] the Ruth  1645.
