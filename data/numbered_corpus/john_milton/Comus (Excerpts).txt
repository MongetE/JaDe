1. SONG1-
2. Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph that liv'st unseen
3. -
4. Within thy airy shell
5. -
6. By slow Meander's margent green,
7. -
8. And in the violet-imbroider'd vale
9. -
10. Where the love-lorn nightingale
11. -
12. Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well:
13. -
14. Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
15. -
16. That likest thy Narcissus are?
17. -
18. O if thou have
19. -

20. Hid them in some flow'ry cave,
21. -

22. Tell me but where
23. -

24. Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere,
25. -

26. So mayst thou be translated to the skies,
27. -

28. And give resounding grace to all heav'ns harmonies.

29. SONG
30. -


31. Sabrina fair
32. -


33. Listen where thou art sitting
34. -


35. Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,
36. -


37. In twisted braids of lilies knitting
38. -


39. The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;
40. -


41. Listen for dear honour's sake,
42. -


43. Goddess of the silver lake,
44. -


45. Listen and save.


46. -


47. Listen and appear to us
48. -


49. In name of great Oceanus,
50. -


51. By the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,
52. -


53. And Tethys' grave majestic pace;
54. -


55. By hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,
56. -


57. And the Carpathian wizard's hook;
58. -


59. By scaly Triton's winding shell,
60. -


61. And old soothsaying Glaucus' spell;
62. -


63. By Leucothea's lovely hands,
64. -


65. And her son that rules the strands;
66. -


67. By Thetis' tinsel-slipper'd feet,
68. -


69. And the songs of Sirens sweet;
70. -


71. By dead Parthenope's dear tomb,
72. -


73. And fair Ligea's golden comb,
74. -


75. Wherewith she sits on diamond rocks
76. -


77. Sleeking her soft alluring locks;
78. -


79. By all the nymphs that nightly dance
80. -


81. Upon thy streams with wily glance,
82. -


83. Rise, rise, and heave thy rosy head
84. -


85. From thy coral-pav'n bed,
86. -


87. And bridle in thy headlong wave,
88. -


89. Till thou our summons answer'd have.
90. -


91. Listen and save.


92. SABRINA RISES, ATTENDED BY WATER-NYMPHS, AND SINGS
93. -


94. By the rushy-fringed bank,
95. -


96. Where grows the willow and the osier dank,
97. -


98. My sliding chariot stays,
99. -


100. Thick set with agate, and the azurn sheen
101. -


102. Of turkis blue, and em'rald green
103. -


104. That in the channel strays,
105. -


106. Whilst from off the waters fleet
107. -


108. Thus I set my printless feet
109. -


110. O'er the cowslip's velvet head,
111. -


112. That bends not as I tread;
113. -


114. Gentle swain at thy request
115. -


116. I am here.
