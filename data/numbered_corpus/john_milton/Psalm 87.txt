1. Among the holy Mountains high
2. Is his foundation fast,
3. There Seated in his Sanctuary,
4. His Temple there is plac't.
5. Sions fair Gates the Lord loves more
6. Then all the dwellings faire
7. Of Jacobs Land, though there be store,
8. And all within his care.
9. City of God, most glorious things
10. Of thee abroad are spoke;
11. I mention Egypt, where proud Kings
12. Did our forefathers yoke,
13. I mention Babel to my friends,
14. Philistia full of scorn,
15. And Tyre with Ethiops utmost ends,
16. Lo this man there was born:
17. But twise that praise shall in our ear
18. Be said of Sion last
19. This and this man was born in her,
20. High God shall fix her fast.
21. The Lord shall write it in a Scrowle
22. That ne're shall be out-worn
23. When he the Nations doth enrowle
24. That this man there was born.
25. Both they who sing, and they who dance
26. With sacred Songs are there,
27. In thee fresh brooks, and soft streams glance
28. And all my fountains clear.
