1. METHOUGHT I saw my late espoused Saint
2. Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,
3. Whom Joves great Son to her glad Husband gave,
4. Rescu'd from death by force though pale and faint.
5. Mine as whom washt from spot of child-bed taint,
6. Purification in the old Law did save,
7. And such, as yet once more I trust to have
8. Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,
9. Came vested all in white, pure as her mind:
10. Her face was vail'd, yet to my fancied sight,
11. Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shin'd
12. So clear, as in no face with more delight.
13. But O as to embrace me she enclin'd
14. I wak'd, she fled, and day brought back my night.
