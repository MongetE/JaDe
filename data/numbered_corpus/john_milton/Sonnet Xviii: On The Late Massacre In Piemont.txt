1. Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughter'd saints, whose bones
2. Lie scatter'd on the Alpine mountains cold,
3. Ev'n them who kept thy truth so pure of old,
4. When all our fathers worshipp'd stocks and stones;
5. Forget not: in thy book record their groans
6. Who were thy sheep and in their ancient fold
7. Slain by the bloody Piemontese that roll'd
8. Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans
9. The vales redoubl'd to the hills, and they
10. To Heav'n. Their martyr'd blood and ashes sow
11. O'er all th' Italian fields where still doth sway
12. The triple tyrant; that from these may grow
13. A hundred-fold, who having learnt thy way
14. Early may fly the Babylonian woe.
