1. To the Lady Margaret Ley

2. Daughter to that good Earl, once President
3. Of England's Council, and her Treasury,
4. Who lived in both, unstained with gold or fee,
5. And left them both, more in himself content,
6. Till sad the breaking of that Parliament
7. Broke him, as that dishonest victory
8. At Chaeronea, fatal to liberty,
9. Killed with report that old man eloquent.
10. Though later born than to have known the days
11. Wherein your father flourished, yet by you,
12. Madam, methinks I see him living yet;
13. So well your words his noble virtues praise,
14. That all both judge you to relate them true,
15. And to possess them, honoured Margaret.
