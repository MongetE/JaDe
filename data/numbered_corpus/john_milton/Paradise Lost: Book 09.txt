1. No more of talk where God or Angel guest
2. With Man, as with his friend, familiar us'd,
3. To sit indulgent, and with him partake
4. Rural repast; permitting him the while
5. Venial discourse unblam'd. I now must change
6. Those notes to tragick; foul distrust, and breach
7. Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,
8. And disobedience: on the part of Heaven
9. Now alienated, distance and distaste,
10. Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,
11. That brought into this world a world of woe,
12. Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery
13. Death's harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument
14. Not less but more heroick than the wrath
15. Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued
16. Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage
17. Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd;
18. Or Neptune's ire, or Juno's, that so long
19. Perplexed the Greek, and Cytherea's son:

20. If answerable style I can obtain
21. Of my celestial patroness, who deigns
22. Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,
23. And dictates to me slumbering; or inspires
24. Easy my unpremeditated verse:
25. Since first this subject for heroick song
26. Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;
27. Not sedulous by nature to indite
28. Wars, hitherto the only argument
29. Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect
30. With long and tedious havock fabled knights
31. In battles feign'd; the better fortitude
32. Of patience and heroick martyrdom
33. Unsung; or to describe races and games,
34. Or tilting furniture, imblazon'd shields,
35. Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds,
36. Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights
37. At joust and tournament; then marshall'd feast
38. Serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneshals;
39. The skill of artifice or office mean,
40. Not that which justly gives heroick name
41. To person, or to poem.  Me, of these
42. Nor skill'd nor studious, higher argument
43. Remains; sufficient of itself to raise
44. That name, unless an age too late, or cold
45. Climate, or years, damp my intended wing
46. Depress'd; and much they may, if all be mine,
47. Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear.
48. The sun was sunk, and after him the star
49. Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring
50. Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter
51. "twixt day and night, and now from end to end
52. Night's hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round:
53. When satan, who late fled before the threats
54. Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd
55. In meditated fraud and malice, bent
56. On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap
57. Of heavier on himself, fearless returned
58. From compassing the earth; cautious of day,
59. Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried
60. His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim
61. That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,
62. The space of seven continued nights he rode
63. With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line
64. He circled; four times crossed the car of night
65. From pole to pole, traversing each colure;
66. On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse
67. From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth
68. Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,
69. Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change,
70. Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise,
71. Into a gulf shot under ground, till part
72. Rose up a fountain by the tree of life:
73. In with the river sunk, and with it rose
74. Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought
75. Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land,
76. From Eden over Pontus and the pool
77. Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob;
78. Downward as far antarctick; and in length,
79. West from Orontes to the ocean barred
80. At Darien ; thence to the land where flows
81. Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed
82. With narrow search; and with inspection deep
83. Considered every creature, which of all
84. Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found
85. The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.
86. Him after long debate, irresolute
87. Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose
88. Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom
89. To enter, and his dark suggestions hide
90. From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake
91. Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,
92. As from his wit and native subtlety
93. Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed,
94. Doubt might beget of diabolick power
95. Active within, beyond the sense of brute.
96. Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief
97. His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.
98. More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built
99. With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
100. O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred
101. For what God, after better, worse would build?
102. Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens
103. That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,
104. Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,
105. In thee concentring all their precious beams
106. Of sacred influence!  As God in Heaven
107. Is center, yet extends to all; so thou,
108. Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee,
109. Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears
110. Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth
111. Of creatures animate with gradual life
112. Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.
113. With what delight could I have walked thee round,
114. If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange
115. Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,
116. Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned,
117. Rocks, dens, and caves!  But I in none of these
118. Find place or refuge; and the more I see
119. Pleasures about me, so much more I feel
120. Torment within me, as from the hateful siege
121. Of contraries: all good to me becomes
122. Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.
123. But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven
124. To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven's Supreme;
125. Nor hope to be myself less miserable
126. By what I seek, but others to make such
127. As I, though thereby worse to me redound:
128. For only in destroying I find ease
129. To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed,
130. Or won to what may work his utter loss,
131. For whom all this was made, all this will soon
132. Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe;
133. In woe then; that destruction wide may range:
134. To me shall be the glory sole among
135. The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred
136. What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days
137. Continued making; and who knows how long
138. Before had been contriving? though perhaps
139. Not longer than since I, in one night, freed
140. From servitude inglorious well nigh half
141. The angelick name, and thinner left the throng
142. Of his adorers: He, to be avenged,
143. And to repair his numbers thus impaired,
144. Whether such virtue spent of old now failed
145. More Angels to create, if they at least
146. Are his created, or, to spite us more,
147. Determined to advance into our room
148. A creature formed of earth, and him endow,
149. Exalted from so base original,
150. With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed,
151. He effected; Man he made, and for him built
152. Magnificent this world, and earth his seat,
153. Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!
154. Subjected to his service angel-wings,
155. And flaming ministers to watch and tend
156. Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance
157. I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist
158. Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry
159. In every bush and brake, where hap may find
160. The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds
161. To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
162. O foul descent! that I, who erst contended
163. With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained
164. Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime,
165. This essence to incarnate and imbrute,
166. That to the highth of Deity aspired!
167. But what will not ambition and revenge
168. Descend to?  Who aspires, must down as low
169. As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,
170. To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,
171. Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:
172. Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,
173. Since higher I fall short, on him who next
174. Provokes my envy, this new favourite
175. Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,
176. Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised
177. From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.
178. So saying, through each thicket dank or dry,
179. Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on
180. His midnight-search, where soonest he might find
181. The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found
182. In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled,
183. His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles:
184. Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den,
185. Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb,
186. Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth
187. The Devil entered; and his brutal sense,
188. In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired
189. With act intelligential; but his sleep
190. Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.
191. Now, when as sacred light began to dawn
192. In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed
193. Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe,
194. From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise
195. To the Creator, and his nostrils fill
196. With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,
197. And joined their vocal worship to the quire
198. Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake
199. The season prime for sweetest scents and airs:
200. Then commune, how that day they best may ply
201. Their growing work: for much their work out-grew
202. The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide,
203. And Eve first to her husband thus began.
204. Adam, well may we labour still to dress
205. This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,
206. Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands
207. Aid us, the work under our labour grows,
208. Luxurious by restraint; what we by day
209. Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,
210. One night or two with wanton growth derides
211. Tending to wild.  Thou therefore now advise,
212. Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present:
213. Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice
214. Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind
215. The woodbine round this arbour, or direct
216. The clasping ivy where to climb; while I,
217. In yonder spring of roses intermixed
218. With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:
219. For, while so near each other thus all day
220. Our task we choose, what wonder if so near
221. Looks intervene and smiles, or object new
222. Casual discourse draw on; which intermits
223. Our day's work, brought to little, though begun
224. Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?
225. To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.
226. Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond
227. Compare above all living creatures dear!
228. Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed,
229. How we might best fulfil the work which here
230. God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass
231. Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found
232. In woman, than to study houshold good,
233. And good works in her husband to promote.
234. Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed
235. Labour, as to debar us when we need
236. Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,
237. Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse
238. Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow,
239. To brute denied, and are of love the food;
240. Love, not the lowest end of human life.
241. For not to irksome toil, but to delight,
242. He made us, and delight to reason joined.
243. These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
244. Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide
245. As we need walk, till younger hands ere long
246. Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps
247. Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:
248. For solitude sometimes is best society,
249. And short retirement urges sweet return.
250. But other doubt possesses me, lest harm
251. Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest
252. What hath been warned us, what malicious foe
253. Envying our happiness, and of his own
254. Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame
255. By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand
256. Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find
257. His wish and best advantage, us asunder;
258. Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each
259. To other speedy aid might lend at need:
260. Whether his first design be to withdraw
261. Our fealty from God, or to disturb
262. Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss
263. Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;
264. Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side
265. That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.
266. The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,
267. Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,
268. Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.
269. To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,
270. As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,
271. With sweet austere composure thus replied.
272. Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord!
273. That such an enemy we have, who seeks
274. Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,
275. And from the parting Angel over-heard,
276. As in a shady nook I stood behind,
277. Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.
278. But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
279. To God or thee, because we have a foe
280. May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
281. His violence thou fearest not, being such
282. As we, not capable of death or pain,
283. Can either not receive, or can repel.
284. His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers
285. Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love
286. Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;
287. Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,
288. Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?
289. To whom with healing words Adam replied.
290. Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!
291. For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:
292. Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
293. Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid
294. The attempt itself, intended by our foe.
295. For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses
296. The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed
297. Not incorruptible of faith, not proof
298. Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn
299. And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,
300. Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,
301. If such affront I labour to avert
302. From thee alone, which on us both at once
303. The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;
304. Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.
305. Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;
306. Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce
307. Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid.
308. I, from the influence of thy looks, receive
309. Access in every virtue; in thy sight
310. More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were
311. Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,
312. Shame to be overcome or over-reached,
313. Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.
314. Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
315. When I am present, and thy trial choose
316. With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?
317. So spake domestick Adam in his care
318. And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought
319. Less attributed to her faith sincere,
320. Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.
321. If this be our condition, thus to dwell
322. In narrow circuit straitened by a foe,
323. Subtle or violent, we not endued
324. Single with like defence, wherever met;
325. How are we happy, still in fear of harm?
326. But harm precedes not sin: only our foe,
327. Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem
328. Of our integrity: his foul esteem
329. Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns
330. Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared
331. By us? who rather double honour gain
332. From his surmise proved false; find peace within,
333. Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.
334. And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed
335. Alone, without exteriour help sustained?
336. Let us not then suspect our happy state
337. Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,
338. As not secure to single or combined.
339. Frail is our happiness, if this be so,
340. And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.
341. To whom thus Adam fervently replied.
342. O Woman, best are all things as the will
343. Of God ordained them: His creating hand
344. Nothing imperfect or deficient left
345. Of all that he created, much less Man,
346. Or aught that might his happy state secure,
347. Secure from outward force; within himself
348. The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
349. Against his will he can receive no harm.
350. But God left free the will; for what obeys
351. Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,
352. But bid her well be ware, and still erect;
353. Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised,
354. She dictate false; and mis-inform the will
355. To do what God expressly hath forbid.
356. Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,
357. That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.
358. Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;
359. Since Reason not impossibly may meet
360. Some specious object by the foe suborned,
361. And fall into deception unaware,
362. Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.
363. Seek not temptation then, which to avoid
364. Were better, and most likely if from me
365. Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
366. Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve
367. First thy obedience; the other who can know,
368. Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
369. But, if thou think, trial unsought may find
370. Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,
371. Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;
372. Go in thy native innocence, rely
373. On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!
374. For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.
375. So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve
376. Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.
377. With thy permission then, and thus forewarned
378. Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
379. Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,
380. May find us both perhaps far less prepared,
381. The willinger I go, nor much expect
382. A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;
383. So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
384. Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand
385. Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light,
386. Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train,
387. Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self
388. In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport,
389. Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,
390. But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,
391. Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.
392. To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,
393. Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled
394. Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,
395. Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
396. Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
397. Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
398. Oft he to her his charge of quick return
399. Repeated; she to him as oft engaged
400. To be returned by noon amid the bower,
401. And all things in best order to invite
402. Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose.
403. O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,
404. Of thy presumed return! event perverse!
405. Thou never from that hour in Paradise
406. Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;
407. Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,
408. Waited with hellish rancour imminent
409. To intercept thy way, or send thee back
410. Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!
411. For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,
412. Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;
413. And on his quest, where likeliest he might find
414. The only two of mankind, but in them
415. The whole included race, his purposed prey.
416. In bower and field he sought, where any tuft
417. Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,
418. Their tendance, or plantation for delight;
419. By fountain or by shady rivulet
420. He sought them both, but wished his hap might find
421. Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope
422. Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,
423. Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
424. Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,
425. Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round
426. About her glowed, oft stooping to support
427. Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay
428. Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,
429. Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays
430. Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while
431. Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,
432. From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.
433. Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed
434. Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;
435. Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen,
436. Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers
437. Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:
438. Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned
439. Or of revived Adonis, or renowned
440. Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son;
441. Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king
442. Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.
443. Much he the place admired, the person more.
444. As one who long in populous city pent,
445. Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,
446. Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe
447. Among the pleasant villages and farms
448. Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;
449. The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,
450. Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;
451. If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass,
452. What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;
453. She most, and in her look sums all delight:
454. Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold
455. This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve
456. Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form
457. Angelick, but more soft, and feminine,
458. Her graceful innocence, her every air
459. Of gesture, or least action, overawed
460. His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved
461. His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:
462. That space the Evil-one abstracted stood
463. From his own evil, and for the time remained
464. Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed,
465. Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:
466. But the hot Hell that always in him burns,
467. Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,
468. And tortures him now more, the more he sees
469. Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon
470. Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts
471. Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.
472. Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet
473. Compulsion thus transported, to forget
474. What hither brought us! hate, not love;nor hope
475. Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste
476. Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy,
477. Save what is in destroying; other joy
478. To me is lost.  Then, let me not let pass
479. Occasion which now smiles; behold alone
480. The woman, opportune to all attempts,
481. Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,
482. Whose higher intellectual more I shun,
483. And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb
484. Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;
485. Foe not informidable! exempt from wound,
486. I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain
487. Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.
488. She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!
489. Not terrible, though terrour be in love
490. And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,
491. Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;
492. The way which to her ruin now I tend.
493. So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed
494. In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve
495. Addressed his way: not with indented wave,
496. Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,
497. Circular base of rising folds, that towered
498. Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head
499. Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;
500. With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect
501. Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass
502. Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape
503. And lovely; never since of serpent-kind
504. Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed,
505. Hermione and Cadmus, or the god
506. In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed
507. Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;
508. He with Olympias; this with her who bore
509. Scipio, the highth of Rome.  With tract oblique
510. At first, as one who sought access, but feared
511. To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
512. As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought
513. Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind
514. Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail:
515. So varied he, and of his tortuous train
516. Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,
517. To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound
518. Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used
519. To such disport before her through the field,
520. From every beast; more duteous at her call,
521. Than at Circean call the herd disguised.
522. He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,
523. But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed
524. His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,
525. Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.
526. His gentle dumb expression turned at length
527. The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad
528. Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue
529. Organick, or impulse of vocal air,
530. His fraudulent temptation thus began.
531. Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps
532. Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm
533. Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,
534. Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze
535. Insatiate; I thus single;nor have feared
536. Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.
537. Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,
538. Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine
539. By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore
540. With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,
541. Where universally admired; but here
542. In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,
543. Beholders rude, and shallow to discern
544. Half what in thee is fair, one man except,
545. Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen
546. A Goddess among Gods, adored and served
547. By Angels numberless, thy daily train.
548. So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned:
549. Into the heart of Eve his words made way,
550. Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,
551. Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.
552. What may this mean? language of man pronounced
553. By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?
554. The first, at least, of these I thought denied
555. To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day,
556. Created mute to all articulate sound:
557. The latter I demur; for in their looks
558. Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.
559. Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field
560. I knew, but not with human voice endued;
561. Redouble then this miracle, and say,
562. How camest thou speakable of mute, and how
563. To me so friendly grown above the rest
564. Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
565. Say, for such wonder claims attention due.
566. To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.
567. Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!
568. Easy to me it is to tell thee all
569. What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:
570. I was at first as other beasts that graze
571. The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,
572. As was my food; nor aught but food discerned
573. Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:
574. Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced
575. A goodly tree far distant to behold
576. Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,
577. Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;
578. When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,
579. Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense
580. Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats
581. Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,
582. Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.
583. To satisfy the sharp desire I had
584. Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved
585. Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,
586. Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent
587. Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.
588. About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;
589. For, high from ground, the branches would require
590. Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree
591. All other beasts that saw, with like desire
592. Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
593. Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung
594. Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill
595. I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,
596. At feed or fountain, never had I found.
597. Sated at length, ere long I might perceive
598. Strange alteration in me, to degree
599. Of reason in my inward powers; and speech
600. Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.
601. Thenceforth to speculations high or deep
602. I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind
603. Considered all things visible in Heaven,
604. Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good:
605. But all that fair and good in thy divine
606. Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray,
607. United I beheld; no fair to thine
608. Equivalent or second! which compelled
609. Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come
610. And gaze, and worship thee of right declared
611. Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!
612. So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,
613. Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.
614. Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt
615. The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:
616. But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?
617. For many are the trees of God that grow
618. In Paradise, and various, yet unknown
619. To us; in such abundance lies our choice,
620. As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,
621. Still hanging incorruptible, till men
622. Grow up to their provision, and more hands
623. Help to disburden Nature of her birth.
624. To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.
625. Empress, the way is ready, and not long;
626. Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,
627. Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past
628. Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept
629. My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon
630. Lead then, said Eve.  He, leading, swiftly rolled
631. In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,
632. To mischief swift.  Hope elevates, and joy
633. Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,
634. Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night
635. Condenses, and the cold environs round,
636. Kindled through agitation to a flame,
637. Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,
638. Hovering and blazing with delusive light,
639. Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way
640. To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;
641. There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.
642. So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud
643. Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree
644. Of prohibition, root of all our woe;
645. Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.
646. Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,
647. Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,
648. The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;
649. Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.
650. But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;
651. God so commanded, and left that command
652. Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live
653. Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.
654. To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.
655. Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit
656. Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,
657. Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air$?
658. To whom thus Eve, yet sinless.  Of the fruit
659. Of each tree in the garden we may eat;
660. But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
661. The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat
662. Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
663. She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold
664. The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love
665. To Man, and indignation at his wrong,
666. New part puts on; and, as to passion moved,
667. Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act
668. Raised, as of some great matter to begin.
669. As when of old some orator renowned,
670. In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence
671. Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed,
672. Stood in himself collected; while each part,
673. Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue;
674. Sometimes in highth began, as no delay
675. Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right:
676. So standing, moving, or to highth up grown,
677. The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.
678. O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,
679. Mother of science! now I feel thy power
680. Within me clear; not only to discern
681. Things in their causes, but to trace the ways
682. Of highest agents, deemed however wise.
683. Queen of this universe! do not believe
684. Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die:
685. How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life
686. To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me,
687. Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,
688. And life more perfect have attained than Fate
689. Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.
690. Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast
691. Is open? or will God incense his ire
692. For such a petty trespass? and not praise
693. Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain
694. Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,
695. Deterred not from achieving what might lead
696. To happier life, knowledge of good and evil;
697. Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil
698. Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?
699. God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;
700. Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:
701. Your fear itself of death removes the fear.
702. Why then was this forbid?  Why, but to awe;
703. Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,
704. His worshippers?  He knows that in the day
705. Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear,
706. Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then
707. Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,
708. Knowing both good and evil, as they know.
709. That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man,
710. Internal Man, is but proportion meet;
711. I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.
712. So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off
713. Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished,
714. Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.
715. And what are Gods, that Man may not become
716. As they, participating God-like food?
717. The Gods are first, and that advantage use
718. On our belief, that all from them proceeds:
719. I question it; for this fair earth I see,
720. Warmed by the sun, producing every kind;
721. Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed
722. Knowledge of good and evil in this tree,
723. That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains
724. Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
725. The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
726. What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree
727. Impart against his will, if all be his?
728. Or is it envy? and can envy dwell
729. In heavenly breasts?  These, these, and many more
730. Causes import your need of this fair fruit.
731. Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!
732. He ended; and his words, replete with guile,
733. Into her heart too easy entrance won:
734. Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold
735. Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound
736. Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned
737. With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:
738. Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked
739. An eager appetite, raised by the smell
740. So savoury of that fruit, which with desire,
741. Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,
742. Solicited her longing eye; yet first
743. Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.
744. Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,
745. Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;
746. Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay
747. Gave elocution to the mute, and taught
748. The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:
749. Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,
750. Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree
751. Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;
752. Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding
753. Commends thee more, while it infers the good
754. By thee communicated, and our want:
755. For good unknown sure is not had; or, had
756. And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
757. In plain then, what forbids he but to know,
758. Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
759. Such prohibitions bind not.  But, if death
760. Bind us with after-bands, what profits then
761. Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat
762. Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!
763. How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives,
764. And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,
765. Irrational till then.  For us alone
766. Was death invented? or to us denied
767. This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?
768. For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first
769. Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy
770. The good befallen him, author unsuspect,
771. Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.
772. What fear I then? rather, what know to fear
773. Under this ignorance of good and evil,
774. Of God or death, of law or penalty?
775. Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,
776. Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,
777. Of virtue to make wise:  What hinders then
778. To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?
779. So saying, her rash hand in evil hour
780. Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!
781. Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,
782. Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,
783. That all was lost.  Back to the thicket slunk
784. The guilty Serpent; and well might;for Eve,
785. Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else
786. Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,
787. In fruit she never tasted, whether true
788. Or fancied so, through expectation high
789. Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.
790. Greedily she ingorged without restraint,
791. And knew not eating death:  Satiate at length,
792. And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon,
793. Thus to herself she pleasingly began.
794. O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees
795. In Paradise! of operation blest
796. To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.
797. And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end
798. Created; but henceforth my early care,
799. Not without song, each morning, and due praise,
800. Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease
801. Of thy full branches offered free to all;
802. Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature
803. In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know;
804. Though others envy what they cannot give:
805. For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here
806. Thus grown.  Experience, next, to thee I owe,
807. Best guide; not following thee, I had remained
808. In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way,
809. And givest access, though secret she retire.
810. And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high,
811. High, and remote to see from thence distinct
812. Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
813. May have diverted from continual watch
814. Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies
815. About him.  But to Adam in what sort
816. Shall I appear? shall I to him make known
817. As yet my change, and give him to partake
818. Full happiness with me, or rather not,
819. But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
820. Without copartner? so to add what wants
821. In female sex, the more to draw his love,
822. And render me more equal; and perhaps,
823. A thing not undesirable, sometime
824. Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free
825. This may be well:  But what if God have seen,
826. And death ensue? then I shall be no more!
827. And Adam, wedded to another Eve,
828. Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;
829. A death to think!  Confirmed then I resolve,
830. Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:
831. So dear I love him, that with him all deaths
832. I could endure, without him live no life.
833. So saying, from the tree her step she turned;
834. But first low reverence done, as to the Power
835. That dwelt within, whose presence had infused
836. Into the plant sciential sap, derived
837. From nectar, drink of Gods.  Adam the while,
838. Waiting desirous her return, had wove
839. Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn
840. Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;
841. As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.
842. Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new
843. Solace in her return, so long delayed:
844. Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,
845. Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;
846. And forth to meet her went, the way she took
847. That morn when first they parted: by the tree
848. Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met,
849. Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand
850. A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,
851. New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.
852. To him she hasted; in her face excuse
853. Came prologue, and apology too prompt;
854. Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.
855. Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?
856. Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived
857. Thy presence; agony of love till now
858. Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more
859. Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,
860. The pain of absence from thy sight.  But strange
861. Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:
862. This tree is not, as we are told, a tree
863. Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown
864. Opening the way, but of divine effect
865. To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;
866. And hath been tasted such:  The serpent wise,
867. Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,
868. Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become,
869. Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth
870. Endued with human voice and human sense,
871. Reasoning to admiration; and with me
872. Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I
873. Have also tasted, and have also found
874. The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes,
875. Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,
876. And growing up to Godhead; which for thee
877. Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
878. For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;
879. Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.
880. Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot
881. May join us, equal joy, as equal love;
882. Lest, thou not tasting, different degree
883. Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce
884. Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.
885. Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;
886. But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.
887. On the other side Adam, soon as he heard
888. The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,
889. Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill
890. Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;
891. From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve
892. Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:
893. Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length
894. First to himself he inward silence broke.
895. O fairest of Creation, last and best
896. Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled
897. Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,
898. Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
899. How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,
900. Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!
901. Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress
902. The strict forbiddance, how to violate
903. The sacred fruit forbidden!  Some cursed fraud
904. Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,
905. And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee
906. Certain my resolution is to die:
907. How can I live without thee! how forego
908. Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,
909. To live again in these wild woods forlorn!
910. Should God create another Eve, and I
911. Another rib afford, yet loss of thee
912. Would never from my heart: no, no!I feel
913. The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh,
914. Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state
915. Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.
916. So having said, as one from sad dismay
917. Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed
918. Submitting to what seemed remediless,
919. Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.
920. Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,
921. And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared,
922. Had it been only coveting to eye
923. That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,
924. Much more to taste it under ban to touch.
925. But past who can recall, or done undo?
926. Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so
927. Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact
928. Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,
929. Profaned first by the serpent, by him first
930. Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;
931. Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;
932. Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,
933. Higher degree of life; inducement strong
934. To us, as likely tasting to attain
935. Proportional ascent; which cannot be
936. But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.
937. Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
938. Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy
939. Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,
940. Set over all his works; which in our fall,
941. For us created, needs with us must fail,
942. Dependant made; so God shall uncreate,
943. Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;
944. Not well conceived of God, who, though his power
945. Creation could repeat, yet would be loth
946. Us to abolish, lest the Adversary
947. Triumph, and say; "Fickle their state whom God
948. "Most favours; who can please him long? Me first
949. "He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?"
950. Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.
951. However I with thee have fixed my lot,
952. Certain to undergo like doom:  If death
953. Consort with thee, death is to me as life;
954. So forcible within my heart I feel
955. The bond of Nature draw me to my own;
956. My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;
957. Our state cannot be severed; we are one,
958. One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.
959. So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.
960. O glorious trial of exceeding love,
961. Illustrious evidence, example high!
962. Engaging me to emulate; but, short
963. Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,
964. Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,
965. And gladly of our union hear thee speak,
966. One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof
967. This day affords, declaring thee resolved,
968. Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,
969. Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,
970. To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,
971. If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;
972. Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds,
973. Direct, or by occasion, hath presented
974. This happy trial of thy love, which else
975. So eminently never had been known?
976. Were it I thought death menaced would ensue
977. This my attempt, I would sustain alone
978. The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die
979. Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact
980. Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured
981. Remarkably so late of thy so true,
982. So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel
983. Far otherwise the event; not death, but life
984. Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,
985. Taste so divine, that what of sweet before
986. Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
987. On my experience, Adam, freely taste,
988. And fear of death deliver to the winds.
989. So saying, she embraced him, and for joy
990. Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love
991. Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur
992. Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.
993. In recompence for such compliance bad
994. Such recompence best merits from the bough
995. She gave him of that fair enticing fruit
996. With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat,
997. Against his better knowledge; not deceived,
998. But fondly overcome with female charm.
999. Earth trembled from her entrails, as again
1000. In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;
1001. Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops
1002. Wept at completing of the mortal sin
1003. Original: while Adam took no thought,
1004. Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate
1005. Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth
1006. Him with her loved society; that now,
1007. As with new wine intoxicated both,
1008. They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel
1009. Divinity within them breeding wings,
1010. Wherewith to scorn the earth:  But that false fruit
1011. Far other operation first displayed,
1012. Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve
1013. Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him
1014. As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:
1015. Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move.
1016. Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,
1017. And elegant, of sapience no small part;
1018. Since to each meaning savour we apply,
1019. And palate call judicious; I the praise
1020. Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.
1021. Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained
1022. From this delightful fruit, nor known till now
1023. True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be
1024. In things to us forbidden, it might be wished,
1025. For this one tree had been forbidden ten.
1026. But come, so well refreshed, now let us play,
1027. As meet is, after such delicious fare;
1028. For never did thy beauty, since the day
1029. I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned
1030. With all perfections, so inflame my sense
1031. With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now
1032. Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!
1033. So said he, and forbore not glance or toy
1034. Of amorous intent; well understood
1035. Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.
1036. Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank,
1037. Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered,
1038. He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch,
1039. Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,
1040. And hyacinth;  Earth's freshest softest lap.
1041. There they their fill of love and love's disport
1042. Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal,
1043. The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep
1044. Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play,
1045. Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit,
1046. That with exhilarating vapour bland
1047. About their spirits had played, and inmost powers
1048. Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep,
1049. Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams
1050. Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose
1051. As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,
1052. Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds
1053. How darkened; innocence, that as a veil
1054. Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;
1055. Just confidence, and native righteousness,
1056. And honour, from about them, naked left
1057. To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe
1058. Uncovered more.  So rose the Danite strong,
1059. Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap
1060. Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked
1061. Shorn of his strength.  They destitute and bare
1062. Of all their virtue:  Silent, and in face
1063. Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute:
1064. Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,
1065. At length gave utterance to these words constrained.
1066. O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear
1067. To that false worm, of whomsoever taught
1068. To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall,
1069. False in our promised rising; since our eyes
1070. Opened we find indeed, and find we know
1071. Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;
1072. Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;
1073. Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,
1074. Of innocence, of faith, of purity,
1075. Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,
1076. And in our faces evident the signs
1077. Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;
1078. Even shame, the last of evils; of the first
1079. Be sure then.--How shall I behold the face
1080. Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy
1081. And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes
1082. Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
1083. Insufferably bright.  O! might I here
1084. In solitude live savage; in some glade
1085. Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable
1086. To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad
1087. And brown as evening:  Cover me, ye Pines!
1088. Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs
1089. Hide me, where I may never see them more!--
1090. But let us now, as in bad plight, devise
1091. What best may for the present serve to hide
1092. The parts of each from other, that seem most
1093. To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen;
1094. Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed,
1095. And girded on our loins, may cover round
1096. Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame,
1097. There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.
1098. So counselled he, and both together went
1099. Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose
1100. The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,
1101. But such as at this day, to Indians known,
1102. In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms
1103. Branching so broad and long, that in the ground
1104. The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow
1105. About the mother tree, a pillared shade
1106. High over-arched, and echoing walks between:
1107. There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,
1108. Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds
1109. At loop-holes cut through thickest shade:  Those leaves
1110. They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe;
1111. And, with what skill they had, together sewed,
1112. To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide
1113. Their guilt and dreaded shame!  O, how unlike
1114. To that first naked glory!  Such of late
1115. Columbus found the American, so girt
1116. With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild
1117. Among the trees on isles and woody shores.
1118. Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part
1119. Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,
1120. They sat them down to weep; nor only tears
1121. Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within
1122. Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate,
1123. Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore
1124. Their inward state of mind, calm region once
1125. And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:
1126. For Understanding ruled not, and the Will
1127. Heard not her lore; both in subjection now
1128. To sensual Appetite, who from beneath
1129. Usurping over sovran Reason claimed
1130. Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,
1131. Adam, estranged in look and altered style,
1132. Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.
1133. Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid
1134. With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
1135. Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,
1136. I know not whence possessed thee; we had then
1137. Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled
1138. Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!
1139. Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
1140. The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
1141. Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.
1142. To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.
1143. What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!
1144. Imputest thou that to my default, or will
1145. Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows
1146. But might as ill have happened thou being by,
1147. Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there,
1148. Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned
1149. Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;
1150. No ground of enmity between us known,
1151. Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.
1152. Was I to have never parted from thy side?
1153. As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.
1154. Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head,
1155. Command me absolutely not to go,
1156. Going into such danger, as thou saidst?
1157. Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay;
1158. Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
1159. Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,
1160. Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.
1161. To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.
1162. Is this the love, is this the recompence
1163. Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed
1164. Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I;
1165. Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,
1166. Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?
1167. And am I now upbraided as the cause
1168. Of thy transgressing?  Not enough severe,
1169. It seems, in thy restraint:  What could I more
1170. I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold
1171. The danger, and the lurking enemy
1172. That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force;
1173. And force upon free will hath here no place.
1174. But confidence then bore thee on; secure
1175. Either to meet no danger, or to find
1176. Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps
1177. I also erred, in overmuch admiring
1178. What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought
1179. No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue
1180. The errour now, which is become my crime,
1181. And thou the accuser.  Thus it shall befall
1182. Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting,
1183. Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;
1184. And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,
1185. She first his weak indulgence will accuse.
1186. Thus they in mutual accusation spent
1187. The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;
1188. And of their vain contest appeared no end.
