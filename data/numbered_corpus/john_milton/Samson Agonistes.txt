1. Samson. A little onward lend thy guiding hand
2. To these dark steps, a little further on;
3. For yonder bank hath choice of sun or shade.
4. There I am wont to sit, when any chance
5. Relieves me from my task of servile toil,
6. Daily in the common prison else enjoined me,
7. Where I, a prisoner chained, scarce freely draw
8. The air, imprisoned also, close and damp,
9. Unwholesome draught. But here I feel amends—
10. The breath of Heaven fresh blowing, pure and sweet,
11. With day-spring born; here leave me to respire.
12. This day a solemn feast the people hold
13. To Dagon, their sea-idol, and forbid
14. Laborious works. Unwillingly this rest
15. Their superstition yields me; hence, with leave
16. Retiring from the popular noise, I seek
17. This unfrequented place to find some ease—
18. Ease to the body some, none to the mind
19. From restless thoughts, that, like a deadly swarm
20. Of hornets armed, no sooner found alone
21. But rush upon me thronging, and present
22. Times past, what once I was, and what am now.
23. Oh, wherefore was my birth from Heaven foretold
24. Twice by an Angel, who at last, in sight
25. Of both my parents, all in flames ascended
26. From off the altar where an offering burned,
27. As in a fiery column charioting
28. His godlike presence, and from some great act
29. Or benefit revealed to Abraham’s race?
30. Why was my breeding ordered and prescribed
31. As of a person separate to God,
32. Designed for great exploits, if I must die
33. Betrayed, captived, and both my eyes put out,
34. Made of my enemies the scorn and gaze,
35. To grind in brazen fetters under task
36. With this heaven-gifted strength? O glorious strength,
37. Put to the labour of a beast, debased
38. Lower than bond-slave! Promise was that I
39. Should Israel from Philistian yoke deliver!
40. Ask for this great Deliverer now, and find him
41. Eyeless in Gaza, at the mill with slaves,
42. Himself in bonds under Philistian yoke.
43. Yet stay; let me not rashly call in doubt
44. Divine prediction. What if all foretold
45. Had been fulfilled but through mine own default?
46. Whom have I to complain of but myself,
47. Who this high gift of strength committed to me,
48. In what part lodged, how easily bereft me,
49. Under the seal of silence could not keep,
50. But weakly to a woman must reveal it,
51. O’ercome with importunity and tears?
52. O impotence of mind in body strong!
53. But what is strength without a double share
54. Of wisdom? Vast, unwieldly, burdensome,
55. Proudly secure, yet liable to fall
56. By weakest subtleties; not made to rule,
57. But to subserve where wisdom bears command.
58. God, when he gave me strength, to shew withal
59. How slight the gift was, hung it in my hair.
60. But peace! I must not quarrel with the will
61. Of highest dispensation, which herein
62. Haply had ends above my reach to know.
63. Suffices that to me strength is my bane,
64. And proves the source of all my miseries—
65. So many, and so huge, that each apart
66. Would ask a life to wail. But, chief of all,
67. O loss of sight, of thee I most complain!
68. Blind among enemies! O worse than chains,
69. Dungeon, or beggary, or decrepit age!
70. Light, the prime work of God, to me is extinct,
71. And all her various objects of delight
72. Annulled, which might in part my grief have eased.
73. Inferior to the vilest now become
74. Of man or worm, the vilest here excel me:
75. They creep, yet see; I, dark in light, exposed
76. To daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong,
77. Within doors, or without, still as a fool,
78. In power of others, never in my own—
79. Scarce half I seem to live, dead more than half.
80. O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,
81. Irrecoverábly dark, total eclipse
82. Without all hope of day!
83. O first-created Beam, and thou great Word,
84. “Let there be light, and light was over all,”
85. Why am I thus bereaved thy prime decree?
86. The Sun to me is dark
87. And silent as the Moon,
88. When she deserts the night,
89. Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.
90. Since light so necessary is to life,
91. And almost life itself, if it be true
92. That light is in the soul,
93. She all in every part, why was the sight
94. To such a tender ball as the eye confined,
95. So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
96. And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused,
97. That she might look at will through every pore?
98. Then had I not been thus exiled from light,
99. As in the land of darkness, yet in light,
100. To live a life half dead, a living death,
101. And buried; but, O yet more miserable!
102. Myself my sepulchre, a moving grave;
103. Buried, yet not exempt,
104. By privilege of death and burial,
105. From worst of other evils, pains, and wrongs;
106. But made hereby obnoxious more
107. To all the miseries of life,
108. Life in captivity
109. Among inhuman foes.
110. But who are these? for with joint pace I hear
111. The tread of many feet steering this way;
112. Perhaps my enemies, who come to stare
113. At my affliction, and perhaps to insult—
114. Their daily practice to afflict me more.
115. Chor. This, this is he; softly a while;
116. Let us not break in upon him.
117. O change beyond report, thought, or belief!
118. See how he lies at random, carelessly diffused,
119. With languished head unpropt,
120. As one past hope, abandoned,
121. And by himself given over,
122. In slavish habit, ill-fitted weeds
123. O’er-worn and soiled.
124. Or do my eyes misrepresent? Can this be he,
125. That heroic, that renowned,
126. Irresistible Samson? whom, unarmed,
127. No strength of man, or fiercest wild beast, could withstand;
128. Who tore the lion as the lion tears the kid;
129. Ran on embattled armies clad in iron,
130. And, weaponless himself,
131. Made arms ridiculous, useless the forgery
132. Of brazen shield and spear, the hammered cuirass,
133. Chalybean-tempered steel, and frock of mail
134. Adamantean proof:
135. But safest he who stood aloof,
136. When insupportably his foot advanced,
137. In scorn of their proud arms and warlike tools,
138. Spurned them to death by troops. The bold Ascalonite
139. Fled from his lion ramp; old warriors turned
140. Their plated backs under his heel,
141. Or grovelling soiled their crested helmets in the dust.
142. Then with what trivial weapon came to hand,
143. The jaw of a dead ass, his sword of bone,
144. A thousand foreskins fell, the flower of Palestine,
145. In Ramath-lechi, famous to this day:
146. Then by main force pulled up, and on his shoulders bore,
147. The gates of Azza, post and massy bar,
148. Up to the hill by Hebron, seat of giants old—
149. No journey of a sabbath-day, and loaded so—
150. Like whom the Gentiles feign to bear up Heaven.
151. Which shall I first bewail—
152. Thy bondage or lost sight,
153. Prison within prison
154. Inseparably dark?
155. Thou art become (O worst imprisonment!)
156. The dungeon of thyself; thy soul
157. (Which men enjoying sight oft without cause complain)
158. Imprisoned now indeed,
159. In real darkness of the body dwells,
160. Shut up from outward light
161. To incorporate with gloomy night;
162. For inward light, alas!
163. Puts forth no visual beam.
164. O mirror of our fickle state,
165. Since man on earth, unparalleled,
166. The rarer thy example stands,
167. By how much from the top of wondrous glory,
168. Strongest of mortal men,
169. To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fallen.
170. For him I reckon not in high estate
171. Whom long descent of birth,
172. Or the sphere of fortune, raises;
173. But them whose strength, while virtue was her mate,
174. Might have subdued the Earth,
175. Universally crowned with highest praises.
176. Sams. I hear the sound of words; their sense the air
177. Dissolves unjointed ere it reach my ear.
178. Chor. He speaks: let us draw nigh. Matchless in might,
179. The glory late of Israel, now the grief!
180. We come, thy friends and neighbours not unknown.
181. From Eshtaol and Zora’s fruitful vale,
182. To visit or bewail thee; or, if better,
183. Counsel or consolation we may bring,
184. Salve to thy sores: apt words have power to swage
185. The tumours of a troubled mind,
186. And are as balm to festered wounds.
187. Sams. Your coming, friends, revives me; for I learn
188. Now of my own experience, not by talk,
189. How counterfeit a coin they are who “friends”
190. Bear in their superscription (of the most
191. I would be understood). In prosperous days
192. They swarm, but in adverse withdraw their head,
193. Not to be found, though sought. Ye see, O friends,
194. How many evils have enclosed me round;
195. Yet that which was the worst now least afflicts me,
196. Blindness; for, had I sight, confused with shame,
197. How could I once look up, or heave the head,
198. Who, like a foolish pilot, have shipwrecked
199. My Vessel trusted to me from above,
200. Gloriously rigged, and for a word, a tear,
201. Fool! have divulged the secret gift of God
202. To a deceitful woman? Tell me, friends,
203. Am I not sung and proverbed for a fool
204. In every street? Do they not say, “How well
205. Are come upon him his deserts”? Yet why?
206. Immeasurable strength they might behold
207. In me; of wisdom nothing more than mean.
208. This with the other should at least have paired;
209. These two, proportioned ill, drove me transverse.
210. Chor. Tax not divine disposal. Wisest men
211. Have erred, and by bad women been deceived;
212. And shall again, pretend they ne’er so wise.
213. Deject not, then, so overmuch thyself,
214. Who hast of sorrow thy full load besides.
215. Yet, truth to say, I oft have heard men wonder
216. Why thou should’st wed Philistian women rather
217. Than of thine own tribe fairer, or as fair,
218. At least of thy own nation, and as noble.
219. Sams. The first I saw at Timna, and she pleased
220. Me, not my parents, that I sought to wed
221. The daughter of an Infidel. They knew not
222. That what I motioned was of God; I knew
223. From intimate impulse, and therefore urged
224. The marriage on, that, by occasion hence,
225. I might begin Israel’s deliverance—
226. The work to which I was divinely called.
227. She proving false, the next I took to wife
228. (O that I never had! found wish too late!)
229. Was in the vale of Sorec, Dalila,
230. That specious monster, my accomplished snare.
231. I thought it lawful from my former act,
232. And the same end, still watching to oppress
233. Israel’s oppressors. Of what now I suffer
234. She was not the prime cause, but I myself,
235. Who, vanquished with a peal of words, (O weakness!)
236. Gave up my fort of silence to a woman.
237. Chor. In seeking just occasion to provoke
238. The Philistine, thy country’s enemy,
239. Thou never wast remiss, I bear thee witness;
240. Yet Israel still serves with all his sons.
241. Sams. That fault I take not on me, but transfer
242. On Israel’s governors and heads of tribes,
243. Who, seeing those great acts which God had done
244. Singly be me against their conquerors,
245. Acknowledged not, or not at all considered,
246. Deliverance offered. I, on the other side,
247. Used no ambition to commend my deeds;
248. The deeds themselves, though mute, spoke loud the doer.
249. But they persisted deaf, and would not seem
