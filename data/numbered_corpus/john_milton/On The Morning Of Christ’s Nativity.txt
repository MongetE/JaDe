1. I

2. This is the month, and this the happy morn,
3. Wherein the Son of Heaven’s eternal King,
4. Of wedded maid and Virgin Mother born,
5. Our great redemption from above did bring;
6. For so the holy sages once did sing,
7. That he our deadly forfeit should release,
8. And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.

9. II

10. That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,
11. And that far-beaming blaze of majesty,
12. Wherewith he wont at Heaven’s high council-table
13. To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,
14. He laid aside, and, here with us to be,
15. Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day,
16. And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.

17. III

18. Say, Heavenly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein
19. Afford a present to the Infant God?
20. Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,
21. To welcome him to this his new abode,
22. Now while the heaven, by the Sun’s team untrod,
23. Hath took no print of the approaching light,
24. And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?

25. IV

26. See how from far upon the Eastern road
27. The star-led Wisards haste with odours sweet!
28. Oh! run; prevent them with thy humble ode,
29. And lay it lowly at his blessèd feet;
30. Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,
31. And join thy voice unto the Angel Quire,
32. From out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire.

33. The Hymn
34. I

35. It was the winter wild,
36. While the heaven-born child
37. All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;
38. Nature, in awe to him,
39. Had doffed her gaudy trim,
40. With her great Master so to sympathize:
41. It was no season then for her
42. To wanton with the Sun, her lusty Paramour.

43. II

44. Only with speeches fair
45. She woos the gentle air
46. To hide her guilty front with innocent snow,
47. And on her naked shame,
48. Pollute with sinful blame,
49. The saintly veil of maiden white to throw;
50. Confounded, that her Maker’s eyes
51. Should look so near upon her foul deformities.

52. III

53. But he, her fears to cease,
54. Sent down the meek-eyed Peace:
55. She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding
56. Down through the turning sphere,
57. His ready Harbinger,
58. With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;
59. And, waving wide her myrtle wand,
60. She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.

61. IV

62. No war, or battail’s sound,
63. Was heard the world around;
64. The idle spear and shield were high uphung;
65. The hookèd chariot stood,
66. Unstained with hostile blood;
67. The trumpet spake not to the armèd throng;
68. And Kings sat still with awful eye,
69. As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.

70. V

71. But peaceful was the night
72. Wherein the Prince of Light
73. His reign of peace upon the earth began.
74. The winds, with wonder whist,
75. Smoothly the waters kissed,
76. Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean,
77. Who now hath quite forgot to rave,
78. While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.

79. VI

80. The stars, with deep amaze,
81. Stand fixed in steadfast gaze,
82. Bending one way their precious influence,
83. And will not take their flight,
84. For all the morning light,
85. Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;
86. But in their glimmering orbs did glow,
87. Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.

88. VII

89. And, though the shady gloom
90. Had given day her room,
91. The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed,
92. And hid his head of shame,
93. As his inferior flame
94. The new-enlightened world no more should need:
95. He saw a greater Sun appear
96. Than his bright Throne or burning axletree could bear.

97. VIII

98. The Shepherds on the lawn,
99. Or ere the point of dawn,
100. Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;
101. Full little thought they than
102. That the mighty Pan
103. Was kindly come to live with them below:
104. Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,
105. Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.

106. IX

107. When such music sweet
108. Their hearts and ears did greet
109. As never was by mortal finger strook,
110. Divinely-warbled voice
111. Answering the stringèd noise,
112. As all their souls in blissful rapture took:
113. The air, such pleasure loth to lose,
114. With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.

115. X

116. Nature, that heard such sound
117. Beneath the hollow round
118. Of Cynthia’s seat the airy Region thrilling,
119. Now was almost won
120. To think her part was done,
121. And that her reign had here its last fulfilling:
122. She knew such harmony alone
123. Could hold all Heaven and Earth in happier union.

124. XI

125. At last surrounds their sight
126. A globe of circular light,
127. That with long beams the shamefaced Night arrayed;
128. The helmèd Cherubim
129. And sworded Seraphim
130. Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed,
131. Harping in loud and solemn quire,
132. With unexpressive notes, to Heaven’s newborn Heir.

133. XII

134. Such music (as ’tis said)
135. Before was never made,
136. But when of old the Sons of Morning sung,
137. While the Creator great
138. His constellations set,
139. And the well-balanced World on hinges hung,
140. And cast the dark foundations deep,
141. And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep.

142. XIII

143. Ring out, ye crystal spheres!
144. Once bless our human ears,
145. If ye have power to touch our senses so;
146. And let your silver chime
147. Move in melodious time;
148. And let the bass of heaven’s deep organ blow;
149. And with your ninefold harmony
150. Make up full consort of the angelic symphony.

151. XIV

152. For, if such holy song
153. Enwrap our fancy long,
154. Time will run back and fetch the Age of Gold;
155. And speckled Vanity
156. Will sicken soon and die,
157. And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;
158. And Hell itself will pass away,
159. And leave her dolorous mansions of the peering day.

160. XV

161. Yes, Truth and Justice then
162. Will down return to men,
163. The enamelled arras of the rainbow wearing;
164. And Mercy set between,
165. Throned in celestial sheen,
166. With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;
167. And Heaven, as at some festival,
168. Will open wide the gates of her high palace-hall.

169. XVI

170. But wisest Fate says No,
171. This must not yet be so;
172. The Babe lies yet in smiling infancy
173. That on the bitter cross
174. Must redeem our loss,
175. So both himself and us to glorify:
176. Yet first, to those chained in sleep,
177. The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,

178. XVII

179. With such a horrid clang
180. As on Mount Sinai rang,
181. While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake:
182. The aged Earth, aghast
183. With terror of that blast,
184. Shall from the surface to the centre shake,
185. When, at the world’s last sessiön,
186. The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.

187. XVIII

188. And then at last our bliss
189. Full and perfect is,
190. But now begins; for from this happy day
191. The Old Dragon under ground,
192. In straiter limits bound,
193. Not half so far casts his usurpèd sway,
194. And, wroth to see his Kingdom fail,
195. Swindges the scaly horror of his folded tail.

196. XIX

197. The Oracles are dumb;
198. No voice or hideous hum
199. Runs through the archèd roof in words deceiving.
200. Apollo from his shrine
201. Can no more divine,
202. Will hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.
203. No nightly trance, or breathèd spell,
204. Inspires the pale-eyed Priest from the prophetic cell.

205. XX

206. The lonely mountains o’er,
207. And the resounding shore,
208. A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;
209. Edgèd with poplar pale,
210. From haunted spring, and dale
211. The parting Genius is with sighing sent;
212. With flower-inwoven tresses torn
213. The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.

214. XXI

215. In consecrated earth,
216. And on the holy hearth,
217. The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;
218. In urns, and altars round,
219. A drear and dying sound
220. Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;
221. And the chill marble seems to sweat,
222. While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.

223. XXII

224. Peor and Baälim
225. Forsake their temples dim,
226. With that twice-battered god of Palestine;
227. And moonèd Ashtaroth,
228. Heaven’s Queen and Mother both,
229. Now sits not girt with tapers’ holy shine:
230. The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn;
231. In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.

232. XXIII

233. And sullen Moloch, fled,
234. Hath left in shadows dread
235. His burning idol all of blackest hue;
236. In vain with cymbals’ ring
237. They call the grisly king,
238. In dismal dance about the furnace blue;
239. The brutish gods of Nile as fast,
240. Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.

241. XXIV

242. Nor is Osiris seen
243. In Memphian grove or green,
244. Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud;
245. Nor can he be at rest
246. Within his sacred chest;
247. Nought but profoundest Hell can be his shroud;
248. In vain, with timbreled anthems dark,
249. The sable-stolèd Sorcerers bear his worshiped ark.

250. XXV

251. He feels from Juda’s land
252. The dreaded Infant’s hand;
253. The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
254. Nor all the gods beside
255. Longer dare abide,
256. Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
257. Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,
258. Can in his swaddling bands control the damnèd crew.

259. XXVI

260. So, when the Sun in bed,
261. Curtained with cloudy red,
262. Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,
263. The flocking shadows pale
264. Troop to the infernal jail,
265. Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave,
266. And the yellow-skirted Fays
267. Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze.

268. XXVII

269. But see! the Virgin blest
270. Hath laid her Babe to rest,
271. Time is our tedious song should here have ending:
272. Heaven’s youngest-teemèd star
273. Hath fixed her polished car,
274. Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;
275. And all about the courtly stable
276. Bright-harnessed Angels sit in order serviceable.
