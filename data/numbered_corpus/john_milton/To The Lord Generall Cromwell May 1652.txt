1. On The Proposalls Of Certaine Ministers At The Committee For
2. Propagation Of The Gospell


3. Cromwell, our cheif of men, who through a cloud
4. Not of warr onely, but detractions rude,
5. Guided by faith & matchless Fortitude
6. To peace & truth thy glorious way hast plough'd,
7. And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud
8. Hast reard Gods Trophies, & his work pursu'd,
9. While Darwen stream with blood of Scotts imbru'd,
10. And Dunbarr field resounds thy praises loud,
11. And Worsters laureat wreath; yet much remaines
12. To conquer still; peace hath her victories
13. No less renownd then warr, new foes aries
14. Threatning to bind our soules with secular chaines:
15. Helpe us to save free Conscience from the paw
16. Of hireling wolves whose Gospell is their maw.
