1. XXII

2. Cyriac, this three years' day these eyes, though clear,
3. To outward view, of blemish or of spot,
4. Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot;
5. Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear
6. Of sun, or moon, or star, throughout the year,
7. Or man, or woman. Yet I argue not
8. Against Heav'n's hand or will, nor bate a jot
9. Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer
10. Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?
11. The conscience, Friend, t' have lost them overplied
12. In liberty's defence, my noble task,
13. Of which all Europe rings from side to side.
14. This thought might lead me through the world's vain mask
15. Content, though blind, had I no better guide.
