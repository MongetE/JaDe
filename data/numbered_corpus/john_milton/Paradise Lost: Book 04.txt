1. O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw
2. The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
3. Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
4. Came furious down to be revenged on men,
5. Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now,
6. While time was, our first parents had been warned
7. The coming of their secret foe, and 'scaped,
8. Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare:  For now
9. Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,
10. The tempter ere the accuser of mankind,
11. To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss
12. Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell:
13. Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold
14. Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,
15. Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth
16. Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast,
17. And like a devilish engine back recoils
18. Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract
19. His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir
20. The Hell within him; for within him Hell
21. He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell
22. One step, no more than from himself, can fly
23. By change of place:  Now conscience wakes despair,
24. That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory
25. Of what he was, what is, and what must be
26. Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
27. Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view
28. Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad;
29. Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun,
30. Which now sat high in his meridian tower:
31. Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.
32. O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned,
33. Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God
34. Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars
35. Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call,
36. But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,
37. Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams,
38. That bring to my remembrance from what state
39. I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;
40. Till pride and worse ambition threw me down
41. Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King:
42. Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return
43. From me, whom he created what I was
44. In that bright eminence, and with his good
45. Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
46. What could be less than to afford him praise,
47. The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,
48. How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,
49. And wrought but malice; lifted up so high
50. I sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher
51. Would set me highest, and in a moment quit
52. The debt immense of endless gratitude,
53. So burdensome still paying, still to owe,
54. Forgetful what from him I still received,
55. And understood not that a grateful mind
56. By owing owes not, but still pays, at once
57. Indebted and discharged; what burden then
58. O, had his powerful destiny ordained
59. Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood
60. Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised
61. Ambition!  Yet why not some other Power
62. As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,
63. Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great
64. Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within
65. Or from without, to all temptations armed.
66. Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
67. Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,
68. But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all?
69. Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,
70. To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
71. Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will
72. Chose freely what it now so justly rues.
73. Me miserable! which way shall I fly
74. Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
75. Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;
76. And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep
77. Still threatening to devour me opens wide,
78. To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.
79. O, then, at last relent:  Is there no place
80. Left for repentance, none for pardon left?
81. None left but by submission; and that word
82. Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame
83. Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced
84. With other promises and other vaunts
85. Than to submit, boasting I could subdue
86. The Omnipotent.  Ay me! they little know
87. How dearly I abide that boast so vain,
88. Under what torments inwardly I groan,
89. While they adore me on the throne of Hell.
90. With diadem and scepter high advanced,
91. The lower still I fall, only supreme
92. In misery:  Such joy ambition finds.
93. But say I could repent, and could obtain,
94. By act of grace, my former state; how soon
95. Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay
96. What feigned submission swore?  Ease would recant
97. Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
98. For never can true reconcilement grow,
99. Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep:
100. Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
101. And heavier fall:  so should I purchase dear
102. Short intermission bought with double smart.
103. This knows my Punisher; therefore as far
104. From granting he, as I from begging, peace;
105. All hope excluded thus, behold, in stead
106. Mankind created, and for him this world.
107. So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear;
108. Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost;
109. Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least
110. Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold,
111. By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;
112. As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.
113. Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face
114. Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair;
115. Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed
116. Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.
117. For heavenly minds from such distempers foul
118. Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware,
119. Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm,
120. Artificer of fraud; and was the first
121. That practised falsehood under saintly show,
122. Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:
123. Yet not enough had practised to deceive
124. Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down
125. The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount
126. Saw him disfigured, more than could befall
127. Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce
128. He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,
129. As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.
130. So on he fares, and to the border comes
131. Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,
132. Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,
133. As with a rural mound, the champaign head
134. Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides
135. Access denied; and overhead upgrew
136. Insuperable height of loftiest shade,
137. Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,
138. A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,
139. Shade above shade, a woody theatre
140. Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops
141. The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;

142. Which to our general sire gave prospect large
143. Into his nether empire neighbouring round.
144. And higher than that wall a circling row
145. Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,
146. Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,
147. Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed:
148. On which the sun more glad impressed his beams
149. Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,
150. When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed
151. That landskip:  And of pure now purer air
152. Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
153. Vernal delight and joy, able to drive
154. All sadness but despair:  Now gentle gales,
155. Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense
156. Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
157. Those balmy spoils.  As when to them who fail
158. Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past
159. Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow
160. Sabean odours from the spicy shore
161. Of Araby the blest; with such delay
162. Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league
163. Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles:
164. So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend,
165. Who came their bane; though with them better pleased
166. Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume
167. That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse
168. Of Tobit's son, and with a vengeance sent
169. From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.
170. Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
171. Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;
172. But further way found none, so thick entwined,
173. As one continued brake, the undergrowth
174. Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
175. All path of man or beast that passed that way.
176. One gate there only was, and that looked east
177. On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw,
178. Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt,
179. At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound
180. Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within
181. Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling wolf,
182. Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,
183. Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
184. In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,
185. Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold:
186. Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash
187. Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,
188. Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,
189. In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles:
190. So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold;
191. So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.
192. Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,
193. The middle tree and highest there that grew,
194. Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life
195. Thereby regained, but sat devising death
196. To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought
197. Of that life-giving plant, but only used
198. For prospect, what well used had been the pledge
199. Of immortality.  So little knows
200. Any, but God alone, to value right
201. The good before him, but perverts best things
202. To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.
203. Beneath him with new wonder now he views,
204. To all delight of human sense exposed,
205. In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more,
206. A Heaven on Earth:  For blissful Paradise
207. Of God the garden was, by him in the east
208. Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line
209. From Auran eastward to the royal towers
210. Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,
211. Of where the sons of Eden long before
212. Dwelt in Telassar:  In this pleasant soil
213. His far more pleasant garden God ordained;
214. Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
215. All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;
216. And all amid them stood the tree of life,
217. High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit
218. Of vegetable gold; and next to life,
219. Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by,
220. Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.
221. Southward through Eden went a river large,
222. Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill
223. Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown
224. That mountain as his garden-mould high raised
225. Upon the rapid current, which, through veins
226. Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,
227. Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill
228. Watered the garden; thence united fell
229. Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,
230. Which from his darksome passage now appears,
231. And now, divided into four main streams,
232. Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm
233. And country, whereof here needs no account;
234. But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,
235. How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,
236. Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,
237. With mazy errour under pendant shades
238. Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed
239. Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art
240. In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon
241. Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,
242. Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
243. The open field, and where the unpierced shade
244. Imbrowned the noontide bowers:  Thus was this place
245. A happy rural seat of various view;
246. Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,
247. Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,
248. Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,
249. If true, here only, and of delicious taste:
250. Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks
251. Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,
252. Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap
253. Of some irriguous valley spread her store,
254. Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:
255. Another side, umbrageous grots and caves
256. Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine
257. Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps
258. Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall
259. Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,
260. That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
261. Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.
262. The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,
263. Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune
264. The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,
265. Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,
266. Led on the eternal Spring.  Not that fair field
267. Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,
268. Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis
269. Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain
270. To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove
271. Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired
272. Castalian spring, might with this Paradise
273. Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle
274. Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,
275. Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,
276. Hid Amalthea, and her florid son
277. Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye;
278. Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard,
279. Mount Amara, though this by some supposed
280. True Paradise under the Ethiop line
281. By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock,
282. A whole day's journey high, but wide remote
283. From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend
284. Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind
285. Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange
286. Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,
287. Godlike erect, with native honour clad
288. In naked majesty seemed lords of all:
289. And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine
290. The image of their glorious Maker shone,
291. Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure,
292. (Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,)
293. Whence true authority in men; though both
294. Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;
295. For contemplation he and valour formed;
296. For softness she and sweet attractive grace;
297. He for God only, she for God in him:
298. His fair large front and eye sublime declared
299. Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks
300. Round from his parted forelock manly hung
301. Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:
302. She, as a veil, down to the slender waist
303. Her unadorned golden tresses wore
304. Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved
305. As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied
306. Subjection, but required with gentle sway,
307. And by her yielded, by him best received,
308. Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,
309. And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.
310. Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed;
311. Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame
312. Of nature's works, honour dishonourable,
313. Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind
314. With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,
315. And banished from man's life his happiest life,
316. Simplicity and spotless innocence!
317. So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight
318. Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill:
319. So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair,
320. That ever since in love's embraces met;
321. Adam the goodliest man of men since born
322. His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.
323. Under a tuft of shade that on a green
324. Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side
325. They sat them down; and, after no more toil
326. Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
327. To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease
328. More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite
329. More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell,
330. Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
331. Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline
332. On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:
333. The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,
334. Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream;
335. Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
336. Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems
337. Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league,
338. Alone as they.  About them frisking played
339. All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase
340. In wood or wilderness, forest or den;
341. Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw
342. Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,
343. Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,
344. To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed
345. His?kithetmroboscis; close the serpent sly,
346. Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
347. His braided train, and of his fatal guile
348. Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass
349. Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,
350. Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,
351. Declined, was hasting now with prone career
352. To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale
353. Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:
354. When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,
355. Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.
356. O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold!
357. Into our room of bliss thus high advanced
358. Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,
359. Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright
360. Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue
361. With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
362. In them divine resemblance, and such grace
363. The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.
364. Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh
365. Your change approaches, when all these delights
366. Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe;
367. More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;
368. Happy, but for so happy ill secured
369. Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven
370. Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe
371. As now is entered; yet no purposed foe
372. To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn,
373. Though I unpitied:  League with you I seek,
374. And mutual amity, so strait, so close,
375. That I with you must dwell, or you with me
376. Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please,
377. Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such
378. Accept your Maker's work; he gave it me,
379. Which I as freely give:  Hell shall unfold,
380. To entertain you two, her widest gates,
381. And send forth all her kings; there will be room,
382. Not like these narrow limits, to receive
383. Your numerous offspring; if no better place,
384. Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
385. On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.
386. And should I at your harmless innocence
387. Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just,
388. Honour and empire with revenge enlarged,
389. By conquering this new world, compels me now
390. To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.
391. So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,
392. The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds.
393. Then from his lofty stand on that high tree
394. Down he alights among the sportful herd
395. Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one,
396. Now other, as their shape served best his end
397. Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied,
398. To mark what of their state he more might learn,
399. By word or action marked. About them round
400. A lion now he stalks with fiery glare;
401. Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied
402. In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play,
403. Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft
404. His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,
405. Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both,
406. Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men
407. To first of women Eve thus moving speech,
408. Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.
409. Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys,
410. Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power
411. That made us, and for us this ample world,
412. Be infinitely good, and of his good
413. As liberal and free as infinite;
414. That raised us from the dust, and placed us here
415. In all this happiness, who at his hand
416. Have nothing merited, nor can perform
417. Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires
418. From us no other service than to keep
419. This one, this easy charge, of all the trees
420. In Paradise that bear delicious fruit
421. So various, not to taste that only tree
422. Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life;
423. So near grows death to life, whate'er death is,
424. Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest
425. God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree,
426. The only sign of our obedience left,
427. Among so many signs of power and rule
428. Conferred upon us, and dominion given
429. Over all other creatures that possess
430. Earth, air, and sea.  Then let us not think hard
431. One easy prohibition, who enjoy
432. Free leave so large to all things else, and choice
433. Unlimited of manifold delights:
434. But let us ever praise him, and extol
435. His bounty, following our delightful task,
436. To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers,
437. Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.
438. To whom thus Eve replied.  O thou for whom
439. And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,
440. And without whom am to no end, my guide
441. And head! what thou hast said is just and right.
442. For we to him indeed all praises owe,
443. And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy
444. So far the happier lot, enjoying thee
445. Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou
446. Like consort to thyself canst no where find.
447. That day I oft remember, when from sleep
448. I first awaked, and found myself reposed
449. Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where
450. And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
451. Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
452. Of waters issued from a cave, and spread
453. Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved
454. Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went
455. With unexperienced thought, and laid me down
456. On the green bank, to look into the clear
457. Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.
458. As I bent down to look, just opposite
459. A shape within the watery gleam appeared,
460. Bending to look on me:  I started back,
461. It started back; but pleased I soon returned,
462. Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
463. Of sympathy and love:  There I had fixed
464. Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,
465. Had not a voice thus warned me;  'What thou seest,
466. 'What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself;
467. 'With thee it came and goes: but follow me,
468. 'And I will bring thee where no shadow stays
469. 'Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he
470. 'Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy
471. 'Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear
472. 'Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called
473. 'Mother of human race.'  What could I do,
474. But follow straight, invisibly thus led?
475. Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall,
476. Under a platane; yet methought less fair,
477. Less winning soft, less amiably mild,
478. Than that smooth watery image:  Back I turned;
479. Thou following cryedst aloud, 'Return, fair Eve;
480. 'Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest, of him thou art,
481. 'His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent
482. 'Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart,
483. 'Substantial life, to have thee by my side
484. 'Henceforth an individual solace dear;
485. 'Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim
486. 'My other half:'  With that thy gentle hand
487. Seised mine:  I yielded;and from that time see
488. How beauty is excelled by manly grace,
489. And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.
490. So spake our general mother, and with eyes
491. Of conjugal attraction unreproved,
492. And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned
493. On our first father; half her swelling breast
494. Naked met his, under the flowing gold
495. Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight
496. Both of her beauty, and submissive charms,
497. Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter
498. On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds
499. That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip
500. With kisses pure:  Aside the Devil turned
501. For envy; yet with jealous leer malign
502. Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.
503. Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,
504. Imparadised in one another's arms,
505. The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill
506. Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust,
507. Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,
508. Among our other torments not the least,
509. Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.
510. Yet let me not forget what I have gained
511. From their own mouths:  All is not theirs, it seems;
512. One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,
513. Forbidden them to taste:  Knowledge forbidden
514. Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should their Lord
515. Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know?
516. Can it be death?  And do they only stand
517. By ignorance?  Is that their happy state,
518. The proof of their obedience and their faith?
519. O fair foundation laid whereon to build
520. Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds
521. With more desire to know, and to reject
522. Envious commands, invented with design
523. To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt
524. Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,
525. They taste and die:  What likelier can ensue
526. But first with narrow search I must walk round
527. This garden, and no corner leave unspied;
528. A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
529. Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,
530. Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw
531. What further would be learned.  Live while ye may,
532. Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return,
533. Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!
534. So saying, his proud step he scornful turned,
535. But with sly circumspection, and began
536. Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale, his roam
537. Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven
538. With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun
539. Slowly descended, and with right aspect
540. Against the eastern gate of Paradise
541. Levelled his evening rays:  It was a rock
542. Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds,
543. Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent
544. Accessible from earth, one entrance high;
545. The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung
546. Still as it rose, impossible to climb.
547. Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat,
548. Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night;
549. About him exercised heroick games
550. The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand
551. Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears,
552. Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.
553. Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even
554. On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star
555. In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired
556. Impress the air, and shows the mariner
557. From what point of his compass to beware
558. Impetuous winds:  He thus began in haste.
559. Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given
560. Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place
561. No evil thing approach or enter in.
562. This day at highth of noon came to my sphere
563. A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know
564. More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man,
565. God's latest image:  I described his way
566. Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait;
567. But in the mount that lies from Eden north,
568. Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks
569. Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured:
570. Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade
571. Lost sight of him:  One of the banished crew,
572. I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise
573. New troubles; him thy care must be to find.
574. To whom the winged warriour thus returned.
575. Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,
576. Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst,
577. See far and wide:  In at this gate none pass
578. The vigilance here placed, but such as come
579. Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour
580. No creature thence:  If Spirit of other sort,
581. So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds
582. On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude
583. Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.
584. But if within the circuit of these walks,
585. In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom
586. Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.
587. So promised he; and Uriel to his charge
588. Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised
589. Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
590. Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb,
591. Incredible how swift, had thither rolled
592. Diurnal, or this less volubil earth,
593. By shorter flight to the east, had left him there
594. Arraying with reflected purple and gold
595. The clouds that on his western throne attend.
596. Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray
597. Had in her sober livery all things clad;
598. Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,
599. They to their grassy couch, these to their nests
600. Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
601. She all night long her amorous descant sung;
602. Silence was pleased:  Now glowed the firmament
603. With living sapphires:  Hesperus, that led
604. The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,
605. Rising in clouded majesty, at length
606. Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,
607. And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.
608. When Adam thus to Eve.  Fair Consort, the hour
609. Of night, and all things now retired to rest,
610. Mind us of like repose; since God hath set
611. Labour and rest, as day and night, to men
612. Successive; and the timely dew of sleep,
613. Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines
614. Our eye-lids:  Other creatures all day long
615. Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest;
616. Man hath his daily work of body or mind
617. Appointed, which declares his dignity,
618. And the regard of Heaven on all his ways;
619. While other animals unactive range,
620. And of their doings God takes no account.
621. To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east
622. With first approach of light, we must be risen,
623. And at our pleasant labour, to reform
624. Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green,
625. Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,
626. That mock our scant manuring, and require
627. More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth:
628. Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums,
629. That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,
630. Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;
631. Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.
632. To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned
633. My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst
634. Unargued I obey:  So God ordains;
635. God is thy law, thou mine:  To know no more
636. Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise.
637. With thee conversing I forget all time;
638. All seasons, and their change, all please alike.
639. Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,
640. With charm of earliest birds:  pleasant the sun,
641. When first on this delightful land he spreads
642. His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,
643. Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth
644. After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
645. Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,
646. With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,
647. And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:
648. But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends
649. With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun
650. On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,
651. Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;
652. Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,
653. With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,
654. Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.
655. But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom
656. This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?
657. To whom our general ancestor replied.
658. Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,
659. These have their course to finish round the earth,
660. By morrow evening, and from land to land
661. In order, though to nations yet unborn,
662. Ministring light prepared, they set and rise;
663. Lest total Darkness should by night regain
664. Her old possession, and extinguish life
665. In Nature and all things; which these soft fires
666. Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat
667. Of various influence foment and warm,
668. Temper or nourish, or in part shed down
669. Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
670. On earth, made hereby apter to receive
671. Perfection from the sun's more potent ray.
672. These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
673. Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,
674. That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:
675. Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
676. Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:
677. All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
678. Both day and night:  How often from the steep
679. Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
680. Celestial voices to the midnight air,
681. Sole, or responsive each to others note,
682. Singing their great Creator? oft in bands
683. While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,
684. With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
685. In full harmonick number joined, their songs
686. Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.
687. Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed
688. On to their blissful bower: it was a place
689. Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed
690. All things to Man's delightful use; the roof
691. Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
692. Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew
693. Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side
694. Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub,
695. Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower,
696. Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin,
697. Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought
698. Mosaick; underfoot the violet,
699. Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay
700. Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone
701. Of costliest emblem:  Other creature here,
702. Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none,
703. Such was their awe of Man.  In shadier bower
704. More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned,
705. Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph
706. Nor Faunus haunted.  Here, in close recess,
707. With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs,
708. Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed;
709. And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung,
710. What day the genial Angel to our sire
711. Brought her in naked beauty more adorned,
712. More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods
713. Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like
714. In sad event, when to the unwiser son
715. Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared
716. Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged
717. On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire.
718. Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,
719. Both turned, and under open sky adored
720. The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven,
721. Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,
722. And starry pole:  Thou also madest the night,
723. Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day,
724. Which we, in our appointed work employed,
725. Have finished, happy in our mutual help
726. And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss
727. Ordained by thee; and this delicious place
728. For us too large, where thy abundance wants
729. Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
730. But thou hast promised from us two a race
731. To fill the earth, who shall with us extol
732. Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,
733. And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.
734. This said unanimous, and other rites
735. Observing none, but adoration pure
736. Which God likes best, into their inmost bower
737. Handed they went; and, eased the putting off
738. These troublesome disguises which we wear,
739. Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween,
740. Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites
741. Mysterious of connubial love refused:
742. Whatever hypocrites austerely talk
743. Of purity, and place, and innocence,
744. Defaming as impure what God declares
745. Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.
746. Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain
747. But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
748. Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source
749. Of human offspring, sole propriety
750. In Paradise of all things common else!
751. By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men
752. Among the bestial herds to range; by thee
753. Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,
754. Relations dear, and all the charities
755. Of father, son, and brother, first were known.
756. Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,
757. Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
758. Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets,
759. Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced,
760. Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.
761. Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights
762. His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,
763. Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile
764. Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared,
765. Casual fruition; nor in court-amours,
766. Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,
767. Or serenate, which the starved lover sings
768. To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
769. These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept,
770. And on their naked limbs the flowery roof
771. Showered roses, which the morn repaired.  Sleep on,
772. Blest pair; and O!yet happiest, if ye seek
773. No happier state, and know to know no more.
774. Now had night measured with her shadowy cone
775. Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault,
776. And from their ivory port the Cherubim,
777. Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed
778. To their night watches in warlike parade;
779. When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.
780. Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south
781. With strictest watch; these other wheel the north;
782. Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part,
783. Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.
784. From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called
785. That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.
786. Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed
787. Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook;
788. But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,
789. Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.
790. This evening from the sun's decline arrived,
791. Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen
792. Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped
793. The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:
794. Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.
795. So saying, on he led his radiant files,
796. Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct
797. In search of whom they sought:  Him there they found
798. Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,
799. Assaying by his devilish art to reach
800. The organs of her fancy, and with them forge
801. Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams;
802. Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
803. The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise
804. Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise
805. At least distempered, discontented thoughts,
806. Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,
807. Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.
808. Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
809. Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure
810. Touch of celestial temper, but returns
811. Of force to its own likeness:  Up he starts
812. Discovered and surprised.  As when a spark
813. Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid
814. Fit for the tun some magazine to store
815. Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain,
816. With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air;
817. So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
818. Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed
819. So sudden to behold the grisly king;
820. Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.
821. Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell
822. Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed,
823. Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait,
824. Here watching at the head of these that sleep?
825. Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn,
826. Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate
827. For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar:
828. Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,
829. The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know,
830. Why ask ye, and superfluous begin
831. Your message, like to end as much in vain?
832. To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.
833. Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,
834. Or undiminished brightness to be known,
835. As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure;
836. That glory then, when thou no more wast good,
837. Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now
838. Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.
839. But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
840. To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
841. This place inviolable, and these from harm.
842. So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke,
843. Severe in youthful beauty, added grace
844. Invincible:  Abashed the Devil stood,
845. And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
846. Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined
847. His loss; but chiefly to find here observed
848. His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed
849. Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,
850. Best with the best, the sender, not the sent,
851. Or all at once; more glory will be won,
852. Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said Zephon bold,
853. Will save us trial what the least can do
854. Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.
855. The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;
856. But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on,
857. Champing his iron curb:  To strive or fly
858. He held it vain; awe from above had quelled
859. His heart, not else dismayed.  Now drew they nigh
860. The western point, where those half-rounding guards
861. Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined,
862. A waiting next command.  To whom their Chief,
863. Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.
864. O friends!  I hear the tread of nimble feet
865. Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern
866. Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade;
867. And with them comes a third of regal port,
868. But faded splendour wan; who by his gait
869. And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,
870. Not likely to part hence without contest;
871. Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.
872. He scarce had ended, when those two approached,
873. And brief related whom they brought, where found,
874. How busied, in what form and posture couched.
875. To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.
876. Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed
877. To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge
878. Of others, who approve not to transgress
879. By thy example, but have power and right
880. To question thy bold entrance on this place;
881. Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those
882. Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!
883. To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.
884. Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise,
885. And such I held thee; but this question asked
886. Puts me in doubt.  Lives there who loves his pain!
887. Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,
888. Though thither doomed!  Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt
889. And boldly venture to whatever place
890. Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change
891. Torment with ease, and soonest recompense
892. Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;
893. To thee no reason, who knowest only good,
894. But evil hast not tried: and wilt object
895. His will who bounds us!  Let him surer bar
896. His iron gates, if he intends our stay
897. In that dark durance:  Thus much what was asked.
898. The rest is true, they found me where they say;
899. But that implies not violence or harm.
900. Thus he in scorn.  The warlike Angel moved,
901. Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.
902. O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
903. Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew,
904. And now returns him from his prison 'scaped,
905. Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
906. Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither
907. Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed;
908. So wise he judges it to fly from pain
909. However, and to 'scape his punishment!
910. So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath,
911. Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight
912. Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,
913. Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain
914. Can equal anger infinite provoked.
915. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
916. Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they
917. Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief!
918. The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged
919. To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
920. Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.
921. To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.
922. Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,
923. Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood
924. Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid
925. The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,
926. And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.
927. But still thy words at random, as before,
928. Argue thy inexperience what behoves
929. From hard assays and ill successes past
930. A faithful leader, not to hazard all
931. Through ways of danger by himself untried:
932. I, therefore, I alone first undertook
933. To wing the desolate abyss, and spy
934. This new created world, whereof in Hell
935. Fame is not silent, here in hope to find
936. Better abode, and my afflicted Powers
937. To settle here on earth, or in mid air;
938. Though for possession put to try once more
939. What thou and thy gay legions dare against;
940. Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
941. High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne,
942. And practised distances to cringe, not fight,
943. To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.
944. To say and straight unsay, pretending first
945. Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy,
946. Argues no leader but a liear traced,
947. Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?  O name,
948. O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!
949. Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
950. Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.
951. Was this your discipline and faith engaged,
952. Your military obedience, to dissolve
953. Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
954. And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem
955. Patron of liberty, who more than thou
956. Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored
957. Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope
958. To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?
959. But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant;
960. Fly neither whence thou fledst!  If from this hour
961. Within these hallowed limits thou appear,
962. Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained,
963. And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn
964. The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.
965. So threatened he; but Satan to no threats
966. Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.
967. Then when I am thy captive talk of chains,
968. Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then
969. Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
970. From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King
971. Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,
972. Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels
973. In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.
974. While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright
975. Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns
976. Their phalanx, and began to hem him round
977. With ported spears, as thick as when a field
978. Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
979. Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind
980. Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands,
981. Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
982. Prove chaff.  On the other side, Satan, alarmed,
983. Collecting all his might, dilated stood,
984. Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:
985. His stature reached the sky, and on his crest
986. Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp
987. What seemed both spear and shield:  Now dreadful deeds
988. Might have ensued, nor only Paradise
989. In this commotion, but the starry cope
990. Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements
991. At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn
992. With violence of this conflict, had not soon
993. The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,
994. Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen
995. Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,
996. Wherein all things created first he weighed,
997. The pendulous round earth with balanced air
998. In counterpoise, now ponders all events,
999. Battles and realms:  In these he put two weights,
1000. The sequel each of parting and of fight:
1001. The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam,
1002. Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.
1003. Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine;
1004. Neither our own, but given:  What folly then
1005. To boast what arms can do? since thine no more
1006. Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now
1007. To trample thee as mire:  For proof look up,
1008. And read thy lot in yon celestial sign;
1009. Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak,
1010. If thou resist.  The Fiend looked up, and knew
1011. His mounted scale aloft:  Nor more;but fled
1012. Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
