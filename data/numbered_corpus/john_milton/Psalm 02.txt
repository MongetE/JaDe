1. Done Aug. 8. 1653. Terzetti.


2. Why do the Gentiles tumult, and the Nations
3. Muse a vain thing, the Kings of th'earth upstand
4. With power, and Princes in their Congregations
5. Lay deep their plots together through each Land,
6. Against the Lord and his Messiah dear.
7. Let us break off; say they, by strength of hand
8. Their bonds, and cast from us, no more to wear,
9. Their twisted cords: he who in Heaven doth dwell
10. Shall laugh, the Lord shall scoff them, then severe
11. Speak to them in his wrath, and in his fell
12. And fierce ire trouble them; but I saith hee
13. Anointed have my King (though ye rebell)
14. On Sion my holi' hill.  A firm decree
15. I will declare; the Lord to me hath say'd
16. Thou art my Son I have begotten thee
17. This day, ask of me, and the grant is made;
18. As thy possession I on thee bestow
19. Th'Heathen, and as thy conquest to be sway'd
20. Earths utmost bounds: them shalt thou bring full low
21. With Iron Sceptir bruis'd, and them disperse
22. Like to a potters vessel shiver'd so.
23. And now be wise at length ye Kings averse
24. Be taught ye Judges of the earth; with fear
25. Jehovah serve and let your joy converse
26. With trembling;  Kiss the Son least he appear
27. In anger and ye perish in the way
28. If once his wrath take fire like fuel sere.
29. Happy all those who have in him their stay.
