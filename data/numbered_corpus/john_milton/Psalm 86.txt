1. Thy gracious ear, O Lord, encline,
2. O hear me I thee pray,
3. For I am poor, and almost pine
4. With need, and sad decay.
5. Preserve my soul, for *I have trod           Heb. I am good, loving,
6. Thy waies, and love the just,                    a doer of good and
7. Save thou thy servant O my God                          holy things
8. Who still in thee doth trust.
9. Pity me Lord for daily thee
10. I call; 4 O make rejoyce
11. Thy Servants Soul; for Lord to thee
12. I lift my soul and voice,
13. For thou art good, thou Lord art prone
14. To pardon, thou to all
15. Art full of mercy, thou alone
16. To them that on thee call.
17. Unto my supplication Lord
18. Give ear, and to the crie
19. Of my incessant praiers afford
20. Thy hearing graciously.
21. I in the day of my distress
22. Will call on thee for aid;
23. For thou wilt grant me free access
24. And answer, what I pray'd.
25. Like thee among the gods is none
26. O Lord, nor any works
27. Of all that other Gods have done
28. Like to thy glorious works.
29. The Nations all whom thou hast made
30. Shall come, and all shall frame
31. To bow them low before thee Lord,
32. And glorifie thy name.
33. For great thou art, and wonders great
34. By thy strong hand are done,
35. Thou in thy everlasting Seat
36. Remainest God alone.
37. Teach me O Lord thy way most right,
38. I in thy truth will hide,
39. To fear thy name my heart unite
40. So shall it never slide.
41. Thee will I praise O Lord my God
42. Thee honour, and adore
43. With my whole heart, and blaze abroad
44. Thy name for ever more.
45. For great thy mercy is toward me,
46. And thou hast free'd my Soul
47. Eev'n from the lowest Hell set free
48. From deepest darkness foul.
49. O God the proud against me rise
50. And violent men are met
51. To seek my life, and in their eyes
52. No fear of thee have set.
53. But thou Lord art the God most mild
54. Readiest thy grace to shew,
55. Slow to be angry, and art stil'd
56. Most mercifull, most true.
57. O turn to me thy face at length,
58. And me have mercy on,
59. Unto thy servant give thy strength,
60. And save thy hand-maids Son.
61. Some sign of good to me afford,
62. And let my foes then see
63. And be asham'd, because thou Lord
64. Do'st help and comfort me.
