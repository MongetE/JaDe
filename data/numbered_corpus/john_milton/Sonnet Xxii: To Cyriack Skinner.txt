1. Cyriack, this three years' day these eyes, though clear
2. To outward view of blemish or of spot,
3. Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot;
4. Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear
5. Of sun or moon or star throughout the year,
6. Or man or woman. Yet I argue not
7. Against Heav'n's hand or will, not bate a jot
8. Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer
9. Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?
10. The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied
11. In liberty's defence, my noble task,
12. Of which all Europe talks from side to side.
13. This thought might lead me through the world's vain mask
14. Content, though blind, had I no better guide.
