1. Fly, envious Time, till thou run out thy race,
2. Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours,
3. Whose speed is but the heavy plummet's pace;
4. And glut thyself with what thy womb devours,
5. Which is no more than what is false and vain,
6. And merely mortal dross;
7. So little is our loss,
8. So little is thy gain.
9. For when as each thing bad thou hast intombed,
10. And last of all thy greedy self consumed,
11. Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss
12. With an individual kiss,
13. And Joy shall overtake us as a flood;
14. When every thing that is sincerely good
15. And perfectly divine,
16. With truth, and peace, and love, shall ever shine
17. About the supreme throne
18. Of Him, t' whose happy-making sight alone
19. When once our heav'nly-guided soul shall climb,
20. Then, all this earthly grossness quit,
21. Attired with stars, we shall for ever sit,
22. Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee, O Time.
