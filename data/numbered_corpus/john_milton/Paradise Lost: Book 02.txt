1. High on a throne of royal state, which far
2. Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind,
3. Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
4. Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,
5. Satan exalted sat, by merit raised
6. To that bad eminence; and, from despair
7. Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
8. Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue
9. Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught,
10. His proud imaginations thus displayed:--
11. "Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!--
12. For, since no deep within her gulf can hold
13. Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen,
14. I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent
15. Celestial Virtues rising will appear
16. More glorious and more dread than from no fall,
17. And trust themselves to fear no second fate!--
18. Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven,
19. Did first create your leader--next, free choice
20. With what besides in council or in fight
21. Hath been achieved of merit--yet this loss,
22. Thus far at least recovered, hath much more
23. Established in a safe, unenvied throne,
24. Yielded with full consent. The happier state
25. In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw
26. Envy from each inferior; but who here
27. Will envy whom the highest place exposes
28. Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim
29. Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share
30. Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good
31. For which to strive, no strife can grow up there
32. From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell
33. Precedence; none whose portion is so small
34. Of present pain that with ambitious mind
35. Will covet more! With this advantage, then,
36. To union, and firm faith, and firm accord,
37. More than can be in Heaven, we now return
38. To claim our just inheritance of old,
39. Surer to prosper than prosperity
40. Could have assured us; and by what best way,
41. Whether of open war or covert guile,
42. We now debate. Who can advise may speak."
43. He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king,
44. Stood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit
45. That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.
46. His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed
47. Equal in strength, and rather than be less
48. Cared not to be at all; with that care lost
49. Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse,
50. He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:--
51. "My sentence is for open war. Of wiles,
52. More unexpert, I boast not: them let those
53. Contrive who need, or when they need; not now.
54. For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest--
55. Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait
56. The signal to ascend--sit lingering here,
57. Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place
58. Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame,
59. The prison of his ryranny who reigns
60. By our delay? No! let us rather choose,
61. Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once
62. O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way,
63. Turning our tortures into horrid arms
64. Against the Torturer; when, to meet the noise
65. Of his almighty engine, he shall hear
66. Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see
67. Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
68. Among his Angels, and his throne itself
69. Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,
70. His own invented torments. But perhaps
71. The way seems difficult, and steep to scale
72. With upright wing against a higher foe!
73. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench
74. Of that forgetful lake benumb not still,
75. That in our porper motion we ascend
76. Up to our native seat; descent and fall
77. To us is adverse. Who but felt of late,
78. When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
79. Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep,
80. With what compulsion and laborious flight
81. We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then;
82. Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke
83. Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find
84. To our destruction, if there be in Hell
85. Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse
86. Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned
87. In this abhorred deep to utter woe!
88. Where pain of unextinguishable fire
89. Must exercise us without hope of end
90. The vassals of his anger, when the scourge
91. Inexorably, and the torturing hour,
92. Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus,
93. We should be quite abolished, and expire.
94. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
95. His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged,
96. Will either quite consume us, and reduce
97. To nothing this essential--happier far
98. Than miserable to have eternal being!--
99. Or, if our substance be indeed divine,
100. And cannot cease to be, we are at worst
101. On this side nothing; and by proof we feel
102. Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,
103. And with perpetual inroads to alarm,
104. Though inaccessible, his fatal throne:
105. Which, if not victory, is yet revenge."
106. He ended frowning, and his look denounced
107. Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous
108. To less than gods. On th' other side up rose
109. Belial, in act more graceful and humane.
110. A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed
111. For dignity composed, and high exploit.
112. But all was false and hollow; though his tongue
113. Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear
114. The better reason, to perplex and dash
115. Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low--
116. To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds
117. Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear,
118. And with persuasive accent thus began:--
119. "I should be much for open war, O Peers,
120. As not behind in hate, if what was urged
121. Main reason to persuade immediate war
122. Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast
123. Ominous conjecture on the whole success;
124. When he who most excels in fact of arms,
125. In what he counsels and in what excels
126. Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair
127. And utter dissolution, as the scope
128. Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
129. First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled
130. With armed watch, that render all access
131. Impregnable: oft on the bodering Deep
132. Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing
133. Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,
134. Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way
135. By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise
136. With blackest insurrection to confound
137. Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy,
138. All incorruptible, would on his throne
139. Sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould,
140. Incapable of stain, would soon expel
141. Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,
142. Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope
143. Is flat despair: we must exasperate
144. Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage;
145. And that must end us; that must be our cure--
146. To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose,
147. Though full of pain, this intellectual being,
148. Those thoughts that wander through eternity,
149. To perish rather, swallowed up and lost
150. In the wide womb of uncreated Night,
151. Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows,
152. Let this be good, whether our angry Foe
153. Can give it, or will ever? How he can
154. Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.
155. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,
156. Belike through impotence or unaware,
157. To give his enemies their wish, and end
158. Them in his anger whom his anger saves
159. To punish endless? 'Wherefore cease we, then?'
160. Say they who counsel war; 'we are decreed,
161. Reserved, and destined to eternal woe;
162. Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,
163. What can we suffer worse?' Is this, then, worst--
164. Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?
165. What when we fled amain, pursued and struck
166. With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought
167. The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed
168. A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay
169. Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.
170. What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,
171. Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,
172. And plunge us in the flames; or from above
173. Should intermitted vengeance arm again
174. His red right hand to plague us? What if all
175. Her stores were opened, and this firmament
176. Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,
177. Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall
178. One day upon our heads; while we perhaps,
179. Designing or exhorting glorious war,
180. Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,
181. Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey
182. Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk
183. Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,
184. There to converse with everlasting groans,
185. Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,
186. Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse.
187. War, therefore, open or concealed, alike
188. My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile
189. With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye
190. Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's height
191. All these our motions vain sees and derides,
192. Not more almighty to resist our might
193. Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
194. Shall we, then, live thus vile--the race of Heaven
195. Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here
196. Chains and these torments? Better these than worse,
197. By my advice; since fate inevitable
198. Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,
199. The Victor's will. To suffer, as to do,
200. Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust
201. That so ordains. This was at first resolved,
202. If we were wise, against so great a foe
203. Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
204. I laugh when those who at the spear are bold
205. And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear
206. What yet they know must follow--to endure
207. Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain,
208. The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now
209. Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,
210. Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit
211. His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,
212. Not mind us not offending, satisfied
213. With what is punished; whence these raging fires
214. Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.
215. Our purer essence then will overcome
216. Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel;
217. Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed
218. In temper and in nature, will receive
219. Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain,
220. This horror will grow mild, this darkness light;
221. Besides what hope the never-ending flight
222. Of future days may bring, what chance, what change
223. Worth waiting--since our present lot appears
224. For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,
225. If we procure not to ourselves more woe."
226. Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb,
227. Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,
228. Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:--
229. "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven
230. We war, if war be best, or to regain
231. Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then
232. May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield
233. To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.
234. The former, vain to hope, argues as vain
235. The latter; for what place can be for us
236. Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme
237. We overpower? Suppose he should relent
238. And publish grace to all, on promise made
239. Of new subjection; with what eyes could we
240. Stand in his presence humble, and receive
241. Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne
242. With warbled hyms, and to his Godhead sing
243. Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits
244. Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes
245. Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,
246. Our servile offerings? This must be our task
247. In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome
248. Eternity so spent in worship paid
249. To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue,
250. By force impossible, by leave obtained
251. Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state
252. Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek
253. Our own good from ourselves, and from our own
254. Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess,
255. Free and to none accountable, preferring
256. Hard liberty before the easy yoke
257. Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear
258. Then most conspicuous when great things of small,
259. Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,
260. We can create, and in what place soe'er
261. Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain
262. Through labour and endurance. This deep world
263. Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst
264. Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire
265. Choose to reside, his glory unobscured,
266. And with the majesty of darkness round
267. Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.
268. Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!
269. As he our darkness, cannot we his light
270. Imitate when we please? This desert soil
271. Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold;
272. Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
273. Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?
274. Our torments also may, in length of time,
275. Become our elements, these piercing fires
276. As soft as now severe, our temper changed
277. Into their temper; which must needs remove
278. The sensible of pain. All things invite
279. To peaceful counsels, and the settled state
280. Of order, how in safety best we may
281. Compose our present evils, with regard
282. Of what we are and where, dismissing quite
283. All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise."
284. He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled
285. Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain
286. The sound of blustering winds, which all night long
287. Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull
288. Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance
289. Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay
290. After the tempest. Such applause was heard
291. As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,
292. Advising peace: for such another field
293. They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear
294. Of thunder and the sword of Michael
295. Wrought still within them; and no less desire
296. To found this nether empire, which might rise,
297. By policy and long process of time,
298. In emulation opposite to Heaven.
299. Which when Beelzebub perceived--than whom,
300. Satan except, none higher sat--with grave
301. Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed
302. A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven
303. Deliberation sat, and public care;
304. And princely counsel in his face yet shone,
305. Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood
306. With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear
307. The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look
308. Drew audience and attention still as night
309. Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:--
310. "Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven,
311. Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now
312. Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called
313. Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
314. Inclines--here to continue, and build up here
315. A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream,
316. And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed
317. This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat
318. Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt
319. From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league
320. Banded against his throne, but to remain
321. In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,
322. Under th' inevitable curb, reserved
323. His captive multitude. For he, to be sure,
324. In height or depth, still first and last will reign
325. Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part
326. By our revolt, but over Hell extend
327. His empire, and with iron sceptre rule
328. Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven.
329. What sit we then projecting peace and war?
330. War hath determined us and foiled with loss
331. Irreparable; terms of peace yet none
332. Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given
333. To us enslaved, but custody severe,
334. And stripes and arbitrary punishment
335. Inflicted? and what peace can we return,
336. But, to our power, hostility and hate,
337. Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow,
338. Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least
339. May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice
340. In doing what we most in suffering feel?
341. Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need
342. With dangerous expedition to invade
343. Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,
344. Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find
345. Some easier enterprise? There is a place
346. (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven
347. Err not)--another World, the happy seat
348. Of some new race, called Man, about this time
349. To be created like to us, though less
350. In power and excellence, but favoured more
351. Of him who rules above; so was his will
352. Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath
353. That shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed.
354. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn
355. What creatures there inhabit, of what mould
356. Or substance, how endued, and what their power
357. And where their weakness: how attempted best,
358. By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut,
359. And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure
360. In his own strength, this place may lie exposed,
361. The utmost border of his kingdom, left
362. To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,
363. Some advantageous act may be achieved
364. By sudden onset--either with Hell-fire
365. To waste his whole creation, or possess
366. All as our own, and drive, as we were driven,
367. The puny habitants; or, if not drive,
368. Seduce them to our party, that their God
369. May prove their foe, and with repenting hand
370. Abolish his own works. This would surpass
371. Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
372. In our confusion, and our joy upraise
373. In his disturbance; when his darling sons,
374. Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse
375. Their frail original, and faded bliss--
376. Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth
377. Attempting, or to sit in darkness here
378. Hatching vain empires." Thus beelzebub
379. Pleaded his devilish counsel--first devised
380. By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,
381. But from the author of all ill, could spring
382. So deep a malice, to confound the race
383. Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell
384. To mingle and involve, done all to spite
385. The great Creator? But their spite still serves
386. His glory to augment. The bold design
387. Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy
388. Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent
389. They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:--
390. "Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,
391. Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are,
392. Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep
393. Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate,
394. Nearer our ancient seat--perhaps in view
395. Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms,
396. And opportune excursion, we may chance
397. Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone
398. Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light,
399. Secure, and at the brightening orient beam
400. Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air,
401. To heal the scar of these corrosive fires,
402. Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send
403. In search of this new World? whom shall we find
404. Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet
405. The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,
406. And through the palpable obscure find out
407. His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight,
408. Upborne with indefatigable wings
409. Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive
410. The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then
411. Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe,
412. Through the strict senteries and stations thick
413. Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
414. All circumspection: and we now no less
415. Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send
416. The weight of all, and our last hope, relies."
417. This said, he sat; and expectation held
418. His look suspense, awaiting who appeared
419. To second, or oppose, or undertake
420. The perilous attempt. But all sat mute,
421. Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each
422. In other's countenance read his own dismay,
423. Astonished. None among the choice and prime
424. Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found
425. So hardy as to proffer or accept,
426. Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last,
427. Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised
428. Above his fellows, with monarchal pride
429. Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:--
430. "O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones!
431. With reason hath deep silence and demur
432. Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way
433. And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.
434. Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire,
435. Outrageous to devour, immures us round
436. Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant,
437. Barred over us, prohibit all egress.
438. These passed, if any pass, the void profound
439. Of unessential Night receives him next,
440. Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being
441. Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.
442. If thence he scape, into whatever world,
443. Or unknown region, what remains him less
444. Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?
445. But I should ill become this throne, O Peers,
446. And this imperial sovereignty, adorned
447. With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed
448. And judged of public moment in the shape
449. Of difficulty or danger, could deter
450. Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume
451. These royalties, and not refuse to reign,
452. Refusing to accept as great a share
453. Of hazard as of honour, due alike
454. To him who reigns, and so much to him due
455. Of hazard more as he above the rest
456. High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers,
457. Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,
458. While here shall be our home, what best may ease
459. The present misery, and render Hell
460. More tolerable; if there be cure or charm
461. To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain
462. Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch
463. Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad
464. Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
465. Deliverance for us all. This enterprise
466. None shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose
467. The Monarch, and prevented all reply;
468. Prudent lest, from his resolution raised,
469. Others among the chief might offer now,
470. Certain to be refused, what erst they feared,
471. And, so refused, might in opinion stand
472. His rivals, winning cheap the high repute
473. Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they
474. Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice
475. Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.
476. Their rising all at once was as the sound
477. Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend
478. With awful reverence prone, and as a God
479. Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.
480. Nor failed they to express how much they praised
481. That for the general safety he despised
482. His own: for neither do the Spirits damned
483. Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast
484. Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,
485. Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal.
486. Thus they their doubtful consultations dark
487. Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief:
488. As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds
489. Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread
490. Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element
491. Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower,
492. If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,
493. Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,
494. The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds
495. Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.
496. O shame to men! Devil with devil damned
497. Firm concord holds; men only disagree
498. Of creatures rational, though under hope
499. Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace,
500. Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife
501. Among themselves, and levy cruel wars
502. Wasting the earth, each other to destroy:
503. As if (which might induce us to accord)
504. Man had not hellish foes enow besides,
505. That day and night for his destruction wait!
506. The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth
507. In order came the grand infernal Peers:
508. Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed
509. Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less
510. Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme,
511. And god-like imitated state: him round
512. A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed
513. With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.
514. Then of their session ended they bid cry
515. With trumpet's regal sound the great result:
516. Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
517. Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,
518. By herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss
519. Heard far adn wide, and all the host of Hell
520. With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.
521. Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised
522. By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers
523. Disband; and, wandering, each his several way
524. Pursues, as inclination or sad choice
525. Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find
526. Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain
527. The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.
528. Part on the plain, or in the air sublime,
529. Upon the wing or in swift race contend,
530. As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields;
531. Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal
532. With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:
533. As when, to warn proud cities, war appears
534. Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush
535. To battle in the clouds; before each van
536. Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,
537. Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms
538. From either end of heaven the welkin burns.
539. Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell,
540. Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air
541. In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:--
542. As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned
543. With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore
544. Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,
545. And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
546. Into th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild,
547. Retreated in a silent valley, sing
548. With notes angelical to many a harp
549. Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall
550. By doom of battle, and complain that Fate
551. Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
552. Their song was partial; but the harmony
553. (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)
554. Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment
555. The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet
556. (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)
557. Others apart sat on a hill retired,
558. In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high
559. Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate--
560. Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
561. And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.
562. Of good and evil much they argued then,
563. Of happiness and final misery,
564. Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:
565. Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!--
566. Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm
567. Pain for a while or anguish, and excite
568. Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast
569. With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
570. Another part, in squadrons and gross bands,
571. On bold adventure to discover wide
572. That dismal world, if any clime perhaps
573. Might yield them easier habitation, bend
574. Four ways their flying march, along the banks
575. Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge
576. Into the burning lake their baleful streams--
577. Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;
578. Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;
579. Cocytus, named of lamentation loud
580. Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,
581. Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
582. Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,
583. Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls
584. Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks
585. Forthwith his former state and being forgets--
586. Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
587. Beyond this flood a frozen continent
588. Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms
589. Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land
590. Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems
591. Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,
592. A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
593. Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,
594. Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air
595. Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire.
596. Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,
597. At certain revolutions all the damned
598. Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change
599. Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,
600. From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
601. Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine
602. Immovable, infixed, and frozen round
603. Periods of time,--thence hurried back to fire.
604. They ferry over this Lethean sound
605. Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,
606. And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach
607. The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose
608. In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,
609. All in one moment, and so near the brink;
610. But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt,
611. Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
612. The ford, and of itself the water flies
613. All taste of living wight, as once it fled
614. The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on
615. In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands,
616. With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,
617. Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found
618. No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale
619. They passed, and many a region dolorous,
620. O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp,
621. Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death--
622. A universe of death, which God by curse
623. Created evil, for evil only good;
624. Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,
625. Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,
626. Obominable, inutterable, and worse
627. Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,
628. Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.
629. Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,
630. Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,
631. Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell
632. Explores his solitary flight: sometimes
633. He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;
634. Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars
635. Up to the fiery concave towering high.
636. As when far off at sea a fleet descried
637. Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds
638. Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles
639. Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring
640. Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,
641. Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,
642. Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed
643. Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear
644. Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,
645. And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,
646. Three iron, three of adamantine rock,
647. Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,
648. Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat
649. On either side a formidable Shape.
650. The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,
651. But ended foul in many a scaly fold,
652. Voluminous and vast--a serpent armed
653. With mortal sting. About her middle round
654. A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked
655. With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung
656. A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,
657. If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,
658. And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled
659. Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these
660. Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts
661. Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;
662. Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called
663. In secret, riding through the air she comes,
664. Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance
665. With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon
666. Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape--
667. If shape it might be called that shape had none
668. Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;
669. Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,
670. For each seemed either--black it stood as Night,
671. Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,
672. And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head
673. The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
674. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat
675. The monster moving onward came as fast
676. With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.
677. Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired--
678. Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,
679. Created thing naught valued he nor shunned),
680. And with disdainful look thus first began:--
681. "Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape,
682. That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance
683. Thy miscreated front athwart my way
684. To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,
685. That be assured, without leave asked of thee.
686. Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,
687. Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven."
688. To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:--
689. "Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he,
690. Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then
691. Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms
692. Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons,
693. Conjured against the Highest--for which both thou
694. And they, outcast from God, are here condemned
695. To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
696. And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven
697. Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,
698. Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more,
699. Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment,
700. False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings,
701. Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
702. Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart
703. Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before."
704. So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape,
705. So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold,
706. More dreadful and deform. On th' other side,
707. Incensed with indignation, Satan stood
708. Unterrified, and like a comet burned,
709. That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
710. In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
711. Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head
712. Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands
713. No second stroke intend; and such a frown
714. Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds,
715. With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on
716. Over the Caspian,--then stand front to front
717. Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow
718. To join their dark encounter in mid-air.
719. So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell
720. Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;
721. For never but once more was wither like
722. To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds
723. Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,
724. Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat
725. Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key,
726. Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.
727. "O father, what intends thy hand," she cried,
728. "Against thy only son? What fury, O son,
729. Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart
730. Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom?
731. For him who sits above, and laughs the while
732. At thee, ordained his drudge to execute
733. Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids--
734. His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!"
735. She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest
736. Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:--
737. "So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange
738. Thou interposest, that my sudden hand,
739. Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds
740. What it intends, till first I know of thee
741. What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why,
742. In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st
743. Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son.
744. I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
745. Sight more detestable than him and thee."
746. T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:--
747. "Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem
748. Now in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair
749. In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight
750. Of all the Seraphim with thee combined
751. In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King,
752. All on a sudden miserable pain
753. Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
754. In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast
755. Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,
756. Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,
757. Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,
758. Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized
759. All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid
760. At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign
761. Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,
762. I pleased, and with attractive graces won
763. The most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft
764. Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing,
765. Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st
766. With me in secret that my womb conceived
767. A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose,
768. And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained
769. (For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe
770. Clear victory; to our part loss and rout
771. Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell,
772. Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down
773. Into this Deep; and in the general fall
774. I also: at which time this powerful key
775. Into my hands was given, with charge to keep
776. These gates for ever shut, which none can pass
777. Without my opening. Pensive here I sat
778. Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb,
779. Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown,
780. Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
781. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest,
782. Thine own begotten, breaking violent way,
783. Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain
784. Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew
785. Transformed: but he my inbred enemy
786. Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,
787. Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death!
788. Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed
789. From all her caves, and back resounded Death!
790. I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,
791. Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,
792. Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed,
793. And, in embraces forcible and foul
794. Engendering with me, of that rape begot
795. These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry
796. Surround me, as thou saw'st--hourly conceived
797. And hourly born, with sorrow infinite
798. To me; for, when they list, into the womb
799. That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw
800. My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth
801. Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,
802. That rest or intermission none I find.
803. Before mine eyes in opposition sits
804. Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on,
805. And me, his parent, would full soon devour
806. For want of other prey, but that he knows
807. His end with mine involved, and knows that I
808. Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,
809. Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.
810. But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun
811. His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope
812. To be invulnerable in those bright arms,
813. Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,
814. Save he who reigns above, none can resist."
815. She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore
816. Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:--
817. "Dear daughter--since thou claim'st me for thy sire,
818. And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge
819. Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys
820. Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change
821. Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-of--know,
822. I come no enemy, but to set free
823. From out this dark and dismal house of pain
824. Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host
825. Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed,
826. Fell with us from on high. From them I go
827. This uncouth errand sole, and one for all
828. Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread
829. Th' unfounded Deep, and through the void immense
830. To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold
831. Should be--and, by concurring signs, ere now
832. Created vast and round--a place of bliss
833. In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed
834. A race of upstart creatures, to supply
835. Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed,
836. Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude,
837. Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught
838. Than this more secret, now designed, I haste
839. To know; and, this once known, shall soon return,
840. And bring ye to the place where thou and Death
841. Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen
842. Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed
843. With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled
844. Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey."
845. He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death
846. Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear
847. His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw
848. Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced
849. His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:--
850. "The key of this infernal Pit, by due
851. And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King,
852. I keep, by him forbidden to unlock
853. These adamantine gates; against all force
854. Death ready stands to interpose his dart,
855. Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might.
856. But what owe I to his commands above,
857. Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down
858. Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,
859. To sit in hateful office here confined,
860. Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born--
861. Here in perpetual agony and pain,
862. With terrors and with clamours compassed round
863. Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?
864. Thou art my father, thou my author, thou
865. My being gav'st me; whom should I obey
866. But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon
867. To that new world of light and bliss, among
868. The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign
869. At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems
870. Thy daughter and thy darling, without end."
871. Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,
872. Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;
873. And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train,
874. Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew,
875. Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers
876. Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns
877. Th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar
878. Of massy iron or solid rock with ease
879. Unfastens. On a sudden open fly,
880. With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,
881. Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate
882. Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook
883. Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut
884. Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood,
885. That with extended wings a bannered host,
886. Under spread ensigns marching, mibht pass through
887. With horse and chariots ranked in loose array;
888. So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth
889. Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.
890. Before their eyes in sudden view appear
891. The secrets of the hoary Deep--a dark
892. Illimitable ocean, without bound,
893. Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height,
894. And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night
895. And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold
896. Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise
897. Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.
898. For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce,
899. Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring
900. Their embryon atoms: they around the flag
901. Of each his faction, in their several clans,
902. Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow,
903. Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands
904. Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,
905. Levied to side with warring winds, and poise
906. Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere
907. He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits,
908. And by decision more embroils the fray
909. By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter,
910. Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss,
911. The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave,
912. Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,
913. But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
914. Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,
915. Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain
916. His dark materials to create more worlds--
917. Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend
918. Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,
919. Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith
920. He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed
921. With noises loud and ruinous (to compare
922. Great things with small) than when Bellona storms
923. With all her battering engines, bent to rase
924. Some capital city; or less than if this frame
925. Of Heaven were falling, and these elements
926. In mutiny had from her axle torn
927. The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans
928. He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke
929. Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league,
930. As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides
931. Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets
932. A vast vacuity. All unawares,
933. Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops
934. Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour
935. Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance,
936. The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,
937. Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him
938. As many miles aloft. That fury stayed--
939. Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea,
940. Nor good dry land--nigh foundered, on he fares,
941. Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,
942. Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.
943. As when a gryphon through the wilderness
944. With winged course, o'er hill or moory dale,
945. Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth
946. Had from his wakeful custody purloined
947. The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend
948. O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,
949. With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,
950. And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.
951. At length a universal hubbub wild
952. Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused,
953. Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear
954. With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies
955. Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power
956. Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
957. Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
958. Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
959. Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne
960. Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread
961. Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned
962. Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things,
963. The consort of his reign; and by them stood
964. Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name
965. Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,
966. And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled,
967. And Discord with a thousand various mouths.
968. T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:--"Ye Powers
969. And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss,
970. Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy
971. With purpose to explore or to disturb
972. The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint
973. Wandering this darksome desert, as my way
974. Lies through your spacious empire up to light,
975. Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek,
976. What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
977. Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place,
978. From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King
979. Possesses lately, thither to arrive
980. I travel this profound. Direct my course:
981. Directed, no mean recompense it brings
982. To your behoof, if I that region lost,
983. All usurpation thence expelled, reduce
984. To her original darkness and your sway
985. (Which is my present journey), and once more
986. Erect the standard there of ancient Night.
987. Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge!"
988. Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old,
989. With faltering speech and visage incomposed,
990. Answered:  "I know thee, stranger, who thou art--  ***
991. That mighty leading Angel, who of late
992. Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown.
993. I saw and heard; for such a numerous host
994. Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep,
995. With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,
996. Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates
997. Poured out by millions her victorious bands,
998. Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here
999. Keep residence; if all I can will serve
1000. That little which is left so to defend,
1001. Encroached on still through our intestine broils
1002. Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell,
1003. Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath;
1004. Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world
1005. Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain
1006. To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!
1007. If that way be your walk, you have not far;
1008. So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed;
1009. Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain."
1010. He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply,
1011. But, glad that now his sea should find a shore,
1012. With fresh alacrity and force renewed
1013. Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire,
1014. Into the wild expanse, and through the shock
1015. Of fighting elements, on all sides round
1016. Environed, wins his way; harder beset
1017. And more endangered than when Argo passed
1018. Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks,
1019. Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned
1020. Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steered.
1021. So he with difficulty and labour hard
1022. Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;
1023. But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell,
1024. Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain,
1025. Following his track (such was the will of Heaven)
1026. Paved after him a broad and beaten way
1027. Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf
1028. Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length,
1029. From Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb
1030. Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse
1031. With easy intercourse pass to and fro
1032. To tempt or punish mortals, except whom
1033. God and good Angels guard by special grace.
1034. But now at last the sacred influence
1035. Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven
1036. Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night
1037. A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins
1038. Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire,
1039. As from her outmost works, a broken foe,
1040. With tumult less and with less hostile din;
1041. That Satan with less toil, and now with ease,
1042. Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light,
1043. And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds
1044. Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn;
1045. Or in the emptier waste, resembling air,
1046. Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold
1047. Far off th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide
1048. In circuit, undetermined square or round,
1049. With opal towers and battlements adorned
1050. Of living sapphire, once his native seat;
1051. And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
1052. This pendent World, in bigness as a star
1053. Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.
1054. Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,
1055. Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.
