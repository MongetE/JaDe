1. All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,
2. Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn,
3. Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand
4. Unbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave
5. Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,
6. Where light and darkness in perpetual round
7. Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven
8. Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;
9. Light issues forth, and at the other door
10. Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
11. To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well
12. Seem twilight here:  And now went forth the Morn
13. Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold
14. Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,
15. Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain
16. Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,
17. Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,
18. Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
19. War he perceived, war in procinct; and found
20. Already known what he for news had thought
21. To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed
22. Among those friendly Powers, who him received
23. With joy and acclamations loud, that one,
24. That of so many myriads fallen, yet one
25. Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill
26. They led him high applauded, and present
27. Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,
28. From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.
29. Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought
30. The better fight, who single hast maintained
31. Against revolted multitudes the cause
32. Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;
33. And for the testimony of truth hast borne
34. Universal reproach, far worse to bear
35. Than violence; for this was all thy care
36. To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds
37. Judged thee perverse:  The easier conquest now
38. Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
39. Back on thy foes more glorious to return,
40. Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue
41. By force, who reason for their law refuse,
42. Right reason for their law, and for their King
43. Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.
44. Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,
45. And thou, in military prowess next,
46. Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons
47. Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,
48. By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,
49. Equal in number to that Godless crew
50. Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms
51. Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven
52. Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,
53. Into their place of punishment, the gulf
54. Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
55. His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.
56. So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began
57. To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll
58. In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign
59. Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud
60. Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:
61. At which command the Powers militant,
62. That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined
63. Of union irresistible, moved on
64. In silence their bright legions, to the sound
65. Of instrumental harmony, that breathed
66. Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds
67. Under their God-like leaders, in the cause
68. Of God and his Messiah.  On they move
69. Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,
70. Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides
71. Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground
72. Their march was, and the passive air upbore
73. Their nimble tread; as when the total kind
74. Of birds, in orderly array on wing,
75. Came summoned over Eden to receive
76. Their names of thee; so over many a tract
77. Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,
78. Tenfold the length of this terrene:  At last,
79. Far in the horizon to the north appeared
80. From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched
81. In battailous aspect, and nearer view
82. Bristled with upright beams innumerable
83. Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields
84. Various, with boastful argument portrayed,
85. The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
86. With furious expedition; for they weened
87. That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,
88. To win the mount of God, and on his throne
89. To set the Envier of his state, the proud
90. Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain
91. In the mid way:  Though strange to us it seemed
92. At first, that Angel should with Angel war,
93. And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet
94. So oft in festivals of joy and love
95. Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,
96. Hymning the Eternal Father:  But the shout
97. Of battle now began, and rushing sound
98. Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
99. High in the midst, exalted as a God,
100. The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,
101. Idol of majesty divine, enclosed
102. With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;
103. Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now
104. "twixt host and host but narrow space was left,
105. A dreadful interval, and front to front
106. Presented stood in terrible array
107. Of hideous length:  Before the cloudy van,
108. On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,
109. Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,
110. Came towering, armed in adamant and gold;
111. Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood
112. Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
113. And thus his own undaunted heart explores.
114. O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest
115. Should yet remain, where faith and realty
116. Remain not:  Wherefore should not strength and might
117. There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove
118. Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?
119. His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,
120. I mean to try, whose reason I have tried
121. Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
122. That he, who in debate of truth hath won,
123. Should win in arms, in both disputes alike
124. Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,
125. When reason hath to deal with force, yet so
126. Most reason is that reason overcome.
127. So pondering, and from his armed peers
128. Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met
129. His daring foe, at this prevention more
130. Incensed, and thus securely him defied.
131. Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached
132. The highth of thy aspiring unopposed,
133. The throne of God unguarded, and his side
134. Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power
135. Or potent tongue:  Fool!not to think how vain
136. Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;
137. Who out of smallest things could, without end,
138. Have raised incessant armies to defeat
139. Thy folly; or with solitary hand
140. Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,
141. Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed
142. Thy legions under darkness:  But thou seest
143. All are not of thy train; there be, who faith
144. Prefer, and piety to God, though then
145. To thee not visible, when I alone
146. Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
147. From all:  My sect thou seest;now learn too late
148. How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.
149. Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,
150. Thus answered.  Ill for thee, but in wished hour
151. Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest
152. From flight, seditious Angel! to receive
153. Thy merited reward, the first assay
154. Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,
155. Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose
156. A third part of the Gods, in synod met
157. Their deities to assert; who, while they feel
158. Vigour divine within them, can allow
159. Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comest
160. Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
161. From me some plume, that thy success may show
162. Destruction to the rest:  This pause between,
163. (Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,
164. At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven
165. To heavenly souls had been all one; but now
166. I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
167. Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!
168. Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,
169. Servility with freedom to contend,
170. As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.
171. To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.
172. Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find
173. Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
174. Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
175. Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,
176. Or Nature:  God and Nature bid the same,
177. When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
178. Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,
179. To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled
180. Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
181. Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;
182. Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.
183. Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve
184. In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine
185. Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;
186. Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while
187. From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
188. This greeting on thy impious crest receive.
189. So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
190. Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
191. On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,
192. Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,
193. Such ruin intercept:  Ten paces huge
194. He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee
195. His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth
196. Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,
197. Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,
198. Half sunk with all his pines.  Amazement seised
199. The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see
200. Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,
201. Presage of victory, and fierce desire
202. Of battle:  Whereat Michael bid sound
203. The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven
204. It sounded, and the faithful armies rung
205. Hosanna to the Highest:  Nor stood at gaze
206. The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined
207. The horrid shock.  Now storming fury rose,
208. And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
209. Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed
210. Horrible discord, and the madding wheels
211. Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise
212. Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss
213. Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,
214. And flying vaulted either host with fire.
215. So under fiery cope together rushed
216. Both battles main, with ruinous assault
217. And inextinguishable rage.  All Heaven
218. Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth
219. Had to her center shook.  What wonder? when
220. Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
221. On either side, the least of whom could wield
222. These elements, and arm him with the force
223. Of all their regions:  How much more of power
224. Army against army numberless to raise
225. Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
226. Though not destroy, their happy native seat;
227. Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,
228. From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled
229. And limited their might; though numbered such
230. As each divided legion might have seemed
231. A numerous host; in strength each armed hand
232. A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed
233. Each warriour single as in chief, expert
234. When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
235. Of battle, open when, and when to close
236. The ridges of grim war:  No thought of flight,
237. None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
238. That argued fear; each on himself relied,
239. As only in his arm the moment lay
240. Of victory:  Deeds of eternal fame
241. Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread
242. That war and various; sometimes on firm ground
243. A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,
244. Tormented all the air; all air seemed then
245. Conflicting fire.  Long time in even scale
246. The battle hung; till Satan, who that day
247. Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms
248. No equal, ranging through the dire attack
249. Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length
250. Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled
251. Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway
252. Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down
253. Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand
254. He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb
255. Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,
256. A vast circumference.  At his approach
257. The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil
258. Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end
259. Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued
260. Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown
261. And visage all inflamed first thus began.
262. Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
263. Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest
264. These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,
265. Though heaviest by just measure on thyself,
266. And thy  adherents:  How hast thou disturbed
267. Heaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought
268. Misery, uncreated till the crime
269. Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled
270. Thy malice into thousands, once upright
271. And faithful, now proved false!  But think not here
272. To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out
273. From all her confines.  Heaven, the seat of bliss,
274. Brooks not the works of violence and war.
275. Hence then, and evil go with thee along,
276. Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;
277. Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,
278. Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,
279. Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,
280. Precipitate thee with augmented pain.
281. So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
282. The Adversary.  Nor think thou with wind
283. Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds
284. Thou canst not.  Hast thou turned the least of these
285. To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
286. Unvanquished, easier to transact with me
287. That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats
288. To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end
289. The strife which thou callest evil, but we style
290. The strife of glory; which we mean to win,
291. Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell
292. Thou fablest; here however to dwell free,
293. If not to reign:  Mean while thy utmost force,
294. And join him named Almighty to thy aid,
295. I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.
296. They ended parle, and both addressed for fight
297. Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
298. Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
299. Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift
300. Human imagination to such highth
301. Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,
302. Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,
303. Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.
304. Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air
305. Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields
306. Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood
307. In horrour:  From each hand with speed retired,
308. Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,
309. And left large field, unsafe within the wind
310. Of such commotion; such as, to set forth
311. Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke,
312. Among the constellations war were sprung,
313. Two planets, rushing from aspect malign
314. Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky
315. Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.
316. Together both with next to almighty arm
317. Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed
318. That might determine, and not need repeat,
319. As not of power at once; nor odds appeared
320. In might or swift prevention:  But the sword
321. Of Michael from the armoury of God
322. Was given him tempered so, that neither keen
323. Nor solid might resist that edge: it met
324. The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite
325. Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,
326. But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared
327. All his right side:  Then Satan first knew pain,
328. And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore
329. The griding sword with discontinuous wound
330. Passed through him:  But the ethereal substance closed,
331. Not long divisible; and from the gash
332. A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
333. Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,
334. And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.
335. Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
336. By Angels many and strong, who interposed
337. Defence, while others bore him on their shields
338. Back to his chariot, where it stood retired
339. From off the files of war:  There they him laid
340. Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,
341. To find himself not matchless, and his pride
342. Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath
343. His confidence to equal God in power.
344. Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout
345. Vital in every part, not as frail man
346. In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,
347. Cannot but by annihilating die;
348. Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
349. Receive, no more than can the fluid air:
350. All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,
351. All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,
352. They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size
353. Assume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare.
354. Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
355. Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,
356. And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
357. Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied,
358. And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound
359. Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven
360. Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon
361. Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms
362. And uncouth pain fled bellowing.  On each wing
363. Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,
364. Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,
365. Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,
366. Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods
367. Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,
368. Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.
369. Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
370. The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow
371. Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence
372. Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.
373. I might relate of thousands, and their names
374. Eternize here on earth; but those elect
375. Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,
376. Seek not the praise of men:  The other sort,
377. In might though wonderous and in acts of war,
378. Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom
379. Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,
380. Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
381. For strength from truth divided, and from just,
382. Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise
383. And ignominy; yet to glory aspires
384. Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:
385. Therefore eternal silence be their doom.
386. And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,
387. With many an inroad gored; deformed rout
388. Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground
389. With shivered armour strown, and on a heap
390. Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,
391. And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled
392. O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host
393. Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,
394. Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,
395. Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
396. By sin of disobedience; till that hour
397. Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.
398. Far otherwise the inviolable Saints,
399. In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,
400. Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;
401. Such high advantages their innocence
402. Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned,
403. Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood
404. Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained
405. By wound, though from their place by violence moved,
406. Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven
407. Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,
408. And silence on the odious din of war:
409. Under her cloudy covert both retired,
410. Victor and vanquished:  On the foughten field
411. Michael and his Angels prevalent
412. Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,
413. Cherubick waving fires:  On the other part,
414. Satan with his rebellious disappeared,
415. Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,
416. His potentates to council called by night;
417. And in the midst thus undismayed began.
418. O now in danger tried, now known in arms
419. Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,
420. Found worthy not of liberty alone,
421. Too mean pretence! but what we more affect,
422. Honour, dominion, glory, and renown;
423. Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight,
424. (And if one day, why not eternal days?)
425. What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send
426. Against us from about his throne, and judged
427. Sufficient to subdue us to his will,
428. But proves not so:  Then fallible, it seems,
429. Of future we may deem him, though till now
430. Omniscient thought.  True is, less firmly armed,
431. Some disadvantage we endured and pain,
432. Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;
433. Since now we find this our empyreal form
434. Incapable of mortal injury,
435. Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,
436. Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.
437. Of evil then so small as easy think
438. The remedy; perhaps more valid arms,
439. Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
440. May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
441. Or equal what between us made the odds,
442. In nature none:  If other hidden cause
443. Left them superiour, while we can preserve
444. Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,
445. Due search and consultation will disclose.
446. He sat; and in the assembly next upstood
447. Nisroch, of Principalities the prime;
448. As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,
449. Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,
450. And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.
451. Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free
452. Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard
453. For Gods, and too unequal work we find,
454. Against unequal arms to fight in pain,
455. Against unpained, impassive; from which evil
456. Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails
457. Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain
458. Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands
459. Of mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well
460. Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,
461. But live content, which is the calmest life:
462. But pain is perfect misery, the worst
463. Of evils, and, excessive, overturns
464. All patience.  He, who therefore can invent
465. With what more forcible we may offend
466. Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm
467. Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves
468. No less than for deliverance what we owe.
469. Whereto with look composed Satan replied.
470. Not uninvented that, which thou aright
471. Believest so main to our success, I bring.
472. Which of us who beholds the bright surface
473. Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand,
474. This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned
475. With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;
476. Whose eye so superficially surveys
477. These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
478. Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,
479. Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched
480. With Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth
481. So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?
482. These in their dark nativity the deep
483. Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;
484. Which, into hollow engines, long and round,
485. Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire
486. Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth
487. From far, with thundering noise, among our foes
488. Such implements of mischief, as shall dash
489. To pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands
490. Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed
491. The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
492. Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,
493. Effect shall end our wish.  Mean while revive;
494. Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined
495. Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.
496. He ended, and his words their drooping cheer
497. Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.
498. The invention all admired, and each, how he
499. To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed
500. Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought
501. Impossible:  Yet, haply, of thy race
502. In future days, if malice should abound,
503. Some one intent on mischief, or inspired
504. With devilish machination, might devise
505. Like instrument to plague the sons of men
506. For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
507. Forthwith from council to the work they flew;
508. None arguing stood; innumerable hands
509. Were ready; in a moment up they turned
510. Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath
511. The originals of nature in their crude
512. Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam
513. They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,
514. Concocted and adusted they reduced
515. To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:
516. Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth
517. Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,
518. Whereof to found their engines and their balls
519. Of missive ruin; part incentive reed
520. Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
521. So all ere day-spring, under conscious night,
522. Secret they finished, and in order set,
523. With silent circumspection, unespied.
524. Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,
525. Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms
526. The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood
527. Of golden panoply, refulgent host,
528. Soon banded; others from the dawning hills
529. Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,
530. Each quarter to descry the distant foe,
531. Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,
532. In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met
533. Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow
534. But firm battalion; back with speediest sail
535. Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
536. Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.
537. Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,
538. Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
539. This day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud
540. He comes, and settled in his face I see
541. Sad resolution, and secure:  Let each
542. His adamantine coat gird well, and each
543. Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,
544. Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,
545. If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,
546. But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.
547. So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon
548. In order, quit of all impediment;
549. Instant without disturb they took alarm,
550. And onward moved embattled:  When behold!
551. Not distant far with heavy pace the foe
552. Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube
553. Training his devilish enginery, impaled
554. On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,
555. To hide the fraud.  At interview both stood
556. A while; but suddenly at head appeared
557. Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.
558. Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;
559. That all may see who hate us, how we seek
560. Peace and composure, and with open breast
561. Stand ready to receive them, if they like
562. Our overture; and turn not back perverse:
563. But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!
564. Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge
565. Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand
566. Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch
567. What we propound, and loud that all may hear!
568. So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce
569. Had ended; when to right and left the front
570. Divided, and to either flank retired:
571. Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,
572. A triple mounted row of pillars laid
573. On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,
574. Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,
575. With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)
576. Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths
577. With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,
578. Portending hollow truce:  At each behind
579. A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed
580. Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,
581. Collected stood within our thoughts amused,
582. Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds
583. Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied
584. With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,
585. But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,
586. From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar
587. Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,
588. And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul
589. Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail
590. Of iron globes; which, on the victor host
591. Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,
592. That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,
593. Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell
594. By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;
595. The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might
596. Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift
597. By quick contraction or remove; but now
598. Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;
599. Nor served it to relax their serried files.
600. What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse
601. Repeated, and indecent overthrow
602. Doubled, would render them yet more despised,
603. And to their foes a laughter; for in view
604. Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,
605. In posture to displode their second tire
606. Of thunder:  Back defeated to return
607. They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,
608. And to his mates thus in derision called.
609. O Friends! why come not on these victors proud
610. Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,
611. To entertain them fair with open front
612. And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms
613. Of composition, straight they changed their minds,
614. Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
615. As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed
616. Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps
617. For joy of offered peace:  But I suppose,
618. If our proposals once again were heard,
619. We should compel them to a quick result.
620. To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.
621. Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,
622. Of hard contents, and full of force urged home;
623. Such as we might perceive amused them all,
624. And stumbled many:  Who receives them right,
625. Had need from head to foot well understand;
626. Not understood, this gift they have besides,
627. They show us when our foes walk not upright.
628. So they among themselves in pleasant vein
629. Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond
630. All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might
631. To match with their inventions they presumed
632. So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,
633. And all his host derided, while they stood
634. A while in trouble:  But they stood not long;
635. Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
636. Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
637. Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,
638. Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)
639. Their arms away they threw, and to the hills
640. (For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
641. Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,)
642. Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;
643. From their foundations loosening to and fro,
644. They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,
645. Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops
646. Up-lifting bore them in their hands:  Amaze,
647. Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,
648. When coming towards them so dread they saw
649. The bottom of the mountains upward turned;
650. Till on those cursed engines' triple-row
651. They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence
652. Under the weight of mountains buried deep;
653. Themselves invaded next, and on their heads
654. Main promontories flung, which in the air
655. Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;
656. Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised
657. Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
658. Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;
659. Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
660. Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,
661. Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
662. The rest, in imitation, to like arms
663. Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:
664. So hills amid the air encountered hills,
665. Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire;
666. That under ground they fought in dismal shade;
667. Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game
668. To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped
669. Upon confusion rose:  And now all Heaven
670. Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;
671. Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits
672. Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,
673. Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen
674. This tumult, and permitted all, advised:
675. That his great purpose he might so fulfil,
676. To honour his anointed Son avenged
677. Upon his enemies, and to declare
678. All power on him transferred:  Whence to his Son,
679. The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.
680. Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,
681. Son, in whose face invisible is beheld
682. Visibly, what by Deity I am;
683. And in whose hand what by decree I do,
684. Second Omnipotence! two days are past,
685. Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,
686. Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
687. These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight,
688. As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;
689. For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,
690. Equal in their creation they were formed,
691. Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought
692. Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;
693. Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
694. Endless, and no solution will be found:
695. War wearied hath performed what war can do,
696. And to disordered rage let loose the reins
697. With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes
698. Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.
699. Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;
700. For thee I have ordained it; and thus far
701. Have suffered, that the glory may be thine
702. Of ending this great war, since none but Thou
703. Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace
704. Immense I have transfused, that all may know
705. In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;
706. And, this perverse commotion governed thus,
707. To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
708. Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King
709. By sacred unction, thy deserved right.
710. Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;
711. Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels
712. That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,
713. My bow and thunder, my almighty arms
714. Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;
715. Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out
716. From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:
717. There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
718. God, and Messiah his anointed King.
719. He said, and on his Son with rays direct
720. Shone full; he all his Father full expressed
721. Ineffably into his face received;
722. And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.
723. O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,
724. First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st
725. To glorify thy Son, I always thee,
726. As is most just:  This I my glory account,
727. My exaltation, and my whole delight,
728. That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will
729. Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
730. Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume,
731. And gladlier shall resign, when in the end
732. Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee
733. For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:
734. But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on
735. Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,
736. Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,
737. Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;
738. To their prepared ill mansion driven down,
739. To chains of darkness, and the undying worm;
740. That from thy just obedience could revolt,
741. Whom to obey is happiness entire.
742. Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure
743. Far separate, circling thy holy mount,
744. Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,
745. Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.
746. So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose
747. From the right hand of Glory where he sat;
748. And the third sacred morn began to shine,
749. Dawning through Heaven.  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound
750. The chariot of Paternal Deity,
751. Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,
752. Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed
753. By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each
754. Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all
755. And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels
756. Of beryl, and careering fires between;
757. Over their heads a crystal firmament,
758. Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure
759. Amber, and colours of the showery arch.
760. He, in celestial panoply all armed
761. Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
762. Ascended; at his right hand Victory
763. Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow
764. And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;
765. And from about him fierce effusion rolled
766. Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:
767. Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
768. He onward came; far off his coming shone;
769. And twenty thousand (I their number heard)
770. Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;
771. He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
772. On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,
773. Illustrious far and wide; but by his own
774. First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised,
775. When the great ensign of Messiah blazed
776. Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;
777. Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
778. His army, circumfused on either wing,
779. Under their Head imbodied all in one.
780. Before him Power Divine his way prepared;
781. At his command the uprooted hills retired
782. Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went
783. Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,
784. And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.
785. This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,
786. And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,
787. Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
788. In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
789. But to convince the proud what signs avail,
790. Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?
791. They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,
792. Grieving to see his glory, at the sight
793. Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth,
794. Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud
795. Weening to prosper, and at length prevail
796. Against God and Messiah, or to fall
797. In universal ruin last; and now
798. To final battle drew, disdaining flight,
799. Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
800. To all his host on either hand thus spake.
801. Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,
802. Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:
803. Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
804. Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;
805. And as ye have received, so have ye done,
806. Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew
807. The punishment to other hand belongs;
808. Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:
809. Number to this day's work is not ordained,
810. Nor multitude; stand only, and behold
811. God's indignation on these godless poured
812. By me; not you, but me, they have despised,
813. Yet envied; against me is all their rage,
814. Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme
815. Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,
816. Hath honoured me, according to his will.
817. Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;
818. That they may have their wish, to try with me
819. In battle which the stronger proves; they all,
820. Or I alone against them; since by strength
821. They measure all, of other excellence
822. Not emulous, nor care who them excels;
823. Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.
824. So spake the Son, and into terrour changed
825. His countenance too severe to be beheld,
826. And full of wrath bent on his enemies.
827. At once the Four spread out their starry wings
828. With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs
829. Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound
830. Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.
831. He on his impious foes right onward drove,
832. Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels
833. The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,
834. All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon
835. Among them he arrived; in his right hand
836. Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent
837. Before him, such as in their souls infixed
838. Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost,
839. All courage; down their idle weapons dropt:
840. O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode
841. Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
842. That wished the mountains now might be again
843. Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.
844. Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
845. His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four
846. Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels
847. Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;
848. One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye
849. Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
850. Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,
851. And of their wonted vigour left them drained,
852. Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
853. Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked
854. His thunder in mid volley; for he meant
855. Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:
856. The overthrown he raised, and as a herd
857. Of goats or timorous flock together thronged
858. Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued
859. With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds
860. And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,
861. Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed
862. Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight
863. Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse
864. Urged them behind:  Headlong themselves they threw
865. Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath
866. Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.
867. Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw
868. Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled
869. Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep
870. Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
871. Nine days they fell:  Confounded Chaos roared,
872. And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
873. Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout
874. Incumbered him with ruin:  Hell at last
875. Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;
876. Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire
877. Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.
878. Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired
879. Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.
880. Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,
881. Messiah his triumphal chariot turned:
882. To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood
883. Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,
884. With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,
885. Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright,
886. Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,
887. Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,
888. Worthiest to reign:  He, celebrated, rode
889. Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts
890. And temple of his Mighty Father throned
891. On high; who into glory him received,
892. Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.
893. Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,
894. At thy request, and that thou mayest beware
895. By what is past, to thee I have revealed
896. What might have else to human race been hid;
897. The discord which befel, and war in Heaven
898. Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall
899. Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled
900. With Satan; he who envies now thy state,
901. Who now is plotting how he may seduce
902. Thee also from obedience, that, with him
903. Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake
904. His punishment, eternal misery;
905. Which would be all his solace and revenge,
906. As a despite done against the Most High,
907. Thee once to gain companion of his woe.
908. But listen not to his temptations, warn
909. Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,
910. By terrible example, the reward
911. Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,
912. Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
