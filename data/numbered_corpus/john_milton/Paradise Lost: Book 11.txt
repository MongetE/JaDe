1. Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn
2. From his displeasure; in whose look serene,
3. When angry most he seemed and most severe,
4. What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?
5. So spake our father penitent; nor Eve
6. Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place
7. Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell
8. Before him reverent; and both confessed
9. Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears
10. Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air
11. Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
12. Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
13. Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood
14. Praying; for from the mercy-seat above
15. Prevenient grace descending had removed
16. The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh
17. Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed
18. Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer
19. Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight
20. Than loudest oratory:  Yet their port
21. Not of mean suitors; nor important less
22. Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair
23. In fables old, less ancient yet than these,
24. Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore
25. The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine
26. Of Themis stood devout.  To Heaven their prayers
27. Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds
28. Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed
29. Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad
30. With incense, where the golden altar fumed,
31. By their great intercessour, came in sight
32. Before the Father's throne: them the glad Son
33. Presenting, thus to intercede began.
34. See$ Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung
35. From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs
36. And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed
37. With incense, I thy priest before thee bring;
38. Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed
39. Sown with contrition in his heart, than those
40. Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees
41. Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen
42. From innocence.  Now therefore, bend thine ear
43. To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute;
44. Unskilful with what words to pray, let me
45. Interpret for him; me, his advocate
46. And propitiation; all his works on me,
47. Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those
48. Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.
49. Accept me; and, in me, from these receive
50. The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live
51. Before thee reconciled, at least his days
52. Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I
53. To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,)
54. To better life shall yield him: where with me
55. All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss;
56. Made one with me, as I with thee am one.
57. To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.
58. All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
59. Obtain; all thy request was my decree:
60. But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,
61. The law I gave to Nature him forbids:
62. Those pure immortal elements, that know,
63. No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,
64. Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off,
65. As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,
66. And mortal food; as may dispose him best
67. For dissolution wrought by sin, that first
68. Distempered all things, and of incorrupt
69. Corrupted.  I, at first, with two fair gifts
70. Created him endowed; with happiness,
71. And immortality: that fondly lost,
72. This other served but to eternize woe;
73. Till I provided death: so death becomes
74. His final remedy; and, after life,
75. Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined
76. By faith and faithful works, to second life,
77. Waked in the renovation of the just,
78. Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.
79. But let us call to synod all the Blest,
80. Through Heaven's wide bounds: from them I will not hide
81. My judgements; how with mankind I proceed,
82. As how with peccant Angels late they saw,
83. And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.
84. He ended, and the Son gave signal high
85. To the bright minister that watched; he blew
86. His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
87. When God descended, and perhaps once more
88. To sound at general doom.  The angelick blast
89. Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers
90. Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring,
91. By the waters of life, where'er they sat
92. In fellowships of joy, the sons of light
93. Hasted, resorting to the summons high;
94. And took their seats; till from his throne supreme
95. The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.
96. O Sons, like one of us Man is become
97. To know both good and evil, since his taste
98. Of that defended fruit; but let him boast
99. His knowledge of good lost, and evil got;
100. Happier! had it sufficed him to have known
101. Good by itself, and evil not at all.
102. He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite,
103. My motions in him; longer than they move,
104. His heart I know, how variable and vain,
105. Self-left.  Lest therefore his now bolder hand
106. Reach also of the tree of life, and eat,
107. And live for ever, dream at least to live
108. For ever, to remove him I decree,
109. And send him from the garden forth to till
110. The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.
111. Michael, this my behest have thou in charge;
112. Take to thee from among the Cherubim
113. Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend,
114. Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
115. Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:
116. Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God
117. Without remorse drive out the sinful pair;
118. From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce
119. To them, and to their progeny, from thence
120. Perpetual banishment.  Yet, lest they faint
121. At the sad sentence rigorously urged,
122. (For I behold them softened, and with tears
123. Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.
124. If patiently thy bidding they obey,
125. Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal
126. To Adam what shall come in future days,
127. As I shall thee enlighten; intermix
128. My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed;
129. So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
130. And on the east side of the garden place,
131. Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,
132. Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame
133. Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright,
134. And guard all passage to the tree of life:
135. Lest Paradise a receptacle prove
136. To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey;
137. With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.
138. He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared
139. For swift descent; with him the cohort bright
140. Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each
141. Had, like a double Janus; all their shape
142. Spangled with eyes more numerous than those
143. Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse,
144. Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed
145. Of Hermes, or his opiate rod.  Mean while,
146. To re-salute the world with sacred light,
147. Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed
148. The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve
149. Had ended now their orisons, and found
150. Strength added from above; new hope to spring
151. Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked;
152. Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.
153. Eve, easily my faith admit, that all
154. The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends;
155. But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven
156. So prevalent as to concern the mind
157. Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,
158. Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer
159. Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne
160. Even to the seat of God.  For since I sought
161. By prayer the offended Deity to appease;
162. Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart;
163. Methought I saw him placable and mild,
164. Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew
165. That I was heard with favour; peace returned
166. Home to my breast, and to my memory
167. His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe;
168. Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now
169. Assures me that the bitterness of death
170. Is past, and we shall live.  Whence hail to thee,
171. Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind,
172. Mother of all things living, since by thee
173. Man is to live; and all things live for Man.
174. To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
175. Ill-worthy I such title should belong
176. To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained
177. A help, became thy snare; to me reproach
178. Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise:
179. But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
180. That I, who first brought death on all, am graced
181. The source of life; next favourable thou,
182. Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st,
183. Far other name deserving.  But the field
184. To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed,
185. Though after sleepless night; for see!the morn,
186. All unconcerned with our unrest, begins
187. Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth;
188. I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
189. Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined
190. Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
191. What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?
192. Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.
193. So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate
194. Subscribed not:  Nature first gave signs, impressed
195. On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed,
196. After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight
197. The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour,
198. Two birds of gayest plume before him drove;
199. Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,
200. First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,
201. Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind;
202. Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.
203. Adam observed, and with his eye the chase
204. Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.
205. O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh,
206. Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows
207. Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn
208. Us, haply too secure, of our discharge
209. From penalty, because from death released
210. Some days: how long, and what till then our life,
211. Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust,
212. And thither must return, and be no more?
213. Why else this double object in our sight
214. Of flight pursued in the air, and o'er the ground,
215. One way the self-same hour? why in the east
216. Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light
217. More orient in yon western cloud, that draws
218. O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,
219. And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
220. He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands
221. Down from a sky of jasper lighted now
222. In Paradise, and on a hill made halt;
223. A glorious apparition, had not doubt
224. And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye.
225. Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
226. Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw
227. The field pavilioned with his guardians bright;
228. Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared
229. In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,
230. Against the Syrian king, who to surprise
231. One man, assassin-like, had levied war,
232. War unproclaimed.  The princely Hierarch
233. In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise
234. Possession of the garden; he alone,
235. To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,
236. Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve,
237. While the great visitant approached, thus spake.
238. Eve$ now expect great tidings, which perhaps
239. Of us will soon determine, or impose
240. New laws to be observed; for I descry,
241. From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,
242. One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait,
243. None of the meanest; some great Potentate
244. Or of the Thrones above; such majesty
245. Invests him coming! yet not terrible,
246. That I should fear; nor sociably mild,
247. As Raphael, that I should much confide;
248. But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend,
249. With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
250. He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
251. Not in his shape celestial, but as man
252. Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms
253. A military vest of purple flowed,
254. Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain
255. Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old
256. In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof;
257. His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
258. In manhood where youth ended; by his side,
259. As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,
260. Satan's dire dread; and in his hand the spear.
261. Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state
262. Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.
263. Adam, Heaven's high behest no preface needs:
264. Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death,
265. Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
266. Defeated of his seisure many days
267. Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent,
268. And one bad act with many deeds well done
269. Mayest cover:  Well may then thy Lord, appeased,
270. Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim;
271. But longer in this Paradise to dwell
272. Permits not: to remove thee I am come,
273. And send thee from the garden forth to till
274. The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.
275. He added not; for Adam at the news
276. Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
277. That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen
278. Yet all had heard, with audible lament
279. Discovered soon the place of her retire.
280. O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!
281. Must I thus leave thee$ Paradise? thus leave
282. Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades,
283. Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
284. Quiet though sad, the respite of that day
285. That must be mortal to us both.  O flowers,
286. That never will in other climate grow,
287. My early visitation, and my last
288. ;t even, which I bred up with tender hand
289. From the first opening bud, and gave ye names!
290. Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank
291. Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?
292. Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned
293. With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee
294. How shall I part, and whither wander down
295. Into a lower world; to this obscure
296. And wild? how shall we breathe in other air
297. Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?
298. Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.
299. Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign
300. What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart,
301. Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine:
302. Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes
303. Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound;
304. Where he abides, think there thy native soil.
305. Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp
306. Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,
307. To Michael thus his humble words addressed.
308. Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named
309. Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem
310. Prince above princes! gently hast thou told
311. Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
312. And in performing end us; what besides
313. Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair,
314. Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring,
315. Departure from this happy place, our sweet
316. Recess, and only consolation left
317. Familiar to our eyes! all places else
318. Inhospitable appear, and desolate;
319. Nor knowing us, nor known:  And, if by prayer
320. Incessant I could hope to change the will
321. Of Him who all things can, I would not cease
322. To weary him with my assiduous cries:
323. But prayer against his absolute decree
324. No more avails than breath against the wind,
325. Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:
326. Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
327. This most afflicts me, that, departing hence,
328. As from his face I shall be hid, deprived
329. His blessed countenance:  Here I could frequent
330. With worship place by place where he vouchsafed
331. Presence Divine; and to my sons relate,
332. 'On this mount he appeared; under this tree
333. 'Stood visible; among these pines his voice
334. 'I heard; here with him at this fountain talked:
335. So many grateful altars I would rear
336. Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone
337. Of lustre from the brook, in memory,
338. Or monument to ages; and theron
339. Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers:
340. In yonder nether world where shall I seek
341. His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?
342. For though I fled him angry, yet recalled
343. To life prolonged and promised race, I now
344. Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
345. Of glory; and far off his steps adore.
346. To whom thus Michael with regard benign.
347. Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth;
348. Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills
349. Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives,
350. Fomented by his virtual power and warmed:
351. All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
352. No despicable gift; surmise not then
353. His presence to these narrow bounds confined
354. Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been
355. Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread
356. All generations; and had hither come
357. From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate
358. And reverence thee, their great progenitor.
359. But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down
360. To dwell on even ground now with thy sons:
361. Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain,
362. God is, as here; and will be found alike
363. Present; and of his presence many a sign
364. Still following thee, still compassing thee round
365. With goodness and paternal love, his face
366. Express, and of his steps the track divine.
367. Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed
368. Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent
369. To show thee what shall come in future days
370. To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad
371. Expect to hear; supernal grace contending
372. With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn
373. True patience, and to temper joy with fear
374. And pious sorrow; equally inured
375. By moderation either state to bear,
376. Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
377. Safest thy life, and best prepared endure
378. Thy mortal passage when it comes.--Ascend
379. This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)
380. Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest;
381. As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.
382. To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.
383. Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
384. Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit,
385. However chastening; to the evil turn
386. My obvious breast; arming to overcome
387. By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,
388. If so I may attain. -- So both ascend
389. In the visions of God.  It was a hill,
390. Of Paradise the highest; from whose top
391. The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken,
392. Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.
393. Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round,
394. Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set
395. Our second Adam, in the wilderness;
396. To show him all Earth's kingdoms, and their glory.
397. His eye might there command wherever stood
398. City of old or modern fame, the seat
399. Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls
400. Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can,
401. And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne,
402. To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence
403. To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul,
404. Down to the golden Chersonese; or where
405. The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since
406. In Hispahan; or where the Russian Ksar
407. In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance,
408. Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken
409. The empire of Negus to his utmost port
410. Ercoco, and the less maritim kings
411. Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,
412. And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm
413. Of Congo, and Angola farthest south;
414. Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount
415. The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,
416. Morocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen;
417. On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway
418. The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw
419. Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume,
420. And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat
421. Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled
422. Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons
423. Call El Dorado.  But to nobler sights
424. Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed,
425. Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
426. Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue
427. The visual nerve, for he had much to see;
428. And from the well of life three drops instilled.
429. So deep the power of these ingredients pierced,
430. Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,
431. That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,
432. Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced;
433. But him the gentle Angel by the hand
434. Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.
435. Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold
436. The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought
437. In some to spring from thee; who never touched
438. The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired;
439. Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive
440. Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.
441. His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,
442. Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves
443. New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds;
444. I' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood,
445. Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon
446. A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
447. First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf,
448. Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next,
449. More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock,
450. Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid
451. The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed,
452. On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed:
453. His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven
454. Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;
455. The other's not, for his was not sincere;
456. Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked,
457. Smote him into the midriff with a stone
458. That beat out life; he fell;and, deadly pale,
459. Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.
460. Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
461. Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.
462. O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen
463. To that meek man, who well had sacrificed;
464. Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?
465. To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.
466. These two are brethren, Adam, and to come
467. Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain,
468. For envy that his brother's offering found
469. From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact
470. Will be avenged; and the other's faith, approved,
471. Lose no reward; though here thou see him die,
472. Rolling in dust and gore.  To which our sire.
473. Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!
474. But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way
475. I must return to native dust?  O sight
476. Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
477. Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!
478. To whom thus Michael.  Death thou hast seen
479. In his first shape on Man; but many shapes
480. Of Death, and many are the ways that lead
481. To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense
482. More terrible at the entrance, than within.
483. Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die;
484. By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more
485. In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring
486. Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
487. Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know
488. What misery the inabstinence of Eve
489. Shall bring on Men.  Immediately a place
490. Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;
491. A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid
492. Numbers of all diseased; all maladies
493. Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms
494. Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,
495. Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,
496. Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs,
497. Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy,
498. And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,
499. Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,
500. Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.
501. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair
502. Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch;
503. And over them triumphant Death his dart
504. Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked
505. With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.
506. Sight so deform what heart of rock could long
507. Dry-eyed behold?  Adam could not, but wept,
508. Though not of woman born; compassion quelled
509. His best of man, and gave him up to tears
510. A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess;
511. And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.
512. O miserable mankind, to what fall
513. Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!
514. Better end here unborn.  Why is life given
515. To be thus wrested from us? rather, why
516. Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew
517. What we receive, would either no accept
518. Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down;
519. Glad to be so dismissed in peace.  Can thus
520. The image of God in Man, created once
521. So goodly and erect, though faulty since,
522. To such unsightly sufferings be debased
523. Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,
524. Retaining still divine similitude
525. In part, from such deformities be free,
526. And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt?
527. Their Maker's image, answered Michael, then
528. Forsook them, when themselves they vilified
529. To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took
530. His image whom they served, a brutish vice,
531. Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
532. Therefore so abject is their punishment,
533. Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own;
534. Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced;
535. While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules
536. To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they
537. God's image did not reverence in themselves.
538. I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.
539. But is there yet no other way, besides
540. These painful passages, how we may come
541. To death, and mix with our connatural dust?
542. There is, said Michael, if thou well observe
543. The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught,
544. In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence
545. Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
546. Till many years over thy head return:
547. So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop
548. Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease
549. Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature:
550. This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive
551. Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change
552. To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then,
553. Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego,
554. To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,
555. Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign
556. A melancholy damp of cold and dry
557. To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume
558. The balm of life.  To whom our ancestor.
559. Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong
560. Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit,
561. Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge;
562. Which I must keep till my appointed day
563. Of rendering up, and patiently attend
564. My dissolution.  Michael replied.
565. Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest
566. Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven:
567. And now prepare thee for another sight.
568. He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon
569. Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds
570. Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound
571. Of instruments, that made melodious chime,
572. Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved
573. Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch,
574. Instinct through all proportions, low and high,
575. Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.
576. In other part stood one who, at the forge
577. Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass
578. Had melted, (whether found where casual fire
579. Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale,
580. Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot
581. To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream
582. From underground;) the liquid ore he drained
583. Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed
584. First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought
585. Fusil or graven in metal.  After these,
586. But on the hither side, a different sort
587. From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat,
588. Down to the plain descended; by their guise
589. Just men they seemed, and all their study bent
590. To worship God aright, and know his works
591. Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve
592. Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain
593. Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!
594. A bevy of fair women, richly gay
595. In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung
596. Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on:
597. The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes
598. Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net
599. Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose;
600. And now of love they treat, till the evening-star,
601. Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat
602. They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke
603. Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:
604. With feast and musick all the tents resound.
605. Such happy interview, and fair event
606. Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,
607. And charming symphonies, attached the heart
608. Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,
609. The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.
610. True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest;
611. Much better seems this vision, and more hope
612. Of peaceful days portends, than those two past;
613. Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse;
614. Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.
615. To whom thus Michael.  Judge not what is best
616. By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet;
617. Created, as thou art, to nobler end
618. Holy and pure, conformity divine.
619. Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents
620. Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race
621. Who slew his brother; studious they appear
622. Of arts that polish life, inventers rare;
623. Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit
624. Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.
625. Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;
626. For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed
627. Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
628. Yet empty of all good wherein consists
629. Woman's domestick honour and chief praise;
630. Bred only and completed to the taste
631. Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,
632. To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye:
633. To these that sober race of men, whose lives
634. Religious titled them the sons of God,
635. Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame
636. Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles
637. Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy,
638. Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which
639. The world erelong a world of tears must weep.
640. To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.
641. O pity and shame, that they, who to live well
642. Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread
643. Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
644. But still I see the tenour of Man's woe
645. Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.
646. From Man's effeminate slackness it begins,
647. Said the Angel, who should better hold his place
648. By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.
649. But now prepare thee for another scene.
650. He looked, and saw wide territory spread
651. Before him, towns, and rural works between;
652. Cities of men with lofty gates and towers,
653. Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war,
654. Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise;
655. Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,
656. Single or in array of battle ranged
657. Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood;
658. One way a band select from forage drives
659. A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine,
660. From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock,
661. Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,
662. Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,
663. But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray;
664. With cruel tournament the squadrons join;
665. Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies
666. With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,
667. Deserted:  Others to a city strong
668. Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine,
669. Assaulting; others from the wall defend
670. With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire;
671. On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.
672. In other part the sceptered heralds call
673. To council, in the city-gates; anon
674. Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed,
675. Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon,
676. In factious opposition; till at last,
677. Of middle age one rising, eminent
678. In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,
679. Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,
680. And judgement from above: him old and young
681. Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,
682. Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
683. Unseen amid the throng: so violence
684. Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law,
685. Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.
686. Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
687. Lamenting turned full sad; O!what are these,
688. Death's ministers, not men? who thus deal death
689. Inhumanly to men, and multiply
690. Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
691. His brother: for of whom such massacre
692. Make they, but of their brethren; men of men
693. But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven
694. Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?
695. To whom thus Michael.  These are the product
696. Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest;
697. Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves
698. Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed,
699. Produce prodigious births of body or mind.
700. Such were these giants, men of high renown;
701. For in those days might only shall be admired,
702. And valour and heroick virtue called;
703. To overcome in battle, and subdue
704. Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
705. Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
706. Of human glory; and for glory done
707. Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours
708. Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods;
709. Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.
710. Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth;
711. And what most merits fame, in silence hid.
712. But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
713. The only righteous in a world preverse,
714. And therefore hated, therefore so beset
715. With foes, for daring single to be just,
716. And utter odious truth, that God would come
717. To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High
718. Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
719. Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God
720. High in salvation and the climes of bliss,
721. Exempt from death; to show thee what reward
722. Awaits the good; the rest what punishment;
723. Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.
724. He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed;
725. The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar;
726. All now was turned to jollity and game,
727. To luxury and riot, feast and dance;
728. Marrying or prostituting, as befel,
729. Rape or adultery, where passing fair
730. Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.
731. At length a reverend sire among them came,
732. And of their doings great dislike declared,
733. And testified against their ways; he oft
734. Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,
735. Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached
736. Conversion and repentance, as to souls
737. In prison, under judgements imminent:
738. But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased
739. Contending, and removed his tents far off;
740. Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,
741. Began to build a vessel of huge bulk;
742. Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth;
743. Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door
744. Contrived; and of provisions laid in large,
745. For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!
746. Of every beast, and bird, and insect small,
747. Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught
748. Their order: last the sire and his three sons,
749. With their four wives; and God made fast the door.
750. Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings
751. Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove
752. From under Heaven; the hills to their supply
753. Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist,
754. Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky
755. Like a dark cieling stood; down rushed the rain
756. Impetuous; and continued, till the earth
757. No more was seen: the floating vessel swum
758. Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow
759. Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else
760. Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp
761. Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea,
762. Sea without shore; and in their palaces,
763. Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped
764. And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late,
765. All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.
766. How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
767. The end of all thy offspring, end so sad,
768. Depopulation!  Thee another flood,
769. Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned,
770. And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared
771. By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last,
772. Though comfortless; as when a father mourns
773. His children, all in view destroyed at once;
774. And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint.
775. O visions ill foreseen!  Better had I
776. Lived ignorant of future! so had borne
777. My part of evil only, each day's lot
778. Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed
779. The burden of many ages, on me light
780. At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth
781. Abortive, to torment me ere their being,
782. With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek
783. Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall
784. Him or his children; evil he may be sure,
785. Which neither his foreknowing can prevent;
786. And he the future evil shall no less
787. In apprehension than in substance feel,
788. Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
789. Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped
790. Famine and anguish will at last consume,
791. Wandering that watery desart:  I had hope,
792. When violence was ceased, and war on earth,
793. All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned
794. With length of happy days the race of Man;
795. But I was far deceived; for now I see
796. Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.
797. How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide,
798. And whether here the race of Man will end.
799. To whom thus Michael.  Those, whom last thou sawest
800. In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
801. First seen in acts of prowess eminent
802. And great exploits, but of true virtue void;
803. Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast
804. Subduing nations, and achieved thereby
805. Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey;
806. Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
807. Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride
808. Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.
809. The conquered also, and enslaved by war,
810. Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose
811. And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned
812. In sharp contest of battle found no aid
813. Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal,
814. Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
815. Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords
816. Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear
817. More than enough, that temperance may be tried:
818. So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved;
819. Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot;
820. One man except, the only son of light
821. In a dark age, against example good,
822. Against allurement, custom, and a world
823. Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn,
824. The grand-child, with twelve sons encreased, departs
825. From Canaan, to a land hereafter called
826. Egypt, divided by the river Nile;
827. See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths
828. Into the sea:  To sojourn in that land
829. He comes, invited by a younger son
830. In time of dearth; a son, whose worthy deeds
831. Raise him to be the second in that realm
832. Of Pharaoh:  There he dies, and leaves his race
833. Growing into a nation, and now grown
834. Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks
835. To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests
836. Or violence, he of their wicked ways
837. Shall them admonish; and before them set
838. The paths of righteousness, how much more safe
839. And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come
840. On their impenitence; and shall return
841. Of them derided, but of God observed
842. The one just man alive; by his command
843. Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst,
844. To save himself, and houshold, from amidst
845. A world devote to universal wrack.
846. No sooner he, with them of man and beast
847. Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged,
848. And sheltered round; but all the cataracts
849. Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour
850. Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep,
851. Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp
852. Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise
853. Above the highest hills:  Then shall this mount
854. Of Paradise by might of waves be moved
855. Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,
856. With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift,
857. Down the great river to the opening gulf,
858. And there take root an island salt and bare,
859. The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews' clang:
860. To teach thee that God attributes to place
861. No sanctity, if none be thither brought
862. By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
863. And now, what further shall ensue, behold.
864. He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood,
865. Which now abated; for the clouds were fled,
866. Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry,
867. Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed;
868. And the clear sun on his wide watery glass
869. Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,
870. As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink
871. From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole
872. With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt
873. His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.
874. The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground,
875. Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.
876. And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear;
877. With clamour thence the rapid currents drive,
878. Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.
879. Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies,
880. And after him, the surer messenger,
881. A dove sent forth once and again to spy
882. Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light:
883. The second time returning, in his bill
884. An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign:
885. Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark
886. The ancient sire descends, with all his train;
887. Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
888. Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds
889. A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow
890. Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,
891. Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.
892. Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,
893. Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.
894. O thou, who future things canst represent
895. As present, heavenly Instructer!  I revive
896. At this last sight; assured that Man shall live,
897. With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.
898. Far less I now lament for one whole world
899. Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice
900. For one man found so perfect, and so just,
901. That God vouchsafes to raise another world
902. From him, and all his anger to forget.
903. But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven
904. Distended, as the brow of God appeased?
905. Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind
906. The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud,
907. Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?
908. To whom the Arch-Angel.  Dextrously thou aimest;
909. So willingly doth God remit his ire,
910. Though late repenting him of Man depraved;
911. Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw
912. The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh
913. Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed,
914. Such grace shall one just man find in his sight,
915. That he relents, not to blot out mankind;
916. And makes a covenant never to destroy
917. The earth again by flood; nor let the sea
918. Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world,
919. With man therein or beast; but, when he brings
920. Over the earth a cloud, will therein set
921. His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look,
922. And call to mind his covenant: Day and night,
923. Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost,
924. Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new,
925. Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
