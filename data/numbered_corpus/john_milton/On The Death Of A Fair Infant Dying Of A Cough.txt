1. I

2. O fairest flower no sooner blown but blasted,
3. Soft silken Primrose fading timelesslie,
4. Summers chief honour if thou hadst outlasted
5. Bleak winters force that made thy blossome drie;
6. For he being amorous on that lovely die
7. That did thy cheek envermeil, thought to kiss
8. But kill'd alas, and then bewayl'd his fatal bliss.

9. II

10. For since grim Aquilo his charioter
11. By boistrous rape th' Athenian damsel got,
12. He thought it toucht his Deitie full neer,
13. If likewise he some fair one wedded not,
14. Thereby to wipe away th' infamous blot,
15. Of long-uncoupled bed, and childless eld,
16. Which 'mongst the wanton gods a foul reproach was held.

17. III

18. So mounting up in ycie-pearled carr,
19. Through middle empire of the freezing aire
20. He wanderd long, till thee he spy'd from farr,
21. There ended was his quest, there ceast his care
22. Down he descended from his Snow-soft chaire,
23. But all unwares with his cold-kind embrace
24. Unhous'd thy Virgin Soul from her fair hiding place.

25. IV

26. Yet art thou not inglorious in thy fate;
27. For so Apollo, with unweeting hand
28. Whilome did slay his dearly-loved mate
29. Young Hyacinth born on Eurotas' strand,
30. Young Hyacinth the pride of Spartan land;
31. But then transform'd him to a purple flower
32. Alack that so to change thee winter had no power.

33. V

34. Yet can I not perswade me thou art dead
35. Or that thy coarse corrupts in earths dark wombe,
36. Or that thy beauties lie in wormie bed,
37. Hid from the world in a low delved tombe;
38. Could Heav'n for pittie thee so strictly doom?
39. O no! for something in thy face did shine
40. Above mortalitie that shew'd thou wast divine.

41. VI

42. Resolve me then oh Soul most surely blest
43. (If so it be that thou these plaints dost hear)
44. Tell me bright Spirit where e're thou hoverest
45. Whether above that high first-moving Spheare
46. Or in the Elisian fields (if such there were.)
47. Oh say me true if thou wert mortal wight
48. And why from us so quickly thou didst take thy flight.

49. VII

50. Wert thou some Starr which from the ruin'd roofe
51. Of shak't Olympus by mischance didst fall;
52. Which carefull Jove in natures true behoofe
53. Took up, and in fit place did reinstall?
54. Or did of late earths Sonnes besiege the wall
55. Of sheenie Heav'n, and thou some goddess fled
56. Amongst us here below to hide thy nectar'd head

57. VIII

58. Or wert thou that just Maid who once before
59. Forsook the hated earth, O tell me sooth
60. And cam'st again to visit us once more?
61. Or wert thou that sweet smiling Youth!
62. Or that c[r]own'd Matron sage white-robed Truth?
63. Or any other of that heav'nly brood
64. Let down in clowdie throne to do the world some good.

65. Note: 53 Or wert thou] Or wert thou Mercy -- conjectured by
66. John Heskin Ch. Ch. Oxon. from Ode on Nativity, st. 15.

67. IX

68. Or wert thou of the golden-winged boast,
69. Who having clad thy self in humane weed,
70. To earth from thy praefixed seat didst poast,
71. And after short abode flie back with speed,
72. As if to shew what creatures Heav'n doth breed,
73. Thereby to set the hearts of men on fire
74. To scorn the sordid world, and unto Heav'n aspire.

75. X

76. But oh why didst thou not stay here below
77. To bless us with thy heav'n-lov'd innocence,
78. To slake his wrath whom sin hath made our foe
79. To turn Swift-rushing black perdition hence,
80. Or drive away the slaughtering  pestilence,
81. To stand 'twixt us and our deserved smart
82. But thou canst best perform that office where thou art.

83. XI

84. Then thou the mother of so sweet a child
85. Her false imagin'd loss cease to lament,
86. And wisely learn to curb thy sorrows wild;
87. Think what a present thou to God hast sent,
88. And render him with patience what he lent;
89. This if thou do he will an off-spring give,
90. That till the worlds last-end shall make thy name to live.
