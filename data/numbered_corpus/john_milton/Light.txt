1. HAIL holy light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born,
2. Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam
3. May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light,
4. And never but in unapproached light
5. Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,
6. Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
7. Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,
8. Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,
9. Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice
10. Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest
11. The rising world of waters dark and deep,
12. Won from the void and formless infinite.
13. Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,
14. Escap't the Stygian Pool, though long detain'd
15. In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
16. Through utter and through middle darkness borne
17. With other notes then to th' Orphean Lyre
18. I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night,
19. Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down
20. The dark descent, and up to reascend,
21. Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,
22. And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou
23. Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain
24. To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
25. So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,
26. Or dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more
27. Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
28. Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,
29. Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
30. Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath
31. That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,
32. Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget
33. Those other two equal'd with me in Fate,
34. So were I equal'd with them in renown.
35. Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides,
36. And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old.
37. Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move
38. Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird
39. Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid
40. Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year
41. Seasons return, but not to me returns
42. Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn,
43. Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,
44. Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
45. But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark
46. Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men
47. Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair
48. Presented with a Universal blanc
49. Of Natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd,
50. And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.
51. So much the rather thou Celestial light
52. Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
53. Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence
54. Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
55. Of things invisible to mortal sight.
