1. HENCE, vain deluding Joys,
2. ............The brood of Folly without father bred!
3. How little you bested
4. ............Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys!
5. Dwell in some idle brain,
6. ............And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,
7. As thick and numberless
8. ............As the gay motes that people the sun-beams,
9. Or likest hovering dreams,
10. ............The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train.
11. But, hail! thou Goddess sage and holy!
12. Hail, divinest Melancholy!
13. Whose saintly visage is too bright
14. To hit the sense of human sight,
15. And therefore to our weaker view
16. O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue;
17. Black, but such as in esteem
18. Prince Memnon's sister might beseem,
19. Or that starred Ethiop queen that strove
20. To set her beauty's praise above
21. The Sea-Nymphs, and their powers offended.
22. Yet thou art higher far descended:
23. Thee bright-haired Vesta long of yore
24. To solitary Saturn bore;
25. His daughter she; in Saturn's reign
26. Such mixture was not held a stain.
27. Oft in glimmering bowers and glades
28. He met her, and in secret shades
29. Of woody Ida's inmost grove,
30. Whilst yet there was no fear of Jove.
31. Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,
32. Sober, steadfast, and demure,
33. All in a robe of darkest grain,
34. Flowing with majestic train,
35. And sable stole of cypress lawn
36. Over thy decent shoulders drawn.
37. Come; but keep thy wonted state,
38. With even step, and musing gait,
39. And looks commercing with the skies,
40. Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:
41. There, held in holy passion still,
42. Forget thyself to marble, till
43. With a sad leaden downward cast
44. Thou fix them on the earth as fast.
45. And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet,
46. Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,
47. And hears the Muses in a ring
48. Aye round about Jove's altar sing;
49. And add to these retired Leisure,
50. That in trim gardens takes his pleasure;
51. But, first and chiefest, with thee bring
52. Him that yon soars on golden wing,
53. Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,
54. The Cherub Contemplation;
55. And the mute Silence hist along,
56. 'Less Philomel will deign a song,
57. In her sweetest saddest plight,
58. Smoothing the rugged brow of Night,
59. While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke
60. Gently o'er the accustomed oak.
61. Sweet bird, that shunn'st the noise of folly,
62. Most musical, most melancholy!
63. Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among
64. I woo, to hear thy even-song;
65. And, missing thee,I walk unseen
66. On the dry smooth-shaven green,
67. To behold the wandering moon,
68. Riding near her highest noon,
69. Like one that had been led astray
70. Through the heaven's wide pathless way,
71. And oft, as if her head she bowed,
72. Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
73. Oft, on a plat of rising ground,
74. I hear the far-off curfew sound,
75. Over some wide-watered shore,
76. Swinging slow with sullen roar;
77. Or, if the air will not permit,
78. Some still removed place will fit,
79. Where glowing embers through the room
80. Teach light to counterfeit a gloom,
81. Far from all resort of mirth,
82. Save the cricket on the hearth,
83. Or the bellman's drowsy charm
84. To bless the doors from nightly harm.
85. Or let my lamp, at midnight hour,
86. Be seen in some high lonely tower,
87. Where I may oft outwatch the Bear,
88. With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere
89. The spirit of Plato, to unfold
90. What worlds or what vast regions hold
91. The immortal mind that hath forsook
92. Her mansion in this fleshly nook;
93. And of those demons that are found
94. In fire, air, flood, or underground,
95. Whose power hath a true consent
96. With planet or with element.
97. Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy
98. In sceptred pall come sweeping by,
99. Presenting Thebes, or Pelops' line,
100. Or the tale of Troy divine,
101. Or what (though rare) of later age
102. Ennobled hath the buskined stage.
103. But, O sad Virgin! that thy power
104. Might raise Musaeus from his bower;
105. Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
106. Such notes as, warbled to the string,
107. Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,
108. And made Hell grant what love did seek;
109. Or call up him that left half-told
110. The story of Cambuscan bold,
111. Of Camball, and of Algarsife,
112. And who had Canace to wife,
113. That owned the virtuous ring and glass,
114. And of the wondrous horse of brass
115. On which the Tartar king did ride;
116. And if aught else great bards beside
117. In sage and solemn tunes have sung,
118. Of turneys, and of trophies hung,
119. Of forests, and enchantments drear,
120. Where more is meant than meets the ear.
121. Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career,
122. Till civil-suited Morn appear,
123. Not tricked and frounced, as she was wont
124. With the Attic boy to hunt,
125. But kerchieft in a comely cloud
126. While rocking winds are piping loud,
127. Or ushered with a shower still,
128. When the gust hath blown his fill,
129. Ending on the rustling leaves,
130. With minute-drops from off the eaves.
131. And, when the sun begins to fling
132. His flaring beams, me, Goddess, bring
133. To arched walks of twilight groves,
134. And shadows brown, that Sylvan loves,
135. Of pine, or monumental oak,
136. Where the rude axe with heaved stroke
137. Was never heard the nymphs to daunt,
138. Or fright them from their hallowed haunt.
139. There, in close covert, by some brook,
140. Where no profaner eye may look,
141. Hide me from day's garish eye,
142. While the bee with honeyed thigh,
143. That at her flowery work doth sing,
144. And the waters murmuring,
145. With such consort as they keep,
146. Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep.
147. And let some strange mysterious dream
148. Wave at his wings, in airy stream
149. Of lively portraiture displayed,
150. Softly on my eyelids laid;
151. And, as I wake, sweet music breathe
152. Above, about, or underneath,
153. Sent by some Spirit to mortals good,
154. Or the unseen Genius of the wood.
155. But let my due feet never fail
156. To walk the studious cloister's pale,
157. And love the high embowed roof,
158. With antique pillars massy proof,
159. And storied windows richly dight,
160. Casting a dim religious light.
161. There let the pealing organ blow,
162. To the full-voiced quire below,
163. In service high and anthems clear,
164. As may with sweetness, through mine ear,
165. Dissolve me into ecstasies,
166. And bring all Heaven before mine eyes.
167. And may at last my weary age
168. Find out the peaceful hermitage,
169. The hairy gown and mossy cell,
170. Where I may sit and rightly spell
171. Of every star that heaven doth shew,
172. And every herb that sips the dew,
173. Till old experience do attain
174. To something like prophetic strain.
175. These pleasures, Melancholy, give;
176. And I with thee will choose to live.
