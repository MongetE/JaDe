1. Fairfax, whose name in armes through Europe rings
2. Filling each mouth with envy, or with praise,
3. And all her jealous monarchs with amaze,
4. And rumors loud, that daunt remotest kings,
5. Thy firm unshak'n vertue ever brings
6. Victory home, though new rebellions raise
7. Their Hydra heads, & the fals North displaies
8. Her brok'n league, to impe their serpent wings,
9. O yet a nobler task awaites thy hand;
10. Yet what can Warr, but endless warr still breed,
11. Till Truth, & Right from Violence be freed,
12. And Public Faith cleard from the shamefull brand
13. Of Public Fraud.  In vain doth Valour bleed
14. While Avarice, & Rapine share the land.
