1. Ye flaming Powers, and wingèd Warriors bright,
2. That erst with music, and triumphant song,
3. First heard by happy watchful Shepherds’ ear,
4. So sweetly sung your joy the clouds along,
5. Through the soft silence of the listening night,—
6. Now mourn; and if sad share with us to bear
7. Your fiery essence can distill no tear,
8. Burn in your sighs, and borrow
9. Seas wept from our deep sorrow,
10. He who with all Heaven’s heraldry whilere
11. Entered the world, now bleeds to give us ease.
12. Alas! how soon our sin
13. Sore doth begin
14. His infancy to seize!
15. O more exceeding Love, or Law more just?
16. Just Law indeed, but more exceeding Love!
17. For we, by rightful doom remediless,
18. Were lost in death, till He, that dwelt above
19. High-throned in secret bliss, for us frail dust
20. Emptied his glory, even to nakedness;
21. And that great Covenant which we still transgress
22. Intirely satisfied,
23. And the full wrath beside
24. Of vengeful Justice bore for our excess,
25. And seals obedience first with wounding smart
26. This day; but oh! ere long,
27. Huge pangs and strong
28. Will pierce more near his heart.
