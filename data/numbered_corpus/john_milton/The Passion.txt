1. I

2. Erewhile of music, and ethereal mirth,
3. Wherewith the stage of Air and Earth did ring,
4. And joyous news of heavenly Infant’s birth,
5. My muse with Angels did divide to sing;
6. But headlong joy is ever on the wing,
7. In wintry solstice like the shortened light
8. Soon swallowed up in dark and long outliving night.

9. II

10. For now to sorrow must I tune my song,
11. And set my Harp to notes of saddest woe,
12. Which on our dearest Lord did seize ere long,
13. Dangers, and snares, and wrongs, and worse than so,
14. Which he for us did freely undergo:
15. Most perfect Hero, tried in heaviest plight
16. Of labours huge and hard, too hard for human wight!

17. III

18. He, sovran Priest, stooping his regal head,
19. That dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes,
20. Poor fleshly Tabernacle enterèd,
21. His starry front low-roofed beneath the skies:
22. Oh, what a mask was there, what a disguise!
23. Yet more: the stroke of death he must abide;
24. Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethren’s side.

25. IV

26. These latest scenes confine my roving verse;
27. To this horizon is my Phœbus bound.
28. His godlike acts, and his temptations fierce,
29. And former sufferings, otherwhere are found;
30. Loud o’er the rest Cremona’s trump doth sound:
31. Me softer airs befit, and softer strings
32. Of lute, or viol still, more apt for mournful things.

33. V

34. Befriend me, Night, best Patroness of grief!
35. Over the pole thy thickest mantle throw,
36. And work my flattered fancy to belief
37. That Heaven and Earth are coloured with my woe;
38. My sorrows are too dark for day to know:
39. The leaves should all be black whereon I write,
40. And letters, where my tears have washed, a wannish white.

41. VI

42. See, see the chariot, and those rushing wheels,
43. That whirled the prophet up at Chebar flood;
44. My spirit some transporting Cherub feels
45. To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood,
46. Once glorious towers, now sunk in guiltless blood.
47. There doth my soul in holy vision sit,
48. In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatic fit.

49. VII

50. Mine eye hath found that sad sepulchral rock
51. That was the casket of Heaven’s richest store,
52. And here, though grief my feeble hands up-lock,
53. Yet on the softened quarry would I score
54. My plaining verse as lively as before;
55. For sure so well instructed are my tears
56. That they would fitly fall in ordered characters.

57. VIII

58. Or, should I thence, hurried on viewless wing,
59. Take up a weeping on the mountains wild,
60. The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring
61. Would soon unbosom all their Echoes mild;
62. And I (for grief is easily beguiled)
63. Might think the infection of my sorrows loud
64. Had got a race of mourners on some pregnant cloud.

65. This Subject the Author finding to be above the years he had when he wrote it, and nothing satisfied with what was begun, left it unfinished.
