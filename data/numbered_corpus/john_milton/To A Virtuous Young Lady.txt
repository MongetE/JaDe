1. Lady! that in the prime of earliest youth
2. Wisely hast shunned the broad way and the green,
3. And with those few art eminently seen,
4. That labour up the Hill of Heavenly Truth,
5. The better part with Mary and with Ruth
6. Chosen thou hast, and they that overween,
7. And at thy growing virtues fret their spleen,
8. No anger find in thee, but pity and ruth.
9. Thy care is fixed, and zealously attends
10. To fill thy odorous Lamp with deeds of light.
11. And Hope that reaps not shame; therefore be sure,
12. Thou, when the Bridegroom with his feastful friends
13. Passes to bliss at the mid hour of night,
14. Hast gained thy entrance, Virgin wise and pure.
