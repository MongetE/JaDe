1. How lovely are thy dwellings fair!
2. O Lord of Hoasts, how dear
3. The pleasant Tabernacles are!
4. Where thou do'st dwell so near.
5. My Soul doth long and almost die
6. Thy Courts O Lord to see,
7. My heart and flesh aloud do crie,
8. O living God, for thee.
9. There ev'n the Sparrow freed from wrong
10. Hath found a house of rest,
11. The Swallow there, to lay her young
12. Hath built her brooding nest,
13. Ev'n by thy Altars Lord of Hoasts
14. They find their safe abode,
15. And home they fly from round the Coasts
16. Toward thee, My King, my God
17. Happy, who in thy house reside
18. Where thee they ever praise,
19. Happy, whose strength in thee doth bide,
20. And in their hearts thy waies.
21. They pass through Baca's thirstie Vale,
22. That dry and barren ground
23. As through a fruitfull watry Dale
24. Where Springs and Showrs abound.
25. They journey on from strength to strength
26. With joy and gladsom cheer
27. Till all before our God at length
28. In Sion do appear.
29. Lord God of Hoasts hear now my praier
30. O Jacobs God give ear,
31. Thou God our shield look on the face
32. Of thy anointed dear.
33. For one day in thy Courts to be
34. Is better, and mere blest
35. Then in the joyes of Vanity,
36. A thousand daies at best.
37. I in the temple of my God
38. Had rather keep a dore,
39. Then dwell in Tents, and rich abode
40. With Sin for evermore
41. For God the Lord both Sun and Shield
42. Gives grace and glory bright,
43. No good from him shall be with-held
44. Whose waies are just and right.
45. Lord God of Hoasts that raign 'st on high,
46. That man is truly blest
47. Who only on thee doth relie.
48. And in thee only rest.
