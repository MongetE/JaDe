1. Be not thou silent now at length
2. O God hold not thy peace,
3. Sit not thou still O God of strength
4. We cry and do not cease.
5. For lo thy furious foes now *swell
6. And *storm outrageously,                                *Jehemajun.
7. And they that hate thee proud and fill
8. Exalt their heads full hie.
9. Against thy people they *contrive                       *Jagnarimu.
10. *Their Plots and Counsels deep,                             *Sod.
11. *Them to ensnare they chiefly strive             *Jithjagnatsu gnal.
12. *Whom thou dost hide and keep.                          *Tsephuneca.
13. Come let us cut them off say they,
14. Till they no Nation be
15. That Israels name for ever may
16. Be lost in memory.
17. For they consult *with all their might,               *Lev jachdau.
18. And all as one in mind
19. Themselves against thee they unite
20. And in firm union bind.
21. The tents of Edom, and the brood
22. Of scornful Ishmael,
23. Moab, with them of Hagars blood
24. That in the Desart dwell,
25. Gebal and Ammon there conspire,
26. And hateful Amalec,
27. The Philistims, and they of Tyre
28. Whose bounds the sea doth check.
29. With them great Asshur also bands
30. And doth confirm the knot,
31. All these have lent their armed hands
32. To aid the Sons of Lot.
33. Do to them as to Midian bold
34. That wasted all the Coast.
35. To Sisera, and as is told
36. Thou didst to Jabins hoast,
37. When at the brook of Kishon old
38. They were repulst and slain,
39. At Endor quite cut off, and rowl'd
40. As dung upon the plain.
41. As Zeb and Oreb evil sped
42. So let their Princes speed
43. As Zeba, and Zalmunna bled
44. So let their Princes bleed.
45. For they amidst their pride have said
46. By right now shall we seize
47. Gods houses, and will now invade
48. *Their stately Palaces.                    *Neoth Elohim bears both.
49. My God, oh make them as a wheel
50. No quiet let them find,
51. Giddy and restless let them reel
52. Like stubble from the wind.
53. As when an aged wood takes fire
54. Which on a sudden straies,
55. The greedy flame runs hier and hier
56. Till all the mountains blaze,
57. So with thy whirlwind them pursue,
58. And with thy tempest chase;
59. *And till they *yield thee honour due,                *They seek thy
60. Lord fill with shame their face.                         Name. Heb.
61. Asham'd and troubl'd let them be,
62. Troubl'd and sham'd for ever,
63. Ever confounded, and so die
64. With shame, and scape it never.
65. Then shall they know that thou whose name
66. Jehova is alone,
67. Art the most high, and thou the same
68. O're all the earth art one.
