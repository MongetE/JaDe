1. OH how comely it is and how reviving
2. To the Spirits of just men long opprest!
3. When God into the hands of thir deliverer
4. Puts invincible might
5. To quell the mighty of the Earth, th' oppressour,
6. The brute and boist'rous force of violent men
7. Hardy and industrious to support
8. Tyrannic power, but raging to pursue
9. The righteous and all such as honour Truth;
10. He all thir Ammunition
11. And feats of War defeats
12. With plain Heroic magnitude of mind
13. And celestial vigour arm'd,
14. Thir Armories and Magazins contemns,
15. Renders them useless, while
16. With winged expedition
17. Swift as the lightning glance he executes
18. His errand on the wicked, who surpris'd
19. Lose thir defence distracted and amaz'd.

20. ALL is best, though we oft doubt,
21. What th' unsearchable dispose
22. Of highest wisdom brings about,
23. And ever best found in the close.
24. Oft he seems to hide his face,
25. But unexpectedly returns
26. And to his faithful Champion hath in place
27. Bore witness gloriously; whence Gaza mourns
28. And all that band them to resist
29. His uncontroulable intent.
30. His servants he with new acquist
31. Of true experience from this great event
32. With peace and consolation hath dismist,
33. And calm of mind all passion spent.

34. O FOR some honest lover's ghost,
35. Some kind unbodied post
36. Sent from the shades below!
37. I strangely long to know
38. Whether the noble chaplets wear
39. Those that their mistress' scorn did bear
40. Or those that were used kindly.

41. For whatsoe'er they tell us here
42. To make those sufferings dear,
43. 'Twill there, I fear, be found
44. That to the being crown'd
45. T' have loved alone will not suffice,
46. Unless we also have been wise
47. And have our loves enjoy'd.

48. What posture can we think him in
49. That, here unloved, again
50. Departs, and 's thither gone
51. Where each sits by his own?
52. Or how can that Elysium be
53. Where I my mistress still must see
54. Circled in other's arms?

55. For there the judges all are just,
56. And Sophonisba must
57. Be his whom she held dear,
58. Not his who loved her here.
59. The sweet Philoclea, since she died,
60. Lies by her Pirocles his side,
61. Not by Amphialus.

62. Some bays, perchance, or myrtle bough
63. For difference crowns the brow
64. Of those kind souls that were
65. The noble martyrs here:
66. And if that be the only odds
67. (As who can tell?), ye kinder gods,
68. Give me the woman here!
