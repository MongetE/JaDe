1. Thou Shepherd that dost Israel keep
2. Give ear in time of need,
3. Who leadest like a flock of sheep
4. Thy loved Josephs seed,
5. That sitt'st between the Cherubs bright
6. Between their wings out-spread
7. Shine forth, and from thy cloud give light,
8. And on our foes thy dread.
9. In Ephraims view and Benjamins,
10. And in Manasse's sight
11. Awake* thy strength, come, and be seen                    *Gnorera.
12. To save us by thy might.
13. Turn us again, thy grace divine
14. To us O God vouchsafe;
15. Cause thou thy face on us to shine
16. And then we shall be safe.Lord God of Hosts, how long wilt thou,
17. How long wilt thou declare
18. Thy *smoaking wrath, and angry brow                     *Gnashanta.
19. Against thy peoples praire.
20. Thou feed'st them with the bread of tears,
21. Their bread with tears they eat,
22. And mak'st them* largely drink the tears                  *Shalish.
23. Wherewith their cheeks are wet.
24. A strife thou mak'st us and a prey
25. To every neighbour foe,
26. Among themselves they *laugh, they *play,                *Jilgnagu.
27. And *flouts at us they throw.
28. Return us, and thy grace divine,
29. O God of Hosts vouchsafe
30. Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
31. And then we shall be safe.A Vine from Aegypt thou hast brought,
32. Thy free love made it thine,
33. And drov'st out Nations proud and haut
34. To plant this lovely Vine.
35. Thou did'st prepare for it a place
36. And root it deep and fast
37. That it began to grow apace,
38. And fill'd the land at last.
39. With her green shade that cover'd all,
40. The Hills were over-spread
41. Her Bows as high as Cedars tall
42. Advanc'd their lofty head.
43. Her branches on the western side
44. Down to the Sea she sent,
45. And upward to that river wide
46. Her other branches went.
47. Why hast thou laid her Hedges low
48. And brok'n down her Fence,
49. That all may pluck her, as they go,
50. With rudest violence?
51. The tusked Boar out of the wood
52. Up turns it by the roots,
53. Wild Beasts there brouze, and make their food
54. Her Grapes and tender Shoots.
55. Return now, God of Hosts, look down
56. From Heav'n, thy Seat divine,
57. Behold us, but without a frown,
58. And visit this thy Vine.
59. Visit this Vine, which thy right hand
60. Hath set, and planted long,
61. And the young branch, that for thy self
62. Thou hast made firm and strong.
63. But now it is consum'd with fire,
64. And cut with Axes down,
65. They perish at thy dreadfull ire,
66. At thy rebuke and frown.
67. Upon the man of thy right hand
68. Let thy good hand be laid,
69. Upon the Son of Man, whom thou
70. Strong for thyself hast made.
71. So shall we not go back from thee
72. To wayes of sin and shame,
73. Quick'n us thou, then gladly wee
74. Shall call upon thy Name.
75. Return us, and thy grace divine
76. Lord God of Hosts voutsafe,
77. Cause thou thy face on us to shine,
78. And then we shall be safe.
