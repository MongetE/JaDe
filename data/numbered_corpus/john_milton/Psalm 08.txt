1. Aug. 14. 1653.


2. O Jehovah our Lord how wondrous great
3. And glorious is thy name through all the earth?
4. So as above the Heavens thy praise to set
5. Out of the tender mouths of latest bearth,

6. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou
7. Hast founded strength because of all thy foes
8. To stint th'enemy, and slack th'avengers brow
9. That bends his rage thy providence to oppose.

10. When I behold thy Heavens, thy Fingers art,
11. The Moon and Starrs which thou so bright hast set,
12. In the pure firmament, then saith my heart,
13. O What is man that thou remembrest yet,

14. And think'st upon him; or of man begot
15. That him thou visit'st and of him art found;
16. Scarce to be less then Gods, thou mad'st his lot,
17. With honour and with state thou hast him crown'd.

18. O're the works of thy hand thou mad'st him Lord,
19. Thou hast put all under his lordly feet,
20. All Flocks, and Herds, by thy commanding word,
21. All beasts that in the field or forrest meet.

22. Fowl of the Heavens, and Fish that through the wet
23. Sea-paths in shoals do slide. And know no dearth.
24. O Jehovah our Lord how wondrous great
25. And glorious is thy name through all the earth.
