1. Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
2. Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above
3. Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd
4. The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh
5. Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath'd
6. Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer
7. Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight
8. Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port
9. Not of mean suiters, nor important less
10. Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair
11. In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,
12. Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore
13. The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine
14. Of Themis stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers
15. Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes
16. Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd
17. Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad
18. With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,
19. By thir great Intercessor, came in sight
20. Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son
21. Presenting, thus to intercede began.
22. See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung
23. From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs
24. And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt
25. With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,
26. Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
27. Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those
28. Which his own hand manuring all the Trees
29. Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n
30. From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare
31. To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;
32. Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee
33. Interpret for him, mee his Advocate
34. And propitiation, all his works on mee
35. Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those
36. Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.
37. Accept me, and in mee from these receave
38. The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live
39. Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days
40. Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I
41. To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)
42. To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee
43. All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,
44. Made one with me as I with thee am one.
45. To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.
46. All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
47. Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:
48. But longer in that Paradise to dwell,
49. The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:
50. Those pure immortal Elements that know
51. No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,
52. Eject him tainted now, and purge him off
53. As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,
54. And mortal food, as may dispose him best
55. For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first
56. Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt
57. Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts
58. Created him endowd, with Happiness
59. And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,
60. This other serv'd but to eternize woe;
61. Till I provided Death; so Death becomes
62. His final remedie, and after Life
63. Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd
64. By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,
65. Wak't in the renovation of the just,
66. Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.
67. But let us call to Synod all the Blest
68. Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide
69. My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,
70. As how with peccant Angels late they saw;
71. And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.
72. He ended, and the Son gave signal high
73. To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew
74. His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps
75. When God descended, and perhaps once more
76. To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast
77. Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs
78. Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring,
79. By the waters of Life, where ere they sate
80. In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light
81. Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,
82. And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream
83. Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.
84. O Sons, like one of us Man is become
85. To know both Good and Evil, since his taste
86. Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast
87. His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,
88. Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known
89. Good by it self, and Evil not at all.
90. He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,
91. My motions in him, longer then they move,
92. His heart I know, how variable and vain
93. Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand
94. Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,
95. And live for ever, dream at least to live
96. Forever, to remove him I decree,
97. And send him from the Garden forth to Till
98. The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.
99. Michael, this my behest have thou in charge,
100. Take to thee from among the Cherubim
101. Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend
102. Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
103. Vacant possession som new trouble raise:
104. Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God
105. Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,
106. From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce
107. To them and to thir Progenie from thence
108. Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint
109. At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,
110. For I behold them soft'nd and with tears
111. Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.
112. If patiently thy bidding they obey,
113. Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale
114. To Adam what shall come in future dayes,
115. As I shall thee enlighten, intermix
116. My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd;
117. So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
118. And on the East side of the Garden place,
119. Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes,
120. Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame
121. Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,
122. And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:
123. Least Paradise a receptacle prove
124. To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,
125. With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.
126. He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd
127. For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright
128. Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each
129. Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape
130. Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those
131. Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze,
132. Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed
133. Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Meanwhile
134. To resalute the World with sacred Light
135. Leucothia wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd
136. The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve
137. Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,
138. Strength added from above, new hope to spring
139. Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;
140. Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd.
141. Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all
142. The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends
143. But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n
144. So prevalent as to concerne the mind
145. Of God high blest, or to incline his will,
146. Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,
147. Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne
148. Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught
149. By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,
150. Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,
151. Methought I saw him placable and mild,
152. Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew
153. That I was heard with favour; peace returnd
154. Home to my brest, and to my memorie
155. His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;
156. Which then not minded in dismay, yet now
157. Assures me that the bitterness of death
158. Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,
159. Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,
160. Mother of all things living, since by thee
161. Man is to live, and all things live for Man.
162. To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
163. Ill worthie I such title should belong
164. To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind
165. A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach
166. Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:
167. But infinite in pardon was my Judge,
168. That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't
169. The sourse of life; next favourable thou,
170. Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,
171. Farr other name deserving. But the Field
172. To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,
173. Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,
174. All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins
175. Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,
176. I never from thy side henceforth to stray,
177. Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind
178. Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,
179. What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?
180. Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.
181. So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate
182. Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest
183. On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd
184. After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight
185. The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour,
186. Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:
187. Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,
188. First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,
189. Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;
190. Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.
191. Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase
192. Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake.
193. O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh,
194. Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews
195. Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn
196. Us haply too secure of our discharge
197. From penaltie, because from death releast
198. Some days; how long, and what till then our life,
199. Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,
200. And thither must return and be no more.
201. VVhy else this double object in our sight
202. Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground
203. One way the self-same hour? why in the East
204. Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light
205. More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws
206. O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,
207. And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.
208. He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands
209. Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now
210. In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,
211. A glorious Apparition, had not doubt
212. And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye.
213. Not that more glorious, when the Angels met
214. Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw
215. The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;
216. Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd
217. In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,
218. Against the Syrian King, who to surprize
219. One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,
220. Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch
221. In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise
222. Possession of the Garden; hee alone,
223. To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way,
224. Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve,
225. While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.
226. Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps
227. Of us will soon determin, or impose
228. New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie
229. From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill
230. One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate
231. None of the meanest, some great Potentate
232. Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie
233. Invests him coming; yet not terrible,
234. That I should fear, nor sociably mild,
235. As Raphael, that I should much confide,
236. But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,
237. With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
238. He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,
239. Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man
240. Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes
241. A militarie Vest of purple flowd
242. Livelier then Meliboean or the graine
243. Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old
244. In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff;
245. His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime
246. In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side
247. As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword,
248. Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.
249. Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State
250. Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.
251. Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:
252. Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,
253. Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
254. Defeated of his seisure many dayes
255. Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,
256. And one bad act with many deeds well done
257. Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd
258. Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;
259. But longer in this Paradise to dwell
260. Permits not; to remove thee I am come,
261. And send thee from the Garden forth to till
262. The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.
263. He added not, for Adam at the newes
264. Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
265. That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen
266. Yet all had heard, with audible lament
267. Discover'd soon the place of her retire.
268. O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!
269. Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
270. Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,
271. Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
272. Quiet though sad, the respit of that day
273. That must be mortal to us both. O flours,
274. That never will in other Climate grow,
275. My early visitation, and my last
276. At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand
277. From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,
278. Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke
279. Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?
280. Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd
281. With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee
282. How shall I part, and whither wander down
283. Into a lower World, to this obscure
284. And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire
285. Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?
286. Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.
287. Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne
288. What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,
289. Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;
290. Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes
291. Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;
292. Where he abides, think there thy native soile.
293. Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
294. Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,
295. To Michael thus his humble words addressd.
296. Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd
297. Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem
298. Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould
299. Thy message, which might else in telling wound,
300. And in performing end us; what besides
301. Of sorrow and dejection and despair
302. Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,
303. Departure from this happy place, our sweet
304. Recess, and onely consolation left
305. Familiar to our eyes, all places else
306. Inhospitable appeer and desolate,
307. Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer
308. Incessant I could hope to change the will
309. Of him who all things can, I would not cease
310. To wearie him with my assiduous cries:
311. But prayer against his absolute Decree
312. No more availes then breath against the winde,
313. Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:
314. Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
315. This most afflicts me, that departing hence,
316. As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd
317. His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,
318. With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd
319. Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;
320. On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree
321. Stood visible, among these Pines his voice
322. I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:
323. So many grateful Altars I would reare
324. Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone
325. Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,
326. Or monument to Ages, and thereon
327. Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours:
328. In yonder nether World where shall I seek
329. His bright appearances, or footstep trace?
330. For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd
331. To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now
332. Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
333. Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.
334. To whom thus Michael with regard benigne.
335. Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth
336. Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills
337. Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,
338. Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:
339. All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,
340. No despicable gift; surmise not then
341. His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd
342. Of Paradise or Eden: this had been
343. Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred
344. All generations, and had hither come
345. From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate
346. And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.
347. But this præeminence thou hast lost, brought down
348. To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:
349. Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine
350. God is as here, and will be found alike
351. Present, and of his presence many a signe
352. Still following thee, still compassing thee round
353. With goodness and paternal Love, his Face
354. Express, and of his steps the track Divine.
355. Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,
356. Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent
357. To shew thee what shall come in future dayes
358. To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad
359. Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending
360. With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn
361. True patience, and to temper joy with fear
362. And pious sorrow, equally enur'd
363. By moderation either state to beare,
364. Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
365. Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure
366. Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend
367. This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes)
368. Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,
369. As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.
370. To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd.
371. Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
372. Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,
373. However chast'ning, to the evil turne
374. My obvious breast, arming to overcom
375. By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,
376. If so I may attain. So both ascend
377. In the Visions of God: It was a Hill
378. Of Paradise the highest, from whose top
379. The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken
380. Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.
381. Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,
382. Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
383. Our second Adam in the Wilderness,
384. To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.
385. His Eye might there command wherever stood
386. City of old or modern Fame, the Seat
387. Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls
388. Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can
389. And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne,
390. To Paquin of Sinæan Kings, and thence
391. To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul
392. Down to the golden Chersonese, or where
393. The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since
394. In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar
395. In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,
396. Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken
397. Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port
398. Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings
399. Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,
400. And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme
401. Of Congo, and Angola fardest South;
402. Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount
403. The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus,
404. Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen;
405. On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway
406. The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw
407. Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume,
408. And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat
409. Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd
410. Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons
411. Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights
412. Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd
413. VVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight
414. Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue
415. The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;
416. And from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd.
417. So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,
418. Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,
419. That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes,
420. Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:
421. But him the gentle Angel by the hand
422. Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.
423. Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold
424. Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought
425. In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd
426. Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,
427. Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive
428. Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.
429. His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,
430. Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves
431. New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;
432. Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood
433. Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon
434. A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought
435. First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,
436. Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next
437. More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock
438. Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid
439. The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,
440. On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.
441. His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n
442. Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;
443. The others not, for his was not sincere;
444. Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,
445. Smote him into the Midriff with a stone
446. That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale
447. Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.
448. Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
449. Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd.
450. O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n
451. To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;
452. Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?
453. T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.
454. These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come
455. Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,
456. For envie that his Brothers Offering found
457. From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact
458. Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd
459. Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,
460. Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire.
461. Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!
462. But have I now seen Death? Is this the way
463. I must return to native dust? O sight
464. Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
465. Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!
466. To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen
467. In his first shape on man; but many shapes
468. Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead
469. To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense
470. More terrible at th' entrance then within.
471. Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,
472. By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more
473. In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring
474. Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew
475. Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know
476. What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve
477. Shall bring on men. Immediately a place
478. Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,
479. A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid
480. Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies
481. Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes
482. Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,
483. Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,
484. Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,
485. Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.
486. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair
487. Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;
488. And over them triumphant Death his Dart
489. Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't
490. With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.
491. Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long
492. Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept,
493. Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd
494. His best of Man, and gave him up to tears
495. A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,
496. And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.
497. O miserable Mankind, to what fall
498. Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd?
499. Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n
500. To be thus wrested from us? rather why
501. Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
502. What we receive, would either not accept
503. Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,
504. Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus
505. Th' Image of God in man created once
506. So goodly and erect, though faultie since,
507. To such unsightly sufferings be debas't
508. Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,
509. Retaining still Divine similitude
510. In part, from such deformities be free,
511. And for his Makers Image sake exempt?
512. Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then
513. Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd
514. To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took
515. His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,
516. Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
517. Therefore so abject is thir punishment,
518. Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,
519. Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't
520. While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
521. To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they
522. Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.
523. I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit.
524. But is there yet no other way, besides
525. These painful passages, how we may come
526. To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?
527. There is, said Michael, if thou well observe
528. The rule of not too much, by temperance taught
529. In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence
530. Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,
531. Till many years over thy head return:
532. So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop
533. Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease
534. Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:
535. This is old age; but then thou must outlive
536. Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change
537. To witherd weak thy Senses then
538. Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,
539. To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth
540. Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne
541. A melancholly damp of cold and dry
542. To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume
543. The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor.
544. Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong
545. Life much, bent rather how I may be quit
546. Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,
547. Which I must keep till my appointed day
548. Of rendring up. Michael to him repli'd.
549. Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst
550. Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:
551. And now prepare thee for another sight.
552. He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon
553. Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds
554. Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound
555. Of Instruments that made melodious chime
556. Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd
557. Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch
558. Instinct through all proportions low and high
559. Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.
560. In other part stood one who at the Forge
561. Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass
562. Had melted (whether found where casual fire
563. Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,
564. Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot
565. To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream
566. From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind
567. Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd
568. First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought
569. Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these,
570. But on the hether side a different sort
571. From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,
572. Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise
573. Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent
574. To worship God aright, and know his works
575. Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve
576. Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain
577. Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold
578. A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay
579. In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung
580. Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:
581. The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes
582. Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net
583. Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;
584. And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star
585. Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat
586. They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke
587. Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;
588. With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.
589. Such happy interview and fair event
590. Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,
591. And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart
592. Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight,
593. The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd.
594. True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,
595. Much better seems this Vision, and more hope
596. Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;
597. Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,
598. Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.
599. To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best
600. By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,
601. Created, as thou art, to nobler end
602. Holie and pure, conformitie divine.
603. Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents
604. Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race
605. Who slew his Brother; studious they appere
606. Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,
607. Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit
608. Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.
609. Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;
610. For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd
611. Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,
612. Yet empty of all good wherein consists
613. Womans domestic honour and chief praise;
614. Bred onely and completed to the taste
615. Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,
616. To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.
617. To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives
618. Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,
619. Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame
620. Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles
621. Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,
622. (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which
623. The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.
624. To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft.
625. O pittie and shame, that they who to live well
626. Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread
627. Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
628. But still I see the tenor of Mans woe
629. Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.
630. From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,
631. Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place
632. By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.
633. But now prepare thee for another Scene.
634. He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred
635. Before him, Towns, and rural works between,
636. Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,
637. Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,
638. Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;
639. Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,
640. Single or in Array of Battel rang'd
641. Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;
642. One way a Band select from forage drives
643. A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine
644. From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,
645. Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,
646. Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,
647. But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;
648. With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;
649. Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies
650. With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field
651. Deserted: Others to a Citie strong
652. Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,
653. Assaulting; others from the Wall defend
654. With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;
655. On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.
656. In other part the scepter'd Haralds call
657. To Council in the Citie Gates: anon
658. Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,
659. Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon
660. In factious opposition, till at last
661. Of middle Age one rising, eminent
662. In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,
663. Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,
664. And Judgement from above: him old and young
665. Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands,
666. Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence
667. Unseen amid the throng: so violence
668. Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law
669. Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.
670. Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
671. Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,
672. Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death
673. Inhumanly to men, and multiply
674. Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew
675. His Brother; for of whom such massacher
676. Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?
677. But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n
678. Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost?
679. To whom thus Michael: These are the product
680. Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st;
681. Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves
682. Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,
683. Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.
684. Such were these Giants, men of high renown;
685. For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,
686. And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;
687. To overcome in Battel, and subdue
688. Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
689. Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
690. Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done
691. Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,
692. Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,
693. Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.
694. Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth,
695. And what most merits fame in silence hid.
696. But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
697. The onely righteous in a World perverse,
698. And therefore hated, therefore so beset
699. With Foes for daring single to be just,
700. And utter odious Truth, that God would come
701. To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High
702. Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds
703. Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God
704. High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,
705. Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward
706. Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;
707. Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.
708. He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd;
709. The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,
710. All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,
711. To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,
712. Marrying or prostituting, as befell,
713. Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire
714. Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.
715. At length a Reverend Sire among them came,
716. And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,
717. And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft
718. Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,
719. Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd
720. Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls
721. In prison under Judgements imminent:
722. But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd
723. Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;
724. Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,
725. Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,
726. Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth,
727. Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore
728. Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large
729. For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!
730. Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small
731. Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught
732. Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons
733. With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.
734. Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings
735. Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove
736. From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie
737. Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,
738. Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie
739. Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain
740. Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth
741. No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum
742. Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow
743. Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else
744. Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp
745. Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,
746. Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces
747. Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd
748. And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,
749. All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.
750. How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold
751. The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,
752. Depopulation; thee another Floud,
753. Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,
754. And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard
755. By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,
756. Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns
757. His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;
758. And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.
759. O Visions ill foreseen! better had I
760. Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne
761. My part of evil onely, each dayes lot
762. Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst
763. The burd'n of many Ages, on me light
764. At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth
765. Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,
766. With thought that they must be. Let no man seek
767. Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
768. Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,
769. Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,
770. And hee the future evil shall no less
771. In apprehension then in substance feel
772. Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,
773. Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't
774. Famin and anguish will at last consume
775. Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope
776. When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,
777. All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd
778. With length of happy days the race of man;
779. But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see
780. Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.
781. How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,
782. And whether here the Race of man will end.
783. To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst
784. In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they
785. First seen in acts of prowess eminent
786. And great exploits, but of true vertu void;
787. Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste
788. Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby
789. Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,
790. Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,
791. Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride
792. Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.
793. The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr
794. Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
795. And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd
796. In sharp contest of Battel found no aide
797. Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale
798. Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,
799. Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords
800. Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear
801. More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:
802. So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,
803. Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;
804. One Man except, the onely Son of light
805. In a dark Age, against example good,
806. Against allurement, custom, and a World
807. Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,
808. Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes
809. Shall them admonish, and before them set
810. The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,
811. And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come
812. On thir impenitence; and shall returne
813. Of them derided, but of God observd
814. The one just Man alive; by his command
815. Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,
816. To save himself and houshold from amidst
817. A World devote to universal rack.
818. No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast
819. Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,
820. And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts
821. Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre
822. Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep
823. Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp
824. Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise
825. Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount
826. Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd
827. Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,
828. With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift
829. Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,
830. And there take root an Iland salt and bare,
831. The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.
832. To teach thee that God attributes to place
833. No sanctitie, if none be thither brought
834. By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
835. And now what further shall ensue, behold.
836. He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,
837. Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,
838. Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie
839. Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;
840. And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass
841. Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,
842. As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink
843. From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole
844. With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt
845. His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.
846. The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground
847. Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.
848. And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;
849. With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive
850. Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.
851. Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,
852. And after him, the surer messenger,
853. A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie
854. Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;
855. The second time returning, in his Bill
856. An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:
857. Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke
858. The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;
859. Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
860. Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds
861. A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow
862. Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,
863. Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.
864. Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
865. Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth.
866. O thou that future things canst represent
867. As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive
868. At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live
869. With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.
870. Farr less I now lament for one whole World
871. Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce
872. For one Man found so perfet and so just,
873. That God voutsafes to raise another World
874. From him, and all his anger to forget.
875. But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,
876. Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,
877. Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
878. The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,
879. Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?
880. To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;
881. So willingly doth God remit his Ire,
882. Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,
883. Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw
884. The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh
885. Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,
886. Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,
887. That he relents, not to blot out mankind,
888. And makes a Covenant never to destroy
889. The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea
890. Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World
891. With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings
892. Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set
893. His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look
894. And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,
895. Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost
896. Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,
897. Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
898. Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;
899. And Man as from a second stock proceed.
900. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave
901. Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine
902. Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:
903. Henceforth what is to com I will relate,
904. Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
905. This second sours of Men, while yet but few,
906. And while the dread of judgement past remains
907. Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,
908. With some regard to what is just and right
909. Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,
910. Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,
911. Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,
912. Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,
913. With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast
914. Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell
915. Long time in peace by Families and Tribes
916. Under paternal rule; till one shall rise
917. Of proud ambitious heart, who not content
918. With fair equalitie, fraternal state,
919. Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd
920. Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
921. Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;
922. Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)
923. With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse
924. Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:
925. A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd
926. Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n,
927. Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie;
928. And from Rebellion shall derive his name,
929. Though of Rebellion others he accuse.
930. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns
931. With him or under him to tyrannize,
932. Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde
933. The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
934. Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;
935. Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build
936. A Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n;
937. And get themselves a name, least far disperst
938. In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,
939. Regardless whether good or evil fame.
940. But God who oft descends to visit men
941. Unseen, and through thir habitations walks
942. To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,
943. Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower
944. Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets
945. Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase
946. Quite out thir Native Language, and instead
947. To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
948. Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
949. Among the Builders; each to other calls
950. Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,
951. As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n
952. And looking down, to see the hubbub strange
953. And hear the din; thus was the building left
954. Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd.
955. Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas'd.
956. O execrable Son so to aspire
957. Above his Brethren, to himself affirming
958. Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:
959. He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl
960. Dominion absolute; that right we hold
961. By his donation; but Man over men
962. He made not Lord; such title to himself
963. Reserving, human left from human free.
964. But this Usurper his encroachment proud
965. Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends
966. Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food
967. Will he convey up thither to sustain
968. Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire
969. Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,
970. And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?
971. To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr'st
972. That Son, who on the quiet state of men
973. Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
974. Rational Libertie; yet know withall,
975. Since thy original lapse, true Libertie
976. Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells
977. Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:
978. Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,
979. Immediately inordinate desires
980. And upstart Passions catch the Government
981. From Reason, and to servitude reduce
982. Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits
983. Within himself unworthie Powers to reign
984. Over free Reason, God in Judgement just
985. Subjects him from without to violent Lords;
986. Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
987. His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,
988. Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.
989. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low
990. From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,
991. But Justice, and some fatal curse annext
992. Deprives them of thir outward libertie,
993. Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son
994. Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame
995. Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,
996. Servant of servants, on his vitious Race.
997. Thus will this latter, as the former World,
998. Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last
999. Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
1000. His presence from among them, and avert
1001. His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth
1002. To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;
1003. And one peculiar Nation to select
1004. From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd,
1005. A Nation from one faithful man to spring:
1006. Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,
1007. Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men
1008. (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
1009. While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,
1010. As to forsake the living God, and fall
1011. To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone
1012. For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes
1013. To call by Vision from his Fathers house,
1014. His kindred and false Gods, into a Land
1015. Which he will shew him, and from him will raise
1016. A mightie Nation, and upon him showre
1017. His benediction so, that in his Seed
1018. All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,
1019. Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:
1020. I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith
1021. He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile
1022. Ur of Chaldæa, passing now the Ford
1023. To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train
1024. Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;
1025. Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth
1026. With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.
1027. Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents
1028. Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine
1029. Of Moreb; there by promise he receaves
1030. Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;
1031. From Hamath Northward to the Desert South
1032. (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)
1033. From Hermon East to the great Western Sea,
1034. Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold
1035. In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare
1036. Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream
1037. Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons
1038. Shall dwell to Senir; that long ridge of Hills.
1039. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth
1040. Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed
1041. Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise
1042. The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon
1043. Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest,
1044. Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
1045. A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,
1046. Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;
1047. The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs
1048. From Canaan, to a Land hereafter call'd
1049. Egypt, divided by the River Nile;
1050. See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes
1051. Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land
1052. He comes invited by a yonger Son
1053. In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds
1054. Raise him to be the second in that Realme
1055. Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race
1056. Growing into a Nation, and now grown
1057. Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks
1058. To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests
1059. Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
1060. Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:
1061. Till by two brethren (those two brethren call
1062. Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime
1063. His people from enthralment, they return
1064. With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.
1065. But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies
1066. To know thir God, or message to regard,
1067. Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;
1068. To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,
1069. Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill
1070. With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;
1071. His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,
1072. Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,
1073. And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,
1074. Haile mixt with fire must rend th' Egyptian Skie
1075. And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;
1076. What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,
1077. A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down
1078. Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:
1079. Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
1080. Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;
1081. Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born
1082. Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds
1083. This River-dragon tam'd at length submits
1084. To let his sojourners depart, and oft
1085. Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice
1086. More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage
1087. Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea
1088. Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass
1089. As on drie land between two christal walls,
1090. Aw'd by the rod of Moses so to stand
1091. Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:
1092. Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,
1093. Though present in his Angel, who shall goe
1094. Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,
1095. By day a Cloud, by night a pillar of Fire,
1096. To guide them in thir journey, and remove
1097. Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:
1098. All night he will pursue, but his approach
1099. Darkness defends between till morning Watch;
1100. Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud
1101. God looking forth will trouble all his Host
1102. And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command
1103. Moses once more his potent Rod extends
1104. Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;
1105. On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,
1106. And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect
1107. Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance
1108. Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,
1109. Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd
1110. Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare
1111. Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather
1112. Inglorious life with servitude; for life
1113. To noble and ignoble is more sweet
1114. Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.
1115. This also shall they gain by thir delay
1116. In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found
1117. Thir government, and thir great Senate choose
1118. Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:
1119. God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top
1120. Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
1121. In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound
1122. Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine
1123. To civil Justice, part religious Rites
1124. Of sacrifice, informing them, by types
1125. And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise
1126. The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve
1127. Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God
1128. To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech
1129. That Moses might report to them his will,
1130. And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,
1131. Instructed that to God is no access
1132. Without Mediator, whose high Office now
1133. Moses in figure beares, to introduce
1134. One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,
1135. And all the Prophets in thir Age the times
1136. Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites
1137. Establisht, such delight hath God in Men
1138. Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes
1139. Among them to set up his Tabernacle,
1140. The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
1141. By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd
1142. Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein
1143. An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,
1144. The Records of his Cov'nant, over these
1145. A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings
1146. Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn
1147. Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing
1148. The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud
1149. Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,
1150. Save when they journie, and at length they come,
1151. Conducted by his Angel to the Land
1152. Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest
1153. Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,
1154. How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,
1155. Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still
1156. A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,
1157. Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand,
1158. And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon
1159. Till Israel overcome; so call the third
1160. From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him
1161. His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.
1162. Here Adam interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n,
1163. Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things
1164. Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne
1165. Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde
1166. Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd,
1167. Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom
1168. Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see
1169. His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,
1170. Favour unmerited by me, who sought
1171. Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means.
1172. This yet I apprehend not, why to those
1173. Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth
1174. So many and so various Laws are giv'n;
1175. So many Laws argue so many sins
1176. Among them; how can God with such reside?
1177. To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin
1178. Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
1179. And therefore was Law given them to evince
1180. Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up
1181. Sin against Law to fight; that when they see
1182. Law can discover sin, but not remove,
1183. Save by those shadowie expiations weak,
1184. The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude
1185. Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,
1186. Just for unjust, that in such righteousness
1187. To them by Faith imputed, they may finde
1188. Justification towards God, and peace
1189. Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies
1190. Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part
1191. Perform, and not performing cannot live.
1192. So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n
1193. With purpose to resign them in full time
1194. Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd
1195. From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,
1196. From imposition of strict Laws, to free
1197. Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear
1198. To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.
1199. And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
1200. Highly belov'd, being but the Minister
1201. Of Law, his people into Canaan lead;
1202. But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
1203. His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell
1204. The adversarie Serpent, and bring back
1205. Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man
1206. Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
1207. Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac't
1208. Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
1209. National interrupt thir public peace,
1210. Provoking God to raise them enemies:
1211. From whom as oft he saves them penitent
1212. By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom
1213. The second, both for pietie renownd
1214. And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
1215. Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne
1216. For ever shall endure; the like shall sing
1217. All Prophecie, [t]hat of the Royal Stock
1218. Of David (so I name this King) shall rise
1219. A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,
1220. Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust
1221. All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings
1222. The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.
1223. But first a long succession must ensue,
1224. And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd,
1225. The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents
1226. Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.
1227. Such follow him, as shall be registerd
1228. Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,
1229. Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults
1230. Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense
1231. God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,
1232. Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark
1233. With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
1234. To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st
1235. Left in confusion, Babylon thence call'd.
1236. There in captivitie he lets them dwell
1237. The space of seventie years, then brings them back,
1238. Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn
1239. To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n.
1240. Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings
1241. Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God
1242. They first re-edifie, and for a while
1243. In mean estate live moderate, till grown
1244. In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;
1245. But first among the Priests dissension springs,
1246. Men who attend the Altar, and should most
1247. Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings
1248. Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise
1249. The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons,
1250. Then loose it to a stranger, that the true
1251. Anointed King Messiah might be born
1252. Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr
1253. Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com,
1254. And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire
1255. His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;
1256. His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
1257. To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;
1258. They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire
1259. Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.
1260. A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire
1261. The Power of the most High; he shall ascend
1262. The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign
1263. With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns.
1264. He ceas'd, discerning Adam with such joy
1265. Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,
1266. Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.
1267. O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher
1268. Of utmost hope! now clear I understand
1269. What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,
1270. Why our great expectation should be call'd
1271. The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,
1272. High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes
1273. Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son
1274. Of God most High; So God with man unites.
1275. Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
1276. Expect with mortal paine: say where and when
1277. Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.
1278. To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight,
1279. As of a Duel, or the local wounds
1280. Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son
1281. Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil
1282. Thy enemie; nor so is overcome
1283. Satan, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise,
1284. Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound:
1285. Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,
1286. Not by destroying Satan, but his works
1287. In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,
1288. But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,
1289. Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd
1290. On penaltie of death, and suffering death,
1291. The penaltie to thy transgression due,
1292. And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
1293. So onely can high Justice rest appaid.
1294. The Law of God exact he shall fulfill
1295. Both by obedience and by love, though love
1296. Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment
1297. He shall endure by coming in the Flesh
1298. To a reproachful life and cursed death,
1299. Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe
1300. In his redemption, and that his obedience
1301. Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits
1302. To save them, not thir own, though legal works.
1303. For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,
1304. Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd
1305. A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross
1306. By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;
1307. But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,
1308. The Law that is against thee, and the sins
1309. Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd,
1310. Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
1311. In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
1312. But soon revives, Death over him no power
1313. Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
1314. Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise
1315. Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
1316. Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
1317. His death for Man, as many as offerd Life
1318. Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace
1319. By Faith not void of works: this God-like act
1320. Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd,
1321. In sin for ever lost from life; this act
1322. Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength
1323. Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,
1324. And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
1325. Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,
1326. Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,
1327. A gentle wafting to immortal Life.
1328. Nor after resurrection shall he stay
1329. Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer
1330. To his Disciples, Men who in his Life
1331. Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge
1332. To teach all nations what of him they learn'd
1333. And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve
1334. Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe
1335. Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life
1336. Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall,
1337. For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.
1338. All Nations they shall teach; for from that day
1339. Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines
1340. Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons
1341. Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world;
1342. So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.
1343. Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend
1344. With victory, triumphing through the aire
1345. Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
1346. The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines
1347. Through all his realme, & there confounded leave;
1348. Then enter into glory, and resume
1349. His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high
1350. Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come,
1351. When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,
1352. With glory and power to judge both quick & dead,
1353. To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward
1354. His faithful, and receave them into bliss,
1355. Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth
1356. Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
1357. Then this of Eden, and far happier daies.
1358. So spake th' Archangel Michael, then paus'd,
1359. As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire
1360. Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd.
1361. O goodness infinite, goodness immense!
1362. That all this good of evil shall produce,
1363. And evil turn to good; more wonderful
1364. Then that which by creation first brought forth
1365. Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,
1366. Whether I should repent me now of sin
1367. By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce
1368. Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,
1369. To God more glory, more good will to Men
1370. From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.
1371. But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n
1372. Must reascend, what will betide the few
1373. His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,
1374. The enemies of truth; who then shall guide
1375. His people, who defend? will they not deale
1376. Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?
1377. Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n
1378. Hee to his own a Comforter will send,
1379. The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
1380. His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith
1381. Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,
1382. To guide them in all truth, and also arme
1383. With spiritual Armour, able to resist
1384. Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts
1385. What Man can do against them, not affraid,
1386. Though to the death, against such cruelties
1387. With inward consolations recompenc't,
1388. And oft supported so as shall amaze
1389. Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit
1390. Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends
1391. To evangelize the Nations, then on all
1392. Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue
1393. To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,
1394. As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win
1395. Great numbers of each Nation to receave
1396. With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length
1397. Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run,
1398. Thir doctrine and thir story written left,
1399. They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,
1400. Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,
1401. Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n
1402. To thir own vile advantages shall turne
1403. Of lucre and ambition, and the truth
1404. With superstitions and traditions taint,
1405. Left onely in those written Records pure,
1406. Though not but by the Spirit understood.
1407. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
1408. Places and titles, and with these to joine
1409. Secular power, though feigning still to act
1410. By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
1411. The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n
1412. To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,
1413. Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force
1414. On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde
1415. Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within
1416. Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then
1417. But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde
1418. His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild
1419. His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,
1420. Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth
1421. Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard
1422. Infallible? yet many will presume:
1423. Whence heavie persecution shall arise
1424. On all who in the worship persevere
1425. Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,
1426. Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes
1427. Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire
1428. Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith
1429. Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,
1430. To good malignant, to bad men benigne,
1431. Under her own waight groaning, till the day
1432. Appeer of respiration to the just,
1433. And vengeance to the wicked, at return
1434. Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid,
1435. The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,
1436. Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,
1437. Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald
1438. In glory of the Father, to dissolve
1439. Satan with his perverted World, then raise
1440. From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd,
1441. New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date
1442. Founded in righteousness and peace and love,
1443. To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.
1444. He ended; and thus Adam last reply'd.
1445. How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,
1446. Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time,
1447. Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,
1448. Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.
1449. Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,
1450. Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill
1451. Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;
1452. Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
1453. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,
1454. And love with feare the onely God, to walk
1455. As in his presence, ever to observe
1456. His providence, and on him sole depend,
1457. Merciful over all his works, with good
1458. Still overcoming evil, and by small
1459. Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak
1460. Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
1461. By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake
1462. Is fortitude to highest victorie,
1463. And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;
1464. Taught this by his example whom I now
1465. Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
1466. To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd:
1467. This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe
1468. Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs
1469. Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,
1470. All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
1471. Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea,
1472. And all the riches of this World enjoydst,
1473. And all the rule, one Empire; onely add
1474. Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,
1475. Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,
1476. By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul
1477. Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath
1478. To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
1479. A Paradise within thee, happier farr.
1480. Let us descend now therefore from this top
1481. Of Speculation; for the hour precise
1482. Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,
1483. By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect
1484. Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,
1485. In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;
1486. We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
1487. Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd
1488. Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd
1489. To meek submission: thou at season fit
1490. Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,
1491. Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,
1492. The great deliverance by her Seed to come
1493. (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.
1494. That ye may live, which will be many dayes,
1495. Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,
1496. With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd
1497. With meditation on the happie end.
1498. He ended, and they both descend the Hill;
1499. Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve
1500. Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;
1501. And thus with words not sad she him receav'd.
1502. Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know;
1503. For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,
1504. Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
1505. Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
1506. VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;
1507. In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,
1508. Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
1509. Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee
1510. Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou,
1511. VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.
1512. This further consolation yet secure
1513. I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,
1514. Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,
1515. By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore.
1516. So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard
1517. VVell pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh
1518. Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill
1519. To thir fixt Station, all in bright array
1520. The Cherubim descended; on the ground
1521. Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist
1522. Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides,
1523. And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel
1524. Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't,
1525. The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd
1526. Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,
1527. And vapour as the Libyan Air adust,
1528. Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat
1529. In either hand the hastning Angel caught
1530. Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate
1531. Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast
1532. To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd.
1533. They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld
1534. Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,
1535. Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate
1536. With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes:
1537. Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon;
1538. The World was all before them, where to choose
1539. Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:
1540. They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,
1541. Through Eden took thir solitarie way.
