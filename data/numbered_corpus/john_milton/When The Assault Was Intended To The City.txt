1. Captain, or colonel, or knight in arms,
2. Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize,
3. If deed of honour did thee ever please,
4. Guard them, and him within protect from harms.
5. He can requite thee, for he knows the charms
6. That call fame on such gentle acts as these,
7. And he can spread thy name o’er lands and seas,
8. Whatever clime the sun’s bright circle warms.
9. Lift not thy spear against the Muse’s bower;
10. The great Emathian conqueror bid spare
11. The house of Pindarus, when temple and tower
12. Went to the ground; and the repeated air
13. Of sad Electra’s Poet had the power
14. To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare.
