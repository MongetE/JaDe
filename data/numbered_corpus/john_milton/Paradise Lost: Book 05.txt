1. Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime
2. Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,
3. When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep
4. Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred,
5. And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound
6. Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,
7. Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song
8. Of birds on every bough; so much the more
9. His wonder was to find unwakened Eve
10. With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,
11. As through unquiet rest:  He, on his side
12. Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love
13. Hung over her enamoured, and beheld
14. Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,
15. Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice
16. Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,
17. Her hand soft touching, whispered thus.  Awake,
18. My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,
19. Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight!
20. Awake:  The morning shines, and the fresh field
21. Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring
22. Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove,
23. What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,
24. How nature paints her colours, how the bee
25. Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.
26. Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye
27. On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.
28. O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
29. My glory, my perfection! glad I see
30. Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night
31. (Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,
32. If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,
33. Works of day past, or morrow's next design,
34. But of offence and trouble, which my mind
35. Knew never till this irksome night:  Methought,
36. Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
37. With gentle voice;  I thought it thine: It said,
38. 'Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,
39. 'The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
40. 'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake
41. 'Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns
42. 'Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light
43. 'Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,
44. 'If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,
45. 'Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire?
46. 'In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment
47. 'Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.'
48. I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;
49. To find thee I directed then my walk;
50. And on, methought, alone I passed through ways
51. That brought me on a sudden to the tree
52. Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,
53. Much fairer to my fancy than by day:
54. And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood
55. One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven
56. By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled
57. Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;
58. And 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,
59. 'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,
60. 'Nor God, nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?
61. 'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?
62. 'Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold
63. 'Longer thy offered good; why else set here?
64. This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm
65. He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled
66. At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:
67. But he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine,
68. 'Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,
69. 'Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit
70. 'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:
71. 'And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more
72. 'Communicated, more abundant grows,
73. 'The author not impaired, but honoured more?
74. 'Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!
75. 'Partake thou also; happy though thou art,
76. 'Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:
77. 'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods
78. 'Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,
79. 'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes
80. 'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see
81. 'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!'
82. So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,
83. Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
84. Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell
85. So quickened appetite, that I, methought,
86. Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the clouds
87. With him I flew, and underneath beheld
88. The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide
89. And various:  Wondering at my flight and change
90. To this high exaltation; suddenly
91. My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,
92. And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked
93. To find this but a dream!  Thus Eve her night
94. Related, and thus Adam answered sad.
95. Best image of myself, and dearer half,
96. The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
97. Affects me equally; nor can I like
98. This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;
99. Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,
100. Created pure.  But know that in the soul
101. Are many lesser faculties, that serve
102. Reason as chief; among these Fancy next
103. Her office holds; of all external things
104. Which the five watchful senses represent,
105. She forms imaginations, aery shapes,
106. Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames
107. All what we affirm or what deny, and call
108. Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
109. Into her private cell, when nature rests.
110. Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes
111. To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,
112. Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams;
113. Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
114. Some such resemblances, methinks, I find
115. Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream,
116. But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
117. Evil into the mind of God or Man
118. May come and go, so unreproved, and leave
119. No spot or blame behind:  Which gives me hope
120. That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,
121. Waking thou never will consent to do.
122. Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,
123. That wont to be more cheerful and serene,
124. Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;
125. And let us to our fresh employments rise
126. Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers
127. That open now their choisest bosomed smells,
128. Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.
129. So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;
130. But silently a gentle tear let fall
131. From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;
132. Two other precious drops that ready stood,
133. Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell
134. Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
135. And pious awe, that feared to have offended.
136. So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.
137. But first, from under shady arborous roof
138. Soon as they forth were come to open sight
139. Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,
140. With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,
141. Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,
142. Discovering in wide landskip all the east
143. Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains,
144. Lowly they bowed adoring, and began
145. Their orisons, each morning duly paid
146. In various style; for neither various style
147. Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
148. Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung
149. Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence
150. Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,
151. More tuneable than needed lute or harp
152. To add more sweetness; and they thus began.
153. These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,
154. Almighty!  Thine this universal frame,
155. Thus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!
156. Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens
157. To us invisible, or dimly seen
158. In these thy lowest works; yet these declare
159. Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.
160. Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,
161. Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs
162. And choral symphonies, day without night,
163. Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven
164. On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol
165. Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
166. Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,
167. If better thou belong not to the dawn,
168. Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn
169. With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,
170. While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.
171. Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,
172. Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise
173. In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,
174. And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.
175. Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,
176. With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;
177. And ye five other wandering Fires, that move
178. In mystick dance not without song, resound
179. His praise, who out of darkness called up light.
180. Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth
181. Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run
182. Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix
183. And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change
184. Vary to our great Maker still new praise.
185. Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise
186. From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,
187. Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
188. In honour to the world's great Author rise;
189. Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,
190. Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,
191. Rising or falling still advance his praise.
192. His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,
193. Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,
194. With every plant, in sign of worship wave.
195. Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,
196. Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
197. Join voices, all ye living Souls:  Ye Birds,
198. That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,
199. Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.
200. Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk
201. The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;
202. Witness if I be silent, morn or even,
203. To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,
204. Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.
205. Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still
206. To give us only good; and if the night
207. Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,
208. Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!
209. So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts
210. Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.
211. On to their morning's rural work they haste,
212. Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row
213. Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far
214. Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check
215. Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine
216. To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines
217. Her marriageable arms, and with him brings
218. Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn
219. His barren leaves.  Them thus employed beheld
220. With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called
221. Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned
222. To travel with Tobias, and secured
223. His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.
224. Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth
225. Satan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf,
226. Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed
227. This night the human pair; how he designs
228. In them at once to ruin all mankind.
229. Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend
230. Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade
231. Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired,
232. To respite his day-labour with repast,
233. Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,
234. As may advise him of his happy state,
235. Happiness in his power left free to will,
236. Left to his own free will, his will though free,
237. Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware
238. He swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal
239. His danger, and from whom; what enemy,
240. Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now
241. The fall of others from like state of bliss;
242. By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;
243. But by deceit and lies:  This let him know,
244. Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend
245. Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.
246. So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled
247. All justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint
248. After his charge received; but from among
249. Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood
250. Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,
251. Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,
252. On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
253. Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate
254. Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide
255. On golden hinges turning, as by work
256. Divine the sovran Architect had framed.
257. From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
258. Star interposed, however small he sees,
259. Not unconformed to other shining globes,
260. Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned
261. Above all hills.  As when by night the glass
262. Of Galileo, less assured, observes
263. Imagined lands and regions in the moon:
264. Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades
265. Delos or Samos first appearing, kens
266. A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight
267. He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky
268. Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing
269. Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan
270. Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar
271. Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems
272. A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,
273. When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's
274. Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.
275. At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise
276. He lights, and to his proper shape returns
277. A Seraph winged:  Six wings he wore, to shade
278. His lineaments divine; the pair that clad
279. Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast
280. With regal ornament; the middle pair
281. Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round
282. Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
283. And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet
284. Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,
285. Sky-tinctured grain.  Like Maia's son he stood,
286. And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled
287. The circuit wide.  Straight knew him all the bands
288. Of Angels under watch; and to his state,
289. And to his message high, in honour rise;
290. For on some message high they guessed him bound.
291. Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come
292. Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,
293. And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;
294. A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here
295. Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will
296. Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,
297. Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.
298. Him through the spicy forest onward come
299. Adam discerned, as in the door he sat
300. Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun
301. Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
302. Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:
303. And Eve within, due at her hour prepared
304. For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please
305. True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
306. Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,
307. Berry or grape:  To whom thus Adam called.
308. Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold
309. Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape
310. Comes this way moving; seems another morn
311. Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven
312. To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe
313. This day to be our guest.  But go with speed,
314. And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour
315. Abundance, fit to honour and receive
316. Our heavenly stranger:  Well we may afford
317. Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow
318. From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies
319. Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows
320. More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.
321. To whom thus Eve.  Adam, earth's hallowed mould,
322. Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store,
323. All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;
324. Save what by frugal storing firmness gains
325. To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:
326. But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,
327. Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice
328. To entertain our Angel-guest, as he
329. Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth
330. God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.
331. So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste
332. She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent
333. What choice to choose for delicacy best,
334. What order, so contrived as not to mix
335. Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring
336. Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change;
337. Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
338. Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields
339. In India East or West, or middle shore
340. In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where
341. Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat
342. Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,
343. She gathers, tribute large, and on the board
344. Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape
345. She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths
346. From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed
347. She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold
348. Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground
349. With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.
350. Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet
351. His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train
352. Accompanied than with his own complete
353. Perfections; in himself was all his state,
354. More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits
355. On princes, when their rich retinue long
356. Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,
357. Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.
358. Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed,
359. Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,
360. As to a superiour nature bowing low,
361. Thus said.  Native of Heaven, for other place
362. None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;
363. Since, by descending from the thrones above,
364. Those happy places thou hast deigned a while
365. To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us
366. Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess
367. This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower
368. To rest; and what the garden choicest bears
369. To sit and taste, till this meridian heat
370. Be over, and the sun more cool decline.
371. Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.
372. Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such
373. Created, or such place hast here to dwell,
374. As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,
375. To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower
376. O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,
377. I have at will.  So to the sylvan lodge
378. They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,
379. With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,
380. Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair
381. Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned
382. Of three that in mount Ida naked strove,
383. Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil
384. She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm
385. Altered her cheek.  On whom the Angel Hail
386. Bestowed, the holy salutation used
387. Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.
388. Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb
389. Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,
390. Than with these various fruits the trees of God
391. Have heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf
392. Their table was, and mossy seats had round,
393. And on her ample square from side to side
394. All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here
395. Danced hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;
396. No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began
397. Our author.  Heavenly stranger, please to taste
398. These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom
399. All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,
400. To us for food and for delight hath caused
401. The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps
402. To spiritual natures; only this I know,
403. That one celestial Father gives to all.
404. To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives
405. (Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part
406. Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found
407. No ingrateful food:  And food alike those pure
408. Intelligential substances require,
409. As doth your rational; and both contain
410. Within them every lower faculty
411. Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,
412. Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,
413. And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
414. For know, whatever was created, needs
415. To be sustained and fed:  Of elements
416. The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,
417. Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires
418. Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon;
419. Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged
420. Vapours not yet into her substance turned.
421. Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
422. From her moist continent to higher orbs.
423. The sun that light imparts to all, receives
424. From all his alimental recompence
425. In humid exhalations, and at even
426. Sups with the ocean.  Though in Heaven the trees
427. Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines
428. Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn
429. We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground
430. Covered with pearly grain:  Yet God hath here
431. Varied his bounty so with new delights,
432. As may compare with Heaven; and to taste
433. Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,
434. And to their viands fell; nor seemingly
435. The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss
436. Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch
437. Of real hunger, and concoctive heat
438. To transubstantiate:  What redounds, transpires
439. Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire
440. Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
441. Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,
442. Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,
443. As from the mine.  Mean while at table Eve
444. Ministered naked, and their flowing cups
445. With pleasant liquours crowned:  O innocence
446. Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,
447. Then had the sons of God excuse to have been
448. Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts
449. Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy
450. Was understood, the injured lover's hell.
451. Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,
452. Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose
453. In Adam, not to let the occasion pass
454. Given him by this great conference to know
455. Of things above his world, and of their being
456. Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw
457. Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms,
458. Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far
459. Exceeded human; and his wary speech
460. Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.
461. Inhabitant with God, now know I well
462. Thy favour, in this honour done to Man;
463. Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
464. To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,
465. Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,
466. As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
467. At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare
468. To whom the winged Hierarch replied.
469. O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom
470. All things proceed, and up to him return,
471. If not depraved from good, created all
472. Such to perfection, one first matter all,
473. Endued with various forms, various degrees
474. Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;
475. But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,
476. As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending
477. Each in their several active spheres assigned,
478. Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
479. Proportioned to each kind.  So from the root
480. Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
481. More aery, last the bright consummate flower
482. Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,
483. Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,
484. To vital spirits aspire, to animal,
485. To intellectual; give both life and sense,
486. Fancy and understanding; whence the soul
487. Reason receives, and reason is her being,
488. Discursive, or intuitive; discourse
489. Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,
490. Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
491. Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
492. If I refuse not, but convert, as you
493. To proper substance.  Time may come, when Men
494. With Angels may participate, and find
495. No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;
496. And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
497. Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,
498. Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend
499. Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice,
500. Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell;
501. If ye be found obedient, and retain
502. Unalterably firm his love entire,
503. Whose progeny you are.  Mean while enjoy
504. Your fill what happiness this happy state
505. Can comprehend, incapable of more.
506. To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.
507. O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,
508. Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
509. Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set
510. From center to circumference; whereon,
511. In contemplation of created things,
512. By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,
513. What meant that caution joined, If ye be found
514. Obedient?  Can we want obedience then
515. To him, or possibly his love desert,
516. Who formed us from the dust and placed us here
517. Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
518. Human desires can seek or apprehend?
519. To whom the Angel.  Son of Heaven and Earth,
520. Attend!  That thou art happy, owe to God;
521. That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,
522. That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
523. This was that caution given thee; be advised.
524. God made thee perfect, not immutable;
525. And good he made thee, but to persevere
526. He left it in thy power; ordained thy will
527. By nature free, not over-ruled by fate
528. Inextricable, or strict necessity:
529. Our voluntary service he requires,
530. Not our necessitated; such with him
531. Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how
532. Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve
533. Willing or no, who will but what they must
534. By destiny, and can no other choose?
535. Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand
536. In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state
537. Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;
538. On other surety none:  Freely we serve,
539. Because we freely love, as in our will
540. To love or not; in this we stand or fall:
541. And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,
542. And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall
543. From what high state of bliss, into what woe!
544. To whom our great progenitor.  Thy words
545. Attentive, and with more delighted ear,
546. Divine instructer, I have heard, than when
547. Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
548. Aereal musick send:  Nor knew I not
549. To be both will and deed created free;
550. Yet that we never shall forget to love
551. Our Maker, and obey him whose command
552. Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts
553. Assured me, and still assure:  Though what thou tellest
554. Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,
555. But more desire to hear, if thou consent,
556. The full relation, which must needs be strange,
557. Worthy of sacred silence to be heard;
558. And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun
559. Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins
560. His other half in the great zone of Heaven.
561. Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,
562. After short pause assenting, thus began.
563. High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,
564. Sad task and hard:  For how shall I relate
565. To human sense the invisible exploits
566. Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,
567. The ruin of so many glorious once
568. And perfect while they stood? how last unfold
569. The secrets of another world, perhaps
570. Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
571. This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach
572. Of human sense, I shall delineate so,
573. By likening spiritual to corporal forms,
574. As may express them best; though what if Earth
575. Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein
576. Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?
577. As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild
578. Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests
579. Upon her center poised; when on a day
580. (For time, though in eternity, applied
581. To motion, measures all things durable
582. By present, past, and future,) on such day
583. As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host
584. Of Angels by imperial summons called,
585. Innumerable before the Almighty's throne
586. Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared
587. Under their Hierarchs in orders bright:
588. Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,
589. Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear
590. Stream in the air, and for distinction serve
591. Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;
592. Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
593. Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love
594. Recorded eminent.  Thus when in orbs
595. Of circuit inexpressible they stood,
596. Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,
597. By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,
598. Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top
599. Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.
600. Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,
601. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;
602. Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.
603. This day I have begot whom I declare
604. My only Son, and on this holy hill
605. Him have anointed, whom ye now behold
606. At my right hand; your head I him appoint;
607. And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow
608. All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:
609. Under his great vice-gerent reign abide
610. United, as one individual soul,
611. For ever happy:  Him who disobeys,
612. Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day,
613. Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls
614. Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place
615. Ordained without redemption, without end.
616. So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words
617. All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.
618. That day, as other solemn days, they spent
619. In song and dance about the sacred hill;
620. Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere
621. Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels
622. Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
623. Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular
624. Then most, when most irregular they seem;
625. And in their motions harmony divine
626. So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear
627. Listens delighted.  Evening now approached,
628. (For we have also our evening and our morn,
629. We ours for change delectable, not need;)
630. Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
631. Desirous; all in circles as they stood,
632. Tables are set, and on a sudden piled
633. With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows
634. In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,
635. Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.
636. On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,
637. They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet
638. Quaff immortality and joy, secure
639. Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds
640. Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered
641. With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.
642. Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
643. From that high mount of God, whence light and shade
644. Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed
645. To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there
646. In darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed
647. All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;
648. Wide over all the plain, and wider far
649. Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,
650. (Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,
651. Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend
652. By living streams among the trees of life,
653. Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,
654. Celestial tabernacles, where they slept
655. Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,
656. Melodious hymns about the sovran throne
657. Alternate all night long: but not so waked
658. Satan; so call him now, his former name
659. Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,
660. If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,
661. In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught
662. With envy against the Son of God, that day
663. Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed
664. Messiah King anointed, could not bear
665. Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.
666. Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,
667. Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
668. Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved
669. With all his legions to dislodge, and leave
670. Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,
671. Contemptuous; and his next subordinate
672. Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.
673. Sleepest thou, Companion dear?  What sleep can close
674. Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree
675. Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips
676. Of Heaven's Almighty.  Thou to me thy thoughts
677. Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;
678. Both waking we were one; how then can now
679. Thy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed;
680. New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise
681. In us who serve, new counsels to debate
682. What doubtful may ensue:  More in this place
683. To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou
684. Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;
685. Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night
686. Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,
687. And all who under me their banners wave,
688. Homeward, with flying march, where we possess
689. The quarters of the north; there to prepare
690. Fit entertainment to receive our King,
691. The great Messiah, and his new commands,
692. Who speedily through all the hierarchies
693. Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.
694. So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused
695. Bad influence into the unwary breast
696. Of his associate:  He together calls,
697. Or several one by one, the regent Powers,
698. Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught,
699. That the Most High commanding, now ere night,
700. Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,
701. The great hierarchal standard was to move;
702. Tells the suggested cause, and casts between
703. Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound
704. Or taint integrity:  But all obeyed
705. The wonted signal, and superiour voice
706. Of their great Potentate; for great indeed
707. His name, and high was his degree in Heaven;
708. His countenance, as the morning-star that guides
709. The starry flock, allured them, and with lies
710. Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host.
711. Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns
712. Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,
713. And from within the golden lamps that burn
714. Nightly before him, saw without their light
715. Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread
716. Among the sons of morn, what multitudes
717. Were banded to oppose his high decree;
718. And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.
719. Son, thou in whom my glory I behold
720. In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,
721. Nearly it now concerns us to be sure
722. Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms
723. We mean to hold what anciently we claim
724. Of deity or empire:  Such a foe
725. Is rising, who intends to erect his throne
726. Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north;
727. Nor so content, hath in his thought to try
728. In battle, what our power is, or our right.
729. Let us advise, and to this hazard draw
730. With speed what force is left, and all employ
731. In our defence; lest unawares we lose
732. This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.
733. To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,
734. Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,
735. Made answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes
736. Justly hast in derision, and, secure,
737. Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,
738. Matter to me of glory, whom their hate
739. Illustrates, when they see all regal power
740. Given me to quell their pride, and in event
741. Know whether I be dextrous to subdue
742. Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.
743. So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,
744. Far was advanced on winged speed; an host
745. Innumerable as the stars of night,
746. Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun
747. Impearls on every leaf and every flower.
748. Regions they passed, the mighty regencies
749. Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,
750. In their triple degrees; regions to which
751. All thy dominion, Adam, is no more
752. Than what this garden is to all the earth,
753. And all the sea, from one entire globose
754. Stretched into longitude; which having passed,
755. At length into the limits of the north
756. They came; and Satan to his royal seat
757. High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount
758. Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers
759. From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;
760. The palace of great Lucifer, (so call
761. That structure in the dialect of men
762. Interpreted,) which not long after, he
763. Affecting all equality with God,
764. In imitation of that mount whereon
765. Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,
766. The Mountain of the Congregation called;
767. For thither he assembled all his train,
768. Pretending so commanded to consult
769. About the great reception of their King,
770. Thither to come, and with calumnious art
771. Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.
772. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;
773. If these magnifick titles yet remain
774. Not merely titular, since by decree
775. Another now hath to himself engrossed
776. All power, and us eclipsed under the name
777. Of King anointed, for whom all this haste
778. Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,
779. This only to consult how we may best,
780. With what may be devised of honours new,
781. Receive him coming to receive from us
782. Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!
783. Too much to one! but double how endured,
784. To one, and to his image now proclaimed?
785. But what if better counsels might erect
786. Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?
787. Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend
788. The supple knee?  Ye will not, if I trust
789. To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves
790. Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before
791. By none; and if not equal all, yet free,
792. Equally free; for orders and degrees
793. Jar not with liberty, but well consist.
794. Who can in reason then, or right, assume
795. Monarchy over such as live by right
796. His equals, if in power and splendour less,
797. In freedom equal? or can introduce
798. Law and edict on us, who without law
799. Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,
800. And look for adoration, to the abuse
801. Of those imperial titles, which assert
802. Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.
803. Thus far his bold discourse without controul
804. Had audience; when among the Seraphim
805. Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored
806. The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,
807. Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe
808. The current of his fury thus opposed.
809. O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!
810. Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven
811. Expected, least of all from thee,  Ingrate,
812. In place thyself so high above thy peers.
813. Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn
814. The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,
815. That to his only Son, by right endued
816. With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven
817. Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due
818. Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,
819. Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,
820. And equal over equals to let reign,
821. One over all with unsucceeded power.
822. Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute
823. With him the points of liberty, who made
824. Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven
825. Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?
826. Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,
827. And of our good and of our dignity
828. How provident he is; how far from thought
829. To make us less, bent rather to exalt
830. Our happy state, under one head more near
831. United.  But to grant it thee unjust,
832. That equal over equals monarch reign:
833. Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,
834. Or all angelick nature joined in one,
835. Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,
836. As by his Word, the Mighty Father made
837. All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven
838. By him created in their bright degrees,
839. Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named
840. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,
841. Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,
842. But more illustrious made; since he the head
843. One of our number thus reduced becomes;
844. His laws our laws; all honour to him done
845. Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,
846. And tempt not these; but hasten to appease
847. The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,
848. While pardon may be found in time besought.
849. So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal
850. None seconded, as out of season judged,
851. Or singular and rash:  Whereat rejoiced
852. The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.
853. That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work
854. Of secondary hands, by task transferred
855. From Father to his Son? strange point and new!
856. Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw
857. When this creation was? rememberest thou
858. Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
859. We know no time when we were not as now;
860. Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised
861. By our own quickening power, when fatal course
862. Had circled his full orb, the birth mature
863. Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.
864. Our puissance is our own; our own right hand
865. Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try
866. Who is our equal:  Then thou shalt behold
867. Whether by supplication we intend
868. Address, and to begirt the almighty throne
869. Beseeching or besieging.  This report,
870. These tidings carry to the anointed King;
871. And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.
872. He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,
873. Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
874. Through the infinite host; nor less for that
875. The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone
876. Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.
877. O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,
878. Forsaken of all good!  I see thy fall
879. Determined, and thy hapless crew involved
880. In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread
881. Both of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth
882. No more be troubled how to quit the yoke
883. Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws
884. Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees
885. Against thee are gone forth without recall;
886. That golden scepter, which thou didst reject,
887. Is now an iron rod to bruise and break
888. Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;
889. Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly
890. These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath
891. Impendent, raging into sudden flame,
892. Distinguish not:  For soon expect to feel
893. His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
894. Then who created thee lamenting learn,
895. When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.
896. So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found
897. Among the faithless, faithful only he;
898. Among innumerable false, unmoved,
899. Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,
900. His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;
901. Nor number, nor example, with him wrought
902. To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,
903. Though single.  From amidst them forth he passed,
904. Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained
905. Superiour, nor of violence feared aught;
906. And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned
907. On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.
