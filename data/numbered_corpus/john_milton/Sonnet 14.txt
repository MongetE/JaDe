1. XIV

2. When Faith and Love which parted from thee never,
3. Had ripen'd thy just soul to dwell with God,
4. Meekly thou didst resign this earthy load
5. Of Death, call'd Life; which us from Life doth sever
6. Thy Works and Alms and all thy good Endeavour
7. Staid not behind, nor in the grave were trod;
8. But as Faith pointed with her golden rod,
9. Follow'd thee up to joy and bliss for ever.
10. Love led them on, and Faith who knew them best
11. Thy hand-maids, clad them o're with purple beams
12. And azure wings, that up they flew so drest,
13. And speak the truth of thee on glorious Theams
14. Before the Judge, who thenceforth bid thee rest
15. And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams.
