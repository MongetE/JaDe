1. Let us with a gladsome mind
2. Praise the Lord for he is kind;
3. For his mercies aye endure,
4. Ever faithful, ever sure.

5. Let us blaze his Name abroad,
6. For of gods he is the God;
7. For his, &c.
8. O let us his praises tell,
9. That doth the wrathful tyrants quell;
10. For his, &c.
11. That with his miracles doth make
12. Amazèd Heaven and Earth to shake;
13. For his, &c.
14. That by his wisdom did create
15. The painted heavens so full of state;
16. For his, &c.
17. That did the solid Earth ordain
18. To rise above the watery plain;
19. For his, &c.
20. That by his all-commanding might,
21. Did fill the new-made world with light;
22. For his, &c.
23. And caused the golden-tressèd Sun
24. All the day long his course to run;
25. For his, &c.
26. The hornèd Moon to shine by night
27. Amongst her spangled sisters bright;
28. For his, &c.
29. He, with his thunder-clasping hand,
30. Smote the first-born of Egypt land;
31. For his, &c.
32. And, in despite of Pharao fell,
33. He brought from thence his Israel;
34. For his, &c.
35. The ruddy waves he cleft in twain
36. Of the Erythræan main;
37. For his, &c.
38. The floods stood still, like walls of glass,
39. While the Hebrew bands did pass;
40. For his, &c.
41. But full soon they did devour
42. The tawny King with all his power;
43. For his, &c.
44. His chosen people he did bless
45. In the wasteful Wilderness;
46. For his, &c.
47. In bloody battail he brought down
48. Kings of prowess and renown;
49. For his, &c.
50. He foiled bold Seon and his host,
51. That ruled the Amorrean coast;
52. For his, &c.
53. And large-limbed Og he did subdue,
54. With all his over-hardy crew;
55. For his, &c.
56. And to his servant Israel
57. He gave their land, therein to dwell;
58. For his, &c.
59. He hath, with a piteous eye,
60. Beheld us in our misery;
61. For his, &c.
62. And freed us from the slavery
63. Of the invading enemy;
64. For his, &c.
65. All living creatures he doth feed,
66. And with full hand supplies their need;
67. For his, &c.
68. Let us, therefore, warble forth
69. His mighty majesty and worth;
70. For his, &c.
71. That his mansion hath on high,
72. Above the reach of mortal eye;
73. For his, &c.
