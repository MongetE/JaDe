1. So spake the Son of God; and Satan stood
2. A while as mute, confounded what to say,
3. What to reply, confuted and convinced
4. Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift;
5. At length, collecting all his serpent wiles,
6. With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:—
7. "I see thou know'st what is of use to know,
8. What best to say canst say, to do canst do;
9. Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words
10. To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart
11. Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape.
12. Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult,
13. Thy counsel would be as the oracle
14. Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems
15. On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old
16. Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds
17. That might require the array of war, thy skill
18. Of conduct would be such that all the world
19. Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist
20. In battle, though against thy few in arms.
21. These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide?
22. Affecting private life, or more obscure
23. In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive
24. All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself
25. The fame and glory—glory, the reward
26. That sole excites to high attempts the flame
27. Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure
28. AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise,
29. All treasures and all gain esteem as dross,
30. And dignities and powers, all but the highest?
31. Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe.  The son
32. Of Macedonian Philip had ere these
33. Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held
34. At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down
35. The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled
36. The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode.
37. Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature,
38. Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment.
39. Great Julius, whom now all the world admires,
40. The more he grew in years, the more inflamed
41. With glory, wept that he had lived so long
42. Ingloroious.  But thou yet art not too late."
43. To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:—
44. "Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth
45. For empire's sake, nor empire to affect
46. For glory's sake, by all thy argument.
47. For what is glory but the blaze of fame,
48. The people's praise, if always praise unmixed?
49. And what the people but a herd confused,
50. A miscellaneous rabble, who extol
51. Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise?
52. They praise and they admire they know not what,
53. And know not whom, but as one leads the other;
54. And what delight to be by such extolled,
55. To live upon their tongues, and be their talk?
56. Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise—
57. His lot who dares be singularly good.
58. The intelligent among them and the wise
59. Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised.
60. This is true glory and renown—when God,
61. Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks
62. The just man, and divulges him through Heaven
63. To all his Angels, who with true applause
64. Recount his praises.  Thus he did to Job,
65. When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth,
66. As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember,
67. He asked thee, 'Hast thou seen my servant Job?'
68. Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known,
69. Where glory is false glory, attributed
70. To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.
71. They err who count it glorious to subdue
72. By conquest far and wide, to overrun
73. Large countries, and in field great battles win,
74. Great cities by assault.  What do these worthies
75. But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave
76. Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote,
77. Made captive, yet deserving freedom more
78. Than those their conquerors, who leave behind
79. Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove,
80. And all the flourishing works of peace destroy;
81. Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods,
82. Great benefactors of mankind, Deliverers,
83. Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice?
84. One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other;
85. Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men,
86. Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed,
87. Violent or shameful death their due reward.
88. But, if there be in glory aught of good;
89. It may be means far different be attained,
90. Without ambition, war, or violence—
91. By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent,
92. By patience, temperance.  I mention still
93. Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne,
94. Made famous in a land and times obscure;
95. Who names not now with honour patient Job?
96. Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?)
97. By what he taught and suffered for so doing,
98. For truth's sake suffering death unjust, lives now
99. Equal in fame to proudest conquerors.
100. Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done,
101. Aught suffered—if young African for fame
102. His wasted country freed from Punic rage—
103. The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least,
104. And loses, though but verbal, his reward.
105. Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek,
106. Oft not deserved?  I seek not mine, but His
107. Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am."
108. To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:—
109. "Think not so slight of glory, therein least
110. Resembling thy great Father.  He seeks glory,
111. And for his glory all things made, all things
112. Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven,
113. By all his Angels glorified, requires
114. Glory from men, from all men, good or bad,
115. Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption.
116. Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift,
117. Glory he requires, and glory he receives,
118. Promiscuous from all nations, Jew, or Greek,
119. Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared;
120. From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts."
121. To whom our Saviour fervently replied:
122. "And reason; since his Word all things produced,
123. Though chiefly not for glory as prime end,
124. But to shew forth his goodness, and impart
125. His good communicable to every soul
126. Freely; of whom what could He less expect
127. Than glory and benediction—that is, thanks—
128. The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense
129. From them who could return him nothing else,
130. And, not returning that, would likeliest render
131. Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?
132. Hard recompense, unsuitable return
133. For so much good, so much beneficience!
134. But why should man seek glory, who of his own
135. Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs
136. But condemnation, ignominy, and shame—
137. Who, for so many benefits received,
138. Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false,
139. And so of all true good himself despoiled;
140. Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take
141. That which to God alone of right belongs?
142. Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace,
143. That who advances his glory, not their own,
144. Them he himself to glory will advance."
145. So spake the Son of God; and here again
146. Satan had not to answer, but stood struck
147. With guilt of his own sin—for he himself,
148. Insatiable of glory, had lost all;
149. Yet of another plea bethought him soon:—
150. "Of glory, as thou wilt," said he, "so deem;
151. Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass.
152. But to a Kingdom thou art born—ordained
153. To sit upon thy father David's throne,
154. By mother's side thy father, though thy right
155. Be now in powerful hands, that will not part
156. Easily from possession won with arms.
157. Judaea now and all the Promised Land,
158. Reduced a province under Roman yoke,
159. Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled
160. With temperate sway: oft have they violated
161. The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts,
162. Abominations rather, as did once
163. Antiochus.  And think'st thou to regain
164. Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring?
165. So did not Machabeus.  He indeed
166. Retired unto the Desert, but with arms;
167. And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed
168. That by strong hand his family obtained,
169. Though priests, the crown, and David's throne usurped,
170. With Modin and her suburbs once content.
171. If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal
172. And duty—zeal and duty are not slow,
173. But on Occasion's forelock watchful wait:
174. They themselves rather are occasion best—
175. Zeal of thy Father's house, duty to free
176. Thy country from her heathen servitude.
177. So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify,
178. The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign—
179. The happier reign the sooner it begins.
180. Rein then; what canst thou better do the while?"
181. To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:—
182. "All things are best fulfilled in their due time;
183. And time there is for all things, Truth hath said.
184. If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told
185. That it shall never end, so, when begin
186. The Father in his purpose hath decreed—
187. He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl.
188. What if he hath decreed that I shall first
189. Be tried in humble state, and things adverse,
190. By tribulations, injuries, insults,
191. Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence,
192. Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting
193. Without distrust or doubt, that He may know
194. What I can suffer, how obey?  Who best
195. Can suffer best can do, best reign who first
196. Well hath obeyed—just trial ere I merit
197. My exaltation without change or end.
198. But what concerns it thee when I begin
199. My everlasting Kingdom?  Why art thou
200. Solicitous?  What moves thy inquisition?
201. Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall,
202. And my promotion will be thy destruction?"
203. To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:—
204. "Let that come when it comes.  All hope is lost
205. Of my reception into grace; what worse?
206. For where no hope is left is left no fear.
207. If there be worse, the expectation more
208. Of worse torments me than the feeling can.
209. I would be at the worst; worst is my port,
210. My harbour, and my ultimate repose,
211. The end I would attain, my final good.
212. My error was my error, and my crime
213. My crime; whatever, for itself condemned,
214. And will alike be punished, whether thou
215. Reign or reign not—though to that gentle brow
216. Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign,
217. From that placid aspect and meek regard,
218. Rather than aggravate my evil state,
219. Would stand between me and thy Father's ire
220. (Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell)
221. A shelter and a kind of shading cool
222. Interposition, as a summer's cloud.
223. If I, then, to the worst that can be haste,
224. Why move thy feet so slow to what is best?
225. Happiest, both to thyself and all the world,
226. That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King!
227. Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained
228. Of the enterprise so hazardous and high!
229. No wonder; for, though in thee be united
230. What of perfection can in Man be found,
231. Or human nature can receive, consider
232. Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent
233. At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns,
234. And once a year Jerusalem, few days'
235. Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe?
236. The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory,
237. Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts—
238. Best school of best experience, quickest in sight
239. In all things that to greatest actions lead.
240. The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever
241. Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty
242. (As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom)
243. Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous.
244. But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit
245. Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes
246. The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state—
247. Sufficient introduction to inform
248. Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts,
249. And regal mysteries; that thou may'st know
250. How best their opposition to withstand."
251. With that (such power was given him then), he took
252. The Son of God up to a mountain high.
253. It was a mountain at whose verdant feet
254. A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide
255. Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed,
256. The one winding, the other straight, and left between
257. Fair champaign, with less rivers interveined,
258. Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea.
259. Fertil of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine;
260. With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills;
261. Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem
262. The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large
263. The prospect was that here and there was room
264. For barren desert, fountainless and dry.
265. To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought
266. Our Saviour, and new train of words began:—
267. "Well have we speeded, and o'er hill and dale,
268. Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers,
269. Cut shorter many a league.  Here thou behold'st
270. Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds,
271. Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on
272. As far as Indus east, Euphrates west,
273. And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay,
274. And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth:
275. Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall
276. Several days' journey, built by Ninus old,
277. Of that first golden monarchy the seat,
278. And seat of Salmanassar, whose success
279. Israel in long captivity still mourns;
280. There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues,
281. As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice
282. Judah and all thy father David's house
283. Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste,
284. Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis,
285. His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there;
286. Ecbatana her structure vast there shews,
287. And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates;
288. There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream,
289. The drink of none but kings; of later fame,
290. Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands,
291. The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there
292. Artaxata, Teredon, Ctesiphon,
293. Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold.
294. All these the Parthian (now some ages past
295. By great Arsaces led, who founded first
296. That empire) under his dominion holds,
297. From the luxurious kings of Antioch won.
298. And just in time thou com'st to have a view
299. Of his great power; for now the Parthian king
300. In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host
301. Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild
302. Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid
303. He marches now in haste.  See, though from far,
304. His thousands, in what martial equipage
305. They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms,
306. Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit—
307. All horsemen, in which fight they most excel;
308. See how in warlike muster they appear,
309. In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings."
310. He looked, and saw what numbers numberless
311. The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops
312. In coats of mail and military pride.
313. In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong,
314. Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice
315. Of many provinces from bound to bound—
316. From Arachosia, from Candaor east,
317. And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs
318. Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales;
319. From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains
320. Of Adiabene, Media, and the south
321. Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven.
322. He saw them in their forms of battle ranged,
323. How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot
324. Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face
325. Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight;
326. The field all iron cast a gleaming brown.
327. Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn,
328. Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight,
329. Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers
330. Of archers; nor of labouring pioners
331. A multitude, with spades and axes armed,
332. To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill,
333. Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay
334. With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke:
335. Mules after these, camels and dromedaries,
336. And waggons fraught with utensils of war.
337. Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,
338. When Agrican, with all his northern powers,
339. Besieged Albracea, as romances tell,
340. The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win
341. The fairest of her sex, Angelica,
342. His daughter, sought by many prowest knights,
343. Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane.
344. Such and so numerous was their chivalry;
345. At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed,
346. And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:—
347. "That thou may'st know I seek not to engage
348. Thy virtue, and not every way secure
349. On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark
350. To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew
351. All this fair sight.  Thy kingdom, though foretold
352. By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou
353. Endeavour, as thy father David did,
354. Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still
355. In all things, and all men, supposes means;
356. Without means used, what it predicts revokes.
357. But say thou wert possessed of David's throne
358. By free consent of all, none opposite,
359. Samaritan or Jew; how couldst thou hope
360. Long to enjoy it quiet and secure
361. Between two such enclosing enemies,
362. Roman and Parthian?  Therefore one of these
363. Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first,
364. By my advice, as nearer, and of late
365. Found able by invasion to annoy
366. Thy country, and captive lead away her kings,
367. Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound,
368. Maugre the Roman.  It shall be my task
369. To render thee the Parthian at dispose,
370. Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league.
371. By him thou shalt regain, without him not,
372. That which alone can truly reinstall thee
373. In David's royal seat, his true successor—
374. Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes
375. Whose offspring in his territory yet serve
376. In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed:
377. The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost
378. Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old
379. Their fathers in the land of Egypt served,
380. This offer sets before thee to deliver.
381. These if from servitude thou shalt restore
382. To their inheritance, then, nor till then,
383. Thou on the throne of David in full glory,
384. From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond,
385. Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear."
386. To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:—
387. "Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm
388. And fragile arms, much instrument of war,
389. Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought,
390. Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear
391. Vented much policy, and projects deep
392. Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues,
393. Plausible to the world, to me worth naught.
394. Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else
395. Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne!
396. My time, I told thee (and that time for thee
397. Were better farthest off), is not yet come.
398. When that comes, think not thou to find me slack
399. On my part aught endeavouring, or to need
400. Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome
401. Luggage of war there shewn me—argument
402. Of human weakness rather than of strength.
403. My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes,
404. I must deliver, if I mean to reign
405. David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway
406. To just extent over all Israel's sons!
407. But whence to thee this zeal?  Where was it then
408. For Israel, or for David, or his throne,
409. When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride
410. Of numbering Israel—which cost the lives
411. of threescore and ten thousand Israelites
412. By three days' pestilence?  Such was thy zeal
413. To Israel then, the same that now to me.
414. As for those captive tribes, themselves were they
415. Who wrought their own captivity, fell off
416. From God to worship calves, the deities
417. Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth,
418. And all the idolatries of heathen round,
419. Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes;
420. Nor in the land of their captivity
421. Humbled themselves, or penitent besought
422. The God of their forefathers, but so died
423. Impenitent, and left a race behind
424. Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce
425. From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain,
426. And God with idols in their worship joined.
427. Should I of these the liberty regard,
428. Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony,
429. Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed,
430. Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps
431. Of Bethel and of Dan?  No; let them serve
432. Their enemies who serve idols with God.
433. Yet He at length, time to himself best known,
434. Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call
435. May bring them back, repentant and sincere,
436. And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood,
437. While to their native land with joy they haste,
438. As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft,
439. When to the Promised Land their fathers passed.
440. To his due time and providence I leave them."
441. So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend
442. Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles.
443. So fares it when with truth falsehood contends.
