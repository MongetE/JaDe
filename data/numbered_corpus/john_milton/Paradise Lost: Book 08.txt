1. The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear
2. So charming left his voice, that he a while
3. Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;
4. Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.
5. What thanks sufficient, or what recompence
6. Equal, have I to render thee, divine
7. Historian, who thus largely hast allayed
8. The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed
9. This friendly condescension to relate
10. Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard
11. With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
12. With glory attributed to the high
13. Creator!  Something yet of doubt remains,
14. Which only thy solution can resolve.
15. When I behold this goodly frame, this world,
16. Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute
17. Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,
18. An atom, with the firmament compared
19. And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll
20. Spaces incomprehensible, (for such
21. Their distance argues, and their swift return
22. Diurnal,) merely to officiate light
23. Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
24. One day and night; in all her vast survey
25. Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,
26. How Nature wise and frugal could commit
27. Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
28. So many nobler bodies to create,
29. Greater so manifold, to this one use,
30. For aught appears, and on their orbs impose
31. Such restless revolution day by day
32. Repeated; while the sedentary Earth,
33. That better might with far less compass move,
34. Served by more noble than herself, attains
35. Her end without least motion, and receives,
36. As tribute, such a sumless journey brought
37. Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;
38. Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.
39. So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed
40. Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve
41. Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,
42. With lowliness majestick from her seat,
43. And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
44. Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,
45. To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,
46. Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,
47. And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.
48. Yet went she not, as not with such discourse
49. Delighted, or not capable her ear
50. Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,
51. Adam relating, she sole auditress;
52. Her husband the relater she preferred
53. Before the Angel, and of him to ask
54. Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix
55. Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute
56. With conjugal caresses: from his lip
57. Not words alone pleased her.  O! when meet now
58. Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?
59. With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,
60. Not unattended; for on her, as Queen,
61. A pomp of winning Graces waited still,
62. And from about her shot darts of desire
63. Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.
64. And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed,
65. Benevolent and facile thus replied.
66. To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven
67. Is as the book of God before thee set,
68. Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn
69. His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:
70. This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,
71. Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest
72. From Man or Angel the great Architect
73. Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
74. His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
75. Rather admire; or, if they list to try
76. Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens
77. Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move
78. His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
79. Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven
80. And calculate the stars, how they will wield
81. The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive
82. To save appearances; how gird the sphere
83. With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er,
84. Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:
85. Already by thy reasoning this I guess,
86. Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest
87. That bodies bright and greater should not serve
88. The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,
89. Earth sitting still, when she alone receives
90. The benefit:  Consider first, that great
91. Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth
92. Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,
93. Nor glistering, may of solid good contain
94. More plenty than the sun that barren shines;
95. Whose virtue on itself works no effect,
96. But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,
97. His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.
98. Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
99. Officious; but to thee, Earth's habitant.
100. And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak
101. The Maker's high magnificence, who built
102. So spacious, and his line stretched out so far;
103. That Man may know he dwells not in his own;
104. An edifice too large for him to fill,
105. Lodged in a small partition; and the rest
106. Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.
107. The swiftness of those circles attribute,
108. Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,
109. That to corporeal substances could add
110. Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow,
111. Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven
112. Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived
113. In Eden; distance inexpressible
114. By numbers that have name.  But this I urge,
115. Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show
116. Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;
117. Not that I so affirm, though so it seem
118. To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
119. God, to remove his ways from human sense,
120. Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,
121. If it presume, might err in things too high,
122. And no advantage gain.  What if the sun
123. Be center to the world; and other stars,
124. By his attractive virtue and their own
125. Incited, dance about him various rounds?
126. Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,
127. Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,
128. In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these
129. The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem,
130. Insensibly three different motions move?
131. Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,
132. Moved contrary with thwart obliquities;
133. Or save the sun his labour, and that swift
134. Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,
135. Invisible else above all stars, the wheel
136. Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,
137. If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day
138. Travelling east, and with her part averse
139. From the sun's beam meet night, her other part
140. Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light,
141. Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,
142. To the terrestrial moon be as a star,
143. Enlightening her by day, as she by night
144. This earth? reciprocal, if land be there,
145. Fields and inhabitants:  Her spots thou seest
146. As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce
147. Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
148. Allotted there; and other suns perhaps,
149. With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,
150. Communicating male and female light;
151. Which two great sexes animate the world,
152. Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.
153. For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
154. By living soul, desart and desolate,
155. Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute
156. Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far
157. Down to this habitable, which returns
158. Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
159. But whether thus these things, or whether not;
160. But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,
161. Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;
162. He from the east his flaming road begin;
163. Or she from west her silent course advance,
164. With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
165. On her soft axle, while she paces even,
166. And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along;
167. Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid;
168. Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!
169. Of other creatures, as him pleases best,
170. Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou
171. In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
172. And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high
173. To know what passes there; be lowly wise:
174. Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;
175. Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there
176. Live, in what state, condition, or degree;
177. Contented that thus far hath been revealed
178. Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.
179. To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.
180. How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure
181. Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!
182. And, freed from intricacies, taught to live
183. The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts
184. To interrupt the sweet of life, from which
185. God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,
186. And not molest us; unless we ourselves
187. Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.
188. But apt the mind or fancy is to rove
189. Unchecked, and of her roving is no end;
190. Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn,
191. That, not to know at large of things remote
192. From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know
193. That which before us lies in daily life,
194. Is the prime wisdom:  What is more, is fume,
195. Or emptiness, or fond impertinence:
196. And renders us, in things that most concern,
197. Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.
198. Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
199. A lower flight, and speak of things at hand
200. Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise
201. Of something not unseasonable to ask,
202. By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.
203. Thee I have heard relating what was done
204. Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate
205. My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;
206. And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest
207. How subtly to detain thee I devise;
208. Inviting thee to hear while I relate;
209. Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:
210. For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;
211. And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
212. Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst
213. And hunger both, from labour, at the hour
214. Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,
215. Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine
216. Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.
217. To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.
218. Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
219. Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee
220. Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
221. Inward and outward both, his image fair:
222. Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace
223. Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;
224. Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
225. Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire
226. Gladly into the ways of God with Man:
227. For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set
228. On Man his equal love:  Say therefore on;
229. For I that day was absent, as befel,
230. Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,
231. Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell;
232. Squared in full legion (such command we had)
233. To see that none thence issued forth a spy,
234. Or enemy, while God was in his work;
235. Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,
236. Destruction with creation might have mixed.
237. Not that they durst without his leave attempt;
238. But us he sends upon his high behests
239. For state, as Sovran King; and to inure
240. Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut,
241. The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;
242. But long ere our approaching heard within
243. Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,
244. Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
245. Glad we returned up to the coasts of light
246. Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.
247. But thy relation now; for I attend,
248. Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.
249. So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
250. For Man to tell how human life began
251. Is hard; for who himself beginning knew
252. Desire with thee still longer to converse
253. Induced me.  As new waked from soundest sleep,
254. Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,
255. In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun
256. Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.
257. Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,
258. And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised
259. By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,
260. As thitherward endeavouring, and upright
261. Stood on my feet: about me round I saw
262. Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,
263. And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,
264. Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;
265. Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;
266. With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.
267. Myself I then perused, and limb by limb
268. Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran
269. With supple joints, as lively vigour led:
270. But who I was, or where, or from what cause,
271. Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;
272. My tongue obeyed, and readily could name
273. Whate'er I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light,
274. And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,
275. Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,
276. And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,
277. Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?--
278. Not of myself;--by some great Maker then,
279. In goodness and in power pre-eminent:
280. Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,
281. From whom I have that thus I move and live,
282. And feel that I am happier than I know.--
283. While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,
284. From where I first drew air, and first beheld
285. This happy light; when, answer none returned,
286. On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,
287. Pensive I sat me down:  There gentle sleep
288. First found me, and with soft oppression seised
289. My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought
290. I then was passing to my former state
291. Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:
292. When suddenly stood at my head a dream,
293. Whose inward apparition gently moved
294. My fancy to believe I yet had being,
295. And lived:  One came, methought, of shape divine,
296. And said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,
297. 'First Man, of men innumerable ordained
298. 'First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide
299. 'To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.'
300. So saying, by the hand he took me raised,
301. And over fields and waters, as in air
302. Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up
303. A woody mountain; whose high top was plain,
304. A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees
305. Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw
306. Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.  Each tree,
307. Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
308. Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite
309. To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found
310. Before mine eyes all real, as the dream
311. Had lively shadowed:  Here had new begun
312. My wandering, had not he, who was my guide
313. Up hither, from among the trees appeared,
314. Presence Divine.  Rejoicing, but with awe,
315. In adoration at his feet I fell
316. Submiss:  He reared me, and 'Whom thou soughtest I am,'
317. Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest
318. 'Above, or round about thee, or beneath.
319. 'This Paradise I give thee, count it thine
320. 'To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:
321. 'Of every tree that in the garden grows
322. 'Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:
323. 'But of the tree whose operation brings
324. 'Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set
325. 'The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,
326. 'Amid the garden by the tree of life,
327. 'Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,
328. 'And shun the bitter consequence: for know,
329. 'The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command
330. 'Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,
331. 'From that day mortal; and this happy state
332. 'Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world
333. 'Of woe and sorrow.'  Sternly he pronounced
334. The rigid interdiction, which resounds
335. Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice
336. Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect
337. Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.
338. 'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth
339. 'To thee and to thy race I give; as lords
340. 'Possess it, and all things that therein live,
341. 'Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.
342. 'In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold
343. 'After their kinds; I bring them to receive
344. 'From thee their names, and pay thee fealty
345. 'With low subjection; understand the same
346. 'Of fish within their watery residence,
347. 'Not hither summoned, since they cannot change
348. 'Their element, to draw the thinner air.'
349. As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold
350. Approaching two and two; these cowering low
351. With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.
352. I named them, as they passed, and understood
353. Their nature, with such knowledge God endued
354. My sudden apprehension:  But in these
355. I found not what methought I wanted still;
356. And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.
357. O, by what name, for thou above all these,
358. Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,
359. Surpassest far my naming; how may I
360. Adore thee, Author of this universe,
361. And all this good to man? for whose well being
362. So amply, and with hands so liberal,
363. Thou hast provided all things:  But with me
364. I see not who partakes.  In solitude
365. What happiness, who can enjoy alone,
366. Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?
367. Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,
368. As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.
369. What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth
370. With various living creatures, and the air
371. Replenished, and all these at thy command
372. To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not
373. Their language and their ways?  They also know,
374. And reason not contemptibly:  With these
375. Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.
376. So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed
377. So ordering:  I, with leave of speech implored,
378. And humble deprecation, thus replied.
379. Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;
380. My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
381. Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,
382. And these inferiour far beneath me set?
383. Among unequals what society
384. Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?
385. Which must be mutual, in proportion due
386. Given and received; but, in disparity
387. The one intense, the other still remiss,
388. Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove
389. Tedious alike:  Of fellowship I speak
390. Such as I seek, fit to participate
391. All rational delight: wherein the brute
392. Cannot be human consort:  They rejoice
393. Each with their kind, lion with lioness;
394. So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:
395. Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl
396. So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;
397. Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.
398. Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.
399. A nice and subtle happiness, I see,
400. Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice
401. Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste
402. No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.
403. What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?
404. Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
405. Of happiness, or not? who am alone
406. From all eternity; for none I know
407. Second to me or like, equal much less.
408. How have I then with whom to hold converse,
409. Save with the creatures which I made, and those
410. To me inferiour, infinite descents
411. Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
412. He ceased; I lowly answered.  To attain
413. The highth and depth of thy eternal ways
414. All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!
415. Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee
416. Is no deficience found:  Not so is Man,
417. But in degree; the cause of his desire
418. By conversation with his like to help
419. Or solace his defects.  No need that thou
420. Shouldst propagate, already Infinite;
421. And through all numbers absolute, though One:
422. But Man by number is to manifest
423. His single imperfection, and beget
424. Like of his like, his image multiplied,
425. In unity defective; which requires
426. Collateral love, and dearest amity.
427. Thou in thy secresy although alone,
428. Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not
429. Social communication; yet, so pleased,
430. Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
431. Of union or communion, deified:
432. I, by conversing, cannot these erect
433. From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.
434. Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used
435. Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained
436. This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.
437. Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;
438. And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,
439. Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;
440. Expressing well the spirit within thee free,
441. My image, not imparted to the brute;
442. Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
443. Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;
444. And be so minded still:  I, ere thou spakest,
445. Knew it not good for Man to be alone;
446. And no such company as then thou sawest
447. Intended thee; for trial only brought,
448. To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:
449. What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,
450. Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,
451. Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.
452. He ended, or I heard no more; for now
453. My earthly by his heavenly overpowered,
454. Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth
455. In that celestial colloquy sublime,
456. As with an object that excels the sense
457. Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair
458. Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called
459. By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.
460. Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell
461. Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,
462. Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,
463. Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape
464. Still glorious before whom awake I stood:
465. Who stooping opened my left side, and took
466. From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,
467. And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,
468. But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:
469. The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;
470. Under his forming hands a creature grew,
471. Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,
472. That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now
473. Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained
474. And in her looks; which from that time infused
475. Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,
476. And into all things from her air inspired
477. The spirit of love and amorous delight.
478. She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked
479. To find her, or for ever to deplore
480. Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:
481. When out of hope, behold her, not far off,
482. Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned
483. With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
484. To make her amiable:  On she came,
485. Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,
486. And guided by his voice; nor uninformed
487. Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:
488. Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,
489. In every gesture dignity and love.
490. I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.
491. This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled
492. Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,
493. Giver of all things fair! but fairest this
494. Of all thy gifts! nor enviest.  I now see
495. Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself
496. Before me:  Woman is her name;of Man
497. Extracted: for this cause he shall forego
498. Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;
499. And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.
500. She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,
501. Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,
502. Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,
503. That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,
504. Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,
505. The more desirable; or, to say all,
506. Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,
507. Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:
508. I followed her; she what was honour knew,
509. And with obsequious majesty approved
510. My pleaded reason.  To the nuptial bower
511. I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,
512. And happy constellations, on that hour
513. Shed their selectest influence; the Earth
514. Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;
515. Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs
516. Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings
517. Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,
518. Disporting, till the amorous bird of night
519. Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star
520. On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.
521. Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought
522. My story to the sum of earthly bliss,
523. Which I enjoy; and must confess to find
524. In all things else delight indeed, but such
525. As, used or not, works in the mind no change,
526. Nor vehement desire; these delicacies
527. I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,
528. Walks, and the melody of birds: but here
529. Far otherwise, transported I behold,
530. Transported touch; here passion first I felt,
531. Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else
532. Superiour and unmoved; here only weak
533. Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance.
534. Or Nature failed in me, and left some part
535. Not proof enough such object to sustain;
536. Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps
537. More than enough; at least on her bestowed
538. Too much of ornament, in outward show
539. Elaborate, of inward less exact.
540. For well I understand in the prime end
541. Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind
542. And inward faculties, which most excel;
543. In outward also her resembling less
544. His image who made both, and less expressing
545. The character of that dominion given
546. O'er other creatures:  Yet when I approach
547. Her loveliness, so absolute she seems
548. And in herself complete, so well to know
549. Her own, that what she wills to do or say,
550. Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:
551. All higher knowledge in her presence falls
552. Degraded;  Wisdom in discourse with her
553. Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;
554. Authority and Reason on her wait,
555. As one intended first, not after made
556. Occasionally; and, to consummate all,
557. Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat
558. Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
559. About her, as a guard angelick placed.
560. To whom the Angel with contracted brow.
561. Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;
562. Do thou but thine; and be not diffident
563. Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou
564. Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,
565. By attributing overmuch to things
566. Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.
567. For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,
568. An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well
569. Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;
570. Not thy subjection:  Weigh with her thyself;
571. Then value:  Oft-times nothing profits more
572. Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right
573. Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,
574. The more she will acknowledge thee her head,
575. And to realities yield all her shows:
576. Made so adorn for thy delight the more,
577. So awful, that with honour thou mayest love
578. Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
579. But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind
580. Is propagated, seem such dear delight
581. Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed
582. To cattle and each beast; which would not be
583. To them made common and divulged, if aught
584. Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
585. The soul of man, or passion in him move.
586. What higher in her society thou findest
587. Attractive, human, rational, love still;
588. In loving thou dost well, in passion not,
589. Wherein true love consists not:  Love refines
590. The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat
591. In reason, and is judicious; is the scale
592. By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,
593. Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,
594. Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.
595. To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.
596. Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught
597. In procreation common to all kinds,
598. (Though higher of the genial bed by far,
599. And with mysterious reverence I deem,)
600. So much delights me, as those graceful acts,
601. Those thousand decencies, that daily flow
602. From all her words and actions mixed with love
603. And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned
604. Union of mind, or in us both one soul;
605. Harmony to behold in wedded pair
606. More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.
607. Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose
608. What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,
609. Who meet with various objects, from the sense
610. Variously representing; yet, still free,
611. Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
612. To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,
613. Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;
614. Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask:
615. Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love
616. Express they? by looks only? or do they mix
617. Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?
618. To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed
619. Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue,
620. Answered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest
621. Us happy, and without love no happiness.
622. Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,
623. (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy
624. In eminence; and obstacle find none
625. Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;
626. Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,
627. Total they mix, union of pure with pure
628. Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need,
629. As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.
630. But I can now no more; the parting sun
631. Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles
632. Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.
633. Be strong, live happy, and love!  But, first of all,
634. Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep
635. His great command; take heed lest passion sway
636. Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will
637. Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,
638. The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!
639. I in thy persevering shall rejoice,
640. And all the Blest:  Stand fast;to stand or fall
641. Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.
642. Perfect within, no outward aid require;
643. And all temptation to transgress repel.
644. So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus
645. Followed with benediction.  Since to part,
646. Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,
647. Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!
648. Gentle to me and affable hath been
649. Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever
650. With grateful memory:  Thou to mankind
651. Be good and friendly still, and oft return!
652. So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven
653. From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.
