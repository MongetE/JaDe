1. O Nightingale! that on yon bloomy spray
2. Warblest at eve, when all the woods are still,
3. Thou with fresh hope the lover's heart dost fill,
4. While the jolly hours lead on propitious May.

5. Thy liquid notes that close the eye of day,
6. First heard before the shallow cuckoo's bill,
7. Portend success in love; O, if Jove's will
8. Have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay,

9. Now timely sing, ere the rude bird of hate
10. Foretell my hopeless doom in some grove nigh;
11. As thou from year to year hast sung too late

12. For my relief, yet hadst no reason why:
13. Whether the Muse, or Love, call thee his mate,
14. Both them I serve, and of their train am I.
