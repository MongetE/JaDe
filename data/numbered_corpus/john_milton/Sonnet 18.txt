1. XVIII

2. Cyriack, whose Grandsire on the Royal Bench
3. Of Brittish Themis, with no mean applause
4. Pronounc't and in his volumes taught our Lawes,
5. Which others at their Barr so often wrench:
6. To day deep thoughts resolve with me to drench
7. In mirth, that after no repenting drawes;
8. Let Euclid rest and Archimedes pause,
9. And what the Swede intend, and what the French.
10. To measure life, learn thou betimes, and know
11. Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;
12. For other things mild Heav'n a time ordains,
13. And disapproves that care, though wise in show,
14. That with superfluous burden loads the day,
15. And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.
