1. Who sickened in the time of his Vacancy, being forbid to go to London by reason of the Plague.


2. Here lies old Hobson. Death hath broke his girt,
3. And here, alas! hath laid him in the dirt;
4. Or else, the ways being foul, twenty to one
5. He’s here stuck in a slough, and overthrown.
6. ’T was such a shifter that, if truth were known,
7. Death was half glad when he had got him down;
8. For he had any time this ten years full
9. Dodged with him betwixt Cambridge and The Bull.
10. And surely Death could never have prevailed,
11. Had not his weekly course of carriage failed;
12. But lately, finding him so long at home,
13. And thinking now his journey’s end was come,
14. And that he had ta’en up his latest Inn,
15. In the kind office of a Chamberlin
16. Showed him his room where he must lodge that night,
17. Pulled off his boots, and took away the light.
18. If any ask for him, it shall be said,
19. “Hobson has supped, and ’s newly gone to bed.”
