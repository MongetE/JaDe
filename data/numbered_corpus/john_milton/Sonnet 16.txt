1. XVI

2. When I consider how my light is spent,
3. E're half my days, in this dark world and wide,
4. And that one Talent which is death to hide,
5. Lodg'd with me useless, though my Soul more bent
6. To serve therewith my Maker, and present
7. My true account, least he returning chide,
8. Doth God exact day-labour, light deny'd,
9. I fondly ask; But patience to prevent
10. That murmur, soon replies, God doth not need
11. Either man's work or his own gifts, who best
12. Bear his milde yoak, they serve him best, his State
13. Is Kingly.  Thousands at his bidding speed
14. And post o're Land and Ocean without rest:
15. They also serve who only stand and waite.
