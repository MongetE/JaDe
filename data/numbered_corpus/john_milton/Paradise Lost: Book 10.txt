1. Mean while the heinous and despiteful act
2. Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how
3. He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve,
4. Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit,
5. Was known in Heaven; for what can 'scape the eye
6. Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart
7. Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just,
8. Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind
9. Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed,
10. Complete to have discovered and repulsed
11. Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.
12. For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered,
13. The high injunction, not to taste that fruit,
14. Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,
15. (Incurred what could they less?) the penalty;
16. And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.
17. Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste
18. The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad,
19. For Man; for of his state by this they knew,
20. Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen
21. Entrance unseen.  Soon as the unwelcome news
22. From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased
23. All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare
24. That time celestial visages, yet, mixed
25. With pity, violated not their bliss.
26. About the new-arrived, in multitudes
27. The ethereal people ran, to hear and know
28. How all befel:  They towards the throne supreme,
29. Accountable, made haste, to make appear,
30. With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance
31. And easily approved; when the Most High
32. Eternal Father, from his secret cloud,
33. Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.
34. Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned
35. From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed,
36. Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth,
37. Which your sincerest care could not prevent;
38. Foretold so lately what would come to pass,
39. When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.
40. I told ye then he should prevail, and speed
41. On his bad errand; Man should be seduced,
42. And flattered out of all, believing lies
43. Against his Maker; no decree of mine
44. Concurring to necessitate his fall,
45. Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
46. His free will, to her own inclining left
47. In even scale.  But fallen he is; and now
48. What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass
49. On his transgression,--death denounced that day?
50. Which he presumes already vain and void,
51. Because not yet inflicted, as he feared,
52. By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find
53. Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end.
54. Justice shall not return as bounty scorned.
55. But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee,
56. Vicegerent Son?  To thee I have transferred
57. All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.
58. Easy it may be seen that I intend
59. Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee
60. Man's friend, his Mediator, his designed
61. Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary,
62. And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.
63. So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright
64. Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son
65. Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full
66. Resplendent all his Father manifest
67. Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.
68. Father Eternal, thine is to decree;
69. Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will
70. Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved,
71. Mayest ever rest well pleased.  I go to judge
72. On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest,
73. Whoever judged, the worst on me must light,
74. When time shall be; for so I undertook
75. Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain
76. Of right, that I may mitigate their doom
77. On me derived; yet I shall temper so
78. Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most
79. Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
80. Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none
81. Are to behold the judgement, but the judged,
82. Those two; the third best absent is condemned,
83. Convict by flight, and rebel to all law:
84. Conviction to the serpent none belongs.
85. Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose
86. Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers,
87. Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant,
88. Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence
89. Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.
90. Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods
91. Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.
92. Now was the sun in western cadence low
93. From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour,
94. To fan the earth now waked, and usher in
95. The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool,
96. Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both,
97. To sentence Man:  The voice of God they heard
98. Now walking in the garden, by soft winds
99. Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard,
100. And from his presence hid themselves among
101. The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God,
102. Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.
103. Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet
104. My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,
105. Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude,
106. Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought:
107. Or come I less conspicuous, or what change
108. Absents thee, or what chance detains?--Come forth!
109. He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first
110. To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed;
111. Love was not in their looks, either to God,
112. Or to each other; but apparent guilt,
113. And shame, and perturbation, and despair,
114. Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.
115. Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.
116. I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice
117. Afraid, being naked, hid myself.  To whom
118. The gracious Judge without revile replied.
119. My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared,
120. But still rejoiced; how is it now become
121. So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked, who
122. Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree,
123. Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?
124. To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.
125. O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand
126. Before my Judge; either to undergo
127. Myself the total crime, or to accuse
128. My other self, the partner of my life;
129. Whose failing, while her faith to me remains,
130. I should conceal, and not expose to blame
131. By my complaint: but strict necessity
132. Subdues me, and calamitous constraint;
133. Lest on my head both sin and punishment,
134. However insupportable, be all
135. Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou
136. Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.--
137. This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help,
138. And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good,
139. So fit, so acceptable, so divine,
140. That from her hand I could suspect no ill,
141. And what she did, whatever in itself,
142. Her doing seemed to justify the deed;
143. She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
144. To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.
145. Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey
146. Before his voice? or was she made thy guide,
147. Superiour, or but equal, that to her
148. Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place
149. Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,
150. And for thee, whose perfection far excelled
151. Hers in all real dignity?  Adorned
152. She was indeed, and lovely, to attract
153. Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts
154. Were such, as under government well seemed;
155. Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part
156. And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.
157. So having said, he thus to Eve in few.
158. Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?
159. To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed,
160. Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge
161. Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.
162. The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.
163. Which when the Lord God heard, without delay
164. To judgement he proceeded on the accused
165. Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer
166. The guilt on him, who made him instrument
167. Of mischief, and polluted from the end
168. Of his creation; justly then accursed,
169. As vitiated in nature:  More to know
170. Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew)
171. Nor altered his offence; yet God at last
172. To Satan first in sin his doom applied,
173. Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:
174. And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.
175. Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed
176. Above all cattle, each beast of the field;
177. Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go,
178. And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.
179. Between thee and the woman I will put
180. Enmity, and between thine and her seed;
181. Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.
182. So spake this oracle, then verified
183. When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve,
184. Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven,
185. Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave
186. Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed
187. In open show; and, with ascension bright,
188. Captivity led captive through the air,
189. The realm itself of Satan, long usurped;
190. Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;
191. Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise;
192. And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.
193. Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply
194. By thy conception; children thou shalt bring
195. In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will
196. Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.
197. On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.
198. Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,
199. And eaten of the tree, concerning which
200. I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof:
201. Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow
202. Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life;
203. Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
204. Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
205. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
206. Till thou return unto the ground; for thou
207. Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth,
208. For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.
209. So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent;
210. And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day,
211. Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood
212. Before him naked to the air, that now
213. Must suffer change, disdained not to begin
214. Thenceforth the form of servant to assume;
215. As when he washed his servants feet; so now,
216. As father of his family, he clad
217. Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain,
218. Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid;
219. And thought not much to clothe his enemies;
220. Nor he their outward only with the skins
221. Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.
222. Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness,
223. Arraying, covered from his Father's sight.
224. To him with swift ascent he up returned,
225. Into his blissful bosom reassumed
226. In glory, as of old; to him appeased
227. All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man
228. Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
229. Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,
230. Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death,
231. In counterview within the gates, that now
232. Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame
233. Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,
234. Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.
235. O Son, why sit we here each other viewing
236. Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives
237. In other worlds, and happier seat provides
238. For us, his offspring dear?  It cannot be
239. But that success attends him; if mishap,
240. Ere this he had returned, with fury driven
241. By his avengers; since no place like this
242. Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
243. Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,
244. Wings growing, and dominion given me large
245. Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on,
246. Or sympathy, or some connatural force,
247. Powerful at greatest distance to unite,
248. With secret amity, things of like kind,
249. By secretest conveyance.  Thou, my shade
250. Inseparable, must with me along;
251. For Death from Sin no power can separate.
252. But, lest the difficulty of passing back
253. Stay his return perhaps over this gulf
254. Impassable, impervious; let us try
255. Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine
256. Not unagreeable, to found a path
257. Over this main from Hell to that new world,
258. Where Satan now prevails; a monument
259. Of merit high to all the infernal host,
260. Easing their passage hence, for intercourse,
261. Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.
262. Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn
263. By this new-felt attraction and instinct.
264. Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.
265. Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong,
266. Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err
267. The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw
268. Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste
269. The savour of death from all things there that live:
270. Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
271. Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.
272. So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell
273. Of mortal change on earth.  As when a flock
274. Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote,
275. Against the day of battle, to a field,
276. Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured
277. With scent of living carcasses designed
278. For death, the following day, in bloody fight:
279. So scented the grim Feature, and upturned
280. His nostril wide into the murky air;
281. Sagacious of his quarry from so far.
282. Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste
283. Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark,
284. Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great)
285. Hovering upon the waters, what they met
286. Solid or slimy, as in raging sea
287. Tost up and down, together crouded drove,
288. From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell;
289. As when two polar winds, blowing adverse
290. Upon the Cronian sea, together drive
291. Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way
292. Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich
293. Cathaian coast.  The aggregated soil
294. Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry,
295. As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm
296. As Delos, floating once; the rest his look
297. Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move;
298. And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate,
299. Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach
300. They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on
301. Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge
302. Of length prodigious, joining to the wall
303. Immoveable of this now fenceless world,
304. Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,
305. Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.
306. So, if great things to small may be compared,
307. Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke,
308. From Susa, his Memnonian palace high,
309. Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont
310. Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,
311. And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.
312. Now had they brought the work by wonderous art
313. Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock,
314. Over the vexed abyss, following the track
315. Of Satan to the self-same place where he
316. First lighted from his wing, and landed safe
317. From out of Chaos, to the outside bare
318. Of this round world:  With pins of adamant
319. And chains they made all fast, too fast they made
320. And durable!  And now in little space
321. The confines met of empyrean Heaven,
322. And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell
323. With long reach interposed; three several ways
324. In sight, to each of these three places led.
325. And now their way to Earth they had descried,
326. To Paradise first tending; when, behold!
327. Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright,
328. Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
329. His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose:
330. Disguised he came; but those his children dear
331. Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.
332. He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk
333. Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape,
334. To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act
335. By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded
336. Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought
337. Vain covertures; but when he saw descend
338. The Son of God to judge them, terrified
339. He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun
340. The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath
341. Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned
342. By night, and listening where the hapless pair
343. Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint,
344. Thence gathered his own doom; which understood
345. Not instant, but of future time, with joy
346. And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned;
347. And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot
348. Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped
349. Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.
350. Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight
351. Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased.
352. Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair
353. Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.
354. O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds,
355. Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own;
356. Thou art their author, and prime architect:
357. For I no sooner in my heart divined,
358. My heart, which by a secret harmony
359. Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,
360. That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks
361. Now also evidence, but straight I felt,
362. Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt,
363. That I must after thee, with this thy son;
364. Such fatal consequence unites us three!
365. Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds,
366. Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
367. Detain from following thy illustrious track.
368. Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined
369. Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered
370. To fortify thus far, and overlay,
371. With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.
372. Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won
373. What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained
374. With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged
375. Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign,
376. There didst not; there let him still victor sway,
377. As battle hath adjudged; from this new world
378. Retiring, by his own doom alienated;
379. And henceforth monarchy with thee divide
380. Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds,
381. His quadrature, from thy orbicular world;
382. Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.
383. Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.
384. Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both;
385. High proof ye now have given to be the race
386. Of Satan (for I glory in the name,
387. Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King,)
388. Amply have merited of me, of all
389. The infernal empire, that so near Heaven's door
390. Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
391. Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm,
392. Hell and this world, one realm, one continent
393. Of easy thorough-fare.  Therefore, while I
394. Descend through darkness, on your road with ease,
395. To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
396. With these successes, and with them rejoice;
397. You two this way, among these numerous orbs,
398. All yours, right down to Paradise descend;
399. There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth
400. Dominion exercise and in the air,
401. Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared;
402. Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
403. My substitutes I send ye, and create
404. Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might
405. Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now
406. My hold of this new kingdom all depends,
407. Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.
408. If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell
409. No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!
410. So saying he dismissed them; they with speed
411. Their course through thickest constellations held,
412. Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan,
413. And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse
414. Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down
415. The causey to Hell-gate:  On either side
416. Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,
417. And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,
418. That scorned his indignation:  Through the gate,
419. Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,
420. And all about found desolate; for those,
421. Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,
422. Flown to the upper world; the rest were all
423. Far to the inland retired, about the walls
424. Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat
425. Of Lucifer, so by allusion called
426. Of that bright star to Satan paragoned;
427. There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand
428. In council sat, solicitous what chance
429. Might intercept their emperour sent; so he
430. Departing gave command, and they observed.
431. As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,
432. By Astracan, over the snowy plains,
433. Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns
434. Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond
435. The realm of Aladule, in his retreat
436. To Tauris or Casbeen:  So these, the late
437. Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell
438. Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch
439. Round their metropolis; and now expecting
440. Each hour their great adventurer, from the search
441. Of foreign worlds:  He through the midst unmarked,
442. In show plebeian Angel militant
443. Of lowest order, passed; and from the door
444. Of that Plutonian hall, invisible
445. Ascended his high throne; which, under state
446. Of richest texture spread, at the upper end
447. Was placed in regal lustre.  Down a while
448. He sat, and round about him saw unseen:
449. At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head
450. And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad
451. With what permissive glory since his fall
452. Was left him, or false glitter:  All amazed
453. At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
454. Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,
455. Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim:
456. Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers,
457. Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy
458. Congratulant approached him; who with hand
459. Silence, and with these words attention, won.
460. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;
461. For in possession such, not only of right,
462. I call ye, and declare ye now; returned
463. Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth
464. Triumphant out of this infernal pit
465. Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,
466. And dungeon of our tyrant:  Now possess,
467. As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven
468. Little inferiour, by my adventure hard
469. With peril great achieved.  Long were to tell
470. What I have done; what suffered;with what pain
471. Voyaged th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep
472. Of horrible confusion; over which
473. By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved,
474. To expedite your glorious march; but I
475. Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride
476. The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb
477. Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild;
478. That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed
479. My journey strange, with clamorous uproar
480. Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found
481. The new created world, which fame in Heaven
482. Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful
483. Of absolute perfection! therein Man
484. Placed in a Paradise, by our exile
485. Made happy:  Him by fraud I have seduced
486. From his Creator; and, the more to encrease
487. Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat
488. Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up
489. Both his beloved Man, and all his world,
490. To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,
491. Without our hazard, labour, or alarm;
492. To range in, and to dwell, and over Man
493. To rule, as over all he should have ruled.
494. True is, me also he hath judged, or rather
495. Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape
496. Man I deceived: that which to me belongs,
497. Is enmity which he will put between
498. Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel;
499. His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:
500. A world who would not purchase with a bruise,
501. Or much more grievous pain?--Ye have the account
502. Of my performance:  What remains, ye Gods,
503. But up, and enter now into full bliss?
504. So having said, a while he stood, expecting
505. Their universal shout, and high applause,
506. To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears
507. On all sides, from innumerable tongues,
508. A dismal universal hiss, the sound
509. Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long
510. Had leisure, wondering at himself now more,
511. His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare;
512. His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining
513. Each other, till supplanted down he fell
514. A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,
515. Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power
516. Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,
517. According to his doom: he would have spoke,
518. But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
519. To forked tongue; for now were all transformed
520. Alike, to serpents all, as accessories
521. To his bold riot:  Dreadful was the din
522. Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now
523. With complicated monsters head and tail,
524. Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire,
525. Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear,
526. And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil
527. Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle
528. Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst,
529. Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun
530. Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime,
531. Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed
532. Above the rest still to retain; they all
533. Him followed, issuing forth to the open field,
534. Where all yet left of that revolted rout,
535. Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array;
536. Sublime with expectation when to see
537. In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;
538. They saw, but other sight instead! a croud
539. Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell,
540. And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw,
541. They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms,
542. Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast;
543. And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form
544. Catched, by contagion; like in punishment,
545. As in their crime.  Thus was the applause they meant,
546. Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame
547. Cast on themselves from their own mouths.  There stood
548. A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,
549. His will who reigns above, to aggravate
550. Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that
551. Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve
552. Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange
553. Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining
554. For one forbidden tree a multitude
555. Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;
556. Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,
557. Though to delude them sent, could not abstain;
558. But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees
559. Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks
560. That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked
561. The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew
562. Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed;
563. This more delusive, not the touch, but taste
564. Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay
565. Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit
566. Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste
567. With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,
568. Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,
569. With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws,
570. With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell
571. Into the same illusion, not as Man
572. Whom they triumphed once lapsed.  Thus were they plagued
573. And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss,
574. Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed;
575. Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo,
576. This annual humbling certain numbered days,
577. To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.
578. However, some tradition they dispersed
579. Among the Heathen, of their purchase got,
580. And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called
581. Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide--
582. Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule
583. Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven
584. And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.
585. Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
586. Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before,
587. Once actual; now in body, and to dwell
588. Habitual habitant; behind her Death,
589. Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
590. On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.
591. Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!
592. What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned
593. With travel difficult, not better far
594. Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch,
595. Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?
596. Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.
597. To me, who with eternal famine pine,
598. Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven;
599. There best, where most with ravine I may meet;
600. Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
601. To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.
602. To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.
603. Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,
604. Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl;
605. No homely morsels! and, whatever thing
606. The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared;
607. Till I, in Man residing, through the race,
608. His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect;
609. And season him thy last and sweetest prey.
610. This said, they both betook them several ways,
611. Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
612. All kinds, and for destruction to mature
613. Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing,
614. From his transcendent seat the Saints among,
615. To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.
616. See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
617. To waste and havock yonder world, which I
618. So fair and good created; and had still
619. Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man
620. Let in these wasteful furies, who impute
621. Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell
622. And his adherents, that with so much ease
623. I suffer them to enter and possess
624. A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem
625. To gratify my scornful enemies,
626. That laugh, as if, transported with some fit
627. Of passion, I to them had quitted all,
628. At random yielded up to their misrule;
629. And know not that I called, and drew them thither,
630. My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth
631. Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed
632. On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst
633. With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling
634. Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son,
635. Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last,
636. Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell
637. For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.
638. Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
639. To sanctity, that shall receive no stain:
640. Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.
641. He ended, and the heavenly audience loud
642. Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas,
643. Through multitude that sung:  Just are thy ways,
644. Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works;
645. Who can extenuate thee?  Next, to the Son,
646. Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom
647. New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise,
648. Or down from Heaven descend.--Such was their song;
649. While the Creator, calling forth by name
650. His mighty Angels, gave them several charge,
651. As sorted best with present things.  The sun
652. Had first his precept so to move, so shine,
653. As might affect the earth with cold and heat
654. Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call
655. Decrepit winter; from the south to bring
656. Solstitial summer's heat.  To the blanc moon
657. Her office they prescribed; to the other five
658. Their planetary motions, and aspects,
659. In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,
660. Of noxious efficacy, and when to join
661. In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed
662. Their influence malignant when to shower,
663. Which of them rising with the sun, or falling,
664. Should prove tempestuous:  To the winds they set
665. Their corners, when with bluster to confound
666. Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll
667. With terrour through the dark aereal hall.
668. Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse
669. The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more,
670. From the sun's axle; they with labour pushed
671. Oblique the centrick globe:  Some say, the sun
672. Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
673. Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven
674. Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,
675. Up to the Tropick Crab: thence down amain
676. By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,
677. As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change
678. Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring
679. Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers,
680. Equal in days and nights, except to those
681. Beyond the polar circles; to them day
682. Had unbenighted shone, while the low sun,
683. To recompense his distance, in their sight
684. Had rounded still the horizon, and not known
685. Or east or west; which had forbid the snow
686. From cold Estotiland, and south as far
687. Beneath Magellan.  At that tasted fruit
688. The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned
689. His course intended; else, how had the world
690. Inhabited, though sinless, more than now,
691. Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
692. These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced
693. Like change on sea and land; sideral blast,
694. Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot,
695. Corrupt and pestilent:  Now from the north
696. Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore,
697. Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice,
698. And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw,
699. Boreas, and Caecias, and Argestes loud,
700. And Thrascias, rend the woods, and seas upturn;
701. With adverse blast upturns them from the south
702. Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds
703. From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce,
704. Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds,
705. Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise,
706. Sirocco and Libecchio.  Thus began
707. Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first,
708. Daughter of Sin, among the irrational
709. Death introduced, through fierce antipathy:
710. Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl,
711. And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving,
712. Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe
713. Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim,
714. Glared on him passing.  These were from without
715. The growing miseries, which Adam saw
716. Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,
717. To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within;
718. And, in a troubled sea of passion tost,
719. Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.
720. O miserable of happy!  Is this the end
721. Of this new glorious world, and me so late
722. The glory of that glory, who now become
723. Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face
724. Of God, whom to behold was then my highth
725. Of happiness!--Yet well, if here would end
726. The misery; I deserved it, and would bear
727. My own deservings; but this will not serve:
728. All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,
729. Is propagated curse.  O voice, once heard
730. Delightfully, Encrease and multiply;
731. Now death to hear! for what can I encrease,
732. Or multiply, but curses on my head?
733. Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling
734. The evil on him brought by me, will curse
735. My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure,
736. For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks
737. Shall be the execration: so, besides
738. Mine own that bide upon me, all from me
739. Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound;
740. On me, as on their natural center, light
741. Heavy, though in their place.  O fleeting joys
742. Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!
743. Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay
744. To mould me Man? did I solicit thee
745. From darkness to promote me, or here place
746. In this delicious garden?  As my will
747. Concurred not to my being, it were but right
748. And equal to reduce me to my dust;
749. Desirous to resign and render back
750. All I received; unable to perform
751. Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold
752. The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,
753. Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added
754. The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable
755. Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out
756. To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet
757. Mortality my sentence, and be earth
758. Insensible!  How glad would lay me down
759. As in my mother's lap!  There I should rest,
760. And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more
761. Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse
762. To me, and to my offspring, would torment me
763. With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt
764. Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die;
765. Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man
766. Which God inspired, cannot together perish
767. With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave,
768. Or in some other dismal place, who knows
769. But I shall die a living death?  O thought
770. Horrid, if true!  Yet why? It was but breath
771. Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life
772. And sin?  The body properly had neither,
773. All of me then shall die: let this appease
774. The doubt, since human reach no further knows.
775. For though the Lord of all be infinite,
776. Is his wrath also?  Be it, Man is not so,
777. But mortal doomed.  How can he exercise
778. Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?
779. Can he make deathless death?  That were to make
780. Strange contradiction, which to God himself
781. Impossible is held; as argument
782. Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out,
783. For anger's sake, finite to infinite,
784. In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour,
785. Satisfied never?  That were to extend
786. His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law;
787. By which all causes else, according still
788. To the reception of their matter, act;
789. Not to the extent of their own sphere.  But say
790. That death be not one stroke, as I supposed,
791. Bereaving sense, but endless misery
792. From this day onward; which I feel begun
793. Both in me, and without me; and so last
794. To perpetuity;--Ay me!that fear
795. Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
796. On my defenceless head; both Death and I
797. Am found eternal, and incorporate both;
798. Nor I on my part single; in me all
799. Posterity stands cursed:  Fair patrimony
800. That I must leave ye, Sons!  O, were I able
801. To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!
802. So disinherited, how would you bless
803. Me, now your curse!  Ah, why should all mankind,
804. For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned,
805. It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed,
806. But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved
807. Not to do only, but to will the same
808. With me?  How can they then acquitted stand
809. In sight of God?  Him, after all disputes,
810. Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain,
811. And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still
812. But to my own conviction: first and last
813. On me, me only, as the source and spring
814. Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;
815. So might the wrath!  Fond wish!couldst thou support
816. That burden, heavier than the earth to bear;
817. Than all the world much heavier, though divided
818. With that bad Woman?  Thus, what thou desirest,
819. And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope
820. Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable
821. Beyond all past example and future;
822. To Satan only like both crime and doom.
823. O Conscience! into what abyss of fears
824. And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which
825. I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!
826. Thus Adam to himself lamented loud,
827. Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell,
828. Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air
829. Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom;
830. Which to his evil conscience represented
831. All things with double terrour:  On the ground
832. Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft
833. Cursed his creation;  Death as oft accused
834. Of tardy execution, since denounced
835. The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,
836. Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke
837. To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
838. Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
839. But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine
840. Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries,
841. O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!
842. With other echo late I taught your shades
843. To answer, and resound far other song.--
844. Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,
845. Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,
846. Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:
847. But her with stern regard he thus repelled.
848. Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best
849. Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false
850. And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,
851. Like his, and colour serpentine, may show
852. Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee
853. Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended
854. To hellish falshood, snare them!  But for thee
855. I had persisted happy; had not thy pride
856. And wandering vanity, when least was safe,
857. Rejected my forewarning, and disdained
858. Not to be trusted; longing to be seen,
859. Though by the Devil himself; him overweening
860. To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting,
861. Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee
862. To trust thee from my side; imagined wise,
863. Constant, mature, proof against all assaults;
864. And understood not all was but a show,
865. Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib
866. Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,
867. More to the part sinister, from me drawn;
868. Well if thrown out, as supernumerary
869. To my just number found.  O! why did God,
870. Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven
871. With Spirits masculine, create at last
872. This novelty on earth, this fair defect
873. Of nature, and not fill the world at once
874. With Men, as Angels, without feminine;
875. Or find some other way to generate
876. Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen,
877. And more that shall befall; innumerable
878. Disturbances on earth through female snares,
879. And strait conjunction with this sex: for either
880. He never shall find out fit mate, but such
881. As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;
882. Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
883. Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained
884. By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld
885. By parents; or his happiest choice too late
886. Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound
887. To a fell adversary, his hate or shame:
888. Which infinite calamity shall cause
889. To human life, and houshold peace confound.
890. He added not, and from her turned; but Eve,
891. Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing
892. And tresses all disordered, at his feet
893. Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought
894. His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.
895. Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven
896. What love sincere, and reverence in my heart
897. I bear thee, and unweeting have offended,
898. Unhappily deceived!  Thy suppliant
899. I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,
900. Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
901. Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress,
902. My only strength and stay:  Forlorn of thee,
903. Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
904. While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,
905. Between us two let there be peace; both joining,
906. As joined in injuries, one enmity
907. Against a foe by doom express assigned us,
908. That cruel Serpent:  On me exercise not
909. Thy hatred for this misery befallen;
910. On me already lost, me than thyself
911. More miserable!  Both have sinned;but thou
912. Against God only; I against God and thee;
913. And to the place of judgement will return,
914. There with my cries importune Heaven; that all
915. The sentence, from thy head removed, may light
916. On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe;
917. Me, me only, just object of his ire!
918. She ended weeping; and her lowly plight,
919. Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault
920. Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought
921. Commiseration:  Soon his heart relented
922. Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,
923. Now at his feet submissive in distress;
924. Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,
925. His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid:
926. As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,
927. And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.
928. Unwary, and too desirous, as before,
929. So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest
930. The punishment all on thyself; alas!
931. Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain
932. His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part,
933. And my displeasure bearest so ill.  If prayers
934. Could alter high decrees, I to that place
935. Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,
936. That on my head all might be visited;
937. Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven,
938. To me committed, and by me exposed.
939. But rise;--let us no more contend, nor blame
940. Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive
941. In offices of love, how we may lighten
942. Each other's burden, in our share of woe;
943. Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see,
944. Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil;
945. A long day's dying, to augment our pain;
946. And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived.
947. To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.
948. Adam, by sad experiment I know
949. How little weight my words with thee can find,
950. Found so erroneous; thence by just event
951. Found so unfortunate:  Nevertheless,
952. Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place
953. Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain
954. Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart
955. Living or dying, from thee I will not hide
956. What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen,
957. Tending to some relief of our extremes,
958. Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,
959. As in our evils, and of easier choice.
960. If care of our descent perplex us most,
961. Which must be born to certain woe, devoured
962. By Death at last; and miserable it is
963. To be to others cause of misery,
964. Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring
965. Into this cursed world a woeful race,
966. That after wretched life must be at last
967. Food for so foul a monster; in thy power
968. It lies, yet ere conception to prevent
969. The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
970. Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death
971. Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two
972. Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.
973. But if thou judge it hard and difficult,
974. Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain
975. From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet;
976. And with desire to languish without hope,
977. Before the present object languishing
978. With like desire; which would be misery
979. And torment less than none of what we dread;
980. Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free
981. From what we fear for both, let us make short, --
982. Let us seek Death; -- or, he not found, supply
983. With our own hands his office on ourselves:
984. Why stand we longer shivering under fears,
985. That show no end but death, and have the power,
986. Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,
987. Destruction with destruction to destroy? --
988. She ended here, or vehement despair
989. Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts
990. Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.
991. But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed,
992. To better hopes his more attentive mind
993. Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.
994. Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
995. To argue in thee something more sublime
996. And excellent, than what thy mind contemns;
997. But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes
998. That excellence thought in thee; and implies,
999. Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret
1000. For loss of life and pleasure overloved.
1001. Or if thou covet death, as utmost end
1002. Of misery, so thinking to evade
1003. The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God
1004. Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so
1005. To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death,
1006. So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain
1007. We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts
1008. Of contumacy will provoke the Highest
1009. To make death in us live:  Then let us seek
1010. Some safer resolution, which methinks
1011. I have in view, calling to mind with heed
1012. Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise
1013. The Serpent's head; piteous amends! unless
1014. Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe,
1015. Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived
1016. Against us this deceit:  To crush his head
1017. Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost
1018. By death brought on ourselves, or childless days
1019. Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe
1020. Shal 'scape his punishment ordained, and we
1021. Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
1022. No more be mentioned then of violence
1023. Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness,
1024. That cuts us off from hope; and savours only
1025. Rancour and pride, impatience and despite,
1026. Reluctance against God and his just yoke
1027. Laid on our necks.  Remember with what mild
1028. And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,
1029. Without wrath or reviling; we expected
1030. Immediate dissolution, which we thought
1031. Was meant by death that day; when lo!to thee
1032. Pains only in child-bearing were foretold,
1033. And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy,
1034. Fruit of thy womb:  On me the curse aslope
1035. Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn
1036. My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse;
1037. My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold
1038. Or heat should injure us, his timely care
1039. Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands
1040. Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged;
1041. How much more, if we pray him, will his ear
1042. Be open, and his heart to pity incline,
1043. And teach us further by what means to shun
1044. The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!
1045. Which now the sky, with various face, begins
1046. To show us in this mountain; while the winds
1047. Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks
1048. Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek
1049. Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish
1050. Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star
1051. Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams
1052. Reflected may with matter sere foment;
1053. Or, by collision of two bodies, grind
1054. The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds
1055. Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock,
1056. Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down
1057. Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine;
1058. And sends a comfortable heat from far,
1059. Which might supply the sun:  Such fire to use,
1060. And what may else be remedy or cure
1061. To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,
1062. He will instruct us praying, and of grace
1063. Beseeching him; so as we need not fear
1064. To pass commodiously this life, sustained
1065. By him with many comforts, till we end
1066. In dust, our final rest and native home.
1067. What better can we do, than, to the place
1068. Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall
1069. Before him reverent; and there confess
1070. Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears
1071. Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air
1072. Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
1073. Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
