1. Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name
2. If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine
3. Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,
4. Above the flight of Pegasean wing!
5. The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou
6. Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
7. Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born,
8. Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,
9. Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse,
10. Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play
11. In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased
12. With thy celestial song.  Up led by thee
13. Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,
14. An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,
15. Thy tempering: with like safety guided down
16. Return me to my native element:
17. Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once
18. Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,)
19. Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,
20. Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.
21. Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound
22. Within the visible diurnal sphere;
23. Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole,
24. More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged
25. To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
26. On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;
27. In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,
28. And solitude; yet not alone, while thou
29. Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn
30. Purples the east: still govern thou my song,
31. Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
32. But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
33. Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race
34. Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard
35. In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears
36. To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned
37. Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend
38. Her son.  So fail not thou, who thee implores:
39. For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.
40. Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,
41. The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned
42. Adam, by dire example, to beware
43. Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven
44. To those apostates; lest the like befall
45. In Paradise to Adam or his race,
46. Charged not to touch the interdicted tree,
47. If they transgress, and slight that sole command,
48. So easily obeyed amid the choice
49. Of all tastes else to please their appetite,
50. Though wandering.  He, with his consorted Eve,
51. The story heard attentive, and was filled
52. With admiration and deep muse, to hear
53. Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought
54. So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven,
55. And war so near the peace of God in bliss,
56. With such confusion: but the evil, soon
57. Driven back, redounded as a flood on those
58. From whom it sprung; impossible to mix
59. With blessedness.  Whence Adam soon repealed
60. The doubts that in his heart arose: and now
61. Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know
62. What nearer might concern him, how this world
63. Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began;
64. When, and whereof created; for what cause;
65. What within Eden, or without, was done
66. Before his memory; as one whose drouth
67. Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,
68. Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,
69. Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.
70. Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,
71. Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed,
72. Divine interpreter! by favour sent
73. Down from the empyrean, to forewarn
74. Us timely of what might else have been our loss,
75. Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach;
76. For which to the infinitely Good we owe
77. Immortal thanks, and his admonishment
78. Receive, with solemn purpose to observe
79. Immutably his sovran will, the end
80. Of what we are.  But since thou hast vouchsafed
81. Gently, for our instruction, to impart
82. Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned
83. Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,
84. Deign to descend now lower, and relate
85. What may no less perhaps avail us known,
86. How first began this Heaven which we behold
87. Distant so high, with moving fires adorned
88. Innumerable; and this which yields or fills
89. All space, the ambient air wide interfused
90. Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause
91. Moved the Creator, in his holy rest
92. Through all eternity, so late to build
93. In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon
94. Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold
95. What we, not to explore the secrets ask
96. Of his eternal empire, but the more
97. To magnify his works, the more we know.
98. And the great light of day yet wants to run
99. Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven,
100. Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears,
101. And longer will delay to hear thee tell
102. His generation, and the rising birth
103. Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
104. Or if the star of evening and the moon
105. Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,
106. Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch;
107. Or we can bid his absence, till thy song
108. End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.
109. Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought:
110. And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.
111. This also thy request, with caution asked,
112. Obtain; though to recount almighty works
113. What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
114. Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
115. Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve
116. To glorify the Maker, and infer
117. Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
118. Thy hearing; such commission from above
119. I have received, to answer thy desire
120. Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain
121. To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope
122. Things not revealed, which the invisible King,
123. Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night;
124. To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
125. Enough is left besides to search and know.
126. But knowledge is as food, and needs no less
127. Her temperance over appetite, to know
128. In measure what the mind may well contain;
129. Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns
130. Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.
131. Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven
132. (So call him, brighter once amidst the host
133. Of Angels, than that star the stars among,)
134. Fell with his flaming legions through the deep
135. Into his place, and the great Son returned
136. Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent
137. Eternal Father from his throne beheld
138. Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.
139. At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought
140. All like himself rebellious, by whose aid
141. This inaccessible high strength, the seat
142. Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,
143. He trusted to have seised, and into fraud
144. Drew many, whom their place knows here no more:
145. Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,
146. Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains
147. Number sufficient to possess her realms
148. Though wide, and this high temple to frequent
149. With ministeries due, and solemn rites:
150. But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm
151. Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven,
152. My damage fondly deemed, I can repair
153. That detriment, if such it be to lose
154. Self-lost; and in a moment will create
155. Another world, out of one man a race
156. Of men innumerable, there to dwell,
157. Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised,
158. They open to themselves at length the way
159. Up hither, under long obedience tried;
160. And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,
161. One kingdom, joy and union without end.
162. Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;
163. And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
164. This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!
165. My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee
166. I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep
167. Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth;
168. Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill
169. Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
170. Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,
171. And put not forth my goodness, which is free
172. To act or not, Necessity and Chance
173. Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.
174. So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake
175. His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
176. Immediate are the acts of God, more swift
177. Than time or motion, but to human ears
178. Cannot without process of speech be told,
179. So told as earthly notion can receive.
180. Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,
181. When such was heard declared the Almighty's will;
182. Glory they sung to the Most High, good will
183. To future men, and in their dwellings peace;
184. Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire
185. Had driven out the ungodly from his sight
186. And the habitations of the just; to Him
187. Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained
188. Good out of evil to create; instead
189. Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring
190. Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse
191. His good to worlds and ages infinite.
192. So sang the Hierarchies:  Mean while the Son
193. On his great expedition now appeared,
194. Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned
195. Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love
196. Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
197. About his chariot numberless were poured
198. Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones,
199. And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged
200. From the armoury of God; where stand of old
201. Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged
202. Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,
203. Celestial equipage; and now came forth
204. Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,
205. Attendant on their Lord:  Heaven opened wide
206. Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound
207. On golden hinges moving, to let forth
208. The King of Glory, in his powerful Word
209. And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.
210. On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore
211. They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
212. Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,
213. Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
214. And surging waves, as mountains, to assault
215. Heaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole.
216. Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace,
217. Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!
218. Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim
219. Uplifted, in paternal glory rode
220. Far into Chaos, and the world unborn;
221. For Chaos heard his voice:  Him all his train
222. Followed in bright procession, to behold
223. Creation, and the wonders of his might.
224. Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand
225. He took the golden compasses, prepared
226. In God's eternal store, to circumscribe
227. This universe, and all created things:
228. One foot he centered, and the other turned
229. Round through the vast profundity obscure;
230. And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,
231. This be thy just circumference, O World!
232. Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,
233. Matter unformed and void:  Darkness profound
234. Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm
235. His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
236. And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
237. Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged
238. The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,
239. Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed
240. Like things to like; the rest to several place
241. Disparted, and between spun out the air;
242. And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.
243. Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light
244. Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,
245. Sprung from the deep; and from her native east
246. To journey through the aery gloom began,
247. Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun
248. Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle
249. Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good;
250. And light from darkness by the hemisphere
251. Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night,
252. He named.  Thus was the first day even and morn:
253. Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
254. By the celestial quires, when orient light
255. Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;
256. Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout
257. The hollow universal orb they filled,
258. And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised
259. God and his works; Creator him they sung,
260. Both when first evening was, and when first morn.
261. Again, God said,  Let there be firmament
262. Amid the waters, and let it divide
263. The waters from the waters; and God made
264. The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
265. Transparent, elemental air, diffused
266. In circuit to the uttermost convex
267. Of this great round; partition firm and sure,
268. The waters underneath from those above
269. Dividing: for as earth, so he the world
270. Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide
271. Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule
272. Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes
273. Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
274. And Heaven he named the Firmament:  So even
275. And morning chorus sung the second day.
276. The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet
277. Of waters, embryon immature involved,
278. Appeared not: over all the face of Earth
279. Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm
280. Prolifick humour softening all her globe,
281. Fermented the great mother to conceive,
282. Satiate with genial moisture; when God said,
283. Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven
284. Into one place, and let dry land appear.
285. Immediately the mountains huge appear
286. Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave
287. Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky:
288. So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low
289. Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
290. Capacious bed of waters:  Thither they
291. Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,
292. As drops on dust conglobing from the dry:
293. Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,
294. For haste; such flight the great command impressed
295. On the swift floods:  As armies at the call
296. Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)
297. Troop to their standard; so the watery throng,
298. Wave rolling after wave, where way they found,
299. If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,
300. Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;
301. But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
302. With serpent errour wandering, found their way,
303. And on the washy oose deep channels wore;
304. Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,
305. All but within those banks, where rivers now
306. Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
307. The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle
308. Of congregated waters, he called Seas:
309. And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth
310. Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,
311. And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,
312. Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.
313. He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then
314. Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,
315. Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad
316. Her universal face with pleasant green;
317. Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered
318. Opening their various colours, and made gay
319. Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,
320. Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept
321. The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed
322. Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,
323. And bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last
324. Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread
325. Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed
326. Their blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned;
327. With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side;
328. With borders long the rivers: that Earth now
329. Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,
330. Or wander with delight, and love to haunt
331. Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained
332. Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground
333. None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist
334. Went up, and watered all the ground, and each
335. Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth,
336. God made, and every herb, before it grew
337. On the green stem:  God saw that it was good:
338. So even and morn recorded the third day.
339. Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights
340. High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide
341. The day from night; and let them be for signs,
342. For seasons, and for days, and circling years;
343. And let them be for lights, as I ordain
344. Their office in the firmament of Heaven,
345. To give light on the Earth; and it was so.
346. And God made two great lights, great for their use
347. To Man, the greater to have rule by day,
348. The less by night, altern; and made the stars,
349. And set them in the firmament of Heaven
350. To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day
351. In their vicissitude, and rule the night,
352. And light from darkness to divide.  God saw,
353. Surveying his great work, that it was good:
354. For of celestial bodies first the sun
355. A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,
356. Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon
357. Globose, and every magnitude of stars,
358. And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field:
359. Of light by far the greater part he took,
360. Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed
361. In the sun's orb, made porous to receive
362. And drink the liquid light; firm to retain
363. Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.
364. Hither, as to their fountain, other stars
365. Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,
366. And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;
367. By tincture or reflection they augment
368. Their small peculiar, though from human sight
369. So far remote, with diminution seen,
370. First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,
371. Regent of day, and all the horizon round
372. Invested with bright rays, jocund to run
373. His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray
374. Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,
375. Shedding sweet influence:  Less bright the moon,
376. But opposite in levelled west was set,
377. His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light
378. From him; for other light she needed none
379. In that aspect, and still that distance keeps
380. Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,
381. Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign
382. With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,
383. With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared
384. Spangling the hemisphere:  Then first adorned
385. With their bright luminaries that set and rose,
386. Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.
387. And God said, Let the waters generate
388. Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul:
389. And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings
390. Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.
391. And God created the great whales, and each
392. Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously
393. The waters generated by their kinds;
394. And every bird of wing after his kind;
395. And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.
396. Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas,
397. And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;
398. And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.
399. Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,
400. With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals
401. Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales,
402. Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft
403. Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate,
404. Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves
405. Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,
406. Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold;
407. Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend
408. Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food
409. In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal
410. And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk
411. Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,
412. Tempest the ocean: there leviathan,
413. Hugest of living creatures, on the deep
414. Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,
415. And seems a moving land; and at his gills
416. Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.
417. Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,
418. Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon
419. Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
420. Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge
421. They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime,
422. With clang despised the ground, under a cloud
423. In prospect; there the eagle and the stork
424. On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build:
425. Part loosely wing the region, part more wise
426. In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,
427. Intelligent of seasons, and set forth
428. Their aery caravan, high over seas
429. Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing
430. Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane
431. Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air
432. Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:
433. From branch to branch the smaller birds with song
434. Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings
435. Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale
436. Ceased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays:
437. Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed
438. Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck,
439. Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows
440. Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit
441. The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower
442. The mid aereal sky:  Others on ground
443. Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds
444. The silent hours, and the other whose gay train
445. Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue
446. Of rainbows and starry eyes.  The waters thus
447. With fish replenished, and the air with fowl,
448. Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.
449. The sixth, and of creation last, arose
450. With evening harps and matin; when God said,
451. Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,
452. Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth,
453. Each in their kind.  The Earth obeyed, and straight
454. Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
455. Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,
456. Limbed and full grown:  Out of the ground up rose,
457. As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons
458. In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;
459. Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked:
460. The cattle in the fields and meadows green:
461. Those rare and solitary, these in flocks
462. Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.
463. The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared
464. The tawny lion, pawing to get free
465. His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,
466. And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,
467. The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole
468. Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw
469. In hillocks:  The swift stag from under ground
470. Bore up his branching head:  Scarce from his mould
471. Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
472. His vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,
473. As plants:  Ambiguous between sea and land
474. The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.
475. At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
476. Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans
477. For wings, and smallest lineaments exact
478. In all the liveries decked of summer's pride
479. With spots of gold and purple, azure and green:
480. These, as a line, their long dimension drew,
481. Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all
482. Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind,
483. Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved
484. Their snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept
485. The parsimonious emmet, provident
486. Of future; in small room large heart enclosed;
487. Pattern of just equality perhaps
488. Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes
489. Of commonalty:  Swarming next appeared
490. The female bee, that feeds her husband drone
491. Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells
492. With honey stored:  The rest are numberless,
493. And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,
494. Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown
495. The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,
496. Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes
497. And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee
498. Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
499. Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled
500. Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand
501. First wheeled their course:  Earth in her rich attire
502. Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth,
503. By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,
504. Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:
505. There wanted yet the master-work, the end
506. Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone
507. And brute as other creatures, but endued
508. With sanctity of reason, might erect
509. His stature, and upright with front serene
510. Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence
511. Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,
512. But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
513. Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes
514. Directed in devotion, to adore
515. And worship God Supreme, who made him chief
516. Of all his works:  therefore the Omnipotent
517. Eternal Father (for where is not he
518. Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake.
519. Let us make now Man in our image, Man
520. In our similitude, and let them rule
521. Over the fish and fowl of sea and air,
522. Beast of the field, and over all the Earth,
523. And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
524. This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,
525. Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed
526. The breath of life; in his own image he
527. Created thee, in the image of God
528. Express; and thou becamest a living soul.
529. Male he created thee; but thy consort
530. Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,
531. Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;
532. Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold
533. Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,
534. And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
535. Wherever thus created, for no place
536. Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,
537. He brought thee into this delicious grove,
538. This garden, planted with the trees of God,
539. Delectable both to behold and taste;
540. And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
541. Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,
542. Variety without end; but of the tree,
543. Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,
544. Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest;
545. Death is the penalty imposed; beware,
546. And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin
547. Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
548. Here finished he, and all that he had made
549. Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;
550. So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:
551. Yet not till the Creator from his work
552. Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,
553. Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode;
554. Thence to behold this new created world,
555. The addition of his empire, how it showed
556. In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair,
557. Answering his great idea.  Up he rode
558. Followed with acclamation, and the sound
559. Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned
560. Angelick harmonies:  The earth, the air
561. Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,)
562. The heavens and all the constellations rung,
563. The planets in their station listening stood,
564. While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.
565. Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung,
566. Open, ye Heavens! your living doors;let in
567. The great Creator from his work returned
568. Magnificent, his six days work, a World;
569. Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign
570. To visit oft the dwellings of just men,
571. Delighted; and with frequent intercourse
572. Thither will send his winged messengers
573. On errands of supernal grace.  So sung
574. The glorious train ascending:  He through Heaven,
575. That opened wide her blazing portals, led
576. To God's eternal house direct the way;
577. A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold
578. And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,
579. Seen in the galaxy, that milky way,
580. Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest
581. Powdered with stars.  And now on Earth the seventh
582. Evening arose in Eden, for the sun
583. Was set, and twilight from the east came on,
584. Forerunning night; when at the holy mount
585. Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne
586. Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,
587. The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down
588. With his great Father; for he also went
589. Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege
590. Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,
591. Author and End of all things; and, from work
592. Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,
593. As resting on that day from all his work,
594. But not in silence holy kept: the harp
595. Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe,
596. And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,
597. All sounds on fret by string or golden wire,
598. Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice
599. Choral or unison: of incense clouds,
600. Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.
601. Creation and the six days acts they sung:
602. Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite
603. Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue
604. Relate thee!  Greater now in thy return
605. Than from the giant Angels:  Thee that day
606. Thy thunders magnified; but to create
607. Is greater than created to destroy.
608. Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound
609. Thy empire!  Easily the proud attempt
610. Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,
611. Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought
612. Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw
613. The number of thy worshippers.  Who seeks
614. To lessen thee, against his purpose serves
615. To manifest the more thy might: his evil
616. Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.
617. Witness this new-made world, another Heaven
618. From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view
619. On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea;
620. Of amplitude almost immense, with stars
621. Numerous, and every star perhaps a world
622. Of destined habitation; but thou knowest
623. Their seasons: among these the seat of Men,
624. Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused,
625. Their pleasant dwelling-place.  Thrice happy Men,
626. And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!
627. Created in his image, there to dwell
628. And worship him; and in reward to rule
629. Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air,
630. And multiply a race of worshippers
631. Holy and just:  Thrice happy, if they know
632. Their happiness, and persevere upright!
633. So sung they, and the empyrean rung
634. With halleluiahs:  Thus was sabbath kept.
635. And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked
636. How first this world and face of things began,
637. And what before thy memory was done
638. From the beginning; that posterity,
639. Informed by thee, might know:  If else thou seekest
640. Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
