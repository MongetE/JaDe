1. XVII


2. Lawrence of vertuous Father vertuous Son,
3. Now that the Fields are dank, and ways are mire,
4. Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
5. Help wast a sullen day; what may be Won
6. From the hard Season gaining: time will run
7. On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire
8. The frozen earth; and cloth in fresh attire
9. The Lillie and Rose, that neither sow'd nor spun.
10. What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
11. Of Attick tast, with Wine, whence we may rise
12. To hear the Lute well toucht, or artfull voice
13. Warble immortal Notes and Tuskan Ayre?
14. He who of those delights can judge, and spare
15. To interpose them oft, is not unwise.
