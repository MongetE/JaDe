1. Aug. 9.
2. When He Fled From Absalom.


3. Lord how many are my foes
4. How many those
5. That in arms against me rise
6. Many are they
7. That of my life distrustfully thus say,
8. No help for him in God there lies.
9. But thou Lord art my shield my glory,
10. Thee through my story
11. Th' exalter of my head I count
12. Aloud I cry'd
13. Unto Jehovah, he full soon reply'd
14. And heard me from his holy mount.
15. I lay and slept, I wak'd again,
16. For my sustain
17. Was the Lord.  Of many millions
18. The populous rout
19. I fear not though incamping round about
20. They pitch against me their Pavillions.
21. Rise Lord, save me my God for thou
22. Hast smote ere now
23. On the cheek-bone all my foes,
24. Of men abhor'd
25. Hast broke the teeth.  This help was from the Lord;
26. Thy blessing on thy people flows.
