1. XXI

2. Cyriac, whose grandsire on the royal bench
3. Of British Themis, with no mean applause
4. Pronounced and in his volumes taught our laws,
5. Which others at their bar so often wrench;
6. Today deep thoughts resolve with me to drench
7. In mirth, that after no repenting draws;
8. Let Euclid rest and Archimedes pause,
9. And what the Swede intends, and what the French.
10. To measure life learn thou betimes, and know
11. Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;
12. For other things mild Heav'n a time ordains,
13. And disapproves that care, though wise in show,
14. That with superfluous burden loads the day,
15. And, when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.
