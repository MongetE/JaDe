1. XXIII

2. Methought I saw my late espoused saint
3. Brought to me, like Alcestis, from the grave,
4. Whom Jove's great son to her glad husband gave,
5. Rescued from death by force, though pale and faint.
6. Mine, as whom washed from spot of child-bed taint
7. Purification in the Old Law did save,
8. And such, as yet once more I trust to have
9. Full sight of her in Heav'n without restraint,
10. Came vested all in white, pure as her mind:
11. Her face was veiled, yet to my fancied sight
12. Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined
13. So clear, as in no face with more delight.
14. But O, as to embrace me she inclined,
15. I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.
