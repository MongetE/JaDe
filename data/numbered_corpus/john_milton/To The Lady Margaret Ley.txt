1. Daughter to that good Earl, one President
2. Of England’s Council and her Treasury,
3. Who lived in both unstained with gold or fee,
4. And left them both, more in himself content,
5. Till the sad breaking of that Parliament
6. Broke him, as that dishonest victory
7. At Chæronea, fatal to liberty,
8. Killed with report that old man eloquent,
9. Though later born than to have known the days
10. Wherein your father flourished, yet by you,
11. Madam, methinks I see him living yet:
12. So well your words his noble virtues praise
13. That all both judge you to relate them true
14. And to possess them, honoured Margaret.
