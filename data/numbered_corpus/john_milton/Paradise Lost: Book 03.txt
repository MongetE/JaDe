1. Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven firstborn,
2. Or of the Eternal coeternal beam
3. May I express thee unblam'd?  since God is light,
4. And never but in unapproached light
5. Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee
6. Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
7. Or hear"st thou rather pure ethereal stream,
8. Whose fountain who shall tell?  before the sun,
9. Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice
10. Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest  ***
11. The rising world of waters dark and deep,
12. Won from the void and formless infinite.
13. Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,
14. Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd
15. In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
16. Through utter and through middle darkness borne,
17. With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
18. I sung of Chaos and eternal Night;
19. Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
20. The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,
21. Though hard and rare:  Thee I revisit safe,
22. And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou
23. Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain
24. To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
25. So  thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs,
26. Or dim suffusion veil'd.  Yet not the more
27. Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt,
28. Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,
29. Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
30. Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,
31. That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow,
32. Nightly I visit:  nor sometimes forget
33. So were I equall'd with them in renown,
34. Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;
35. Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,
36. And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old:
37. Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move
38. Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird
39. Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid
40. Tunes her nocturnal note.  Thus with the year
41. Seasons return; but not to me returns
42. Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,
43. Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,
44. Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
45. But cloud instead, and ever-during dark
46. Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men
47. Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair
48. Presented with a universal blank
49. Of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd,
50. And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
51. So much the rather thou, celestial Light,
52. Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
53. Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence
54. Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
55. Of things invisible to mortal sight.
56. Now had the Almighty Father from above,
57. From the pure empyrean where he sits
58. High thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye
59. His own works and their works at once to view:
60. About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
61. Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receiv'd
62. Beatitude past utterance; on his right
63. The radiant image of his glory sat,
64. His only son; on earth he first beheld
65. Our two first parents, yet the only two
66. Of mankind in the happy garden plac'd
67. Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,
68. Uninterrupted joy, unrivall'd love,
69. In blissful solitude; he then survey'd
70. Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there
71. Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
72. In the dun air sublime, and ready now
73. To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet,
74. On the bare outside of this world, that seem'd
75. Firm land imbosom'd, without firmament,
76. Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.
77. Him God beholding from his prospect high,
78. Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,
79. Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.
80. Only begotten Son, seest thou what rage
81. Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds
82. Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains
83. Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyss
84. Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems
85. On desperate revenge, that shall redound
86. Upon his own rebellious head.  And now,
87. Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way
88. Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light,
89. Directly towards the new created world,
90. And man there plac'd, with purpose to assay
91. If him by force he can destroy, or, worse,
92. By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert;
93. For man will hearken to his glozing lies,
94. And easily transgress the sole command,
95. Sole pledge of his obedience:  So will fall
96. He and his faithless progeny:  Whose fault?
97. Whose but his own?  ingrate, he had of me
98. All he could have; I made him just and right,
99. Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
100. Such I created all the ethereal Powers
101. And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who fail'd;
102. Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
103. Not free, what proof could they have given sincere
104. Of true allegiance, constant faith or love,
105. Where only what they needs must do appear'd,
106. Not what they would?  what praise could they receive?
107. What pleasure I from such obedience paid,
108. When will and reason (reason also is choice)
109. Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd,
110. Made passive both, had serv'd necessity,
111. Not me?  they therefore, as to right belong$ 'd,
112. So were created, nor can justly accuse
113. Their Maker, or their making, or their fate,
114. As if predestination over-rul'd
115. Their will dispos'd by absolute decree
116. Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
117. Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew,
118. Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,
119. Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.
120. So without least impulse or shadow of fate,
121. Or aught by me immutably foreseen,
122. They trespass, authors to themselves in all
123. Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so
124. I form'd them free: and free they must remain,
125. Till they enthrall themselves; I else must change
126. Their nature, and revoke the high decree
127. Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd
128. $THeir freedom: they themselves ordain'd their fall.
129. The first sort by their own suggestion fell,
130. Self-tempted, self-deprav'd:  Man falls, deceiv'd
131. By the other first:  Man therefore shall find grace,
132. The other none:  In mercy and justice both,
133. Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel;
134. But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.
135. Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd
136. All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect
137. Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd.
138. Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
139. Most glorious; in him all his Father shone
140. Substantially express'd; and in his face
141. Divine compassion visibly appear'd,
142. Love without end, and without measure grace,
143. Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.
144. O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd
145. Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;
146. , that Man should find grace;
147. For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol
148. Thy praises, with the innumerable sound
149. Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne
150. Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.
151. For should Man finally be lost, should Man,
152. Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son,
153. Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd
154. With his own folly?  that be from thee far,
155. That far be from thee, Father, who art judge
156. Of all things made, and judgest only right.
157. Or shall the Adversary thus obtain
158. His end, and frustrate thine?  shall he fulfill
159. His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,
160. Or proud return, though to his heavier doom,
161. Yet with revenge accomplish'd, and to Hell
162. Draw after him the whole race of mankind,
163. By him corrupted?  or wilt thou thyself
164. Abolish thy creation, and unmake
165. For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?
166. So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
167. Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence.
168. To whom the great Creator thus replied.
169. O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,
170. Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.
171. My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,
172. All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all
173. As my eternal purpose hath decreed;
174. Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will;
175. Yet not of will in him, but grace in me
176. Freely vouchsaf'd; once more I will renew
177. His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthrall'd
178. By sin to foul exorbitant desires;
179. Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand
180. On even ground against his mortal foe;
181. By me upheld, that he may know how frail
182. His fallen condition is, and to me owe
183. All his deliverance, and to none but me.
184. Some I have chosen of peculiar grace,
185. Elect above the rest; so is my will:
186. The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd
187. Their sinful state, and to appease betimes
188. The incensed Deity, while offer'd grace
189. Invites; for I will clear their senses dark,
190. What may suffice, and soften stony hearts
191. To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
192. To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,
193. Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent,
194. Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
195. And I will place within them as a guide,
196. My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,
197. Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain,
198. And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.
199. This my long sufferance, and my day of grace,
200. They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;
201. But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more,
202. That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;
203. And none but such from mercy I exclude.
204. But yet all is not done; Man disobeying,
205. Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins
206. Against the high supremacy of Heaven,
207. Affecting God-head, and, so losing all,
208. To expiate his treason hath nought left,
209. But to destruction sacred and devote,
210. He, with his whole posterity, must die,
211. Die he or justice must; unless for him
212. Some other able, and as willing, pay
213. The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
214. Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?
215. Which of you will be mortal, to redeem
216. Man's mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?
217. Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?
218. And silence was in Heaven: $ on Man's behalf
219. He ask'd, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,
220. Patron or intercessour none appear'd,
221. Much less that durst upon his own head draw
222. The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
223. And now without redemption all mankind
224. Must have been lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell
225. By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
226. In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,
227. His dearest mediation thus renew'd.
228. Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace;
229. And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
230. The speediest of thy winged messengers,
231. To visit all thy creatures, and to all
232. Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought?
233. Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid
234. Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost;
235. Atonement for himself, or offering meet,
236. Indebted and undone, hath none to bring;
237. Behold me then:  me for him, life for life
238. I offer: on me let thine anger fall;
239. Account me Man; I for his sake will leave
240. Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee
241. Freely put off, and for him lastly die
242. Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.
243. Under his gloomy power I shall not long
244. Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess
245. Life in myself for ever; by thee I live;
246. Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,
247. All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid,
248. $ thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
249. His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul
250. For ever with corruption there to dwell;
251. But I shall rise victorious, and subdue
252. My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.
253. Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop
254. Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed;
255. I through the ample air in triumph high
256. Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show
257. The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight
258. Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,
259. While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes;
260. Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave;
261. Then, with the multitude of my redeemed,
262. Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return,
263. Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud
264. Of anger shall remain, but peace assured
265. And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more
266. Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.
267. His words here ended; but his meek aspect
268. Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love
269. To mortal men, above which only shone
270. Filial obedience: as a sacrifice
271. Glad to be offered, he attends the will
272. Of his great Father. Admiration seized
273. All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,
274. Wondering; but soon th' Almighty thus replied.
275. O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace
276. Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou
277. My sole complacence! Well thou know'st how dear
278. To me are all my works; nor Man the least,
279. Though last created, that for him I spare
280. Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,
281. By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.

282. Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem,
283. Their nature also to thy nature join;
284. And be thyself Man among men on Earth,
285. Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,
286. By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room
287. The head of all mankind, though Adam's son.
288. As in him perish all men, so in thee,
289. As from a second root, shall be restored
290. As many as are restored, without thee none.
291. His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,
292. Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce
293. Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,
294. And live in thee transplanted, and from thee
295. Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,
296. Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,
297. And dying rise, and rising with him raise
298. His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.
299. So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate,
300. Giving to death, and dying to redeem,
301. So dearly to redeem what hellish hate
302. So easily destroyed, and still destroys
303. In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
304. Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume
305. Man's nature, lessen or degrade thine own.
306. Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss
307. Equal to God, and equally enjoying
308. God-like fruition, quitted all, to save
309. A world from utter loss, and hast been found
310. By merit more than birthright Son of God,
311. Found worthiest to be so by being good,
312. Far more than great or high; because in thee
313. Love hath abounded more than glory abounds;
314. Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
315. With thee thy manhood also to this throne:
316. Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign
317. Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,
318. Anointed universal King; all power
319. I give thee; reign for ever, and assume
320. Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme,
321. Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce:
322. All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide
323. In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.
324. When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven,
325. Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send
326. The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim
327. Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds,
328. The living, and forthwith the cited dead
329. Of all past ages, to the general doom
330. Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.
331. Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge
332. Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink
333. Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full,
334. Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while
335. The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring
336. New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,
337. And, after all their tribulations long,
338. See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,
339. With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.
340. Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by,
341. For regal scepter then no more shall need,
342. God shall be all in all.  But, all ye Gods,
343. Adore him, who to compass all this dies;
344. Adore the Son, and honour him as me.
345. No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all
346. The multitude of Angels, with a shout
347. Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
348. As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung
349. With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled
350. The eternal regions:  Lowly reverent
351. Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground
352. With solemn adoration down they cast
353. Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold;
354. Immortal amarant, a flower which once
355. In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,
356. Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence
357. To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,
358. And flowers aloft shading the fount of life,
359. And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
360. Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream;
361. With these that never fade the Spirits elect
362. Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams;
363. Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright
364. Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone,
365. Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.
366. Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took,
367. Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side
368. Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet
369. Of charming symphony they introduce
370. Their sacred song, and waken raptures high;
371. No voice exempt, no voice but well could join
372. Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.
373. Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent,
374. Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
375. Eternal King; the Author of all being,
376. Fonntain of light, thyself invisible
377. Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st
378. Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest
379. The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud
380. Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,
381. Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
382. Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim
383. Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
384. Thee next they sang of all creation first,
385. Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,
386. In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud
387. Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,
388. Whom else no creature can behold; on thee
389. Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides,
390. Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.
391. He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
392. By thee created; and by thee threw down
393. The aspiring Dominations:  Thou that day
394. Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare,
395. Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook
396. Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks
397. Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.
398. Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
399. Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might,
400. To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,
401. Not so on Man:  Him through their malice fallen,
402. Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom
403. So strictly, but much more to pity incline:
404. No sooner did thy dear and only Son
405. Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
406. So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,
407. He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife
408. Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,
409. Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
410. Second to thee, offered himself to die
411. For Man's offence.  O unexampled love,
412. Love no where to be found less than Divine!
413. Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men!  Thy name
414. Shall be the copious matter of my song
415. Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise
416. Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin.
417. Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere,
418. Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
419. Mean while upon the firm opacous globe
420. Of this round world, whose first convex divides
421. The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed
422. From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old,
423. Satan alighted walks:  A globe far off
424. It seemed, now seems a boundless continent
425. Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night
426. Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms
427. Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;
428. Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven,
429. Though distant far, some small reflection gains
430. Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:
431. Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
432. As when a vultur on Imaus bred,
433. Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,
434. Dislodging from a region scarce of prey
435. To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids,
436. On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs
437. Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;
438. But in his way lights on the barren plains
439. Of Sericana, where Chineses drive
440. With sails and wind their cany waggons light:
441. So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend
442. Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey;
443. Alone, for other creature in this place,
444. Living or lifeless, to be found was none;
445. None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
446. Up hither like aereal vapours flew
447. Of all things transitory and vain, when sin
448. With vanity had filled the works of men:
449. Both all things vain, and all who in vain things
450. Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame,
451. Or happiness in this or the other life;
452. All who have their reward on earth, the fruits
453. Of painful superstition and blind zeal,
454. Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find
455. Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;
456. All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand,
457. Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
458. Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,
459. Till final dissolution, wander here;
460. Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed;
461. Those argent fields more likely habitants,
462. Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold
463. Betwixt the angelical and human kind.
464. Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born
465. First from the ancient world those giants came
466. With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:
467. The builders next of Babel on the plain
468. Of Sennaar, and still with vain design,
469. New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:
470. Others came single; he, who, to be deemed
471. A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,
472. Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy
473. Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea,
474. Cleombrotus; and many more too long,
475. Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars
476. White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.
477. Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek
478. In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;
479. And they, who to be sure of Paradise,
480. Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick,
481. Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;
482. They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,
483. And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
484. The trepidation talked, and that first moved;
485. And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems
486. To wait them with his keys, and now at foot
487. Of Heaven's ascent they lift their feet, when lo
488. A violent cross wind from either coast
489. Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry
490. Into the devious air:  Then might ye see
491. Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost
492. And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads,
493. Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,
494. The sport of winds:  All these, upwhirled aloft,
495. Fly o'er the backside of the world far off
496. Into a Limbo large and broad, since called
497. The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown
498. Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.
499. All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed,
500. And long he wandered, till at last a gleam
501. Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste
502. His travelled steps: far distant he descries
503. Ascending by degrees magnificent
504. Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high;
505. At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared
506. The work as of a kingly palace-gate,
507. With frontispiece of diamond and gold
508. Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems
509. The portal shone, inimitable on earth
510. By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.
511. These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
512. Angels ascending and descending, bands
513. Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
514. To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz
515. Dreaming by night under the open sky
516. And waking cried,  This is the gate of Heaven.
517. Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
518. There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
519. Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed
520. Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon
521. Who after came from earth, failing arrived
522. Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the lake
523. Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.
524. The stairs were then let down, whether to dare
525. The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate
526. His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss:
527. Direct against which opened from beneath,
528. Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,
529. A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,
530. Wider by far than that of after-times
531. Over mount Sion, and, though that were large,
532. Over the Promised Land to God so dear;
533. By which, to visit oft those happy tribes,
534. On high behests his angels to and fro
535. Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard
536. From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flood,
537. To Beersaba, where the Holy Land
538. Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore;
539. So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set
540. To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.
541. Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,
542. That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate,
543. Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
544. Of all this world at once.  As when a scout,
545. Through dark?;nd desart ways with?oeril gone
546. All?might,?;t?kast by break of cheerful dawn
547. Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill,
548. Which to his eye discovers unaware
549. The goodly prospect of some foreign land
550. First seen, or some renowned metropolis
551. With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,
552. Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams:
553. Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen,
554. The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised,
555. At sight of all this world beheld so fair.
556. Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood
557. So high above the circling canopy
558. Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point
559. Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
560. Andromeda far off Atlantick seas
561. Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole
562. He views in breadth, and without longer pause
563. Down right into the world's first region throws
564. His flight precipitant, and winds with ease
565. Through the pure marble air his oblique way
566. Amongst innumerable stars, that shone
567. Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds;
568. Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,
569. Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,
570. Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales,
571. Thrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there
572. He staid not to inquire:  Above them all
573. The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven,
574. Allured his eye; thither his course he bends
575. Through the calm firmament, (but up or down,
576. By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell,
577. Or longitude,) where the great luminary
578. Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,
579. That from his lordly eye keep distance due,
580. Dispenses light from far; they, as they move
581. Their starry dance in numbers that compute
582. Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp
583. Turn swift their various motions, or are turned
584. By his magnetick beam, that gently warms
585. The universe, and to each inward part
586. With gentle penetration, though unseen,
587. Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep;
588. So wonderously was set his station bright.
589. There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
590. Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb
591. Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.
592. The place he found beyond expression bright,
593. Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone;
594. Not all parts like, but all alike informed
595. With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;
596. If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;
597. If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,
598. Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone
599. In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides
600. Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen,
601. That stone, or like to that which here below
602. Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
603. In vain, though by their powerful art they bind
604. Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound
605. In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,
606. Drained through a limbeck to his native form.
607. What wonder then if fields and regions here
608. Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run
609. Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch
610. The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote,
611. Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,
612. Here in the dark so many precious things
613. Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?
614. Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
615. Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;
616. For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
617. But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon
618. Culminate from the equator, as they now
619. Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
620. Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,
621. No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray
622. To objects distant far, whereby he soon
623. Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,
624. The same whom John saw also in the sun:
625. His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;
626. Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
627. Circled his head, nor less his locks behind
628. Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
629. Lay waving round; on some great charge employed
630. He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.
631. Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope
632. To find who might direct his wandering flight
633. To Paradise, the happy seat of Man,
634. His journey's end and our beginning woe.
635. But first he casts to change his proper shape,
636. Which else might work him danger or delay:
637. And now a stripling Cherub he appears,
638. Not of the prime, yet such as in his face
639. Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb
640. Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned:
641. Under a coronet his flowing hair
642. In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore
643. Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold;
644. His habit fit for speed succinct, and held
645. Before his decent steps a silver wand.
646. He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright,
647. Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,
648. Admonished by his ear, and straight was known
649. The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven
650. Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne,
651. Stand ready at command, and are his eyes
652. That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth
653. Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,
654. O'er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.
655. Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
656. In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright,
657. The first art wont his great authentick will
658. Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,
659. Where all his sons thy embassy attend;
660. And here art likeliest by supreme decree
661. Like honour to obtain, and as his eye
662. To visit oft this new creation round;
663. Unspeakable desire to see, and know
664. All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man,
665. His chief delight and favour, him for whom
666. All these his works so wonderous he ordained,
667. Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim
668. Alone thus wandering.  Brightest Seraph, tell
669. In which of all these shining orbs hath Man
670. His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,
671. But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell;
672. That I may find him, and with secret gaze
673. Or open admiration him behold,
674. On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
675. Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;
676. That both in him and all things, as is meet,
677. The universal Maker we may praise;
678. Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
679. To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,
680. Created this new happy race of Men
681. To serve him better:  Wise are all his ways.
682. So spake the false dissembler unperceived;
683. For neither Man nor Angel can discern
684. Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks
685. Invisible, except to God alone,
686. By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:
687. And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps
688. At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity
689. Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill
690. Where no ill seems:  Which now for once beguiled
691. Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held
692. The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;
693. Who to the fraudulent impostor foul,
694. In his uprightness, answer thus returned.
695. Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know
696. The works of God, thereby to glorify
697. The great Work-master, leads to no excess
698. That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
699. The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
700. From thy empyreal mansion thus alone,
701. To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,
702. Contented with report, hear only in Heaven:
703. For wonderful indeed are all his works,
704. Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all
705. Had in remembrance always with delight;
706. But what created mind can comprehend
707. Their number, or the wisdom infinite
708. That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?
709. I saw when at his word the formless mass,
710. This world's material mould, came to a heap:
711. Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar
712. Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;
713. Till at his second bidding Darkness fled,
714. Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:
715. Swift to their several quarters hasted then
716. The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire;
717. And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
718. Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
719. That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars
720. Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;
721. Each had his place appointed, each his course;
722. The rest in circuit walls this universe.
723. Look downward on that globe, whose hither side
724. With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;
725. That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light
726. His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,
727. Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon
728. So call that opposite fair star) her aid
729. Timely interposes, and her monthly round
730. Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven,
731. With borrowed light her countenance triform
732. Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,
733. And in her pale dominion checks the night.
734. That spot, to which I point, is Paradise,
735. Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower.
736. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.
737. Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low,
738. As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven,
739. Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
740. Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath,
741. Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success,
742. Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel;
743. Nor staid, till on Niphates' top he lights.
