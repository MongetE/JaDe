2. Answer me when I call
3. God of my righteousness;
4. In straights and in distress
5. Thou didst me disinthrall
6. And set at large; now spare,
7. Now pity me, and hear my earnest prai'r.

8. Great ones how long will ye
9. My glory have in scorn
10. How long be thus forlorn
11. Still to love vanity,
12. To love, to seek, to prize
13. Things false and vain and nothing else but lies?

14. Yet know the Lord hath chose
15. Chose to himself a part
16. The good and meek of heart
17. (For whom to chuse he knows)
18. Jehovah from on high
19. Will hear my voyce what time to him I crie.

20. Be aw'd, and do not sin,
21. Speak to your hearts alone,
22. Upon your beds, each one,
23. And be at peace within.
24. Offer the offerings just
25. Of righteousness and in Jehovah trust.

26. Many there be that say
27. Who yet will shew us good?
28. Talking like this worlds brood;
29. But Lord, thus let me pray,
30. On us lift up the light
31. Lift up the favour of thy count'nance bright.

32. Into my heart more joy
33. And gladness thou hast put
34. Then when a year of glut
35. Their stores doth over-cloy
36. And from their plenteous grounds
37. With vast increase their corn and wine abounds.

38. In peace at once will I
39. Both lay me down and sleep
40. For thou alone dost keep
41. Me safe where ere I lie
42. As in a rocky Cell
43. Thou Lord alone in safety mak'st me dwell.
