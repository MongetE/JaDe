2. Jehovah to my words give ear
3. My meditation waigh
4. The voyce of my complaining hear
5. My King and God for unto thee I pray.
6. Jehovah thou my early voyce
7. Shalt in the morning hear
8. Ith'morning I to thee with choyce
9. Will rank my Prayers, and watch till thou appear.
10. For thou art not a God that takes
11. In wickedness delight
12. Evil with thee no biding makes
13. Fools or mad men stand not within thy sight.
14. All workers of iniquity
15. Thou wilt destroy that speak a ly
16. The bloodi' and guileful man God doth detest.
17. But I will in thy mercies dear
18. Thy numerous mercies go
19. Into thy house; I in thy fear
20. Will towards thy holy temple worship low.
21. Lord lead me in thy righteousness
22. Lead me because of those
23. That do observe if I transgress,
24. Set thy wayes right before, where my step goes.
25. For in his faltring mouth unstable
26. No word is firm or sooth
27. Their inside, troubles miserable;
28. An open grave their throat, their tongue they smooth.
29. God, find them guilty, let them fall
30. By their own counsels quell'd;
31. Push them in their rebellions all
32. Still on; for against thee they have rebell'd;
33. Then all who trust in thee shall bring
34. Their joy, while thou from blame
35. Defend'st them, they shall ever sing
36. And shall triumph in thee, who love thy name.
37. For thou Jehovah wilt be found
38. To bless the just man still,
39. As with a shield thou wilt surround
40. Him with thy lasting favour and good will.
