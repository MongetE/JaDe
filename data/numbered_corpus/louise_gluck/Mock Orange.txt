1. It is not the moon, I tell you.
2. It is these flowers
3. lighting the yard.

4. I hate them.
5. I hate them as I hate sex,
6. the man's mouth
7. sealing my mouth, the man's
8. paralyzing body—

9. and the cry that always escapes,
10. the low, humiliating
11. premise of union—

12. In my mind tonight
13. I hear the question and pursuing answer
14. fused in one sound
15. that mounts and mounts and then
16. is split into the old selves,
17. the tired antagonisms. Do you see?
18. We were made fools of.
19. And the scent of mock orange
20. drifts through the window.

21. How can I rest?
22. How can I be content
23. when there is still
24. that odor in the world?
