1. Night covers the pond with its wing.
2. Under the ringed moon I can make out
3. your face swimming among minnows and the small
4. echoing stars. In the night air
5. the surface of the pond is metal.

6. Within, your eyes are open. They contain
7. a memory I recognize, as though
8. we had been children together. Our ponies
9. grazed on the hill, they were gray
10. with white markings. Now they graze
11. with the dead who wait
12. like children under their granite breastplates,
13. lucid and helpless:

14. The hills are far away. They rise up
15. blacker than childhood.
16. What do you think of, lying so quietly
17. by the water? When you look that way I want
18. to touch you, but do not, seeing
19. as in another life we were of the same blood.
