1. In our family, there were two saints,
2. my aunt and my grandmother.
3. But their lives were different.

4. My grandmother's was tranquil, even at the end.
5. She was like a person walking in calm water;
6. for some reason
7. the sea couldn't bring itself to hurt her.
8. When my aunt took the same path,
9. the waves broke over her, they attacked her,
10. which is how the Fates respond
11. to a true spiritual nature.

12. My grandmother was cautious, conservative:
13. that's why she escaped suffering.
14. My aunt's escaped nothing;
15. each time the sea retreats, someone she loves is taken away.

16. Still she won't experience
17. the sea as evil. To her, it is what it is:
18. where it touches land, it must turn to violence.
