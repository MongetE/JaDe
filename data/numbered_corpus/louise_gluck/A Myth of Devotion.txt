1. When Hades decided he loved this girl
2. he built for her a duplicate of earth,
3. everything the same, down to the meadow,
4. but with a bed added.

5. Everything the same, including sunlight,
6. because it would be hard on a young girl
7. to go so quickly from bright light to utter darkness

8. Gradually, he thought, he'd introduce the night,
9. first as the shadows of fluttering leaves.
10. Then moon, then stars. Then no moon, no stars.
11. Let Persephone get used to it slowly.
12. In the end, he thought, she'd find it comforting.

13. A replica of earth
14. except there was love here.
15. Doesn't everyone want love?

16. He waited many years,
17. building a world, watching
18. Persephone in the meadow.
19. Persephone, a smeller, a taster.
20. If you have one appetite, he thought,
21. you have them all.

22. Doesn't everyone want to feel in the night
23. the beloved body, compass, polestar,
24. to hear the quiet breathing that says
25. I am alive, that means also
26. you are alive, because you hear me,
27. you are here with me. And when one turns,
28. the other turnsâ€”

29. That's what he felt, the lord of darkness,
30. looking at the world he had
31. constructed for Persephone. It never crossed his mind
32. that there'd be no more smelling here,
33. certainly no more eating.

34. Guilt? Terror? The fear of love?
35. These things he couldn't imagine;
36. no lover ever imagines them.

37. He dreams, he wonders what to call this place.
38. First he thinks: The New Hell. Then: The Garden.
39. In the end, he decides to name it
40. Persephone's Girlhood.

41. A soft light rising above the level meadow,
42. behind the bed. He takes her in his arms.
43. He wants to say I love you, nothing can hurt you

44. but he thinks
45. this is a lie, so he says in the end
46. you're dead, nothing can hurt you
47. which seems to him
48. a more promising beginning, more true.
