1. You want to know how I spend my time?
2. I walk the front lawn, pretending
3. to be weeding. You ought to know
4. I'm never weeding, on my knees, pulling
5. clumps of clover from the flower beds: in fact
6. I'm looking for courage, for some evidence
7. my life will change, though
8. it takes forever, checking
9. each clump for the symbolic
10. leaf, and soon the summer is ending, already
11. the leaves turning, always the sick trees
12. going first, the dying turning
13. brilliant yellow, while a few dark birds perform
14. their curfew of music. You want to see my hands?
15. As empty now as at the first note.
16. Or was the point always
17. to continue without a sign?
