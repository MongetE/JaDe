1. We're all dreamers; we don't know who we are.

2. Some machine made us; machine of the world, the constricting family.
3. Then back to the world, polished by soft whips.

4. We dream; we don't remember.

5. Machine of the family: dark fur, forests of the mother's body.
6. Machine of the mother: white city inside her.

7. And before that: earth and water.
8. Moss between rocks, pieces of leaves and grass.

9. And before, cells in a great darkness.
10. And before that, the veiled world.

11. This is why you were born: to silence me.
12. Cells of my mother and father, it is your turn
13. to be pivotal, to be the masterpiece.

14. I improvised; I never remembered.
15. Now it's your turn to be driven;
16. you're the one who demands to know:

17. Why do I suffer? Why am I ignorant?
18. Cells in a great darkness. Some machine made us;
19. it is your turn to address it, to go back asking
20. what am I for? What am I for?
