1. The great thing
2. is not having
3. a mind. Feelings:
4. oh, I have those; they
5. govern me. I have
6. a lord in heaven
7. called the sun, and open
8. for him, showing him
9. the fire of my own heart, fire
10. like his presence.
11. What could such glory be
12. if not a heart? Oh my brothers and sisters,
13. were you like me once, long ago,
14. before you were human? Did you
15. permit yourselves
16. to open once, who would never
17. open again? Because in truth
18. I am speaking now
19. the way you do. I speak
20. because I am shattered.
