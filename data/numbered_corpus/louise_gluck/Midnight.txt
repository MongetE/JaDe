1. Speak to me, aching heart: what
2. Ridiculous errand are you inventing for yourself
3. Weeping in the dark garage
4. With your sack of garbage: it is not your job
5. To take out the garbage, it is your job
6. To empty the dishwasher. You are showing off
7. Again,
8. Exactly as you did in childhood--where
9. Is your sporting side, your famous
10. Ironic detachment? A little moonlight hits
11. The broken window, a little summer moonlight,

13. Murmurs from the earth with its ready
14. Sweetnesses--
15. Is this the way you communicate
16. With your husband, not answering
17. When he calls, or is this the way the heart
18. Behaves when it grieves: it wants to be
19. Alone with the garbage? If I were you,
20. I'd think ahead. After fifteen years,
21. His voice could be getting tired; some night
22. If you don't answer, someone else will answer.
