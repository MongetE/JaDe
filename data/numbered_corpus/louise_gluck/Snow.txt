1. Late December: my father and I
2. are going to New York, to the circus.
3. He holds me
4. on his shoulders in the bitter wind:
5. scraps of white paper
6. blow over the railroad ties.

7. My father liked
8. to stand like this, to hold me
9. so he couldn't see me.
10. I remember
11. staring straight ahead
12. into the world my father saw;
13. I was learning
14. to absorb its emptiness,
15. the heavy snow
16. not falling, whirling around us.
