1. —After Robert Pinsky
2. Defier of closed space, such as the head, opener
3. Of the sealed passageways, so that
4. Sunlight entering the nose can once again

5. Exit the ear, vaporizer, mist machine, whose
6. Soft hiss sounds like another human being

7. But less erratic, more stable, or, if not like a human being,
8. Carried by one, by my mother to the sick chamber
9. Of my childhood  as Freud said,

10. Why are you always sick, Louise? his cigar
11. Confusing mist with smoke, interfering
12. With healingEmbodied

13. Summoner of these ghosts, white plastic tub with your elegant
14. Clear tub, the water sanitized by boiling,
15. Sterile, odorless,

16. In my mother's absence
17. Run by me, the one machine

18. I understand: what
19. Would life be if we could not buy
20. Objects to care for us

21. And bear them home, away from the druggists' pity,
22. If we could not carry in our own arms
23. Alms, alchemy, to the safety of our bedrooms,
24. If there were no more

25. Sounds in the night, continuous
26. Hush, hush of warm steam, not
27. Like human breath though regular, if there were nothing in the world

28. More hopeful than the self,
29. Soothing it, wishing it well.
