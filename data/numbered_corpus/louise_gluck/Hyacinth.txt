1. Is that an attitude for a flower, to stand
2. like a club at the walk; poor slain boy,
3. is that a way to show
4. gratitude to the gods? White
5. with colored hearts, the tall flowers
6. sway around you, all the other boys,
7. in the cold spring, as the violets open.

8. 2
9. There were no flowers in antiquity
10. but boys' bodies, pale, perfectly imagined.
11. So the gods sank to human shape with longing.
12. In the field, in the willow grove,
13. Apollo sent the courtiers away.

14. 3
15. And from the blood of the wound
16. a flower sprang, lilylike, more brilliant
17. than the purples of Tyre.
18. Then the god wept: his vital grief
19. flooded the earth.

20. 4
21. Beauty dies: that is the source
22. of creation. Outside the ring of trees
23. the courtiers could hear
24. the dove's call transmit
25. its uniform, its inborn sorrow—
26. They stood listening, among the rustling willows.
27. Was this the god's lament?
28. They listened carefully. And for a short time
29. all sound was sad.

30. 5
31. There is no other immortality:
32. in the cold spring, the purple violets open.
33. And yet, the heart is black,
34. there is its violence frankly exposed.
35. Or is it not the heart at the center
36. but some other word?
37. And now someone is bending over them,
38. meaning to gather them—

39. 6
40. They could not wait
41. in exile forever.
42. Through the glittering grove
43. the courtiers ran
44. calling the name
45. of their companion
46. over the birds' noise,
47. over the willows' aimless sadness.
48. Well into the night they wept,
49. their clear tears
50. altering no earthly color.
