1. There is always something to be made of pain.
2. Your mother knits.
3. She turns out scarves in every shade of red.
4. They were for Christmas, and they kept you warm
5. while she married over and over, taking you
6. along. How could it work,
7. when all those years she stored her widowed heart
8. as though the dead come back.
9. No wonder you are the way you are,
10. afraid of blood, your women
11. like one brick wall after another.
