1. Small light in the sky appearing
2. suddenly between
3. two pine boughs, their fine needles

4. now etched onto the radiant surface
5. and above this
6. high, feathery heaven—

7. Smell the air. That is the smell of the white pine,
8. most intense when the wind blows through it
9. and the sound it makes equally strange,
10. like the sound of the wind in a movie—

11. Shadows moving. The ropes
12. making the sound they make. What you hear now
13. will be the sound of the nightingale, Chordata,
14. the male bird courting the female—

15. The ropes shift. The hammock
16. sways in the wind, tied
17. firmly between two pine trees.

18. Smell the air. That is the smell of the white pine.

19. It is my mother's voice you hear
20. or is it only the sound the trees make
21. when the air passes through them

22. because what sound would it make,
23. passing through nothing?
