1. Over the still world, a bird calls
2. waking solitary among black boughs.

3. You wanted to be born; I let you be born.
4. When has my grief ever gotten
5. in the way of your pleasure?

6. Plunging ahead
7. into the dark and light at the same time
8. eager for sensation

9. as though you were some new thing, wanting
10. to express yourselves

11. all brilliance, all vivacity

12. never thinking
13. this would cost you anything,
14. never imagining the sound of my voice
15. as anything but part of you—

16. you won't hear it in the other world,
17. not clearly again,
18. not in birdcall or human cry,

19. not the clear sound, only
20. persistent echoing
21. in all sound that means good-bye, good-bye—

22. the one continuous line
23. that binds us to each other.
