1. The great man turns his back on the island.
2. Now he will not die in paradise
3. nor hear again
4. the lutes of paradise among the olive trees,
5. by the clear pools under the cypresses. Time
6. begins now, in which he hears again
7. that pulse which is the narrative
8. sea, at dawn when its pull is strongest.
9. What has brought us here
10. will lead us away; our ship
11. sways in the tinted harbor water.
12. Now the spell is ended.
13. Give him back his life,
14. sea that can only move forward.
