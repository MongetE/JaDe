1. In your extended absence, you permit me
2. use of earth, anticipating
3. some return on investment. I must report
4. failure in my assignment, principally
5. regarding the tomato plants.
6. I think I should not be encouraged to grow
7. tomatoes. Or, if I am, you should withhold
8. the heavy rains, the cold nights that come
9. so often here, while other regions get
10. twelve weeks of summer. All this
11. belongs to you: on the other hand,
12. I planted the seeds, I watched the first shoots
13. like wings tearing the soil, and it was my heart
14. broken by the blight, the black spot so quickly
15. multiplying in the rows. I doubt
16. you have a heart, in our understanding of
17. that term. You who do not discriminate
18. between the dead and the living, who are, in consequence,
19. immune to foreshadowing, you may not know
20. how much terror we bear, the spotted leaf,
21. the red leaves of the maple falling
22. even in August, in early darkness: I am responsible
23. for these vines.
