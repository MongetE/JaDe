1. All day I tried to distinguish
2. need from desire. Now, in the dark,
3. I feel only bitter sadness for us,
4. the builders, the planers of wood,
5. because I have been looking
6. steadily at these elms
7. and seen the process that creates
8. the writhing, stationary tree
9. is torment, and have understood
10. it will make no forms but twisted forms.
