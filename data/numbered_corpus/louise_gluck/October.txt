1. Is it winter again, is it cold again,
2. didn't Frank just slip on the ice,
3. didn't he heal, weren't the spring seeds planted

4. didn't the night end,
5. didn't the melting ice
6. flood the narrow gutters

7. wasn't my body
8. rescued, wasn't it safe

9. didn't the scar form, invisible
10. above the injury

11. terror and cold,
12. didn't they just end, wasn't the back garden
13. harrowed and planted-

14. I remember how the earth felt, red and dense,
15. in stiff rows, weren't the seeds planted,
16. didn't vines climb the south wall

17. I can't hear your voice
18. for the wind's cries, whistling over the bare ground

19. I no longer care
20. what sound it makes

21. when was I silenced, when did it first seem
22. pointless to describe that sound

23. what it sounds like can't change what it is-

24. didn't the night end, wasn't the earth
25. safe when it was planted

26. didn't we plant the seeds,
27. weren't we necessary to the earth,

28. the vines, were they harvested?
