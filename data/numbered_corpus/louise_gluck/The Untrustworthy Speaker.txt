1. Don't listen to me; my heart's been broken.
2. I don't see anything objectively.

3. I know myself; I've learned to hear like a psychiatrist.
4. When I speak passionately,
5. That's when I'm least to be trusted.

6. It's very sad, really: all my life I've been praised
7. For my intelligence, my powers of language, of insight-
8. In the end they're wasted-

9. I never see myself.
10. Standing on the front steps.  Holding my sisters hand.
11. That's why I can't account
12. For the bruises on her arm where the sleeve ends . . .

13. In my own mind, I'm invisible: that's why I'm dangerous.
14. People like me, who seem selfless.
15. We're the cripples, the liars:
16. We're the ones who should be factored out
17. In the interest of truth.

18. When I'm quiet, that's when the truth emerges.
19. A clear sky, the clouds like white fibers.
20. Underneath, a little gray house.  The azaleas
21. Red and bright pink.

22. If you want the truth, you have to close yourself
23. To the older sister, block her out:
24. When I living thing is hurt like that
25. In its deepest workings,
26. All function is altered.

27. That's why I'm not to be trusted.
28. Because a wound to the heart
29. Is also a wound to the mind.
