1. There were others; their bodies
2. were a preparation.
3. I have come to see it as that.

4. As a steam of cries.
5. So much pain in the world - the formless
6. grief of the body, whose language
7. is hunger-

8. And in the hall, the boxed roses:
9. what they mean

10. is chaos. Then begins
11. the terrible charity of marriage,
12. husband and wife

13. climing the green hill in gold light
14. until there is no hill,
15. only a flat plain stopped by the sky.

16. Here is my hand, he said.
17. But that was long ago.
18. Here is my hand that will not harm you.
