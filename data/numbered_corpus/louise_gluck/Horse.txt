1. What does the horse give you
2. That I cannot give you?

3. I watch you when you are alone,
4. When you ride into the field behind the dairy,
5. Your hands buried in the mare's
6. Dark mane.

7. Then I know what lies behind your silence:
8. Scorn, hatred of me, of marriage. Still,
9. You want me to touch you; you cry out
10. As brides cry, but when I look at you I see
11. There are no children in your body.
12. Then what is there?

13. Nothing, I think. Only haste
14. To die before I die.

15. In a dream, I watched you ride the horse
16. Over the dry fields and then
17. Dismount: you two walked together;
18. In the dark, you had no shadows.
19. But I felt them coming toward me
20. Since at night they go anywhere,
21. They are their own masters.

22. Look at me. You think I don't understand?
23. What is the animal
24. If not passage out of this life?
