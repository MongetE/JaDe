1. As a man and woman make
2. a garden between them like
3. a bed of stars, here
4. they linger in the summer evening
5. and the evening turns
6. cold with their terror: it
7. could all end, it is capable
8. of devastation. All, all
9. can be lost, through scented air
10. the narrow columns
11. uselessly rising, and beyond,
12. a churning sea of poppies--

13. Hush, beloved.  It doesn't matter to me
14. how many summers I live to return:
15. this one summer we have entered eternity.
16. I felt your two hands
17. bury me to release its splendor.
