1. There was an apple tree in the yard --
2. this would have been
3. forty years ago -- behind,
4. only meadows. Drifts
5. of crocus in the damp grass.
6. I stood at that window:
7. late April. Spring
8. flowers in the neighbor's yard.
9. How many times, really, did the tree
10. flower on my birthday,
11. the exact day, not
12. before, not after? Substitution
13. of the immutable
14. for the shifting, the evolving.
15. Substitution of the image
16. for relentless earth. What
17. do I know of this place,
18. the role of the tree for decades
19. taken by a bonsai, voices
20. rising from the tennis courts --
21. Fields. Smell of the tall grass, new cut.
22. As one expects of a lyric poet.
23. We look at the world once, in childhood.
24. The rest is memory.
