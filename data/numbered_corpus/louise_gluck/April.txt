1. No one's despair is like my despair--

2. You have no place in this garden
3. thinking such things, producing
4. the tiresome outward signs; the man
5. pointedly weeding an entire forest,
6. the woman limping, refusing to change clothes
7. or wash her hair.

8. Do you suppose I care
9. if you speak to one another?
10. But I mean you to know
11. I expected better of two creatures
12. who were given minds: if not
13. that you would actually care for each other
14. at least that you would understand
15. grief is distributed
16. between you, among all your kind, for me
17. to know you, as deep blue
18. marks the wild scilla, white
19. the wood violet.
