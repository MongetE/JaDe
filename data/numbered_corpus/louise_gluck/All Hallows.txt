1. Even now this landscape is assembling.
2. The hills darken. The oxen
3. Sleep in their blue yoke,
4. The fields having been
5. Picked clean, the sheaves
6. Bound evenly and piled at the roadside
7. Among cinquefoil, as the toothed moon rises:

8. This is the barrenness
9. Of harvest or pestilence
10. And the wife leaning out the window
11. With her hand extended, as in payment,
12. And the seeds
13. Distinct, gold, calling
14. Come here
15. Come here, little one

16. And the soul creeps out of the tree.
