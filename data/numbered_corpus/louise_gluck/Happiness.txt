1. A man and a woman lie on a white bed.
2. It is morning. I think
3. Soon they will waken.
4. On the bedside table is a vase
5. of lilies; sunlight
6. pools in their throats.
7. I watch him turn to her
8. as though to speak her name
9. but silently, deep in her mouth--
10. At the window ledge,
11. once, twice,
12. a bird calls.
13. And then she stirs; her body
14. fills with his breath.

15. I open my eyes; you are watching me.
16. Almost over this room
17. the sun is gliding.
18. Look at your face, you say,
19. holding your own close to me
20. to make a mirror.
21. How calm you are. And the burning wheel
22. passes gently over us.
