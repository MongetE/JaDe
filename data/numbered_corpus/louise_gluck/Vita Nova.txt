1. You saved me, you should remember me.

2. The spring of the year; young men buying tickets for the ferryboats.
3. Laughter, because the air is full of apple blossoms.

4. When I woke up, I realized I was capable of the same feeling.

5. I remember sounds like that from my childhood,
6. laughter for no cause, simply because the world is beautiful,
7. something like that.

8. Lugano. Tables under the apple trees.
9. Deckhands raising and lowering the colored flags.
10. And by the lake's edge, a young man throws his hat into the water;
11. perhaps his sweetheart has accepted him.

12. Crucial
13. sounds or gestures like
14. a track laid down before the larger themes

15. and then unused, buried.

16. Islands in the distance. My mother
17. holding out a plate of little cakes—

18. as far as I remember, changed
19. in no detail, the moment
20. vivid, intact, having never been
21. exposed to light, so that I woke elated, at my age
22. hungry for life, utterly confident—

23. By the tables, patches of new grass, the pale green
24. pieced into the dark existing ground.

25. Surely spring has been returned to me, this time
26. not as a lover but a messenger of death, yet
27. it is still spring, it is still meant tenderly.
