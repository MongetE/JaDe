1. At the end of my suffering
2. there was a door.

3. Hear me out: that which you call death
4. I remember.

5. Overhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.
6. Then nothing. The weak sun
7. flickered over the dry surface.

8. It is terrible to survive
9. as consciousness
10. buried in the dark earth.

11. Then it was over: that which you fear, being
12. a soul and unable
13. to speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth
14. bending a little. And what I took to be
15. birds darting in low shrubs.

16. You who do not remember
17. passage from the other world
18. I tell you I could speak again: whatever
19. returns from oblivion returns
20. to find a voice:

21. from the center of my life came
22. a great fountain, deep blue
23. shadows on azure seawater.
