1. Two women with
2. the same claim
3. came to the feet of
4. the wise king. Two women,
5. but only one baby.
6. The king knew
7. someone was lying.
8. What he said was
9. Let the child be
10. cut in half; that way
11. no one will go
12. empty-handed. He
13. drew his sword.
14. Then, of the two
15. women, one
16. renounced her share:
17. this was
18. the sign, the lesson.
19. Suppose
20. you saw your mother
21. torn between two daughters:
22. what could you do
23. to save her but be
24. willing to destroy
25. yourselfâ€”she would know
26. who was the rightful child,
27. the one who couldn't bear
28. to divide the mother.
