1. One summer she goes into the field as usual
2. stopping for a bit at the pool where she often
3. looks at herself, to see
4. if she detects any changes. She sees
5. the same person, the horrible mantle
6. of daughterliness still clinging to her.

7. The sun seems, in the water, very close.
8. That's my uncle spying again, she thinks—
9. everything in nature is in some way her relative.
10. I am never alone, she thinks,
11. turning the thought into a prayer.
12. Then death appears, like the answer to a prayer.

13. No one understands anymore
14. how beautiful he was. But Persephone remembers.
15. Also that he embraced her, right there,
16. with her uncle watching. She remembers
17. sunlight flashing on his bare arms.

18. This is the last moment she remembers clearly.
19. Then the dark god bore her away.

20. She also remembers, less clearly,
21. the chilling insight that from this moment
22. she couldn't live without him again.

23. The girl who disappears from the pool
24. will never return. A woman will return,
25. looking for the girl she was.

26. She stands by the pool saying, from time to time,
27. I was abducted, but it sounds
28. wrong to her, nothing like what she felt.
29. Then she says, I was not abducted.
30. Then she says, I offered myself, I wanted
31. to escape my body. Even, sometimes,
32. I willed this. But ignorance

33. cannot will knowledge. Ignorance
34. wills something imagined, which it believes exists.

35. All the different nouns—
36. she says them in rotation.
37. Death, husband, god, stranger.
38. Everything sounds so simple, so conventional.
39. I must have been, she thinks, a simple girl.

40. She can't remember herself as that person
41. but she keeps thinking the pool will remember
42. and explain to her the meaning of her prayer
43. so she can understand
44. whether it was answered or not.
