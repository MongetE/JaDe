1. Now, in twilight, on the palace steps
2. the king asks forgiveness of his lady.

3. He is not
4. duplicitous; he has tried to be
5. true to the moment; is there another way of being
6. true to the self?

7. The lady
8. hides her face, somewhat
9. assisted by the shadows. She weeps
10. for her past; when one has a secret life,

11. one's tears are never explained.

12. Yet gladly would the king bear
13. the grief of his lady: his
14. is the generous heart,
15. in pain as in joy.

16. Do you know
17. what forgiveness mean? it mean
18. the world has sinned, the world
19. must be pardoned --
