1. Remember the days of our first happiness,
2. how strong we were, how dazed by passion,
3. lying all day, then all night in the narrow bed,
4. sleeping there, eating there too: it was summer,
5. it seemed everything had ripened
6. at once.  And so hot we lay completely uncovered.
7. Sometimes the wind rose; a willow brushed the window.

8. But we were lost in a way, didn't you feel that?
9. The bed was like a raft; I felt us drifting
10. far from our natures, toward a place where we'd discover nothing.
11. First the sun, then the moon, in fragments,
12. stone through the willow.
13. Things anyone could see.

14. Then the circles closed.  Slowly the nights grew cool;
15. the pendant leaves of the willow
16. yellowed and fell.  And in each of us began
17. a deep isolation, though we never spoke of this,
18. of the absence of regret.
19. We were artists again, my husband.
20. We could resume the journey.
