1. The Greeks are sitting on the beach
2. wondering what to do when the war ends. No one
3. wants to go home, back
4. to that bony island; everyone wants a little more
5. of what there is in Troy, more
6. life on the edge, that sense of every day as being
7. packed with surprises. But how to explain this
8. to the ones at home to whom
9. fighting a war is a plausible
10. excuse for absence, whereas
11. exploring one's capacity for diversion
12. is not. Well, this can be faced
13. later; these
14. are men of action, ready to leave
15. insight to the women and children.
16. Thinking things over in the hot sun, pleased
17. by a new strength in their forearms, which seem
18. more golden than they did at home, some
19. begin to miss their families a little,
20. to miss their wives, to want to see
21. if the war has aged them. And a few grow
22. slightly uneasy: what if war
23. is just a male version of dressing up,
24. a game devised to avoid
25. profound spiritual questions? Ah,
26. but it wasn't only the war. The world had begun
27. calling them, an opera beginning with the war's
28. loud chords and ending with the floating aria of the sirens.
29. There on the beach, discussing the various
30. timetables for getting home, no one believed
31. it could take ten years to get back to Ithaca;
32. no one foresaw that decade of insoluble dilemmasâ€”oh unanswerable
33. affliction of the human heart: how to divide
34. the world's beauty into acceptable
35. and unacceptable loves! On the shores of Troy,
36. how could the Greeks know
37. they were hostages already: who once
38. delays the journey is
39. already enthralled; how could they know
40. that of their small number
41. some would be held forever by the dreams of pleasure,
42. some by sleep, some by music?
