1. Mother died last night,
2. Mother who never dies.

3. Winter was in the air,
4. many months away
5. but in the air nevertheless.

6. It was the tenth of May.
7. Hyacinth and apple blossom
8. bloomed in the back garden.

9. We could hear
10. Maria singing songs from Czechoslovakia —

11. How alone I am —
12. songs of that kind.

13. How alone I am,
14. no mother, no father —
15. my brain seems so empty without them.

16. Aromas drifted out of the earth;
17. the dishes were in the sink,
18. rinsed but not stacked.

19. Under the full moon
20. Maria was folding the washing;
21. the stiff  sheets became
22. dry white rectangles of  moonlight.

23. How alone I am, but in music
24. my desolation is my rejoicing.

25. It was the tenth of May
26. as it had been the ninth, the eighth.

27. Mother slept in her bed,
28. her arms outstretched, her head
29. balanced between them.
