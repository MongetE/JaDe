1. In the story of Patroclus
2. no one survives, not even Achilles
3. who was nearly a god.
4. Patroclus resembled him; they wore
5. the same armor.

6. Always in these friendships
7. one serves the other, one is less than the other:
8. the hierarchy
9. is always apparant, though the legends
10. cannot be trusted--
11. their source is the survivor,
12. the one who has been abandoned.

13. What were the Greek ships on fire
14. compared to this loss?

15. In his tent, Achilles
16. grieved with his whole being
17. and the gods saw
18. he was a man already dead, a victim
19. of the part that loved,
20. the part that was mortal.
