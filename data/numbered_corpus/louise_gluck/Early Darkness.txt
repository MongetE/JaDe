1. How can you say
2. earth should give me joy?  Each thing
3. born is my burden; I cannot succeed
4. with all of you.

5. And you would like to dictate to me,
6. you would like to tell me
7. who among you is most valuable,
8. who most resembles me.
9. And you hold up as an example
10. the pure life, the detachment
11. you struggle to acheive--

12. How can you understand me
13. when you cannot understand yourselves?
14. Your memory is not
15. powerful enough, it will not
16. reach back far enough--

17. Never forget you are my children.
18. You are not suffering because you touched each other
19. but because you were born,
20. because you required life
21. separate from me.
