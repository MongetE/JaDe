1. A child draws the outline of a body.
2. She draws what she can, but it is white all through,
3. she cannot fill in what she knows is there.
4. Within the unsupported line, she knows
5. that life is missing; she has cut
6. one background from another. Like a child,
7. she turns to her mother.

8. And you draw the heart
9. against the emptiness she has created.
