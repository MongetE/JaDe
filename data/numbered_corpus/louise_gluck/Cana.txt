1. What can I tell you that you don't know
2. that will make you tremble again?

3. Forsythia
4. by the roadside, by
5. wet rocks, on the embankments
6. underplanted with hyacinth --

7. For ten years I was happy.
8. You were there; in a sence,
9. you were always with me, the house, the garden
10. constrantly lit,
11. not with lights as we have in the sky
12. but with those emblems of light
13. which are more powerful, being
14. implicitly some earthly
15. thing transformed --

16. And all of it vanished,
17. reabsorbed into impassive process. Then
18. what will we see by,
19. now that the yellow torches have become
20. green branches?
