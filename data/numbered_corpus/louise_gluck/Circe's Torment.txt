1. I regret bitterly
2. The years of loving you in both
3. Your presence and absence, regret
4. The law, the vocation
5. That forbid me to keep you, the sea
6. A sheet of glass, the sun-bleached
7. Beauty of the Greek ships: how
8. Could I have power if
9. I had no wish
10. To transform you: as
11. You loved my body,
12. As you found there
13. Passion we held above
14. All other gifts, in that single moment
15. Over honor and hope, over
16. Loyalty, in the name of that bond
17. I refuse you
18. Such feeling for your wife
19. As will let you
20. Rest with her, I refuse you
21. Sleep again
22. If I cannot have you.
