1. Do you know what I was, how I lived?  You know
2. what despair is; then
3. winter should have meaning for you.

4. I did not expect to survive,
5. earth suppressing me. I didn't expect
6. to waken again, to feel
7. in damp earth my body
8. able to respond again, remembering
9. after so long how to open again
10. in the cold light
11. of earliest spring--

12. afraid, yes, but among you again
13. crying yes risk joy

14. in the raw wind of the new world.
