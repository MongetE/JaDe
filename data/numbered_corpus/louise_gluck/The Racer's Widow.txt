1. The elements have merged into solicitude,
2. Spasms of violets rise above the mud
3. And weed, and soon the birds and ancients
4. Will be starting to arrive, bereaving points
5. South. But never mind. It is not painful to discuss
6. His death. I have been primed for this -
7. For separation -  for so long. But still his face assaults
8. Me; I can hear that car careen again, the crowd coagulate on
9. asphalt
10. In my sleep. And watching him, I feel my legs like snow
11. That let him finally let him go
12. As he lies draining there. And see
13. How even he did not get to keep that lovely body.
