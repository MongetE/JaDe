1. On a small lake off
2. the map of the world, two
3. swans lived. As swans,
4. they spent eighty percent of the day studying
5. themselves in the attentive water and
6. twenty percent ministering to the beloved
7. other. Thus
8. their fame as lovers stems
9. chiefly from narcissism, which leaves
10. so little leisure for
11. more general cruising. But
12. fate had other plans: after ten years, they hit
13. slimy water; whatever the filth was, it
14. clung to the male's plumage, which turned
15. instantly gray; simultaneously,
16. the true purpose of his neck's
17. flexible design revealed itself. So much
18. action on the flat lake, so much
19. he's missed! Sooner or later in a long
20. life together, every couple encounters
21. some emergency like this, some
22. drama which results
23. in harm. This
24. occurs for a reason: to test
25. love and to demand
26. fresh articulation of its complex terms.
27. So it came to light that the male and female
28. flew under different banners: whereas
29. the male believed that love
30. was what one felt in one's heart
31. the female believed
32. love was what one did. But this is not
33. a little story about the male's
34. inherent corruption, using as evidence the swan's
35. sleazy definition of purity. It is
36. a story of guile and innocence. For ten years
37. the female studied the male; she dallied
38. when he slept or when he was
39. conveniently absorbed in the water,
40. while the spontaneous male
41. acted casually, on
42. the whim of the moment. On the muddy water
43. they bickered awhile, in the fading light,
44. until the bickering grew
45. slowly abstract, becoming
46. part of their song
47. after a little longer.
