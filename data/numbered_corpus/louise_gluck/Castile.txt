1. Orange blossoms blowing over Castile
2. children begging for coins

3. I met my love under an orange tree
4. or was it an acacia tree
5. or was he not my love?

6. I read this, then I dreamed this:
7. can waking take back what happened to me?
8. Bells of San Miguel
9. ringing in the distance
10. his hair in the shadows blond-white

11. I dreamed this,
12. does that mean it didn't happen?
13. Does it have to happen in the world to be real?

14. I dreamed everything, the story
15. became my story:

16. he lay beside me,
17. my hand grazed the skin of his shoulder

18. Mid-day, then early evening:
19. in the distance, the sound of a train

20. But it was not the world:
21. in the world, a thing happens finally, absolutely,
22. the mind cannot reverse it.

23. Castile: nuns walking in pairs through the dark garden.
24. Outside the walls of the Holy Angels
25. children begging for coins

26. When I woke I was crying,
27. has that no reality?

28. I met my love under an orange tree:
29. I have forgotten
30. only the facts, not the inferenceâ€”
31. there were children, somewhere, crying, begging for coins

32. I dreamed everything, I gave myself
33. completely and for all time

34. And the train returned us
35. first to Madrid
36. then to the Basque country
