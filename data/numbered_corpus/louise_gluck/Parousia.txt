1. Love of my life, you
2. Are lost and I am
3. Young again.

4. A few years pass.
5. The air fills
6. With girlish music;
7. In the front yard
8. The apple tree is
9. Studded with blossoms.

10. I try to win you back,
11. That is the point
12. Of the writing.
13. But you are gone forever,
14. As in Russian novels, saying
15. A few words I don't remember-

16. How lush the world is,
17. How full of things that don't belong to me-

18. I watch the blossoms shatter,
19. No longer pink,
20. But old, old, a yellowish white-
21. The petals seem
22. To float on the bright grass,
23. Fluttering slightly.

24. What a nothing you were,
25. To be changed so quickly
26. Into an image, an odor-
27. You are everywhere, source
28. Of wisdom and anguish.
