2. Some people are pigs; I make them
3. Look like pigs.

4. I'm sick of your world
5. That lets the outside disguise the inside. Your men weren't bad men;
6. Undisciplined life
7. Did that to them. As pigs,

21. A pragmatist at heart; nobody sees essence who can't
22. Face limitation. If I wanted only to hold you

23. I could hold you prisoner.
