1. Little soul, little perpetually undressed one,
2. Do now as I bid you, climb
3. The shelf-like branches of the spruce tree;
4. Wait at the top, attentive, like
5. A sentry or look-out. He will be home soon;
6. It behooves you to be
7. Generous. You have not been completely
8. Perfect either; with your troublesome body
9. You have done things you shouldn't
10. Discuss in poems. Therefore
11. Call out to him over the open water, over the bright
12. Water
13. With your dark song, with your grasping,
14. Unnatural song--passionate,
15. Like Maria Callas. Who
16. Wouldn't want you? Whose most demonic appetite
17. Could you possibly fail to answer? Soon
18. He will return from wherever he goes in the
19. Meantime,
20. Suntanned from his time away, wanting
21. His grilled chicken. Ah, you must greet him,
22. You must shake the boughs of the tree
23. To get his attention,
24. But carefully, carefully, lest
25. His beautiful face be marred
26. By too many falling needles.
