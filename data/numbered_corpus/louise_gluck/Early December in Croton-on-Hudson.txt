1. Spiked sun. The Hudson's
2. Whittled down by ice.
3. I hear the bone dice
4. Of blown gravel clicking. Bone-
5. pale, the recent snow
6. Fastens like fur to the river.
7. Standstill. We were leaving to deliver
8. Christmas presents when the tire blew
9. Last year. Above the dead valves pines pared
10. Down by a storm stood, limbs bared . . .
11. I want you.
