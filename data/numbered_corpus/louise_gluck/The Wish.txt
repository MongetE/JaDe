1. Remember that time you made the wish?

2. I make a lot of wishes.

3. The time I lied to you
4. about the butterfly. I always wondered
5. what you wished for.

6. What do you think I wished for?

7. I don't know. That I'd come back,
8. that we'd somehow be together in the end.

9. I wished for what I always wish for.
10. I wished for another poem.
