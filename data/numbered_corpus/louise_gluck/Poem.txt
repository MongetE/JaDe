1. In the early evening, a now, as man is bending
2. over his writing table.
3. Slowly he lifts his head; a woman
4. appears, carrying roses.
5. Her face floats to the surface of the mirror,
6. marked with the green spokes of rose stems.

7. It is a form
8. of suffering: then always the transparent page
9. raised to the window until its veins emerge
10. as words finally filled with ink.

11. And I am meant to understand
12. what binds them together
13. or to the gray house held firmly in place by dusk

14. because I must enter their lives:
15. it is spring, the pear tree
16. filming with weak, white blossoms.
