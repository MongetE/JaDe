1. As I perceive
2. I am dying now and know
3. I will not speak again, will not
4. survive the earth, be summoned
5. out of it again, not
6. a flower yet, a spine only, raw dirt
7. catching my ribs, I call you,
8. father and master: all around,
9. my companions are failing, thinking
10. you do not see. How
11. can they know you see
12. unless you save us?
13. In the summer twilight, are you
14. close enough to hear
15. your child's terror? Or
16. are you not my father,
17. you who raised me?
