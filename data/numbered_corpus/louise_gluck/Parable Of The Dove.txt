1. A dove lived in a village.
2. When it opened its mouth
3. sweetness came out, sound
4. like a silver light around
5. the cherry bough. But
6. the dove wasn't satisfied.

7. It saw the villagers
8. gathered to listen under
9. the blossoming tree.
10. It didn't think: I
11. am higher that they are.
12. It wanted to wealk among them,
13. to experience the violence of human feeling,
14. in part for its song's sake.

15. So it became human.
16. It found passion, it found violence,
17. first conflated, then
18. as separate emotions
19. and these were not
20. contained by music. Thus
21. its song changed,
22. the sweet notes of its longing to become human
23. soured and flattened. Then

24. the world drew back; the mutant
25. fell from love
26. as from the cherry branch,
27. it fell stained with the bloody
28. fruit of the tree.

29. So it is true after all, not merely
30. a rule of art:
31. change your form and you change your nature.
32. And time does this to us.
