1. I became a criminal when I fell in love.
2. Before that I was a waitress.

3. I didn't want to go to Chicago with you.
4. I wanted to marry you, I wanted
5. Your wife to suffer.

6. I wanted her life to be like a play
7. In which all the parts are sad parts.

8. Does a good person
9. Think this way? I deserve

10. Credit for my courage--

11. I sat in the dark on your front porch.
12. Everything was clear to me:
13. If your wife wouldn't let you go
14. That proved she didn't love you.
15. If she loved you
16. Wouldn't she want you to be happy?

17. I think now
18. If I felt less I would be
19. A better person. I was
20. A good waitress.
21. I could carry eight drinks.

22. I used to tell you my dreams.
23. Last night I saw a woman sitting in a dark bus--
24. In the dream, she's weeping, the bus she's on
25. Is moving away. With one hand
26. She's waving; the other strokes
27. An egg carton full of babies.

28. The dream doesn't rescue the maiden.
