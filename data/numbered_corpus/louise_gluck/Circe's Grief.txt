1. In the end, I made myself
2. Known to your wife as
3. A god would, in her own house, in
4. Ithaca, a voice
5. Without a body: she
6. Paused in her weaving, her head turning
7. First to the right, then left
8. Though it was hopeless of course
9. To trace that sound to any
10. Objective source: I doubt
11. She will return to her loom
12. With what she knows now. When
13. You see her again, tell her
14. This is how a god says goodbye:
15. If I am in her head forever
16. I am in your life forever.
