1. I asked for much; I received much.
2. I asked for much; I received little, I received
3. next to nothing.

4. And between? A few umbrellas opened indoors.
5. A pair of shoes by mistake on the kitchen table.

6. O wrong, wrong—it was my nature. I was
7. hard-hearted, remote. I was
8. selfish, rigid to the point of tyranny.

9. But I was always that person, even in early childhood.
10. Small, dark-haired, dreaded by the other children.
11. I never changed. Inside the glass, the abstract
12. tide of fortune turned
13. from high to low overnight.

14. Was it the sea? Responding, maybe,
15. to celestial force? To be safe,
16. I prayed. I tried to be a better person.
17. Soon it seemed to me that what began as terror
18. and matured into moral narcissism
19. might have become in fact
20. actual human growth. Maybe
21. this is what my friends meant, taking my hand,
22. telling me they understood
23. the abuse, the incredible shit I accepted,
24. implying (so I once thought) I was a little sick
25. to give so much for so little.
26. Whereas they meant I was good (clasping my hand intensely)—
27. a good friend and person, not a creature of pathos.

28. I was not pathetic! I was writ large,
29. like a queen or a saint.

30. Well, it all makes for interesting conjecture.
31. And it occurs to me that what is crucial is to believe
32. in effort, to believe some good will come of simply trying,
33. a good completely untainted by the corrupt initiating impulse
34. to persuade or seduce—

35. What are we without this?
36. Whirling in the dark universe,
37. alone, afraid, unable to influence fate—

38. What do we have really?
39. Sad tricks with ladders and shoes,
40. tricks with salt, impurely motivated recurring
41. attempts to build character.
42. What do we have to appease the great forces?

43. And I think in the end this was the question
44. that destroyed Agamemnon, there on the beach,
45. the Greek ships at the ready, the sea
46. invisible beyond the serene harbor, the future
47. lethal, unstable: he was a fool, thinking
48. it could be controlled. He should have said
49. I have nothing, I am at your mercy.
