1. The bicycles go by in twos and threes -
2. There's a dance in Billy Brennan's barn to-night,
3. And there's the half-talk code of mysteries
4. And the wink-and-elbow language of delight.
5. Half-past eight and there is not a spot
6. Upon a mile of road, no shadow thrown
7. That might turn out a man or woman, not
8. A footfall tapping secrecies of stone.
9. I have what every poet hates in spite
10. Of all the solemn talk of contemplation.
11. Oh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight
12. Of being king and government and nation.
13. A road, a mile of kingdom, I am king
14. Of banks and stones and every blooming thing.
