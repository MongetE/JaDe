1. On an apple-ripe September morning
2. Through the mist-chill fields I went
3. With a pitch-fork on my shoulder
4. Less for use than for devilment.

5. The threshing mill was set-up, I knew,
6. In Cassidy's haggard last night,
7. And we owed them a day at the threshing
8. Since last year. O it was delight

9. To be paying bills of laughter
10. And chaffy gossip in kind
11. With work thrown in to ballast
12. The fantasy-soaring mind.

13. As I crossed the wooden bridge I wondered
14. As I looked into the drain
15. If ever a summer morning should find me
16. Shovelling up eels again.

17. And  I thought of the wasps' nest in the bank
18. And how I got chased one day
19. Leaving the drag and the scraw-knife behind,
20. How I covered my face with hay.

21. The wet leaves of the cocksfoot
22. Polished my boots as I
23. Went round by the glistening bog-holes
24. Lost in unthinking joy.

25. I'll be carrying bags to-day, I mused,
26. The best job at the mill
27. With plenty of time to talk of our loves
28. As we wait for the bags to fill.

29. Maybe Mary might call round…
30. And then I came to the haggard gate,
31. And I knew as I entered that I had come
32. Through fields that were part of no earthly estate.
