1. One side of the potato-pits was white with frost -
2. How wonderful that was, how wonderful!
3. And when we put our ears to the paling-post
4. The music that came out was magical.

5. The light between the ricks of hay and straw
6. Was a hole in Heaven's gable. An apple tree
7. With its December-glinting fruit we saw -
8. O you, Eve, were the world that tempted me.

9. To eat the knowledge that grew in clay
10. And death the germ within it! Now and then
11. I can remember something of the gay
12. Garden that was childhood's. Again.

13. The tracks of cattle to a drinking-place,
14. A green stone lying sideways in a ditch,
15. Or any common sight, the transfigured face
16. Of a beauty that the world did not touch.

17. My father played the melodion
18. Outside at our gate;
19. There were stars in the morning east
20. And they danced to his music.

21. Across the wild bogs his melodion called
22. To Lennons and Callans.
23. As I pulled on my trousers in a hurry
24. I knew some strange thing had happened.

25. Outside in the cow-house my mother
26. Made the music of milking;
27. The light of her stable-lamp was a star
28. And the frost of Bethlehem made it twinkle.

29. A water-hen screeched in the bog,
30. Mass-going feet
31. Crunched the wafer-ice on the pot-holes,
32. Somebody wistfully twisted the bellows wheel.

33. My child poet picked out the letters
34. On the grey stone,
35. In silver the wonder of a Christmas townland,
36. The winking glitter of a frosty dawn.

37. Cassiopeia was over
38. Cassidy's hanging hill,
39. I looked and three whin bushes rode across
40. The horizon — the Three Wise Kings.

41. And old man passing said:
42. ‘Can't he make it talk -
43. The melodion.' I hid in the doorway
44. And tightened the belt of my box-pleated coat.

45. I nicked six nicks on the door-post
46. With my penknife's big blade -
47. there was a little one for cutting tobacco.
48. And I was six Christmases of age.

49. My father played the melodion,
50. My mother milked the cows,
51. And I had a prayer like a white rose pinned
52. On the Virgin Mary's blouse.
