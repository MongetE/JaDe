1. There's a wind blowing
2. Cold through the corridors,
3. A ghost-wind,
4. The flapping of defeated wings,
5. A hell-fantasy
6. From meadows damned
7. To eternal April

8. And listening, listening
9. To the wind
10. I hear
11. The throat-rattle of dying men,
12. From whose ears oozes
13. Foamy blood,
14. Throttled in a brothel.

15. I see brightly
16. In the wind vacancies
17. Saint Thomas Aquinas
18. And 
19. Poetry blossoms
20. Excitingly
21. As the first flower of truth.
