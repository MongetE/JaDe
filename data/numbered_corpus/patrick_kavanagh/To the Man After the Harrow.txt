1. Now leave the check-reins slack,
2. The seed is flying far today -
3. The seed like stars against the black
4. Eternity of April clay.

5. This seed is potent as the seed
6. Of knowledge in the Hebrew Book,
7. So drive your horses in the creed
8. Of God the Father as a stook.

9. Forget the men on Brady's Hill.
10. Forget what Brady's boy may say.
11. For destiny will not fulfil
12. Unless you let the harrow play.

13. Forget the worm's opinion too
14. Of hooves and pointed harrow-pins,
15. For you are driving your horses through
16. The mist where Genesis begins.
