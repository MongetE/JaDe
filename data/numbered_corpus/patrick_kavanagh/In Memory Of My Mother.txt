1. I do not think of you lying in the wet clay
2. Of a Monaghan graveyard; I see
3. You walking down a lane among the poplars
4. On your way to the station, or happily

5. Going to second Mass on a summer Sunday -
6. You meet me and you say:
7. 'Don't forget to see about the cattle - '
8. Among your earthiest words the angels stray.

9. And I think of you walking along a headland
10. Of green oats in June,
11. So full of repose, so rich with life -
12. And I see us meeting at the end of a town

13. On a fair day by accident, after
14. The bargains are all made and we can walk
15. Together through the shops and stalls and markets
16. Free in the oriental streets of thought.

17. O you are not lying in the wet clay,
18. For it is a harvest evening now and we
19. Are piling up the ricks against the moonlight
20. And you smile up at us Â - eternally.
