1. We borrowed the loan of Kerr's ass
2. To go to Dundalk with butter,
3. Brought him home the evening before the market
4. And exile that night in Mucker.

5. We heeled up the cart before the door,
6. We took the harness inside —
7. The straw-stuffed straddle, the broken breeching
8. With bits of bull-wire tied;

9. The winkers that had no choke-band,
10. The collar and the reins . . . 
11. In Ealing Broadway, London Town
12. I name their several names

13. Until a world comes to life —
14. Morning, the silent bog,
15. And the God of imagination waking
16. In a Mucker fog.
