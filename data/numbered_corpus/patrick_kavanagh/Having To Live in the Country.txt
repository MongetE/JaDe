2. Exiled from thought and feeling, 
3. A mean brutality reigns: 
4. It is really a horrible position to be in 
5. And I equate myself with Dante 
6. And all who have lived outside civilization. 
7. It isn't a question of place but of people; 
8. Wordsworth and Coleridge lived apart from the common man, 
9. Their friends called on them regularly. 
10. Swift is in a somewhat different category 
11. He was a genuine exile and his heavy heart 
12. Weighed him down in Dublin. 
13. Yet even he had compensations for in the Deanery 
14. He received many interesting friends 
15. And it was the eighteenth century. 

16. I suppose that having to live 
17. Among men whose rages 
18. Are for small wet hills full of stones 
19. When one man buys a patch and pays a high price for it 
20. That is not the end of his paying. 
21. "Go home and have another bastard" shout the children, 
22. Cousin of the underbidder, to the young wife of the purchaser. 
23. The first child was born after six months of marriage, 
24. Desperate people, desperate animals. 
25. What must happen the poor priest 
26. Somewhat educated who has to believe that these people have souls 
27. As bright as a poet's - though I don't, mind, speak for myself.
