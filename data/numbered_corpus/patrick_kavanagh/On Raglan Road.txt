1. On Raglan Road on an autumn day I met her first and knew 
2. That her dark hair would weave a snare that I might one day rue; 
3. I saw the danger, yet I walked along the enchanted way, 
4. And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day. 

5. On Grafton Street in November we tripped lightly along the ledge 
6. Of the deep ravine where can be seen the worth of passion's pledge, 
7. The Queen of Hearts still making tarts and I not making hay - 
8. O I loved too much and by such and such is happiness thrown away. 

9. I gave her gifts of the mind I gave her the secret sign that's known 
10. To the artists who have known the true gods of sound and stone 
11. And word and tint. I did not stint for I gave her poems to say. 
12. With her own name there and her own dark hair like clouds over fields of May 

13. On a quiet street where old ghosts meet I see her walking now 
14. Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow 
15. That I had wooed not as I should a creature made of clay - 
16. When the angel woos the clay he'd lose his wings at the dawn of day.
