1. And sometimes I am sorry when the grass
2. Is growing over the stones in quiet hollows
3. And the cocksfoot leans across the rutted cart-pass
4. That I am not the voice of country fellows
5. Who now are standing by some headland talking
6. Of turnips and potatoes or young corn
7. Of turf banks stripped for victory.
8. Here Peace is still hawking 
9. His coloured combs and scarves and beads of horn.

10. Upon a headland by a whinny hedge 
11. A hare sits looking down a leaf-lapped furrow
12. There's an old plough upside-down on a weedy ridge
13. And someone is shouldering home a saddle-harrow.
14. Out of that childhood country what fools climb
15. To fight with tyrants Love and Life and Time?
