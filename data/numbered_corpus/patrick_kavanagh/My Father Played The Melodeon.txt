1. My father played the melodeon
2. Outside at our gate,
3. There were stars in the morning east
4. And they danced to his music.

5. Across the world bogs his melodeon called
6. To Lennons and Callans
7. As I pulled on my trousers in a hurry
8. I knew some strange thing had happened.

9. Outside in the cow-house my mother
10. Made the music of milking,
11. The light of the stable-lamp was a star
12. And the frost of Bethlehem made it twinkle.

13. A water-hen screeched in the bog,
14. Mass-going feet
15. Crunched the wafer-ice on the polt-holes - 
16. Somebody wistfully twisted a bellow's wheel.

17. My child-poet picked out the letters
18. On Time's black stone,
19. In silver the wonder of a Christmas townland
20. The winking glitter of a frosty dawn.

21. Cassiopea was over
22. Cassidy's hanging hill.
23. I looked and three whin bushes rode acoss
24. The horizon - the Three Wise Kings.

25. My father played the melodeon,
26. My mother milked the cows 
27. And I had a prayer like a white rose pinned
28. On the Virgin Mary's blouse.
