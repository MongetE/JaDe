1. They laughed at one I loved-
2. The triangular hill that hung
3. Under the Big Forth. They said 
4. That I was bounded by the whitethorn hedges
5. Of the little farm and did not know the world.
6. But I knew that love's doorway to life
7. Is the same doorway everywhere.
8. Ashamed of what I loved
9. I flung her from me and called her a ditch
10. Although she was smiling at me with violets.

11. But now I am back in her briary arms
12. The dew of an Indian Summer lies
13. On bleached potato-stalks 
14. What age am I?

15. I do not know what age I am,
16. I am no mortal age;
17. I know nothing of women,
18. Nothing of cities,
19. I cannot die
20. Unless I walk outside these whitethorn hedges.
