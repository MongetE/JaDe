1. O stony grey soil of Monaghan
2. The laugh from my love you thieved;
3. You took the gay child of my passion
4. And gave me your clod-conceived.

5. You clogged the feet of my boyhood
6. And I believed that my stumble
7. Had the poise and stride of Apollo
8. And his voice my thick tongued mumble.

9. You told me the plough was immortal!
10. O green-life conquering plough!
11. The mandril stained, your coulter blunted
12. In the smooth lea-field of my brow.

13. You sang on steaming dunghills
14. A song of cowards' brood,
15. You perfumed my clothes with weasel itch,
16. You fed me on swinish food

17. You flung a ditch on my vision
18. Of beauty, love and truth.
19. O stony grey soil of Monaghan
20. You burgled my bank of youth!

21. Lost the long hours of pleasure
22. All the women that love young men.
23. O can I still stroke the monster's back
24. Or write with unpoisoned pen.

25. His name in these lonely verses
26. Or mention the dark fields where
27. The first gay flight of my lyric
28. Got caught in a peasant's prayer.

29. Mullahinsa, Drummeril, Black Shanco-
30. Wherever I turn I see
31. In the stony grey soil of Monaghan
32. Dead loves that were born for me.
