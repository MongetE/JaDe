1. Upon a bank I sat, a child made seer
2. Of one small primrose flowering in my mind.
3. Better than wealth it is, I said, to find
4. One small page of Truth's manuscript made clear.
5. I looked at Christ transfigured without fear—
6. The light was very beautiful and kind,
7. And where the Holy Ghost in flame had signed
8. I read it through the lenses of a tear.
9. And then my sight grew dim, I could not see
10. The primrose that had lighted me to Heaven,
11. And there was but the shadow of a tree
12. Ghostly among the stars.  The years that pass
13. Like tired soldiers nevermore have given
14. Moments to see wonders in the grass.
