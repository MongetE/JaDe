1. Every old man I see
2. Reminds me of my father
3. When he had fallen in love with death
4. One time when sheaves were gathered.

5. That man I saw in Gardner Street
6. Stumbled on the kerb was one,
7. He stared at me half-eyed,
8. I might have been his son.

9. And I remember the musician
10. Faltering over his fiddle
11. In Bayswater, London,
12. He too set me the riddle.

13. Every old man I see
14. In October-coloured weather
15. Seems to say to me:
16. "I was once your father."
