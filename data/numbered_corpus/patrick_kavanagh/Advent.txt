1. We have tested and tasted too much, lover-
2. Through a chink too wide there comes in no wonder.
3. But here in the Advent-darkened room
4. Where the dry black bread and the sugarless tea
5. Of penance will charm back the luxury
6. Of a child's soul, we'll return to Doom
7. The knowledge we stole but could not use.

8. And the newness that was in every stale thing
9. When we looked at it as children: the spirit-shocking
10. Wonder in a black slanting Ulster hill
11. Or the prophetic astonishment in the tedious talking
12. Of an old fool will awake for us and bring
13. You and me to the yard gate to watch the whins
14. And the bog-holes, cart-tracks, old stables where Time begins.

15. O after Christmas we'll have no need to go searching
16. For the difference that sets an old phrase burning-
17. We'll hear it in the whispered argument of a churning
18. Or in the streets where the village boys are lurching.
19. And we'll hear it among decent men too
20. Who barrow dung in gardens under trees,
21. Wherever life pours ordinary plenty.
22. Won't we be rich, my love and I, and
23. God we shall not ask for reason's payment,
24. The why of heart-breaking strangeness in dreeping hedges
25. Nor analyse God's breath in common statement.
26. We have thrown into the dust-bin the clay-minted wages
27. Of pleasure, knowledge and the conscious hour-
28. And Christ comes with a January flower.
