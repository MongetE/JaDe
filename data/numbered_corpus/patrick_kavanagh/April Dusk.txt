1. April dusk
2. It is tragic to be a poet now
3. And not a lover
4. Paradised under the mutest bough.

5. I look through my window and see
6. The ghost of life flitting bat-winged.
7. O I am as old as a sage can even be,
8. O I am as lonely as the first fool kinged.

9. The horse in his stall turns away
10. From the hay-filled manger, dreaming of grass
11. Soft and cool in hollows. Does he neigh
12. Jealousy-words for John MacGuigan's ass
13. That never was civilised in stall or trace.

14. An unmusical ploughboy whistles down the lane
15. Not worried at all about the fate of Europe.
16. While I sit here feeling the subtle pain
17. Of one whose Tree of God has been uprooted.
