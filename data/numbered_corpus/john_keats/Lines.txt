1. UNFELT unheard, unseen,
2. I've left my little queen,
3. Her languid arms in silver slumber lying:
4. Ah! through their nestling touch,
5. Who---who could tell how much
6. There is for madness---cruel, or complying?

7. Those faery lids how sleek!
8. Those lips how moist!---they speak,
9. In ripest quiet, shadows of sweet sounds:
10. Into my fancy's ear
11. Melting a burden dear,
12. How "Love doth know no fulness, nor no bounds."

13. True!---tender monitors!
14. I bend unto your laws:
15. This sweetest day for dalliance was born!
16. So, without more ado,
17. I'll feel my heaven anew,
18. For all the blushing of the hasty morn.

19. .
