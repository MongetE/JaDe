1. How many bards gild the lapses of time!
2. A few of them have ever been the food
3. Of my delighted fancy,—I could brood
4. Over their beauties, earthly, or sublime:
5. And often, when I sit me down to rhyme,
6. These will in throngs before my mind intrude:
7. But no confusion, no disturbance rude
8. Do they occasion; 'tis a pleasing chime.
9. So the unnumbered sounds that evening store;
10. The songs of birds—the whispering of the leaves—
11. The voice of waters—the great bell that heaves
12. With solemn sound,—and thousand others more,
13. That distance of recognizance bereaves,
14. Makes pleasing music, and not wild uproar.
