1. IN drear-nighted December,
2. Too happy, happy tree,
3. Thy branches ne'er remember
4. Their green felicity:
5. The north cannot undo them
6. With a sleety whistle through them;
7. Nor frozen thawings glue them
8. From budding at the prime.

9. In drear-nighted December,
10. Too happy, happy brook,
11. Thy bubblings ne'er remember
12. Apollo's summer look;
13. But with a sweet forgetting,
14. They stay their crystal fretting,
15. Never, never petting
16. About the frozen time.

17. Ah! would 'twere so with many
18. A gentle girl and boy!
19. But were there ever any
20. Writhed not at passed joy?
21. The feel of not to feel it,
22. When there is none to heal it
23. Nor numbed sense to steel it,
24. Was never said in rhyme.
