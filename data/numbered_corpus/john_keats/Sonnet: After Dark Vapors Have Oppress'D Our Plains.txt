1. After dark vapors have oppress'd our plains
2. For a long dreary season, comes a day
3. Born of the gentle South, and clears away
4. From the sick heavens all unseemly stains.
5. The anxious month, relieved of its pains,
6. Takes as a long-lost right the feel of May;
7. The eyelids with the passing coolness play
8. Like rose leaves with the drip of Summer rains.
9. The calmest thoughts came round us; as of leaves
10. Budding -- fruit ripening in stillness -- Autumn suns
11. Smiling at eve upon the quiet sheaves --
12. Sweet Sappho's cheek -- a smiling infant's breath --
13. The gradual sand that through an hour-glass runs --
14. A woodland rivulet -- a Poet's death.
