1. Where's the Poet? show him! show him,
2. Muses nine! that I may know him.
3. 'Tis the man who with a man
4. Is an equal, be he King,
5. Or poorest of the beggar-clan
6. Or any other wonderous thing
7. A man may be 'twixt ape and Plato;
8. 'Tis the man who with a bird,
9. Wren or Eagle, finds his way to
10. All its instincts; he hath heard
11. The Lion's roaring, and can tell
12. What his horny throat expresseth,
13. And to him the Tiger's yell
14. Come articulate and presseth
15. Or his ear like mother-tongue.
