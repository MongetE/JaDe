1. O that a week could be an age, and we
2. Felt parting and warm meeting every week,
3. Then one poor year a thousand years would be,
4. The flush of welcome ever on the cheek:
5. So could we live long life in little space,
6. So time itself would be annihilate,
7. So a day's journey in oblivious haze
8. To serve ourjoys would lengthen and dilate.
9. O to arrive each Monday morn from Ind!
10. To land each Tuesday from the rich Levant!
11. In little time a host of joys to bind,
12. And keep our souls in one eternal pant!
13. This morn, my friend, and yester-evening taught
14. Me how to harbour such a happy thought.
