1. Great spirits now on earth are sojourning;
2. He of the cloud, the cataract, the lake,
3. Who on Helvellyn's summit, wide awake,
4. Catches his freshness from Archangel's wing:
5. He of the rose, the violet, the spring,
6. The social smile, the chain for Freedom's sake:
7. And lo!--whose stedfastness would never take
8. A meaner sound than Raphaelâ€™s whispering.
9. And other spirits there are standing apart
10. Upon the forehead of the age to come;
11. These, these will give the world another heart,
12. And other pulses. Hear ye not the hum
13. Of mighty workings?-------
14. Listen awhile ye nations, and be dumb.
