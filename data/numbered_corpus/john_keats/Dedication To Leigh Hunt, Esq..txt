1. Glory and loveliness have pass'd away;
2. For if we wander out in early morn,
3. No wreathed incense do we see upborne
4. Into the east, to meet the smiling day:
5. No crowd of nymphs soft voic'd and young, and gay,
6. In woven baskets bringing ears of corn,
7. Roses, and pinks, and violets, to adorn
8. The shrine of Flora in her early May.
9. But there are left delights as high as these,
10. And I shall ever bless my destiny,
11. That in a time, when under pleasant trees
12. Pan is no longer sought, I feel a free,
13. A leafy luxury, seeing I could please
14. With these poor offerings, a man like thee.
