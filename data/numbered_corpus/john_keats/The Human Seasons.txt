1. Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;
2. There are four seasons in the mind of man:
3. He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear
4. Takes in all beauty with an easy span:
5. He has his Summer, when luxuriously
6. Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves
7. To ruminate, and by such dreaming high
8. Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves
9. His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings
10. He furleth close; contented so to look
11. On mists in idleness--to let fair things
12. Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.
13. He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,
14. Or else he would forego his mortal nature.
