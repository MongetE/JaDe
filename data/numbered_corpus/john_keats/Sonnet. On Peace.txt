1. O PEACE! and dost thou with thy presence bless
2. The dwellings of this war-surrounded Isle;
3. Soothing with placid brow our late distress,
4. Making the triple kingdom brightly smile?
5. Joyful I hail thy presence; and I hail
6. The sweet companions that await on thee;
7. Complete my joy let not my first wish fail,
8. Let the sweet mountain nymph thy favourite be,
9. With England's happiness proclaim Europa's Liberty.
10. O Europe! let not sceptred tyrants see
11. That thou must shelter in thy former state;
12. Keep thy chains burst, and boldly say thou art free;
13. Give thy kings law leave not uncurbed the great ;
14. So with the horrors past thou'lt win thy happier fate!
