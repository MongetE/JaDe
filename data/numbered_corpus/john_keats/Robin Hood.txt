1. To A Friend

2. NO! those days are gone away,
3. And their hours are old and gray,
4. And their minutes buried all
5. Under the down-trodden pall
6. Ofthe leaves of many years:
7. Many times have winter's shears,
8. Frozen North, and chilling East,
9. Sounded tempests to the feast
10. Of the forest's whispering fleeces,
11. Since men knew nor rent nor leases.

12. No, the bugle sounds no more,
13. And the twanging bow no more;
14. Silent is the ivory shrill
15. Past the heath and up the hill;
16. There is no mid-forest laugh,
17. Where lone Echo gives the half
18. To some wight, amaz'd to hear
19. Jesting, deep in forest drear.

20. On the fairest time of June
21. You may go, with sun or moon,
22. Or the seven stars to light you,
23. Or the polar ray to right you;
24. But you never may behold
25. Little John, or Robin bold;
26. Never one, of all the clan,
27. Thrumming on an empty can
28. Some old hunting ditty, while
29. He doth his green way beguile
30. To fair hostess Merriment,
31. Down beside the pasture Trent;
32. For he left the merry tale,
33. Messenger for spicy ale.

34. Gone, the merry morris din;
35. Gone, the song of Gamelyn;
36. Gone, the tough-belted outlaw
37. Idling in the 'grene shawe';
38. All are gone away and past!
39. And if Robin should be cast
40. Sudden from his turfed grave,
41. And if Marian should have
42. Once again her forest days,
43. She would weep, and he would craze:
44. He would swear, for all his oaks,
45. Fall'n beneath the dockyard strokes,
46. Have rotted on the briny seas;
47. She would weep that her wild bees
48. Sang not to her- -strange! that honey
49. Can't be got without hard money!

50. So it is; yet let us sing
51. Honour to the old bow-string!
52. Honour to the bugle-horn!
53. Honour to the woods unshorn!
54. Honour to the Lincoln green!
55. Honour to the archer keen!
56. Honour to tight little John,
57. And the horse he rode upon!
58. Honour to bold Robin Hood,
59. Sleeping in the underwood!
60. Honour to maid Marian,
61. And to all the Sherwood clan!
62. Though their days have hurried by
63. Let us two a burden try.
