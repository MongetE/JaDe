1. A FRAGMENT OF A TRAGEDY
2. ACT I.
3. SCENE I. Field of Battle.
4. Alarum. Enter King STEPHEN, Knights, and Soldiers.
5. Stephen. If shame can on a soldier's vein-swoll’n front
6. Spread deeper crimson than the battle's toil,
7. Blush in your casing helmets! for see, see!
8. Yonder my chivalry, my pride of war,
9. Wrench'd with an iron hand from firm array,
10. Are routed loose about the plashy meads,
11. Of honour forfeit. O that my known voice
12. Could reach your dastard ears, and fright you more!
13. Fly, cowards, fly! Glocester is at your backs!
14. Throw your slack bridles o'er the flurried manes,
15. Ply well the rowel with faint trembling heels,
16. Scampering to death at last!
17. First Knight. The enemy
18. Bears his flaunt standard close upon their rear.
19. Second Knight. Sure of a bloody prey, seeing the fens
20. Will swamp them girth-deep.
21. Stephen. Over head and ears,
22. No matter! 'Tis a gallant enemy;
23. How like a comet he goes streaming on.
24. But we must plague him in the flank, hey, friends?
25. We are well breathed, follow!
26. Enter Earl BALDWIN and Soldiers, as defeated.
27. Stephen. De Redvers!
28. What is the monstrous bugbear that can fright
29. Baldwin?
30. Baldwin. No scare-crow, but the fortunate star
31. Of boisterous Chester, whose fell truncheon now
32. Points level to the goal of victory.
33. This way he comes, and if you would maintain
34. Your person unaffronted by vile odds,

35. Take horse, my Lord.
36. Stephen. And which way spur for life?
37. Now I thank Heaven I am in the toils,
38. That soldiers may bear witness how my arm
39. Can burst the meshes. Not the eagle more
40. Loves to beat up against a tyrannous blast,
41. Than I to meet the torrent of my foes.
42. This is a brag, be 't so, but if I fall,
43. Carve it upon my 'scutcheon'd sepulchre.
44. On, fellow soldiers! Earl of Redvers, back!
45. Not twenty Earls of Chester shall brow-beat
46. The diadem. [Exeunt. Alarum.

47. SCENE II. Another part of the Field.
48. Trumpets sounding a Victory. Enter GLOCESTER. Knights, and Forces.
49. Glocester. Now may we lift our bruised vizors up,
50. And take the flattering freshness of the air,
51. While the wide din of battle dies away
52. Into times past, yet to be echoed sure
53. In the silent pages of our chroniclers.
54. First Knight. Will Stephen's death be marked there, my good
55. Lord,
56. Or that we gave him lodging in yon towers?
57. Glocester. Fain would I know the great usurper's fate.
58. Enter two Captains severally.
59. First Captain. My Lord!
60. Second Captain. Most noble Earl!
61. First Captain. The King
62. Second Captain. The Empress greets
63. Glocester. What of the King?
64. First Captain. He sole and lone maintains
65. A hopeless bustle mid our swarming arms,
66. And with a nimble savageness attacks,
67. Escapes, makes fiercer onset, then anew
68. Eludes death, giving death to most that dare
69. Trespass within the circuit of his sword!
70. He must by this have fallen. Baldwin is taken;
71. And for the Duke of Bretagne, like a stag
72. He flies, for the Welsh beagles to hunt down.
73. God save the Empress!
74. Glocester. Now our dreaded Queen:
75. What message from her Highness?
76. Second Captain. Royal Maud
77. From the throng'd towers of Lincoln hath look'd down,
78. Like Pallas from the walls of Ilion,
79. And seen her enemies havock'd at her feet.
80. She greets most noble Glocester from her heart,
81. Intreating him, his captains, and brave knights,
82. To grace a banquet. The high city gates
83. Are envious which shall see your triumph pass;
84. The streets are full of music.
85. Enter Second Knight.
86. Glocester. Whence come you?
87. Second Knight. From Stephen, my good Prince, Stephen!
88. Stephen!
89. Glocester. Why do you make such echoing of his name?
90. Second Knight. Because I think, my lord, he is no man,
91. But a fierce demon, Anointed safe from wounds,
92. And misbaptized with a Christian name.
93. Glocester. A mighty soldier! Does he still hold out?
94. Second Knight. He shames our victory. His valour still
95. Keeps elbow-room amid our eager swords,
96. And holds our bladed falchions all aloof
97. His gleaming battle-axe being slaughter-sick,
98. Smote on the morion of a Flemish knight,
99. Broke short in his hand; upon the which he flung
100. The heft away with such a vengeful force,

101. It paunch'd the Earl of Chester's horse, who then
102. Spleen-hearted came in full career at him.
103. Glocester. Did no one take him at a vantage then?
104. Second Knight. Three then with tiger leap upon him flew,
105. Whom, with his sword swift-drawn and nimbly held,
106. He stung away again, and stood to breathe,
107. Smiling. Anon upon him rush'd once more
108. A throng of foes, and in this renew'd strife,
109. My sword met his and snapp'd off at the hilts.
110. Glocester. Come, lead me to this Mars and let us move
111. In silence, not insulting his sad doom
112. With clamorous trumpets. To the Empress bear
113. My salutation as befits the time.
114. [Exeunt GLOCESTER and Forces.

115. SCENE III. The Field of Battle. Enter STEPHEN unarmed.
116. Stephen. Another sword! And what if I could seize
117. One from Bellona's gleaming armoury,
118. Or choose the fairest of her sheaved spears!
119. Where are my enemies? Here, close at hand,
120. Here come the testy brood. O for a sword!
121. I'm faint a biting sword! A noble sword!
122. A hedge-stake or a ponderous stone to hurl
123. With brawny vengeance, like the labourer Cain.
124. Come on! Farewell my kingdom, and all hail
125. Thou superb, plum'd, and helmeted renown,
126. All hail I would not truck this brilliant day
127. To rule in Pylos with a Nestor's beard
128. Come on!
129. Enter DE KAIMS and Knights, &c.
130. De Kaims. Is 't madness, or a hunger after death,
131. That makes thee thus unarm'd throw taunts at us?
132. Yield, Stephen, or my sword's point dip in
133. 'he gloomy current of a traitor's heart.
134. Stephen. Do it, De Kaims, I will not budge an inch.
135. De Kaims. Yes, of thy madness thou shalt take the meed.
136. Stephen. Darest thou?
137. De Kaims. How dare, against a man disarmed?
138. Stephen. What weapons has the lion but himself?
139. Come not near me, De Kaims, for by the price
140. Of all the glory I have won this day,
141. Being a king, I will not yield alive
142. To any but the second man of the realm,
143. Robert of Glocester.
144. De Kaims. Thou shalt vail to me.
145. Stephen. Shall I, when I have sworn against it, sir?
146. Thou think'st it brave to take a breathing king,
147. That, on a court-day bow'd to haughty Maud,
148. The awed presence-chamber may be bold
149. To whisper, there's the man who took alive
150. Stephen me prisoner. Certes, De Kaims,
151. The ambition is a noble one.
152. De Kaims. 'Tis true,
153. And, Stephen, I must compass it.
154. Stephen. No, no,
155. Do not tempt me to throttle you on the gorge,
156. Or with my gauntlet crush your hollow breast,
157. Just when your knighthood is grown ripe and full
158. For lordship.
159. A Soldier. Is an honest yeoman's spear
160. Of no use at a need? Take that.
161. Stephen. Ah, dastard!
162. De Kaims. What, you are vulnerable! my prisoner I
163. Stephen. No, not yet. I disclaim it, and demand
164. Death as a sovereign right unto a king
165. Who 'sdains to yield to any but his peer,
166. If not in title, yet in noble deeds,
167. The Earl of Glocester. Stab to the hilts, De Kaims,
168. For I will never by mean hands be led
169. From this so famous field. Do ye hear! Be quick!
170. [Trumpets. Enter the Earl of CHESTER and Knights.

171. SCENE IV. A Presence Chamber. Queen MAUD in a Chair of State, the
172. Earls of GLOCESTER and CHESTER, Lords, Attendants.
173. Maud. Glocester, no more: I will behold that Boulogne:
174. Set him before me. Not for the poor sake
175. Of regal pomp and a vain-glorious hour,
176. As thou with wary speech, yet near enough,
177. Hast hinted.
178. Glocester. Faithful counsel have I given ;
179. If wary, for your Highness' benefit.
180. Maud. The Heavens forbid that I should not think so,
181. For by thy valour have I won this realm,
182. Which by thy wisdom I will ever keep.
183. To sage advisers let me ever bend
184. 'A meek attentive ear, so that they treat
185. Of the wide kingdom's rule and government,
186. Not trenching on our actions personal.
187. Advis'd, not school'd, I would be; and henceforth
188. Spoken to in clear, plain, and open terms,
189. Not side-ways sermon'd at.
190. Glocester. Then, in plain terms,
191. Once more for the fallen king
192. Maud. Your pardon, Brother,
193. I would no more of that; for, as I said,
194. ‘Tis not for worldly pomp I wish to see
195. The rebel, but as dooming judge to give
196. A sentence something worthy of his guilt.
197. Glocester. If 't must be so, I'll bring him to your presence.
198. [Exit GLOCESTER,
199. Maud. A meaner summoner might do as well
200. My Lord of Chester, is 't true what I hear
201. Of Stephen of Boulogne, our prisoner,
202. That he, as a fit penance for his crimes,
203. Eats wholesome, sweet, and palatable food
204. Off Glocester's golden dishes drinks pure wine,
205. Lodgest soft?
206. Chester. More than that, my gracious Queen,
207. Has anger'd me. The noble Earl, methinks,
208. Full soldier as he is, and without peer
209. In counsel, dreams too much among his books.
210. It may read well, but sure 'tis out of date
211. To play the Alexander with Darius.
212. Maud. Truth! I think so. By Heavens it shall not last!
213. Chester. It would amaze your Highness now to mark
214. How Glocester overstrains his courtesy
215. To that crime-loving rebel, that Boulogne
216. Maud. That ingrate!
217. Chester. For whose vast ingratitude
218. To our late sovereign lord, your noble sire,
219. The generous Earl condoles in his mishaps,
220. And with a sort of lackeying friendliness,
221. Talks off the mighty frowning from his brow,
222. Woos him to hold a duet in a smile,
223. Or, if it please him, play an hour at chess
224. Maud. A perjured slave!
225. Chester. And for his perjury,
226. Glocester has fit rewards nay, I believe,
227. He sets his bustling household's wits at work
228. For flatteries to ease this Stephen's hours,
229. And make a heaven of his purgatory ;

230. Adorning bondage with the pleasant gloss
231. Of feasts and music, and all idle shows
232. Of indoor pageantry; while syren whispers,
233. Predestined for his ear, 'scape as half-check'd
234. From lips the courtliest and the rubiest
235. Of all the realm, admiring of his deeds.
236. Maud. A frost upon his summer!
237. Chester. A queen's nod
238. Can make his June December. Here he comes
