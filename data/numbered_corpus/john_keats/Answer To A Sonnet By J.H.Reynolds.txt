1. "Dark eyes are dearer far
2. Than those that mock the hyacinthine bell."

3. Blue! 'Tis the life of heaven,—the domain
4. Of Cynthia,—the wide palace of the sun,—
5. The tent of Hesperus, and all his train,—
6. The bosomer of clouds, gold, gray, and dun.
7. Blue! 'Tis the life of waters:—Ocean
8. And all its vassal streams, pools numberless,
9. May rage, and foam, and fret, but never can
10. Subside, if not to dark-blue nativeness.
11. Blue! gentle cousin of the forest-green,
12. Married to green in all the sweetest flowers—
13. Forget-me-not,—the blue-bell,—and, that queen
14. Of secrecy, the violet: what strange powers
15. Hast thou, as a mere shadow! But how great,
16. When in an Eye thou art alive with fate!
