1. Cat! who hast pass’d thy grand climacteric,
2. How many mice and rats hast in thy days
3. Destroy’d? How many tit bits stolen? Gaze
4. With those bright languid segments green, and prick
5. Those velvet ears - but pr’ythee do not stick
6. Thy latent talons in me - and upraise
7. Thy gentle mew - and tell me all thy frays,
8. Of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick.
9. Nay, look not down, nor lick thy dainty wrists -
10. For all thy wheezy asthma - and for all
11. Thy tail’s tip is nick’d off - and though the fists
12. Of many a maid have given thee many a maul,
13. Still is that fur as soft, as when the lists
14. In youth thou enter’dest on glass bottled wall.
