1. Come hither all sweet Maidens soberly
2. Down looking aye, and with a chasten'd light
3. Hid in the fringes of your eyelids white,
4. And meekly let your fair hands joined be,
5. As if so gentle that ye could not see,
6. Untouch'd, a victim of your beauty bright,
7. Sinking away to his young spirit's night,
8. Sinking bewilder'd 'mid the dreary sea.
9. 'Tis young Leander toiling to his death.
10. Nigh swooning he doth purse his weary lips
11. For Hero's cheek, and smiles against her smile.
12. O horrid dream! see how his body dips
13. Dead-heavy; arms and shoulders gleam awhile;
14. He's gone; up bubbles all his amorous breath!
