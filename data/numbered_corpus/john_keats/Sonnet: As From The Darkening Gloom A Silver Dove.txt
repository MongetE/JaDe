1. As from the darkening gloom a silver dove
2. Upsoars, and darts into the eastern light,
3. On pinions that nought moves but pure delight,
4. So fled thy soul into the realms above,
5. Regions of peace and everlasting love;
6. Where happy spirits, crown'd with circlets bright
7. Of starry beam, and gloriously bedight,
8. Taste the high joy none but the blest can prove.
9. There thou or joinest the immortal quire
10. In melodies that even heaven fair
11. Fill with superior bliss, or, at desire,
12. Of the omnipotent Father, cleav'st the air
13. On holy message sent -- What pleasure's higher?
14. Wherefore does any grief our joy impair?
