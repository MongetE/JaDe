1. Asleep! O sleep a little while, white pearl!
2. And let me kneel, and let me pray to thee,
3. And let me call Heavenâ€™s blessing on thine eyes,
4. And let me breathe into the happy air,
5. That doth enfold and touch thee all about,
6. Vows of my slavery, my giving up,
7. My sudden adoration, my great love!
