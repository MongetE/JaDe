1. Hast thou from the caves of Golconda, a gem
2. Pure as the ice-drop that froze on the mountain?
3. Bright as the humming-bird's green diadem,
4. When it flutters in sun-beams that shine through a fountain?

5. Hast thou a goblet for dark sparkling wine?
6. That goblet right heavy, and massy, and gold?
7. And splendidly mark'd with the story divine
8. Of Armida the fair, and Rinaldo the bold?

9. Hast thou a steed with a mane richly flowing?
10. Hast thou a sword that thine enemy's smart is?
11. Hast thou a trumpet rich melodies blowing?
12. And wear'st thou the shield of the famâ€™d Britomartis?

13. What is it that hangs from thy shoulder, so brave,
14. Embroidered with many a spring peering flower?
15. Is it a scarf that thy fair lady gave?
16. And hastest thou now to that fair lady's bower?

17. Ah! courteous Sir Knight, with large joy thou art crown'd;
18. Full many the glories that brighten thy youth!
19. I will tell thee my blisses, which richly abound
20. In magical powers to bless, and to sooth.

21. On this scroll thou seest written in characters fair
22. A sun-beamy tale of a wreath, and a chain;
23. And, warrior, it nurtures the property rare
24. Of charming my mind from the trammels of pain.

25. This canopy mark: 'tis the work of a fay;
26. Beneath its rich shade did King Oberon languish,
27. When lovely Titania was far, far away,
28. And cruelly left him to sorrow, and anguish.

29. There, oft would he bring from his soft sighing lute
30. Wild strains to which, spell-bound, the nightingales listened;
31. The wondering spirits of heaven were mute,
32. And tears 'mong the dewdrops of morning oft glistened.

33. In this little dome, all those melodies strange,
34. Soft, plaintive, and melting, for ever will sigh;
35. Nor e'er will the notes from their tenderness change;
36. Nor e'er will the music of Oberon die.

37. So, when I am in a voluptuous vein,
38. I pillow my head on the sweets of the rose,
39. And list to the tale of the wreath, and the chain,
40. Till its echoes depart; then I sink to repose.

41. Adieu, valiant Eric! with joy thou art crown'd;
42. Full many the glories that brighten thy youth,
43. I too have my blisses, which richly abound
44. In magical powers, to bless and to sooth.
