1. Give me a golden pen, and let me lean
2. On heaped-up flowers, in regions clear, and far;
3. Bring me a tablet whiter than a star,
4. Or hand of hymning angel, when 'tis seen
5. The silver strings of heavenly harp atween:
6. And let there glide by many a pearly car
7. Pink robes, and wavy hair, and diamond jar,
8. And half-discovered wings, and glances keen.
9. The while let music wander round my ears,
10. And as it reaches each delicious ending,
11. Let me write down a line of glorious tone,
12. And full of many wonders of the spheres:
13. For what a height my spirit is contending!
14. 'Tis not content so soon to be alone.
