1. MINUTES are flying swiftly, and as yet
2. Nothing unearthly has enticed my brain
3. Into a delphic Labyrinth I would fain
4. Catch an unmortal thought to pay the debt
5. I owe to the kind Poet who has set
6. Upon my ambitious head a glorious gain.
7. Two bending laurel Sprigs 'tis nearly pain
8. To be conscious of such a Coronet.
9. Still time is fleeting, and no dream arises
10. Gorgeous as I would have it only I see
11. A Trampling down of what the world most prizes
12. Turbans and Crowns, and blank regality;
13. And then I run into most wild surmises
14. Of all the many glories that may be.
