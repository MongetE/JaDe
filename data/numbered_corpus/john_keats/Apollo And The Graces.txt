1. APOLLO

2. WHICH of the fairest three
3. To-day will ride with me?
4. My steeds are all pawing at the threshold of the morn:
5. Which of the fairest three
6. To-day will ride with me
7. Across the gold Autumn's whole Kingdom of corn?

8. THE GRACES all answer

9. I will, I - I - I
10. young Apollo let me fly
11. Along with thee,
12. I will- I, I, I,
13. The many wonders see
14. I - I - I - I
15. And thy lyre shall never have a slackened string:
16. I, I, I, I,
17. Thro' the golden day will sing.
