1. A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
2. Its lovliness increases; it will never
3. Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
4. A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
5. Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
6. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
7. A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
8. Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
9. Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
10. Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways
11. Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
12. Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
13. From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
14. Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
15. For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
16. With the green world they live in; and clear rills
17. That for themselves a cooling covert make
18. 'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake,
19. Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
20. And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
21. We have imagined for the mighty dead;
22. An endless fountain of immortal drink,
23. Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
