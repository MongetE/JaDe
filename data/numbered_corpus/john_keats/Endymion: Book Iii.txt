1. There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men
2. With most prevailing tinsel: who unpen
3. Their baaing vanities, to browse away
4. The comfortable green and juicy hay
5. From human pastures; or, O torturing fact!
6. Who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd
7. Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe
8. Our gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge
9. Of sanctuary splendour, not a sight
10. Able to face an owl's, they still are dight
11. By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,
12. And crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,
13. Save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount
14. To their spirit's perch, their being's high account,
15. Their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones--
16. Amid the fierce intoxicating tones
17. Of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,
18. And sudden cannon. Ah! how all this hums,
19. In wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone--
20. Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,
21. And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.--
22. Are then regalities all gilded masks?
23. No, there are throned seats unscalable
24. But by a patient wing, a constant spell,
25. Or by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,
26. Can make a ladder of the eternal wind,
27. And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents
28. To watch the abysm-birth of elements.
29. Aye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate
30. A thousand Powers keep religious state,
31. In water, fiery realm, and airy bourne;
32. And, silent as a consecrated urn,
33. Hold sphery sessions for a season due.
34. Yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!
35. Have bared their operations to this globe--
36. Few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe
37. Our piece of heaven--whose benevolence
38. Shakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense
39. Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,
40. As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud
41. 'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,
42. Eterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair
43. Is of all these the gentlier-mightiest.
44. When thy gold breath is misting in the west,
45. She unobserved steals unto her throne,
46. And there she sits most meek and most alone;
47. As if she had not pomp subservient;
48. As if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent
49. Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;
50. As if the ministring stars kept not apart,
51. Waiting for silver-footed messages.
52. O Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees
53. Feel palpitations when thou lookest in:
54. O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din
55. The while they feel thine airy fellowship.
56. Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip
57. Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,
58. Couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:
59. Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,
60. Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes;
61. And yet thy benediction passeth not
62. One obscure hiding-place, one little spot
63. Where pleasure may be sent: the nested wren
64. Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,
65. And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf
66. Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief
67. To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps
68. Within its pearly house.--The mighty deeps,
69. The monstrous sea is thine--the myriad sea!
70. O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,
71. And Tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load.

72. Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode
73. Of green or silvery bower doth enshrine
74. Such utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine
75. For one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale
76. For one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail
77. His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?
78. Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,
79. Or what a thing is love! 'Tis She, but lo!
80. How chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!
81. She dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness
82. Is wan on Neptune's blue: yet there's a stress
83. Of love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,
84. Dancing upon the waves, as if to please
85. The curly foam with amorous influence.
86. O, not so idle: for down-glancing thence
87. She fathoms eddies, and runs wild about
88. O'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out
89. The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning
90. Their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.
91. Where will the splendor be content to reach?
92. O love! how potent hast thou been to teach
93. Strange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,
94. In gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,
95. In light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,
96. Thou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won.
97. Amid his toil thou gav'st Leander breath;
98. Thou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;
99. Thou madest Pluto bear thin element;
100. And now, O winged Chieftain! thou hast sent
101. A moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,
102. To find Endymion.

103. On gold sand impearl'd
104. With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,
105. Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light
106. Against his pallid face: he felt the charm
107. To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm
108. Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd
109. His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid
110. His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,
111. To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,
112. Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.
113. And so he kept, until the rosy veils
114. Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand
115. Were lifted from the water's breast, and fann'd
116. Into sweet air; and sober'd morning came
117. Meekly through billows:--when like taper-flame
118. Left sudden by a dallying breath of air,
119. He rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare
120. Along his fated way.

121. Far had he roam'd,
122. With nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd
123. Above, around, and at his feet; save things
124. More dead than Morpheus' imaginings:
125. Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large
126. Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;
127. Rudders that for a hundred years had lost
128. The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd
129. With long-forgotten story, and wherein
130. No reveller had ever dipp'd a chin
131. But those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,
132. Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls
133. Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude
134. In ponderous stone, developing the mood
135. Of ancient Nox;--then skeletons of man,
136. Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,
137. And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw
138. Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe
139. These secrets struck into him; and unless
140. Dian had chaced away that heaviness,
141. He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,
142. He onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal
143. About the labyrinth in his soul of love.

144. "What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move
145. My heart so potently? When yet a child
146. I oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd.
147. Thou seem'dst my sister: hand in hand we went
148. From eve to morn across the firmament.
149. No apples would I gather from the tree,
150. Till thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously:
151. No tumbling water ever spake romance,
152. But when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:
153. No woods were green enough, no bower divine,
154. Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:
155. In sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,
156. Or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;
157. And, in the summer tide of blossoming,
158. No one but thee hath heard me blithly sing
159. And mesh my dewy flowers all the night.
160. No melody was like a passing spright
161. If it went not to solemnize thy reign.
162. Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain
163. By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;
164. And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend
165. With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;
166. Thou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--
167. The poet's harp--the voice of friends--the sun;
168. Thou wast the river--thou wast glory won;
169. Thou wast my clarion's blast--thou wast my steed--
170. My goblet full of wine--my topmost deed:--
171. Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!
172. O what a wild and harmonized tune
173. My spirit struck from all the beautiful!
174. On some bright essence could I lean, and lull
175. Myself to immortality: I prest
176. Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.
177. But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss--
178. My strange love came--Felicity's abyss!
179. She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away--
180. Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway
181. Has been an under-passion to this hour.
182. Now I begin to feel thine orby power
183. Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,
184. Keep back thine influence, and do not blind
185. My sovereign vision.--Dearest love, forgive
186. That I can think away from thee and live!--
187. Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize
188. One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!
189. How far beyond!" At this a surpris'd start
190. Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;
191. For as he lifted up his eyes to swear
192. How his own goddess was past all things fair,
193. He saw far in the concave green of the sea
194. An old man sitting calm and peacefully.
195. Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,
196. And his white hair was awful, and a mat
197. Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;
198. And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,
199. A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,
200. O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans
201. Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form
202. Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,
203. And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar
204. Were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape
205. That skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.
206. The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,
207. Yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell
208. To its huge self; and the minutest fish
209. Would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,
210. And show his little eye's anatomy.
211. Then there was pictur'd the regality
212. Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,
213. In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.
214. Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,
215. And in his lap a book, the which he conn'd
216. So stedfastly, that the new denizen
217. Had time to keep him in amazed ken,
218. To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.

219. The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw
220. The wilder'd stranger--seeming not to see,
221. His features were so lifeless. Suddenly
222. He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows
223. Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs
224. Furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,
225. Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,
226. Till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.
227. Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil
228. Had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,
229. Who had not from mid-life to utmost age
230. Eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,
231. Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,
232. With convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,
233. And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd
234. Echo into oblivion, he said:--

235. "Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head
236. In peace upon my watery pillow: now
237. Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.
238. O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!
239. O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung
240. With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,
241. When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?--
242. I'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen
243. Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;
244. Anon upon that giant's arm I'll be,
245. That writhes about the roots of Sicily:
246. To northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,
247. And mount upon the snortings of a whale
248. To some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep
249. On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,
250. Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd
251. With rapture to the other side of the world!
252. O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,
253. I bow full hearted to your old decree!
254. Yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,
255. For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.
256. Thou art the man!" Endymion started back
257. Dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack
258. Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,
259. Mutter'd: "What lonely death am I to die
260. In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,
261. And float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?
262. Or will he touch me with his searing hand,
263. And leave a black memorial on the sand?
264. Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,
265. And keep me as a chosen food to draw
266. His magian fish through hated fire and flame?
267. O misery of hell! resistless, tame,
268. Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,
269. Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!--
270. O Tartarus! but some few days agone
271. Her soft arms were entwining me, and on
272. Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:
273. Her lips were all my own, and--ah, ripe sheaves
274. Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,
275. But never may be garner'd. I must stoop
276. My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!
277. Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell
278. Would melt at thy sweet breath.--By Dian's hind
279. Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind
280. I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,
281. I care not for this old mysterious man!"

282. He spake, and walking to that aged form,
283. Look'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm
284. With pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.
285. Had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?
286. Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought
287. Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,
288. Convulsion to a mouth of many years?
289. He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.
290. The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt
291. Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt
292. About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:

293. "Arise, good youth, for sacred Phoebus' sake!
294. I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel
295. A very brother's yearning for thee steal
296. Into mine own: for why? thou openest
297. The prison gates that have so long opprest
298. My weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,
299. Thou art commission'd to this fated spot
300. For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;
301. I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:
302. Aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power
303. I had been grieving at this joyous hour
304. But even now most miserable old,
305. I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold
306. Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case
307. Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays
308. As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,
309. For thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,
310. Now as we speed towards our joyous task."

311. So saying, this young soul in age's mask
312. Went forward with the Carian side by side:
313. Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide
314. Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands
315. Took silently their foot-prints. "My soul stands
316. Now past the midway from mortality,
317. And so I can prepare without a sigh
318. To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.
319. I was a fisher once, upon this main,
320. And my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;
321. Rough billows were my home by night and day,--
322. The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had
323. No housing from the storm and tempests mad,
324. But hollow rocks,--and they were palaces
325. Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:
326. Long years of misery have told me so.
327. Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago.
328. One thousand years!--Is it then possible
329. To look so plainly through them? to dispel
330. A thousand years with backward glance sublime?
331. To breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime
332. From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,
333. And one's own image from the bottom peep?
334. Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,
335. My long captivity and moanings all
336. Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,
337. The which I breathe away, and thronging come
338. Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.

339. "I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:
340. I was a lonely youth on desert shores.
341. My sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,
342. And craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry
343. Plaining discrepant between sea and sky.
344. Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen
345. Would let me feel their scales of gold and green,
346. Nor be my desolation; and, full oft,
347. When a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft
348. Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe
349. To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe
350. My life away like a vast sponge of fate,
351. Some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,
352. Has dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,
353. And left me tossing safely. But the crown
354. Of all my life was utmost quietude:
355. More did I love to lie in cavern rude,
356. Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,
357. And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!
358. There blush'd no summer eve but I would steer
359. My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear
360. The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,
361. Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:
362. And never was a day of summer shine,
363. But I beheld its birth upon the brine:
364. For I would watch all night to see unfold
365. Heaven's gates, and Aethon snort his morning gold
366. Wide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly
367. At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,
368. My nets would be spread out, and I at rest.
369. The poor folk of the sea-country I blest
370. With daily boon of fish most delicate:
371. They knew not whence this bounty, and elate
372. Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.

373. "Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach
374. At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!
375. Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began
376. To feel distemper'd longings: to desire
377. The utmost privilege that ocean's sire
378. Could grant in benediction: to be free
379. Of all his kingdom. Long in misery
380. I wasted, ere in one extremest fit
381. I plung'd for life or death. To interknit
382. One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff
383. Might seem a work of pain; so not enough
384. Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,
385. And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt
386. Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;
387. Forgetful utterly of self-intent;
388. Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.
389. Then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew
390. His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,
391. I tried in fear the pinions of my will.
392. 'Twas freedom! and at once I visited
393. The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.
394. No need to tell thee of them, for I see
395. That thou hast been a witness--it must be
396. For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,
397. By the melancholy corners of that mouth.
398. So I will in my story straightway pass
399. To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!
400. That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!
401. Why did poor Glaucus ever--ever dare
402. To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!
403. I lov'd her to the very white of truth,
404. And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!
405. She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,
406. Round every isle, and point, and promontory,
407. From where large Hercules wound up his story
408. Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew
409. The more, the more I saw her dainty hue
410. Gleam delicately through the azure clear:
411. Until 'twas too fierce agony to bear;
412. And in that agony, across my grief
413. It flash'd, that Circe might find some relief--
414. Cruel enchantress! So above the water
415. I rear'd my head, and look'd for Phoebus' daughter.
416. Aeaea's isle was wondering at the moon:--
417. It seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon
418. Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.

419. "When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;
420. Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,
421. Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.
422. How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,
423. And over it a sighing voice expire.
424. It ceased--I caught light footsteps; and anon
425. The fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon
426. Push'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!
427. With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove
428. A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all
429. The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall
430. The dew of her rich speech: "Ah! Art awake?
431. O let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!
432. I am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed
433. An urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;
434. And now I find thee living, I will pour
435. From these devoted eyes their silver store,
436. Until exhausted of the latest drop,
437. So it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop
438. Here, that I too may live: but if beyond
439. Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond
440. Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;
441. If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;
442. If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,
443. Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,
444. O let me pluck it for thee." Thus she link'd
445. Her charming syllables, till indistinct
446. Their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;
447. And then she hover'd over me, and stole
448. So near, that if no nearer it had been
449. This furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.

450. "Young man of Latmos! thus particular
451. Am I, that thou may'st plainly see how far
452. This fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not
453. Exclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?

454. "Who could resist? Who in this universe?
455. She did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse
456. My fine existence in a golden clime.
457. She took me like a child of suckling time,
458. And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,
459. The current of my former life was stemm'd,
460. And to this arbitrary queen of sense
461. I bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence
462. Have mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd
463. Me back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.
464. For as Apollo each eve doth devise
465. A new appareling for western skies;
466. So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour
467. Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.
468. And I was free of haunts umbrageous;
469. Could wander in the mazy forest-house
470. Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,
471. And birds from coverts innermost and drear
472. Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow--
473. To me new born delights!

474. "Now let me borrow,
475. For moments few, a temperament as stern
476. As Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn
477. These uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell
478. How specious heaven was changed to real hell.

479. "One morn she left me sleeping: half awake
480. I sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake
481. My greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;
482. But she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts
483. Of disappointment stuck in me so sore,
484. That out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.
485. Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom
486. Damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom
487. A sound of moan, an agony of sound,
488. Sepulchral from the distance all around.
489. Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled
490. That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled
491. Down a precipitous path, as if impell'd.
492. I came to a dark valley.--Groanings swell'd
493. Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,
494. The nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,
495. That glar'd before me through a thorny brake.
496. This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,
497. Bewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near
498. A sight too fearful for the feel of fear:
499. In thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene--
500. The banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,
501. Seated upon an uptorn forest root;
502. And all around her shapes, wizard and brute,
503. Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,
504. Shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!
505. O such deformities! Old Charon's self,
506. Should he give up awhile his penny pelf,
507. And take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,
508. It could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,
509. And tyrannizing was the lady's look,
510. As over them a gnarled staff she shook.
511. Oft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,
512. And from a basket emptied to the rout
513. Clusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick
514. And roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick
515. About their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,
516. Anon she took a branch of mistletoe,
517. And emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:
518. Groan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial
519. Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.
520. She lifted up the charm: appealing groans
521. From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear
522. In vain; remorseless as an infant's bier
523. She whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.
524. Whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,
525. Increasing gradual to a tempest rage,
526. Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;
527. Until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat
528. And puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:
529. Then was appalling silence: then a sight
530. More wildering than all that hoarse affright;
531. For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,
532. Went through the dismal air like one huge Python
533. Antagonizing Boreas,--and so vanish'd.
534. Yet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd
535. These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark
536. Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,
537. With dancing and loud revelry,--and went
538. Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.--
539. Sighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd
540. Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud
541. In human accent: "Potent goddess! chief
542. Of pains resistless! make my being brief,
543. Or let me from this heavy prison fly:
544. Or give me to the air, or let me die!
545. I sue not for my happy crown again;
546. I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;
547. I sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;
548. I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,
549. My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!
550. I will forget them; I will pass these joys;
551. Ask nought so heavenward, so too--too high:
552. Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die,
553. Or be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,
554. From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,
555. And merely given to the cold bleak air.
556. Have mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"

557. That curst magician's name fell icy numb
558. Upon my wild conjecturing: truth had come
559. Naked and sabre-like against my heart.
560. I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;
561. And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,
562. Fainted away in that dark lair of night.
563. Think, my deliverer, how desolate
564. My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,
565. And terrors manifold divided me
566. A spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee
567. Into the dungeon core of that wild wood:
568. I fled three days--when lo! before me stood
569. Glaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,
570. A clammy dew is beading on my brow,
571. At mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.
572. "Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse
573. Made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,
574. To cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,
575. I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:
576. My tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.
577. So, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies
578. Unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries
579. Upon some breast more lily-feminine.
580. Oh, no--it shall not pine, and pine, and pine
581. More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;
582. And then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears
583. Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!
584. Young dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt
585. One hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,
586. That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.
587. And must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.
588. Yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,
589. Let me sob over thee my last adieus,
590. And speak a blessing: Mark me! thou hast thews
591. Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race:
592. But such a love is mine, that here I chase
593. Eternally away from thee all bloom
594. Of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.
595. Hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;
596. And there, ere many days be overpast,
597. Disabled age shall seize thee; and even then
598. Thou shalt not go the way of aged men;
599. But live and wither, cripple and still breathe
600. Ten hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath
601. Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.
602. Adieu, sweet love, adieu!"--As shot stars fall,
603. She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung
604. And poisoned was my spirit: despair sung
605. A war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.
606. A hand was at my shoulder to compel
607. My sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes
608. Moved on with pointed finger. In this guise
609. Enforced, at the last by ocean's foam
610. I found me; by my fresh, my native home.
611. Its tempering coolness, to my life akin,
612. Came salutary as I waded in;
613. And, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave
614. Battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave
615. Large froth before me, while there yet remain'd
616. Hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd.

617. "Young lover, I must weep--such hellish spite
618. With dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might
619. Proving upon this element, dismay'd,
620. Upon a dead thing's face my hand I laid;
621. I look'd--'twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!
622. O vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?
623. Could not thy harshest vengeance be content,
624. But thou must nip this tender innocent
625. Because I lov'd her?--Cold, O cold indeed
626. Were her fair limbs, and like a common weed
627. The sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was
628. I clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass
629. Fleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,
630. Until there shone a fabric crystalline,
631. Ribb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.
632. Headlong I darted; at one eager swirl
633. Gain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!
634. 'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;
635. And all around--But wherefore this to thee
636. Who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?--
637. I left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.
638. My fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread
639. Met palsy half way: soon these limbs became
640. Gaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame.

641. "Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,
642. Without one hope, without one faintest trace
643. Of mitigation, or redeeming bubble
644. Of colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble
645. Thy brain to loss of reason: and next tell
646. How a restoring chance came down to quell
647. One half of the witch in me.                 On a day,
648. Sitting upon a rock above the spray,
649. I saw grow up from the horizon's brink
650. A gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink
651. Away from me again, as though her course
652. Had been resum'd in spite of hindering force--
653. So vanish'd: and not long, before arose
654. Dark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.
655. Old Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,
656. But could not: therefore all the billows green
657. Toss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.
658. The tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds
659. In perilous bustle; while upon the deck
660. Stood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;
661. The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:
662. I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.
663. O they had all been sav'd but crazed eld
664. Annull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd
665. And curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit
666. Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit
667. Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,
668. By one and one, to pale oblivion;
669. And I was gazing on the surges prone,
670. With many a scalding tear and many a groan,
671. When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,
672. Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.
673. I knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp'd
674. These treasures--touch'd the knuckles--they unclasp'd--
675. I caught a finger: but the downward weight
676. O'erpowered me--it sank. Then 'gan abate
677. The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst
678. The comfortable sun. I was athirst
679. To search the book, and in the warming air
680. Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.
681. Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on
682. My soul page after page, till well-nigh won
683. Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,
684. I read these words, and read again, and tried
685. My eyes against the heavens, and read again.
686. O what a load of misery and pain
687. Each Atlas-line bore off!--a shine of hope
688. Came gold around me, cheering me to cope
689. Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!
690. For thou hast brought their promise to an end.

691. "In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,
692. Doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch
693. His loath'd existence through ten centuries,
694. And then to die alone. Who can devise
695. A total opposition? No one. So
696. One million times ocean must ebb and flow,
697. And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,
698. These things accomplish'd:--If he utterly
699. Scans all the depths of magic, and expounds
700. The meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;
701. If he explores all forms and substances
702. Straight homeward to their symbol-essences;
703. He shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,
704. He must pursue this task of joy and grief
705. Most piously;--all lovers tempest-tost,
706. And in the savage overwhelming lost,
707. He shall deposit side by side, until
708. Time's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:
709. Which done, and all these labours ripened,
710. A youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,
711. Shall stand before him; whom he shall direct
712. How to consummate all. The youth elect
713. Must do the thing, or both will be destroy'd."--

714. "Then," cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,
715. "We are twin brothers in this destiny!
716. Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high
717. Is, in this restless world, for me reserv'd.
718. What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,
719. Had we both perish'd?"--"Look!" the sage replied,
720. "Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,
721. Of divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice
722. I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;
723. And where I have enshrined piously
724. All lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die
725. Throughout my bondage." Thus discoursing, on
726. They went till unobscur'd the porches shone;
727. Which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.
728. Sure never since king Neptune held his state
729. Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.
730. Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars
731. Has legion'd all his battle; and behold
732. How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold
733. His even breast: see, many steeled squares,
734. And rigid ranks of iron--whence who dares
735. One step? Imagine further, line by line,
736. These warrior thousands on the field supine:--
737. So in that crystal place, in silent rows,
738. Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.--
739. The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd
740. Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;
741. Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips
742. All ruddy,--for here death no blossom nips.
743. He mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair
744. Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;
745. And each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,
746. Put cross-wise to its heart.

747. "Let us commence,
748. Whisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now."
749. He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,
750. Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,
751. Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.
752. He tore it into pieces small as snow
753. That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;
754. And having done it, took his dark blue cloak
755. And bound it round Endymion: then struck
756. His wand against the empty air times nine.--
757. "What more there is to do, young man, is thine:
758. But first a little patience; first undo
759. This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.
760. Ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;
761. And shouldst thou break it--What, is it done so clean?
762. A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!
763. The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.
764. Here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,
765. Nor mark'd with any sign or charactery--
766. Canst thou read aught? O read for pity's sake!
767. Olympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break
768. This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal."

769. 'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall
770. Sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd
771. A lullaby to silence.--"Youth! now strew
772. These minced leaves on me, and passing through
773. Those files of dead, scatter the same around,
774. And thou wilt see the issue."--'Mid the sound
775. Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,
776. Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,
777. And scatter'd in his face some fragments light.
778. How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight
779. Smiling beneath a coral diadem,
780. Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,
781. Appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,
782. Kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force
783. Press'd its cold hand, and wept--and Scylla sigh'd!
784. Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied--
785. The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,
786. And onward went upon his high employ,
787. Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.
788. And, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,
789. As doth a flower at Apollo's touch.
790. Death felt it to his inwards; 'twas too much:
791. Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.
792. The Latmian persever'd along, and thus
793. All were re-animated. There arose
794. A noise of harmony, pulses and throes
795. Of gladness in the air--while many, who
796. Had died in mutual arms devout and true,
797. Sprang to each other madly; and the rest
798. Felt a high certainty of being blest.
799. They gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment
800. Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.
801. Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,
802. Budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers
803. Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.
804. The two deliverers tasted a pure wine
805. Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.
806. Speechless they eyed each other, and about
807. The fair assembly wander'd to and fro,
808. Distracted with the richest overflow
809. Of joy that ever pour'd from heaven.

810. ----"Away!"
811. Shouted the new-born god; "Follow, and pay
812. Our piety to Neptunus supreme!"--
813. Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,
814. They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,
815. Through portal columns of a giant size,
816. Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.
817. Joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,
818. Down marble steps; pouring as easily
819. As hour-glass sand--and fast, as you might see
820. Swallows obeying the south summer's call,
821. Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.

822. Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,
823. Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,
824. Just within ken, they saw descending thick
825. Another multitude. Whereat more quick
826. Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,
827. And of those numbers every eye was wet;
828. For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,
829. Like what was never heard in all the throes
830. Of wind and waters: 'tis past human wit
831. To tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.

832. This mighty consummation made, the host
833. Mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost
834. Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,
835. And from the rear diminishing away,--
836. Till a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,
837. "Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!
838. God Neptune's palaces!" With noise increas'd,
839. They shoulder'd on towards that brightening east.
840. At every onward step proud domes arose
841. In prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows
842. Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.
843. Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,
844. Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.
845. Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld
846. By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts
847. A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts
848. Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:
849. For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere
850. As marble was there lavish, to the vast
851. Of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,
852. Even for common bulk, those olden three,
853. Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.

854. As large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow
855. Of Iris, when unfading it doth shew
856. Beyond a silvery shower, was the arch
857. Through which this Paphian army took its march,
858. Into the outer courts of Neptune's state:
859. Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,
860. To which the leaders sped; but not half raught
861. Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,
862. And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes
863. Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.
864. Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze
865. Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,
866. And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne
867. Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;
868. At his right hand stood winged Love, and on
869. His left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.

870. Far as the mariner on highest mast
871. Can see all round upon the calmed vast,
872. So wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue
873. Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew
874. Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,
875. Aw'd from the throne aloof;--and when storm-rent
876. Disclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;
877. But sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,
878. Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering
879. Death to a human eye: for there did spring
880. From natural west, and east, and south, and north,
881. A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth
882. A gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.
883. Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread
884. As breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe
885. Of feather'd Indian darts about, as through
886. The delicatest air: air verily,
887. But for the portraiture of clouds and sky:
888. This palace floor breath-air,--but for the amaze
889. Of deep-seen wonders motionless,--and blaze
890. Of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,
891. Globing a golden sphere.

892. They stood in dreams
893. Till Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;
894. The Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;
895. And the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.
896. Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed
897. On all the multitude a nectarous dew.
898. The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew
899. Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;
900. And when they reach'd the throned eminence
901. She kist the sea-nymph's cheek,--who sat her down
902. A toying with the doves. Then,--"Mighty crown
903. And sceptre of this kingdom!" Venus said,
904. "Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:
905. Behold!"--Two copious tear-drops instant fell
906. From the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,
907. And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.--
908. "Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands
909. Of love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour
910. I met thee in earth's bosom, all my power
911. Have I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet
912. Escap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?
913. A little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,
914. Or I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,
915. A humid eye, and steps luxurious,
916. Where these are new and strange, are ominous.
917. Aye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,
918. When others were all blind; and were I given
919. To utter secrets, haply I might say
920. Some pleasant words:--but Love will have his day.
921. So wait awhile expectant. Pr'ythee soon,
922. Even in the passing of thine honey-moon,
923. Visit my Cytherea: thou wilt find
924. Cupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;
925. And pray persuade with thee--Ah, I have done,
926. All blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!"--
927. Thus the fair goddess: while Endymion
928. Knelt to receive those accents halcyon.

929. Meantime a glorious revelry began
930. Before the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran
931. In courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;
932. And plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd
933. New growth about each shell and pendent lyre;
934. The which, in disentangling for their fire,
935. Pull'd down fresh foliage and coverture
936. For dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,
937. Flutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng
938. Made a delighted way. Then dance, and song,
939. And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.
940. In harmless tendril they each other chain'd,
941. And strove who should be smother'd deepest in
942. Fresh crush of leaves.

943. O 'tis a very sin
944. For one so weak to venture his poor verse
945. In such a place as this. O do not curse,
946. High Muses! let him hurry to the ending.

947. All suddenly were silent. A soft blending
948. Of dulcet instruments came charmingly;
949. And then a hymn.

950. "KING of the stormy sea!
951. Brother of Jove, and co-inheritor
952. Of elements! Eternally before
953. Thee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,
954. At thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock
955. Its deep foundations, hissing into foam.
956. All mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home
957. Of thy capacious bosom ever flow.
958. Thou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe
959. Skulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint
960. Of all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint
961. When, from thy diadem, a silver gleam
962. Slants over blue dominion. Thy bright team
963. Gulphs in the morning light, and scuds along
964. To bring thee nearer to that golden song
965. Apollo singeth, while his chariot
966. Waits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not
967. For scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;
968. And it hath furrow'd that large front: yet now,
969. As newly come of heaven, dost thou sit
970. To blend and interknit
971. Subdued majesty with this glad time.
972. O shell-borne King sublime!
973. We lay our hearts before thee evermore--
974. We sing, and we adore!

975. "Breathe softly, flutes;
976. Be tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;
977. Nor be the trumpet heard! O vain, O vain;
978. Not flowers budding in an April rain,
979. Nor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,--
980. No, nor the Eolian twang of Love's own bow,
981. Can mingle music fit for the soft ear
982. Of goddess Cytherea!
983. Yet deign, white Queen of Beauty, thy fair eyes
984. On our souls' sacrifice.

985. "Bright-winged Child!
986. Who has another care when thou hast smil'd?
987. Unfortunates on earth, we see at last
988. All death-shadows, and glooms that overcast
989. Our spirits, fann'd away by thy light pinions.
990. O sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!
991. God of warm pulses, and dishevell'd hair,
992. And panting bosoms bare!
993. Dear unseen light in darkness! eclipser
994. Of light in light! delicious poisoner!
995. Thy venom'd goblet will we quaff until
996. We fill--we fill!
997. And by thy Mother's lips----"


998. Was heard no more
999. For clamour, when the golden palace door
1000. Opened again, and from without, in shone
1001. A new magnificence. On oozy throne
1002. Smooth-moving came Oceanus the old,
1003. To take a latest glimpse at his sheep-fold,
1004. Before he went into his quiet cave
1005. To muse for ever--Then a lucid wave,
1006. Scoop'd from its trembling sisters of mid-sea,
1007. Afloat, and pillowing up the majesty
1008. Of Doris, and the Egean seer, her spouse--
1009. Next, on a dolphin, clad in laurel boughs,
1010. Theban Amphion leaning on his lute:
1011. His fingers went across it--All were mute
1012. To gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,
1013. And Thetis pearly too.--

1014. The palace whirls
1015. Around giddy Endymion; seeing he
1016. Was there far strayed from mortality.
1017. He could not bear it--shut his eyes in vain;
1018. Imagination gave a dizzier pain.
1019. "O I shall die! sweet Venus, be my stay!
1020. Where is my lovely mistress? Well-away!
1021. I die--I hear her voice--I feel my wing--"
1022. At Neptune's feet he sank. A sudden ring
1023. Of Nereids were about him, in kind strife
1024. To usher back his spirit into life:
1025. But still he slept. At last they interwove
1026. Their cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey
1027. Towards a crystal bower far away.

1028. Lo! while slow carried through the pitying crowd,
1029. To his inward senses these words spake aloud;
1030. Written in star-light on the dark above:
1031. Dearest Endymion! my entire love!
1032. How have I dwelt in fear of fate: 'tis done--
1033. Immortal bliss for me too hast thou won.
1034. Arise then! for the hen-dove shall not hatch
1035. Her ready eggs, before I'll kissing snatch
1036. Thee into endless heaven. Awake! awake!

1037. The youth at once arose: a placid lake
1038. Came quiet to his eyes; and forest green,
1039. Cooler than all the wonders he had seen,
1040. Lull'd with its simple song his fluttering breast.
1041. How happy once again in grassy nest!
