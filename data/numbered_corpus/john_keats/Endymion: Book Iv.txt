1. Muse of my native land! loftiest Muse!
2. O first-born on the mountains! by the hues
3. Of heaven on the spiritual air begot:
4. Long didst thou sit alone in northern grot,
5. While yet our England was a wolfish den;
6. Before our forests heard the talk of men;
7. Before the first of Druids was a child;--
8. Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild
9. Rapt in a deep prophetic solitude.
10. There came an eastern voice of solemn mood:--
11. Yet wast thou patient. Then sang forth the Nine,
12. Apollo's garland:--yet didst thou divine
13. Such home-bred glory, that they cry'd in vain,
14. "Come hither, Sister of the Island!" Plain
15. Spake fair Ausonia; and once more she spake
16. A higher summons:--still didst thou betake
17. Thee to thy native hopes. O thou hast won
18. A full accomplishment! The thing is done,
19. Which undone, these our latter days had risen
20. On barren souls. Great Muse, thou know'st what prison
21. Of flesh and bone, curbs, and confines, and frets
22. Our spirit's wings: despondency besets
23. Our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn
24. Seems to give forth its light in very scorn
25. Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.
26. Long have I said, how happy he who shrives
27. To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,
28. And could not pray:--nor can I now--so on
29. I move to the end in lowliness of heart.----

30. "Ah, woe is me! that I should fondly part
31. From my dear native land! Ah, foolish maid!
32. Glad was the hour, when, with thee, myriads bade
33. Adieu to Ganges and their pleasant fields!
34. To one so friendless the clear freshet yields
35. A bitter coolness, the ripe grape is sour:
36. Yet I would have, great gods! but one short hour
37. Of native air--let me but die at home."

38. Endymion to heaven's airy dome
39. Was offering up a hecatomb of vows,
40. When these words reach'd him. Whereupon he bows
41. His head through thorny-green entanglement
42. Of underwood, and to the sound is bent,
43. Anxious as hind towards her hidden fawn.

44. "Is no one near to help me? No fair dawn
45. Of life from charitable voice? No sweet saying
46. To set my dull and sadden'd spirit playing?
47. No hand to toy with mine? No lips so sweet
48. That I may worship them? No eyelids meet
49. To twinkle on my bosom? No one dies
50. Before me, till from these enslaving eyes
51. Redemption sparkles!--I am sad and lost."

52. Thou, Carian lord, hadst better have been tost
53. Into a whirlpool. Vanish into air,
54. Warm mountaineer! for canst thou only bear
55. A woman's sigh alone and in distress?
56. See not her charms! Is Phoebe passionless?
57. Phoebe is fairer far--O gaze no more:--
58. Yet if thou wilt behold all beauty's store,
59. Behold her panting in the forest grass!
60. Do not those curls of glossy jet surpass
61. For tenderness the arms so idly lain
62. Amongst them? Feelest not a kindred pain,
63. To see such lovely eyes in swimming search
64. After some warm delight, that seems to perch
65. Dovelike in the dim cell lying beyond
66. Their upper lids?--Hist!             "O for Hermes' wand
67. To touch this flower into human shape!
68. That woodland Hyacinthus could escape
69. From his green prison, and here kneeling down
70. Call me his queen, his second life's fair crown!
71. Ah me, how I could love!--My soul doth melt
72. For the unhappy youth--Love! I have felt
73. So faint a kindness, such a meek surrender
74. To what my own full thoughts had made too tender,
75. That but for tears my life had fled away!--
76. Ye deaf and senseless minutes of the day,
77. And thou, old forest, hold ye this for true,
78. There is no lightning, no authentic dew
79. But in the eye of love: there's not a sound,
80. Melodious howsoever, can confound
81. The heavens and earth in one to such a death
82. As doth the voice of love: there's not a breath
83. Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,
84. Till it has panted round, and stolen a share
85. Of passion from the heart!"--

86. Upon a bough
87. He leant, wretched. He surely cannot now
88. Thirst for another love: O impious,
89. That he can even dream upon it thus!--
90. Thought he, "Why am I not as are the dead,
91. Since to a woe like this I have been led
92. Through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?
93. Goddess! I love thee not the less: from thee
94. By Juno's smile I turn not--no, no, no--
95. While the great waters are at ebb and flow.--
96. I have a triple soul! O fond pretence--
97. For both, for both my love is so immense,
98. I feel my heart is cut in twain for them."

99. And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.
100. The lady's heart beat quick, and he could see
101. Her gentle bosom heave tumultuously.
102. He sprang from his green covert: there she lay,
103. Sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;
104. With all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes
105. Shut softly up alive. To speak he tries.
106. "Fair damsel, pity me! forgive that I
107. Thus violate thy bower's sanctity!
108. O pardon me, for I am full of grief--
109. Grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!
110. Who stolen hast away the wings wherewith
111. I was to top the heavens. Dear maid, sith
112. Thou art my executioner, and I feel
113. Loving and hatred, misery and weal,
114. Will in a few short hours be nothing to me,
115. And all my story that much passion slew me;
116. Do smile upon the evening of my days:
117. And, for my tortur'd brain begins to craze,
118. Be thou my nurse; and let me understand
119. How dying I shall kiss that lily hand.--
120. Dost weep for me? Then should I be content.
121. Scowl on, ye fates! until the firmament
122. Outblackens Erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth
123. Crumbles into itself. By the cloud girth
124. Of Jove, those tears have given me a thirst
125. To meet oblivion."--As her heart would burst
126. The maiden sobb'd awhile, and then replied:
127. "Why must such desolation betide
128. As that thou speakest of? Are not these green nooks
129. Empty of all misfortune? Do the brooks
130. Utter a gorgon voice? Does yonder thrush,
131. Schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush
132. About the dewy forest, whisper tales?--
133. Speak not of grief, young stranger, or cold snails
134. Will slime the rose to night. Though if thou wilt,
135. Methinks 'twould be a guilt--a very guilt--
136. Not to companion thee, and sigh away
137. The light--the dusk--the dark--till break of day!"
138. "Dear lady," said Endymion, "'tis past:
139. I love thee! and my days can never last.
140. That I may pass in patience still speak:
141. Let me have music dying, and I seek
142. No more delight--I bid adieu to all.
143. Didst thou not after other climates call,
144. And murmur about Indian streams?"--Then she,
145. Sitting beneath the midmost forest tree,
146. For pity sang this roundelay------


147. "O Sorrow,
148. Why dost borrow
149. The natural hue of health, from vermeil lips?--
150. To give maiden blushes
151. To the white rose bushes?
152. Or is it thy dewy hand the daisy tips?

153. "O Sorrow,
154. Why dost borrow
155. The lustrous passion from a falcon-eye?--
156. To give the glow-worm light?
157. Or, on a moonless night,
158. To tinge, on syren shores, the salt sea-spry?

159. "O Sorrow,
160. Why dost borrow
161. The mellow ditties from a mourning tongue?--
162. To give at evening pale
163. Unto the nightingale,
164. That thou mayst listen the cold dews among?

165. "O Sorrow,
166. Why dost borrow
167. Heart's lightness from the merriment of May?--
168. A lover would not tread
169. A cowslip on the head,
170. Though he should dance from eve till peep of day--
171. Nor any drooping flower
172. Held sacred for thy bower,
173. Wherever he may sport himself and play.

174. "To Sorrow
175. I bade good-morrow,
176. And thought to leave her far away behind;
177. But cheerly, cheerly,
178. She loves me dearly;
179. She is so constant to me, and so kind:
180. I would deceive her
181. And so leave her,
182. But ah! she is so constant and so kind.

183. "Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,
184. I sat a weeping: in the whole world wide
185. There was no one to ask me why I wept,--
186. And so I kept
187. Brimming the water-lily cups with tears
188. Cold as my fears.

189. "Beneath my palm trees, by the river side,
190. I sat a weeping: what enamour'd bride,
191. Cheated by shadowy wooer from the clouds,
192. But hides and shrouds
193. Beneath dark palm trees by a river side?

194. "And as I sat, over the light blue hills
195. There came a noise of revellers: the rills
196. Into the wide stream came of purple hue--
197. 'Twas Bacchus and his crew!
198. The earnest trumpet spake, and silver thrills
199. From kissing cymbals made a merry din--
200. 'Twas Bacchus and his kin!
201. Like to a moving vintage down they came,
202. Crown'd with green leaves, and faces all on flame;
203. All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,
204. To scare thee, Melancholy!
205. O then, O then, thou wast a simple name!
206. And I forgot thee, as the berried holly
207. By shepherds is forgotten, when, in June,
208. Tall chesnuts keep away the sun and moon:--
209. I rush'd into the folly!

210. "Within his car, aloft, young Bacchus stood,
211. Trifling his ivy-dart, in dancing mood,
212. With sidelong laughing;
213. And little rills of crimson wine imbrued
214. His plump white arms, and shoulders, enough white
215. For Venus' pearly bite;
216. And near him rode Silenus on his ass,
217. Pelted with flowers as he on did pass
218. Tipsily quaffing.

219. "Whence came ye, merry Damsels! whence came ye!
220. So many, and so many, and such glee?
221. Why have ye left your bowers desolate,
222. Your lutes, and gentler fate?--
223. ‘We follow Bacchus! Bacchus on the wing?
224. A conquering!
225. Bacchus, young Bacchus! good or ill betide,
226. We dance before him thorough kingdoms wide:--
227. Come hither, lady fair, and joined be
228. To our wild minstrelsy!'

229. "Whence came ye, jolly Satyrs! whence came ye!
230. So many, and so many, and such glee?
231. Why have ye left your forest haunts, why left
232. Your nuts in oak-tree cleft?--
233. ‘For wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;
234. For wine we left our heath, and yellow brooms,
235. And cold mushrooms;
236. For wine we follow Bacchus through the earth;
237. Great God of breathless cups and chirping mirth!--
238. Come hither, lady fair, and joined be
239. To our mad minstrelsy!'

240. "Over wide streams and mountains great we went,
241. And, save when Bacchus kept his ivy tent,
242. Onward the tiger and the leopard pants,
243. With Asian elephants:
244. Onward these myriads--with song and dance,
245. With zebras striped, and sleek Arabians' prance,
246. Web-footed alligators, crocodiles,
247. Bearing upon their scaly backs, in files,
248. Plump infant laughers mimicking the coil
249. Of seamen, and stout galley-rowers' toil:
250. With toying oars and silken sails they glide,
251. Nor care for wind and tide.

252. "Mounted on panthers' furs and lions' manes,
253. From rear to van they scour about the plains;
254. A three days' journey in a moment done:
255. And always, at the rising of the sun,
256. About the wilds they hunt with spear and horn,
257. On spleenful unicorn.

258. "I saw Osirian Egypt kneel adown
259. Before the vine-wreath crown!
260. I saw parch'd Abyssinia rouse and sing
261. To the silver cymbals' ring!
262. I saw the whelming vintage hotly pierce
263. Old Tartary the fierce!
264. The kings of Inde their jewel-sceptres vail,
265. And from their treasures scatter pearled hail;
266. Great Brahma from his mystic heaven groans,
267. And all his priesthood moans;
268. Before young Bacchus' eye-wink turning pale.--
269. Into these regions came I following him,
270. Sick hearted, weary--so I took a whim
271. To stray away into these forests drear
272. Alone, without a peer:
273. And I have told thee all thou mayest hear.

274. "Young stranger!
275. I've been a ranger
276. In search of pleasure throughout every clime:
277. Alas! 'tis not for me!
278. Bewitch'd I sure must be,
279. To lose in grieving all my maiden prime.

280. "Come then, Sorrow!
281. Sweetest Sorrow!
282. Like an own babe I nurse thee on my breast:
283. I thought to leave thee
284. And deceive thee,
285. But now of all the world I love thee best.

286. "There is not one,
287. No, no, not one
288. But thee to comfort a poor lonely maid;
289. Thou art her mother,
290. And her brother,
291. Her playmate, and her wooer in the shade."

292. O what a sigh she gave in finishing,
293. And look, quite dead to every worldly thing!
294. Endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;
295. And listened to the wind that now did stir
296. About the crisped oaks full drearily,
297. Yet with as sweet a softness as might be
298. Remember'd from its velvet summer song.
299. At last he said: "Poor lady, how thus long
300. Have I been able to endure that voice?
301. Fair Melody! kind Syren! I've no choice;
302. I must be thy sad servant evermore:
303. I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.
304. Alas, I must not think--by Phoebe, no!
305. Let me not think, soft Angel! shall it be so?
306. Say, beautifullest, shall I never think?
307. O thou could'st foster me beyond the brink
308. Of recollection! make my watchful care
309. Close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!
310. Do gently murder half my soul, and I
311. Shall feel the other half so utterly!--
312. I'm giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;
313. O let it blush so ever! let it soothe
314. My madness! let it mantle rosy-warm
315. With the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm.--
316. This cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;
317. And this is sure thine other softling--this
318. Thine own fair bosom, and I am so near!
319. Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!
320. And whisper one sweet word that I may know
321. This is this world--sweet dewy blossom!"--Woe!
322. Woe! Woe to that Endymion! Where is he?--
323. Even these words went echoing dismally
324. Through the wide forest--a most fearful tone,
325. Like one repenting in his latest moan;
326. And while it died away a shade pass'd by,
327. As of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly
328. Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth
329. Their timid necks and tremble; so these both
330. Leant to each other trembling, and sat so
331. Waiting for some destruction--when lo,
332. Foot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime
333. Beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time
334. Than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt
335. Towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt
336. One moment from his home: only the sward
337. He with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward
338. Swifter than sight was gone--even before
339. The teeming earth a sudden witness bore
340. Of his swift magic. Diving swans appear
341. Above the crystal circlings white and clear;
342. And catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,
343. How they can dive in sight and unseen rise--
344. So from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,
345. Each with large dark blue wings upon his back.
346. The youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame
347. On one, and felt himself in spleen to tame
348. The other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,
349. High as the eagles. Like two drops of dew
350. Exhal'd to Phoebus' lips, away they are gone,
351. Far from the earth away--unseen, alone,
352. Among cool clouds and winds, but that the free,
353. The buoyant life of song can floating be
354. Above their heads, and follow them untir'd.--
355. Muse of my native land, am I inspir'd?
356. This is the giddy air, and I must spread
357. Wide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread
358. Or height, or depth, or width, or any chance
359. Precipitous: I have beneath my glance
360. Those towering horses and their mournful freight.
361. Could I thus sail, and see, and thus await
362. Fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?--
363. There is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade
364. From some approaching wonder, and behold
365. Those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold
366. Snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,
367. Dying to embers from their native fire!

368. There curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,
369. It seem'd as when around the pale new moon
370. Sad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:
371. 'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.
372. For the first time, since he came nigh dead born
373. From the old womb of night, his cave forlorn
374. Had he left more forlorn; for the first time,
375. He felt aloof the day and morning's prime--
376. Because into his depth Cimmerian
377. There came a dream, shewing how a young man,
378. Ere a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,
379. Would at high Jove's empyreal footstool win
380. An immortality, and how espouse
381. Jove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house.
382. Now was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,
383. That he might at the threshold one hour wait
384. To hear the marriage melodies, and then
385. Sink downward to his dusky cave again.
386. His litter of smooth semilucent mist,
387. Diversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,
388. Puzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;
389. And scarcely for one moment could be caught
390. His sluggish form reposing motionless.
391. Those two on winged steeds, with all the stress
392. Of vision search'd for him, as one would look
393. Athwart the sallows of a river nook
394. To catch a glance at silver throated eels,--
395. Or from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals
396. His rugged forehead in a mantle pale,
397. With an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale
398. Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.

399. These raven horses, though they foster'd are
400. Of earth's splenetic fire, dully drop
401. Their full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;
402. Upon the spiritless mist have they outspread
403. Their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,--
404. And on those pinions, level in mid air,
405. Endymion sleepeth and the lady fair.
406. Slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle
407. Upon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile
408. The mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks
409. On heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks
410. To divine powers: from his hand full fain
411. Juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:
412. He tries the nerve of Phoebus' golden bow,
413. And asketh where the golden apples grow:
414. Upon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,
415. And strives in vain to unsettle and wield
416. A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings
417. A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings
418. And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,
419. And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,
420. Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.
421. He blows a bugle,--an ethereal band
422. Are visible above: the Seasons four,--
423. Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store
424. In Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,
425. Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,
426. In swells unmitigated, still doth last
427. To sway their floating morris. "Whose is this?
428. Whose bugle?" he inquires: they smile--"O Dis!
429. Why is this mortal here? Dost thou not know
430. Its mistress' lips? Not thou?--'Tis Dian's: lo!
431. She rises crescented!" He looks, 'tis she,
432. His very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,
433. And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;
434. Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring
435. Towards her, and awakes--and, strange, o'erhead,
436. Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,
437. Beheld awake his very dream: the gods
438. Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;
439. And Phoebe bends towards him crescented.
440. O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,
441. Too well awake, he feels the panting side
442. Of his delicious lady. He who died
443. For soaring too audacious in the sun,
444. Where that same treacherous wax began to run,
445. Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.
446. His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,
447. To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way--
448. Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!
449. So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,
450. He could not help but kiss her: then he grew
451. Awhile forgetful of all beauty save
452. Young Phoebe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave
453. Forgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look
454. At the sweet sleeper,--all his soul was shook,--
455. She press'd his hand in slumber; so once more
456. He could not help but kiss her and adore.
457. At this the shadow wept, melting away.
458. The Latmian started up: "Bright goddess, stay!
459. Search my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,
460. I have no dædale heart: why is it wrung
461. To desperation? Is there nought for me,
462. Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"

463. These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:
464. Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses
465. With 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.
466. "Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe
467. This murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st
468. Pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st
469. What horrors may discomfort thee and me.
470. Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!--
471. Yet did she merely weep--her gentle soul
472. Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole
473. In tenderness, would I were whole in love!
474. Can I prize thee, fair maid, all price above,
475. Even when I feel as true as innocence?
476. I do, I do.--What is this soul then? Whence
477. Came it? It does not seem my own, and I
478. Have no self-passion or identity.
479. Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?
480. By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit
481. Alone about the dark--Forgive me, sweet:
482. Shall we away?" He rous'd the steeds: they beat
483. Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,
484. Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.

485. The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,
486. And Vesper, risen star, began to throe
487. In the dusk heavens silvery, when they
488. Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.
489. Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange--
490. Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,
491. In such wise, in such temper, so aloof
492. Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,
493. So witless of their doom, that verily
494. 'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;
495. Whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd--
496. Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd.

497. Full facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,
498. The moon put forth a little diamond peak,
499. No bigger than an unobserved star,
500. Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;
501. Bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie
502. Her silver sandals, ere deliciously
503. She bow'd into the heavens her timid head.
504. Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,
505. While to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,
506. To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd
507. This beauty in its birth--Despair! despair!
508. He saw her body fading gaunt and spare
509. In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;
510. It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,
511. And, horror! kiss'd his own--he was alone.
512. Her steed a little higher soar'd, and then
513. Dropt hawkwise to the earth.        There lies a den,
514. Beyond the seeming confines of the space
515. Made for the soul to wander in and trace
516. Its own existence, of remotest glooms.
517. Dark regions are around it, where the tombs
518. Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce
519. One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce
520. Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:
521. And in these regions many a venom'd dart
522. At random flies; they are the proper home
523. Of every ill: the man is yet to come
524. Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.
525. But few have ever felt how calm and well
526. Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.
527. There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:
528. Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,
529. Yet all is still within and desolate.
530. Beset with painful gusts, within ye hear
531. No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier
532. The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none
533. Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.
534. Just when the sufferer begins to burn,
535. Then it is free to him; and from an urn,
536. Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught--
537. Young Semele such richness never quaft
538. In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!
539. Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom
540. Of health by due; where silence dreariest
541. Is most articulate; where hopes infest;
542. Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep
543. Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.
544. O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!
545. Pregnant with such a den to save the whole
546. In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!
547. For, never since thy griefs and woes began,
548. Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud
549. Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.
550. Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne
551. With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn
552. Because he knew not whither he was going.
553. So happy was he, not the aerial blowing
554. Of trumpets at clear parley from the east
555. Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.
556. They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm
557. He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm
558. Could lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd
559. A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,--
560. And silvery was its passing: voices sweet
561. Warbling the while as if to lull and greet
562. The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,
563. While past the vision went in bright array.

564. "Who, who from Dian's feast would be away?
565. For all the golden bowers of the day
566. Are empty left? Who, who away would be
567. From Cynthia's wedding and festivity?
568. Not Hesperus: lo! upon his silver wings
569. He leans away for highest heaven and sings,
570. Snapping his lucid fingers merrily!--
571. Ah, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!
572. Ye tender bibbers of the rain and dew,
573. Young playmates of the rose and daffodil,
574. Be careful, ere ye enter in, to fill
575. Your baskets high
576. With fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,
577. Savory, latter-mint, and columbines,
578. Cool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;
579. Yea, every flower and leaf of every clime,
580. All gather'd in the dewy morning: hie
581. Away! fly, fly!--
582. Crystalline brother of the belt of heaven,
583. Aquarius! to whom king Jove has given
584. Two liquid pulse streams 'stead of feather'd wings,
585. Two fan-like fountains,--thine illuminings
586. For Dian play:
587. Dissolve the frozen purity of air;
588. Let thy white shoulders silvery and bare
589. Shew cold through watery pinions; make more bright
590. The Star-Queen's crescent on her marriage night:
591. Haste, haste away!--
592. Castor has tamed the planet Lion, see!
593. And of the Bear has Pollux mastery:
594. A third is in the race! who is the third,
595. Speeding away swift as the eagle bird?
596. The ramping Centaur!
597. The Lion's mane's on end: the Bear how fierce!
598. The Centaur's arrow ready seems to pierce
599. Some enemy: far forth his bow is bent
600. Into the blue of heaven. He'll be shent,
601. Pale unrelentor,
602. When he shall hear the wedding lutes a playing.--
603. Andromeda! sweet woman! why delaying
604. So timidly among the stars: come hither!
605. Join this bright throng, and nimbly follow whither
606. They all are going.
607. Danae's Son, before Jove newly bow'd,
608. Has wept for thee, calling to Jove aloud.
609. Thee, gentle lady, did he disenthral:
610. Ye shall for ever live and love, for all
611. Thy tears are flowing.--
612. By Daphne's fright, behold Apollo!--"

613. More
614. Endymion heard not: down his steed him bore,
615. Prone to the green head of a misty hill.

616. His first touch of the earth went nigh to kill.
617. "Alas!" said he, "were I but always borne
618. Through dangerous winds, had but my footsteps worn
619. A path in hell, for ever would I bless
620. Horrors which nourish an uneasiness
621. For my own sullen conquering: to him
622. Who lives beyond earth's boundary, grief is dim,
623. Sorrow is but a shadow: now I see
624. The grass; I feel the solid ground--Ah, me!
625. It is thy voice--divinest! Where?--who? who
626. Left thee so quiet on this bed of dew?
627. Behold upon this happy earth we are;
628. Let us ay love each other; let us fare
629. On forest-fruits, and never, never go
630. Among the abodes of mortals here below,
631. Or be by phantoms duped. O destiny!
632. Into a labyrinth now my soul would fly,
633. But with thy beauty will I deaden it.
634. Where didst thou melt too? By thee will I sit
635. For ever: let our fate stop here--a kid
636. I on this spot will offer: Pan will bid
637. Us live in peace, in love and peace among
638. His forest wildernesses. I have clung
639. To nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen
640. Or felt but a great dream! O I have been
641. Presumptuous against love, against the sky,
642. Against all elements, against the tie
643. Of mortals each to each, against the blooms
644. Of flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs
645. Of heroes gone! Against his proper glory
646. Has my own soul conspired: so my story
647. Will I to children utter, and repent.
648. There never liv'd a mortal man, who bent
649. His appetite beyond his natural sphere,
650. But starv'd and died. My sweetest Indian, here,
651. Here will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast
652. My life from too thin breathing: gone and past
653. Are cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!
654. And air of visions, and the monstrous swell
655. Of visionary seas! No, never more
656. Shall airy voices cheat me to the shore
657. Of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.
658. Adieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast
659. My love is still for thee. The hour may come
660. When we shall meet in pure elysium.
661. On earth I may not love thee; and therefore
662. Doves will I offer up, and sweetest store
663. All through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine
664. On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,
665. And bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!
666. My river-lily bud! one human kiss!
667. One sigh of real breath--one gentle squeeze,
668. Warm as a dove's nest among summer trees,
669. And warm with dew at ooze from living blood!
670. Whither didst melt? Ah, what of that!--all good
671. We'll talk about--no more of dreaming.--Now,
672. Where shall our dwelling be? Under the brow
673. Of some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun
674. Would hide us up, although spring leaves were none;
675. And where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,
676. Will drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?
677. O thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;
678. Dusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace
679. Those gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:
680. For by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,
681. And by another, in deep dell below,
682. See, through the trees, a little river go
683. All in its mid-day gold and glimmering.
684. Honey from out the gnarled hive I'll bring,
685. And apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,--
686. Cresses that grow where no man may them see,
687. And sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:
688. Pipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,
689. That thou mayst always know whither I roam,
690. When it shall please thee in our quiet home
691. To listen and think of love. Still let me speak;
692. Still let me dive into the joy I seek,--
693. For yet the past doth prison me. The rill,
694. Thou haply mayst delight in, will I fill
695. With fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,
696. And thou shalt feed them from the squirrel's barn.
697. Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,
698. And pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.
699. Its sides I'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,
700. And honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.
701. I will entice this crystal rill to trace
702. Love's silver name upon the meadow's face.
703. I'll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;
704. And to god Phoebus, for a golden lyre;
705. To Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;
706. To Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,
707. That I may see thy beauty through the night;
708. To Flora, and a nightingale shall light
709. Tame on thy finger; to the River-gods,
710. And they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods
711. Of gold, and lines of Naiads' long bright tress.
712. Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!
713. Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be
714. 'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:
715. Those lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak
716. Laws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,
717. Trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,
718. And of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:
719. And that affectionate light, those diamond things,
720. Those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,
721. Shall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.
722. Say, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?
723. O that I could not doubt?"

724. The mountaineer
725. Thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear
726. His briar'd path to some tranquillity.
727. It gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,
728. And yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;
729. Answering thus, just as the golden morrow
730. Beam'd upward from the vallies of the east:
731. "O that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,
732. Or the sweet name of love had pass'd away.
733. Young feather'd tyrant! by a swift decay
734. Wilt thou devote this body to the earth:
735. And I do think that at my very birth
736. I lisp'd thy blooming titles inwardly;
737. For at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,
738. With uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.
739. Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven
740. To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!
741. When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew
742. Favour from thee, and so I kisses gave
743. To the void air, bidding them find out love:
744. But when I came to feel how far above
745. All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,
746. All earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,
747. Was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,--
748. Even then, that moment, at the thought of this,
749. Fainting I fell into a bed of flowers,
750. And languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,
751. Am I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe
752. Me, dear Endymion, were I to weave
753. With my own fancies garlands of sweet life,
754. Thou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!
755. I may not be thy love: I am forbidden--
756. Indeed I am--thwarted, affrighted, chidden,
757. By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.
758. Twice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth
759. Ask me no more! I may not utter it,
760. Nor may I be thy love. We might commit
761. Ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;
762. We might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!
763. Enlarge not to my hunger, or I'm caught
764. In trammels of perverse deliciousness.
765. No, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,
766. And bid a long adieu."

767. The Carian
768. No word return'd: both lovelorn, silent, wan,
769. Into the vallies green together went.
770. Far wandering, they were perforce content
771. To sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;
772. Nor at each other gaz'd, but heavily
773. Por'd on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.

774. Endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves
775. Me to behold thee thus in last extreme:
776. Ensky'd ere this, but truly that I deem
777. Truth the best music in a first-born song.
778. Thy lute-voic'd brother will I sing ere long,
779. And thou shalt aid--hast thou not aided me?
780. Yes, moonlight Emperor! felicity
781. Has been thy meed for many thousand years;
782. Yet often have I, on the brink of tears,
783. Mourn'd as if yet thou wert a forester,--
784. Forgetting the old tale.

785. He did not stir
786. His eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse
787. Of joy he might have felt. The spirit culls
788. Unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays
789. Through the old garden-ground of boyish days.
790. A little onward ran the very stream
791. By which he took his first soft poppy dream;
792. And on the very bark 'gainst which he leant
793. A crescent he had carv'd, and round it spent
794. His skill in little stars. The teeming tree
795. Had swollen and green'd the pious charactery,
796. But not ta'en out. Why, there was not a slope
797. Up which he had not fear'd the antelope;
798. And not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade
799. He had not with his tamed leopards play'd.
800. Nor could an arrow light, or javelin,
801. Fly in the air where his had never been--
802. And yet he knew it not.

803. O treachery!
804. Why does his lady smile, pleasing her eye
805. With all his sorrowing? He sees her not.
806. But who so stares on him? His sister sure!
807. Peona of the woods!--Can she endure--
808. Impossible--how dearly they embrace!
809. His lady smiles; delight is in her face;
810. It is no treachery.

811. "Dear brother mine!
812. Endymion, weep not so! Why shouldst thou pine
813. When all great Latmos so exalt wilt be?
814. Thank the great gods, and look not bitterly;
815. And speak not one pale word, and sigh no more.
816. Sure I will not believe thou hast such store
817. Of grief, to last thee to my kiss again.
818. Thou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,
819. Come hand in hand with one so beautiful.
820. Be happy both of you! for I will pull
821. The flowers of autumn for your coronals.
822. Pan's holy priest for young Endymion calls;
823. And when he is restor'd, thou, fairest dame,
824. Shalt be our queen. Now, is it not a shame
825. To see ye thus,--not very, very sad?
826. Perhaps ye are too happy to be glad:
827. O feel as if it were a common day;
828. Free-voic'd as one who never was away.
829. No tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall
830. Be gods of your own rest imperial.
831. Not even I, for one whole month, will pry
832. Into the hours that have pass'd us by,
833. Since in my arbour I did sing to thee.
834. O Hermes! on this very night will be
835. A hymning up to Cynthia, queen of light;
836. For the soothsayers old saw yesternight
837. Good visions in the air,--whence will befal,
838. As say these sages, health perpetual
839. To shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,
840. In Dian's face they read the gentle lore:
841. Therefore for her these vesper-carols are.
842. Our friends will all be there from nigh and far.
843. Many upon thy death have ditties made;
844. And many, even now, their foreheads shade
845. With cypress, on a day of sacrifice.
846. New singing for our maids shalt thou devise,
847. And pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen's brows.
848. Tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse
849. This wayward brother to his rightful joys!
850. His eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poise
851. His fate most goddess-like. Help me, I pray,
852. To lure--Endymion, dear brother, say
853. What ails thee?" He could bear no more, and so
854. Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,
855. And twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said:
856. "I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!
857. My only visitor! not ignorant though,
858. That those deceptions which for pleasure go
859. 'Mong men, are pleasures real as real may be:
860. But there are higher ones I may not see,
861. If impiously an earthly realm I take.
862. Since I saw thee, I have been wide awake
863. Night after night, and day by day, until
864. Of the empyrean I have drunk my fill.
865. Let it content thee, Sister, seeing me
866. More happy than betides mortality.
867. A hermit young, I'll live in mossy cave,
868. Where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave
869. Thy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.
870. Through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;
871. For to thy tongue will I all health confide.
872. And, for my sake, let this young maid abide
873. With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,
874. Peona, mayst return to me. I own
875. This may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,
876. Thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl
877. Will trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!
878. Wilt be content to dwell with her, to share
879. This sister's love with me?" Like one resign'd
880. And bent by circumstance, and thereby blind
881. In self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:
882. "Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,
883. Of jubilee to Dian:--truth I heard!
884. Well then, I see there is no little bird,
885. Tender soever, but is Jove's own care.
886. Long have I sought for rest, and, unaware,
887. Behold I find it! so exalted too!
888. So after my own heart! I knew, I knew
889. There was a place untenanted in it:
890. In that same void white Chastity shall sit,
891. And monitor me nightly to lone slumber.
892. With sanest lips I vow me to the number
893. Of Dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,
894. With thy good help, this very night shall see
895. My future days to her fane consecrate."

896. As feels a dreamer what doth most create
897. His own particular fright, so these three felt:
898. Or like one who, in after ages, knelt
899. To Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine
900. After a little sleep: or when in mine
901. Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends
902. Who know him not. Each diligently bends
903. Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;
904. Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,
905. By thinking it a thing of yes and no,
906. That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow
907. Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last
908. Endymion said: "Are not our fates all cast?
909. Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!
910. Adieu!" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,
911. Walk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot
912. His eyes went after them, until they got
913. Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,
914. In one swift moment, would what then he saw
915. Engulph for ever. "Stay!" he cried, "ah, stay!
916. Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.
917. Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again.
918. It is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,
919. Peona, ye should hand in hand repair
920. Into those holy groves, that silent are
921. Behind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,
922. At vesper's earliest twinkle--they are gone--
923. But once, once, once again--" At this he press'd
924. His hands against his face, and then did rest
925. His head upon a mossy hillock green,
926. And so remain'd as he a corpse had been
927. All the long day; save when he scantly lifted
928. His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted
929. With the slow move of time,--sluggish and weary
930. Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,
931. Had reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,
932. And, slowly as that very river flows,
933. Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:
934. "Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent
935. Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall
936. Before the serene father of them all
937. Bows down his summer head below the west.
938. Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,
939. But at the setting I must bid adieu
940. To her for the last time. Night will strew
941. On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,
942. And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves
943. To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.
944. Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord
945. Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,
946. Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;
947. My kingdom's at its death, and just it is
948. That I should die with it: so in all this
949. We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,
950. What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe
951. I am but rightly serv'd." So saying, he
952. Tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;
953. Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,
954. As though they jests had been: nor had he done
955. His laugh at nature's holy countenance,
956. Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,
957. And then his tongue with sober seemlihed
958. Gave utterance as he entered: "Ha!" I said,
959. "King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,
960. And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,
961. This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,
962. And the Promethean clay by thief endued,
963. By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head
964. Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed
965. Myself to things of light from infancy;
966. And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,
967. Is sure enough to make a mortal man
968. Grow impious." So he inwardly began
969. On things for which no wording can be found;
970. Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd
971. Beyond the reach of music: for the choir
972. Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar
973. Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull
974. The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,
975. Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.
976. He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,
977. Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight
978. By chilly finger'd spring. "Unhappy wight!
979. Endymion!" said Peona, "we are here!
980. What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?"
981. Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand
982. Press'd, saying:" Sister, I would have command,
983. If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate."
984. At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate
985. And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,
986. To Endymion's amaze: "By Cupid's dove,
987. And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth
988. Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!"
989. And as she spake, into her face there came
990. Light, as reflected from a silver flame:
991. Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display
992. Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day
993. Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld
994. Phoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld
995. Her lucid bow, continuing thus; "Drear, drear
996. Has our delaying been; but foolish fear
997. Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;
998. And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state
999. Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change
1000. Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range
1001. These forests, and to thee they safe shall be
1002. As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee
1003. To meet us many a time." Next Cynthia bright
1004. Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:
1005. Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown
1006. Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.
1007. She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,
1008. Before three swiftest kisses he had told,
1009. They vanish'd far away!--Peona went
1010. Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.
