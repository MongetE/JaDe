1. Chief of organic Numbers!
2. Old Scholar of the Spheres!
3. Thy spirit never slumbers,
4. But rolls about our ears
5. For ever and for ever.
6. O, what a mad endeavour
7. Worketh he
8. Who, to thy sacred and ennobled hearse,
9. Would offer a burnt sacrifice of verse
10. And Melody!

11. How heavenward thou soundedst
12. Live Temple of sweet noise;
13. And discord unconfoundedst:
14. Giving delight new joys,
15. And Pleasure nobler pinions--
16. O where are thy Dominions!
17. Lend thine ear
18. To a young delian oath--aye, by thy soul,
19. By all that from thy mortal Lips did roll;
20. And by the Kernel of thine earthly Love,
21. Beauty, in things on earth and things above,
22. When every childish fashion
23. Has vanish'd from my rhyme
24. Will I grey-gone in passion
25. Give to an after-time
26. Hymning and harmony
27. Of thee, and of thy Words and of thy Life:
28. But vain is now the bruning and the strife--
29. Pangs are in vain -- until I grow high-rife
30. With Old Philosophy
31. And mad with glimpses at futurity!

32. For many years my offerings must be hush'd:
33. When I do speak I'll think upon this hour,
34. Because I feel my forehead hot and flush'd,
35. Even at the simplest vassal of thy Power,--
36. A Lock of thy bright hair!
37. Sudden it came,
38. And I was startled when I heard thy name
39. Coupled so unaware--
40. Yet, at the moment, temperate was my blood:
41. Methought I had beheld it from the flood.
