1. Fill for me a brimming bowl
2. And in it let me drown my soul:
3. But put therein some drug, designed
4. To Banish Women from my mind:
5. For I want not the stream inspiring
6. That fills the mind with--fond desiring,
7. But I want as deep a draught
8. As e'er from Lethe's wave was quaff'd;
9. From my despairing heart to charm
10. The Image of the fairest form
11. That e'er my reveling eyes beheld,
12. That e'er my wandering fancy spell'd.
13. In vain! away I cannot chace
14. The melting softness of that face,
15. The beaminess of those bright eyes,
16. That breast--earth's only Paradise.
17. My sight will never more be blest;
18. For all I see has lost its zest:
19. Nor with delight can I explore,
20. The Classic page, or Muse's lore.
21. Had she but known how beat my heart,
22. And with one smile reliev'd its smart
23. I should have felt a sweet relief,
24. I should have felt ``the joy of grief.''
25. Yet as the Tuscan mid the snow
26. Of Lapland dreams on sweet Arno,
27. Even so for ever shall she be
28. The Halo of my Memory.
