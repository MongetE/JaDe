1. O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell,
2. Let it not be among the jumbled heap
3. Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep, --
4. Nature's observatory -- whence the dell,
5. Its flowery slopes, its river's crystal swell,
6. May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep
7. 'Mongst boughs pavilion'd, where the deer's swift leap
8. Startles the wild bee from the foxglove bell.
9. But though I'll gladly trace these scenes with thee,
10. Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind,
11. Whose words are images of thoughts refin'd,
12. Is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be
13. Almost the highest bliss of human-kind,
14. When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee.
