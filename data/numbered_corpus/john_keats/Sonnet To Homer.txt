1. Standing aloof in giant ignorance,
2. Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades,
3. As one who sits ashore and longs perchance
4. To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas.
5. So thou wast blind; -- but then the veil was rent,
6. For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live,
7. And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent,
8. And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive;
9. Aye on the shores of darkness there is light,
10. And precipices show untrodden green
11. There is a budding morrow in the midnight,
12. There is a triple sight in blindness keen;
13. Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel
14. To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell.
