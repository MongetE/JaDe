1. Oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
2. Alone and palely loitering?
3. The sedge has withered from the lake,
4. And no birds sing.
5. Oh what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
6. So haggard and so woe-begone?
7. The squirrel's granary is full,
8. And the harvest's done.

9. I see a lily on thy brow,
10. With anguish moist and fever-dew,
11. And on thy cheeks a fading rose
12. Fast withereth too.

13. I met a lady in the meads,
14. Full beautiful - a faery's child,
15. Her hair was long, her foot was light,
16. And her eyes were wild.

17. I made a garland for her head,
18. And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
19. She looked at me as she did love,
20. And made sweet moan.

21. I set her on my pacing steed,
22. And nothing else saw all day long,
23. For sidelong would she bend, and sing
24. A faery's song.

25. She found me roots of relish sweet,
26. And honey wild, and manna-dew,
27. And sure in language strange she said -
28. 'I love thee true'.

29. She took me to her elfin grot,
30. And there she wept and sighed full sore,
31. And there I shut her wild wild eyes
32. With kisses four.

33. And there she lulled me asleep
34. And there I dreamed - Ah! woe betide! -
35. The latest dream I ever dreamt
36. On the cold hill side.

37. I saw pale kings and princes too,
38. Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
39. They cried - 'La Belle Dame sans Merci
40. Hath thee in thrall!'

41. I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
42. With horrid warning gaped wide,
43. And I awoke and found me here,
44. On the cold hill's side.

45. And this is why I sojourn here
46. Alone and palely loitering,
47. Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
48. And no birds sing.
