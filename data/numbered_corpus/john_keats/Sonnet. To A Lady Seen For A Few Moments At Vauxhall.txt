1. Time's sea hath been five years at its slow ebb,
2. Long hours have to and fro let creep the sand,
3. Since I was tangled in thy beauty's web,
4. And snared by the ungloving of thine hand.
5. And yet I never look on midnight sky,
6. But I behold thine eyes' well memory'd light;
7. I cannot look upon the rose's dye,
8. But to thy cheek my soul doth take its flight.
9. I cannot look on any budding flower,
10. But my fond ear, in fancy at thy lips
11. And hearkening for a love-sound, doth devour
12. Its sweets in the wrong sense: -- Thou dost eclipse
13. Every delight with sweet remembering,
14. And grief unto my darling joys dost bring.
