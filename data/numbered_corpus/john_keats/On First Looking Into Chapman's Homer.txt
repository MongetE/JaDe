1. Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
2. And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
3. Round many western islands have I been
4. Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
5. Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
6. That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
7. Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
8. Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
9. Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
10. When a new planet swims into his ken;
11. Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
12. He star'd at the Pacific--and all his men
13. Look'd at each other with a wild surmise--
14. Silent, upon a peak in Darien.
