1. As I lay in my bed slepe full unmete
2. Was unto me, but why that I ne might
3. Rest I ne wist, for there n'as erthly wight
4. [As I suppose] had more of hertis ese
5. Than I, for I n'ad sicknesse nor disese. ~ Chaucer


6. What is more gentle than a wind in summer?
7. What is more soothing than the pretty hummer
8. That stays one moment in an open flower,
9. And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower?
10. What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing
11. In a green island, far from all men's knowing?
12. More healthful than the leafiness of dales?
13. More secret than a nest of nightingales?
14. More serene than Cordelia's countenance?
15. More full of visions than a high romance?
16. What, but thee Sleep? Soft closer of our eyes!
17. Low murmurer of tender lullabies!
18. Light hoverer around our happy pillows!
19. Wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows!
20. Silent entangler of a beauty's tresses!
21. Most happy listener! when the morning blesses
22. Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes
23. That glance so brightly at the new sun-rise.

24. But what is higher beyond thought than thee?
25. Fresher than berries of a mountain tree?
26. More strange, more beautiful, more smooth, more regal,
27. Than wings of swans, than doves, than dim-seen eagle?
28. What is it? And to what shall I compare it?
29. It has a glory, and naught else can share it:
30. The thought thereof is awful, sweet, and holy,
31. Chasing away all worldliness and folly;
32. Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder,
33. Or the low rumblings earth's regions under;
34. And sometimes like a gentle whispering
35. Of all the secrets of some wond'rous thing
36. That breathes about us in the vacant air;
37. So that we look around with prying stare,
38. Perhaps to see shapes of light, aerial limning,
39. And catch soft floatings from a faint-heard hymning;
40. To see the laurel wreath, on high suspended,
41. That is to crown our name when life is ended.
42. Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice,
43. And from the heart up-springs, rejoice! rejoice!
44. Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things,
45. And die away in ardent mutterings.

46. No one who once the glorious sun has seen,
47. And all the clouds, and felt his bosom clean
48. For his great Maker's presence, but must know
49. What 'tis I mean, and feel his being glow:
50. Therefore no insult will I give his spirit,
51. By telling what he sees from native merit.

52. O Poesy! for thee I hold my pen
53. That am not yet a glorious denizen
54. Of thy wide heaven- Should I rather kneel
55. Upon some mountain-top until I feel
56. A glowing splendour round about me hung,
57. And echo back the voice of thine own tongue?
58. O Poesy! for thee I grasp my pen
59. That am not yet a glorious denizen
60. Of thy wide heaven; yet, to my ardent prayer,
61. Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air,
62. Smooth'd for intoxication by the breath
63. Of flowering bays, that I may die a death
64. Of luxury, and my young spirit follow
65. The morning sun-beams to the great Apollo
66. Like a fresh sacrifice; or, if I can bear
67. The o'erwhelming sweets, 'twill bring to me the fair
68. Visions of all places: a bowery nook
69. Will be elysium- an eternal book
70. Whence I may copy many a lovely saying
71. About the leaves, and flowers- about the playing
72. Of nymphs in woods, and fountains; and the shade
73. Keeping a silence round a sleeping maid;
74. And many a verse from so strange influence
75. That we must ever wonder how, and whence
76. It came. Also imaginings will hover
77. Round my fire-side, and haply there discover
78. Vistas of solemn beauty, where I'd wander
79. In happy silence, like the clear Meander
80. Through its lone vales; and where I found a spot
81. Of awfuller shade, or an enchanted grot,
82. Or a green hill o'erspread with chequer'd dress
83. Of flowers, and fearful from its loveliness,
84. Write on my tablets all that was permitted,
85. All that was for our human senses fitted.
86. Then the events of this wide world I'd seize
87. Like a strong giant, and my spirit teaze
88. Till at its shoulders it should proudly see
89. Wings to find out an immortality.

90. Stop and consider! life is but a day;
91. A fragile dew-drop on its perilous way
92. From a tree's summit; a poor Indian's sleep
93. While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep
94. Of Montmorenci. Why so sad a moan?
95. Life is the rose's hope while yet unblown;
96. The reading of an ever-changing tale;
97. The light uplifting of a maiden's veil;
98. A pigeon tumbling in clear summer air;
99. A laughing school-boy, without grief or care,
100. Riding the springy branches of an elm.

101. O for ten years, that I may overwhelm
102. Myself in poesy; so I may do the deed
103. That my own soul has to itself decreed.
104. Then will I pass the countries that I see
105. In long perspective, and continually
106. Taste their pure fountains. First the realm I'll pass
107. Of Flora, and old Pan: sleep in the grass,
108. Feed upon apples red, and strawberries,
109. And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees;
110. Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places,
111. To woo sweet kisses from averted faces,-
112. Play with their fingers, touch their shoulders white
113. Into a pretty shrinking with a bite
114. As hard as lips can make it: till agreed,
115. A lovely tale of human life we'll read.
116. And one will teach a tame dove how it best
117. May fan the cool air gently o'er my rest;
118. Another, bending o'er her nimble tread,
119. Will set a green robe floating round her head,
120. And still will dance with ever varied ease,
121. Smiling upon the flowers and the trees:
122. Another will entice me on, and on
123. Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon;
124. Till in the bosom of a leafy world
125. We rest in silence, like two gems upcurl'd
126. In the recesses of a pearly shell.

127. And can I ever bid these joys farewell?
128. Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,
129. Where I may find the agonies, the strife
130. Of human hearts: for lo! I see afar,
131. O'ersailing the blue cragginess, a car
132. And steeds with streamy manes- the charioteer
133. Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear:
134. And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly
135. Along a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly
136. Wheel downward come they into fresher skies,
137. Tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes.
138. Still downward with capacious whirl they glide;
139. And now I see them on the green-hill's side
140. In breezy rest among the nodding stalks.
141. The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks
142. To the trees and mountains; and there soon appear
143. Shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,
144. Passing along before a dusky space
145. Made by some mighty oaks: as they would chase
146. Some ever- fleeting music on they sweep.
147. Lo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:
148. Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;
149. Some with their faces muffled to the ear
150. Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,
151. Go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom;
152. Some looking back, and some with upward gaze;
153. Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways
154. Flit onward- now a lovely wreath of girls
155. Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;
156. And now broad wings. Most awfully intent
157. The driver of those steeds is forward bent,
158. And seems to listen: O that I might know
159. All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.

160. The visions all are fled- the car is fled
161. Into the light of heaven, and in their stead
162. A sense of real things comes doubly strong,
163. And, like a muddy stream, would bear along
164. My soul to nothingness: but I will strive
165. Against all doubtings, and will keep alive
166. The thought of that same chariot, and the strange
167. Journey it went.
168. Is there so small a range
169. In the present strength of manhood, that the high
170. Imagination cannot freely fly
171. As she was wont of old? prepare her steeds,
172. Paw up against the light, and do strange deeds
173. Upon the clouds? Has she not shown us all?
174. From the clear space of ether, to the small
175. Breath of new buds unfolding? From the meaning
176. Of Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening
177. Of April meadows? Here her altar shone,
178. E'en in this isle; and who could paragon
179. The fervid choir that lifted up a noise
180. Of harmony, to where it aye will poise
181. Its mighty self of convoluting sound,
182. Huge as a planet, and like that roll round,
183. Eternally around a dizzy void?
184. Ay, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd
185. With honors; nor had any other care
186. Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair.

187. Could all this be forgotten? Yes, a schism
188. Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,
189. Made great Apollo blush for this his land.
190. Men were thought wise who could not understand
191. His glories: with a puling infant's force
192. They sway'd about upon a rocking horse,
193. And thought it Pegasus. Ah dismal soul'd!
194. The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd
195. Its gathering waves- ye felt it not. The blue
196. Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew
197. Of summer nights collected still to make
198. The morning precious: beauty was awake!
199. Why were ye not awake? But ye were dead
200. To things ye knew not of,- were closely wed
201. To musty laws lined out with wretched rule
202. And compass vile: so that ye taught a school
203. Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,
204. Till, like the certain wands of Jacob's wit,
205. Their verses tallied. Easy was the task:
206. A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask
207. Of Poesy. Ill-fated, impious race!
208. That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,
209. And did not know it,- no, they went about,
210. Holding a poor, decrepid standard out
211. Mark'd with most flimsy mottos, and in large
212. The name of one Boileau!

213. O ye whose charge
214. It is to hover round our pleasant hills!
215. Whose congregated majesty so fills
216. My boundly reverence, that I cannot trace
217. Your hallowed names, in this unholy place,
218. So near those common folk; did not their shames
219. Affright you? Did our old lamenting Thames
220. Delight you? Did ye never cluster round
221. Delicious Avon, with a mournful sound,
222. And weep? Or did ye wholly bid adieu
223. To regions where no more the laurel grew?
224. Or did ye stay to give a welcoming
225. To some lone spirits who could proudly sing
226. Their youth away, and die? 'Twas even so:
227. But let me think away those times of woe:
228. Now 'tis a fairer season; ye have breathed
229. Rich benedictions o'er us; ye have wreathed
230. Fresh garlands: for sweet music has been heard
231. In many places;- some has been upstirr'd
232. From out its crystal dwelling in a lake,
233. By a swan's ebon bill; from a thick brake,
234. Nested and quiet in a valley mild,
235. Bubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild
236. About the earth: happy are ye and glad.

237. These things are doubtless: yet in truth we've had
238. Strange thunders from the potency of song;
239. Mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong,
240. From majesty: but in clear truth the themes
241. Are ugly clubs, the Poets' Polyphemes
242. Disturbing the grand sea. A drainless shower
243. Of light is poesy; 'tis the supreme of power;
244. 'Tis might half slumb'ring on its own right arm.
245. The very archings of her eye-lids charm
246. A thousand willing agents to obey,
247. And still she governs with the mildest sway:
248. But strength alone though of the Muses born
249. Is like a fallen angel: trees uptorn,
250. Darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres
251. Delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,
252. And thorns of life; forgetting the great end
253. Of poesy, that it should be a friend
254. To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man.

255. Yet I rejoice: a myrtle fairer than
256. E'er grew in Paphos, from the bitter weeds
257. Lifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds
258. A silent space with ever sprouting green.
259. All tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen,
260. Creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering,
261. Nibble the little cupped flowers and sing.
262. Then let us clear away the choking thorns
263. From round its gentle stem; let the young fawns,
264. Yeaned in after times, when we are flown,
265. Find a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown
266. With simple flowers: let there nothing be
267. More boisterous than a lover's bended knee;
268. Nought more ungentle than the placid look
269. Of one who leans upon a closed book;
270. Nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes
271. Between two hills. All hail delightful hopes!
272. As she was wont, th' imagination
273. Into most lovely labyrinths will be gone,
274. And they shall be accounted poet kings
275. Who simply tell the most heart-easing things.
276. O may these joys be ripe before I die.

277. Will not some say that I presumptuously
278. Have spoken? that from hastening disgrace
279. 'Twere better far to hide my foolish face?
280. That whining boyhood should with reverence bow
281. Ere the dread thunderbolt could reach? How!
282. If I do hide myself, it sure shall be
283. In the very fane, the light of Poesy:
284. If I do fall, at least I will be laid
285. Beneath the silence of a poplar shade;
286. And over me the grass shall be smooth shaven;
287. And there shall be a kind memorial graven.
288. But off Despondence! miserable bane!
289. They should not know thee, who athirst to gain
290. A noble end, are thirsty every hour.
291. What though I am not wealthy in the dower
292. Of spanning wisdom; though I do not know
293. The shiftings of the mighty winds that blow
294. Hither and thither all the changing thoughts
295. Of man: though no great minist'ring reason sorts
296. Out the dark mysteries of human souls
297. To clear conceiving: yet there ever rolls
298. A vast idea before me, and I glean
299. Therefrom my liberty; thence too I've seen
300. The end and aim of Poesy. 'Tis clear
301. As anything most true; as that the year
302. Is made of the four seasons- manifest
303. As a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,
304. Lifted to the white clouds. Therefore should I
305. Be but the essence of deformity,
306. A coward, did my very eye-lids wink
307. At speaking out what I have dared to think.
308. Ah! rather let me like a madman run
309. Over some precipice; let the hot sun
310. Melt my Dedalian wings, and drive me down
311. Convuls'd and headlong! Stay! an inward frown
312. Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile.
313. An ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,
314. Spreads awfully before me. How much toil!
315. How many days! what desperate turmoil!
316. Ere I can have explored its widenesses.
317. Ah, what a task! upon my bended knees,
318. I could unsay those- no, impossible!
319. Impossible!

320. For sweet relief I'll dwell
321. On humbler thoughts, and let this strange assay
322. Begun in gentleness die so away.
323. E'en now all tumult from my bosom fades:
324. I turn full hearted to the friendly aids
325. That smooth the path of honour; brotherhood,
326. And friendliness the nurse of mutual good.
327. The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet
328. Into the brain ere one can think upon it;
329. The silence when some rhymes are coming out;
330. And when they're come, the very pleasant rout:
331. The message certain to be done to-morrow.
332. 'Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow
333. Some precious book from out its snug retreat,
334. To cluster round it when we next shall meet.
335. Scarce can I scribble on; for lovely airs
336. Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs;
337. Many delights of that glad day recalling,
338. When first my senses caught their tender falling.
339. And with these airs come forms of elegance
340. Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance,
341. Careless, and grand-fingers soft and round
342. Parting luxuriant curls;- and the swift bound
343. Of Bacchus from his chariot, when his eye
344. Made Ariadne's cheek look blushingly.
345. Thus I remember all the pleasant flow
346. Of words at opening a portfolio.

347. Things such as these are ever harbingers
348. To trains of peaceful images: the stirs
349. Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes:
350. A linnet starting all about the bushes:
351. A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted,
352. Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted
353. With over pleasure- many, many more,
354. Might I indulge at large in all my store
355. Of luxuries: yet I must not forget
356. Sleep, quiet with his poppy coronet:
357. For what there may be worthy in these rhymes
358. I partly owe to him: and thus, the chimes
359. Of friendly voices had just given place
360. To as sweet a silence, when I 'gan retrace
361. The pleasant day, upon a couch at ease.
362. It was a poet's house who keeps the keys
363. Of pleasure's temple. Round about were hung
364. The glorious features of the bards who sung
365. In other ages- cold and sacred busts
366. Smiled at each other. Happy he who trusts
367. To clear Futurity his darling fame!
368. Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim
369. At swelling apples with a frisky leap
370. And reaching fingers, 'mid a luscious heap
371. Of vine-leaves. Then there rose to view a fane
372. Of liny marble, and thereto a train
373. Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward:
374. One, loveliest, holding her white hand toward
375. The dazzling sun-rise: two sisters sweet
376. Bending their graceful figures till they meet
377. Over the trippings of a little child:
378. And some are hearing, eagerly, the wild
379. Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping.
380. See, in another picture, nymphs are wiping
381. Cherishingly Diana's timorous limbs;-
382. A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims
383. At the bath's edge, and keeps a gentle motion
384. With the subsiding crystal: as when ocean
385. Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothness o'er
386. Its rocky marge, and balances once more
387. The patient weeds; that now unshent by foam
388. Feel all about their undulating home.

389. Sappho's meek head was there half smiling down
390. At nothing; just as though the earnest frown
391. Of over thinking had that moment gone
392. From off her brow, and left her all alone.

393. Great Alfred's too, with anxious, pitying eyes,
394. As if he always listened to the sighs
395. Of the goaded world; and Kosciusko's worn
396. By horrid suffrance- mightily forlorn.
397. Petrarch, outstepping from the shady green,
398. Starts at the sight of Laura; nor can wean
399. His eyes from her sweet face. Most happy they!
400. For over them was seen a free display
401. Of out-spread wings, and from between them shone
402. The face of Poesy: from off her throne
403. She overlook'd things that I scarce could tell.
404. The very sense of where I was might well
405. Keep Sleep aloof: but more than that there came
406. Thought after thought to nourish up the flame
407. Within my breast; so that the morning light
408. Surprised me even from a sleepless night;
409. And up I rose refresh'd, and glad, and gay,
410. Resolving to begin that very day
411. These lines; and howsoever they be done,
412. I leave them as a father does his son.

413. THE END
