1. To one who has been long in city pent,
2. 'Tis very sweet to look into the fair
3. And open face of heaven,--to breathe a prayer
4. Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
5. Who is more happy, when, with heart's content,
6. Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
7. Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair
8. And gentle tale of love and languishment?
9. Returning home at evening, with an ear
10. Catching the notes of Philomel,--an eye
11. Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,
12. He mourns that day so soon has glided by:
13. E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
14. That falls through the clear ether silently.
