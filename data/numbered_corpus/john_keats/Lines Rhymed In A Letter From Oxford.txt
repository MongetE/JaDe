1. I.
2. The Gothic looks solemn,
3. The plain Doric column
4. Supports an old Bishop and Crosier;
5. The mouldering arch,
6. Shaded o'er by a larch
7. Stands next door to Wilson the Hosier.

8. II.
9. Vice--that is, by turns,--
10. O'er pale faces mourns
11. The black tassell'd trencher and common hat;
12. The Chantry boy sings,
13. The Steeple-bell rings,
14. And as for the Chancellor--dominat.

15. III.
16. There are plenty of trees,
17. And plenty of ease,
18. And plenty of fat deer for Parsons;
19. And when it is venison,
20. Short is the benison,--
21. Then each on a leg or thigh fastens.
