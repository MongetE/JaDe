1. Dear Reynolds, as last night I lay in bed,
2. There came before my eyes that wonted thread
3. Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances,
4. That every other minute vex and please:
5. Things all disjointed come from north and south,--
6. Two witch's eyes above a cherub's mouth,
7. Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon,
8. And Alexander with his nightcap on;
9. Old Socrates a-tying his cravat,
10. And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat;
11. And Junius Brutus, pretty well so-so,
12. Making the best of's way towards Soho.

13. Few are there who escape these visitings--
14. Perhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings,
15. And through whose curtains peeps no hellish nose,
16. No wild-boar tushes, and no mermaid's toes;
17. But flowers bursting out with lusty pride,
18. And young AEolian harps personified;
19. Some Titian colours touch'd into real life,--
20. The sacrifice goes on; the pontiff knife
21. Gleams in the sun, the milk-white heifer lows,
22. The pipes go shrilly, the libation flows:
23. A white sail shows above the green-head cliff,
24. Moves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff;
25. The mariners join hymn with those on land.

26. You know the Enchanted Castle -- it doth stand
27. Upon a rock on the border of a lake,
28. Nested in trees, which all do seem to shake
29. From some old magic like Urganda's sword.
30. O Phoebus! that I had thy sacred word
31. To show this Castle in fair dreaming wise
32. Unto my friend, while sick and ill he lies!

33. You know it well enough, where it doth seem
34. A mossy place, a Merlin's Hall, a dream;
35. You know the clear lake, and the little isles,
36. The mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills--
37. All which elsewhere are but half animate,
38. Here do they look alive to love and hate,
39. To smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound
40. Above some giant, pulsing underground.

41. Part of the building was a chosen See
42. Built by a banish'd Santon of Chaldee;
43. The other part, two thousand years from him,
44. Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim;
45. Then there's a little wing, far from the sun,
46. Built by a Lapland witch turn'd maudlin nun;
47. And many other juts of aged stone
48. Founded with many a mason-devil's groan.

49. The doors all look as if they op'd themselves,
50. The windows as if latch'd by fays and elves,
51. And from them comes a silver flash of light
52. As from the westward of a summer's night;
53. Or like a beauteous woman's large blue eyes
54. Gone mad through olden songs and poesies.

55. See what is coming from the distance dim!
56. A golden galley all in silken trim!
57. Three rows of oars are lightening, moment whiles,
58. Into the verdurous bosoms of those isles;
59. Towards the shade under the Castle wall
60. It comes in silence -- now 'tis hidden all.
61. The clarion sounds, and from a postern-gate
62. An echo of sweet music doth create
63. A fear in the poor herdsman who doth bring
64. His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring,--
65. He tells of the sweet music and the spot
66. To all his friends, and they believe him not.

67. O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake,
68. Would all their colours from the sunset take:
69. From something of material sublime,
70. Rather than shadow our own soul's day-time
71. In the dark void of night. For in the world
72. We jostle- but my flag is not unfurl'd
73. On the Admiral-staff -- and to philosophize
74. I dare not yet! Oh, never will the prize,
75. High reason, and the lore of good and ill,
76. Be my award! Things cannot to the will
77. Be settled, but they tease us out of thought;
78. Or is it that Imagination brought
79. Beyond its proper bound, yet still confin'd,
80. Lost in a sort of Purgatory blind,
81. Cannot refer to any standard law
82. Of either earth or heaven? It is a flaw
83. In happiness to see beyond our bourn,--
84. It forces us in summer skies to mourn,
85. It spoils the singing of the Nightingale.

86. Dear Reynolds! I have a mysterious tale
87. And cannot speak it. The first page I read
88. Upon a lampit rock of green sea-weed
89. Among the breakers; 'twas a quiet eve,
90. The rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave
91. An untumultuous fringe of silver foam
92. Along the flat brown sand; I was at home
93. And should have been most happy,-- but I saw
94. Too far into the sea, where every maw
95. The greater on the less feeds evermore.--
96. But I saw too distinct into the core
97. Of an eternal fierce destruction,
98. And so from happiness I far was gone.
99. Still am I sick of it, and though to-day
100. I've gather'd young spring-leaves, and flowers gay
101. Of periwinkle and wild strawberry,
102. Still do I that most fierce destruction see,--
103. The Shark at savage prey, the Hawk at pounce,--
104. The gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce,
105. Ravening a worm -- Away, ye horrid moods!
106. Moods of one's mind! You know I hate them well.
107. You know I'd sooner be a clapping Bell
108. To some Kamschatcan Missionary Church,
109. Than with these horrid moods be left i' the lurch.
110. Do you get health -- and Tom the same -- I'll dance,
111. And from detested moods in new Romance
112. Take refuge. Of bad lines a Centaine dose
113. Is sure enough -- and so 'here follows prose.'
