1. I cry your mercy—pity—love!—aye, love!
2. Merciful love that tantalizes not,
3. One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,
4. Unmasked, and being seen—without a blot!
5. O! let me have thee whole,—all—all—be mine!
6. That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest
7. Of love, your kiss,—those hands, those eyes divine,
8. That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,—
9. Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all,
10. Withhold no atom's atom or I die,
11. Or living on, perhaps, your wretched thrall,
12. Forget, in the mist of idle misery,
13. Life's purposes,—the palate of my mind
14. Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!
