2. The sun, with his great eye,
3. Sees not so much as I;
4. And the moon, all silver-proud,
5. Might as well be in a cloud.
6. II

7. And O the spring- the spring
8. I lead the life of a king!
9. Couch'd in the teeming grass,
10. I spy each pretty lass.
11. III

12. I look where no one dares,
13. And I stare where no one stares,
14. And when the night is nigh,
15. Lambs bleat my lullaby
