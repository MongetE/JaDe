1. My spirit is too weak; mortality
2. Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
3. And each imagined pinnacle and steep
4. Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
5. Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
6. Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep,
7. That I have not the cloudy winds to keep
8. Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye.
9. Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
10. Bring round the heart an indescribable feud;
11. So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
12. That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
13. Wasting of old Time -with a billowy main,
14. A sun, a shadow of a magnitude.
