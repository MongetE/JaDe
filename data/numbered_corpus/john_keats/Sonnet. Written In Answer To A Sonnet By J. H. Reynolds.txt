1. Blue! 'Tis the life of heaven,--the domain
2. Of Cynthia,--the wide palace of the sun,--
3. The tent of Hesperus, and all his train,--
4. The bosomer of clouds, gold, gray, and dun.
5. Blue! 'Tis the life of waters: -- Ocean
6. And all its vassal streams, pools numberless,
7. May rage, and foam, and fret, but never can
8. Subside, if not to dark-blue nativeness.
9. Blue! Gentle cousin of the forest-green,
10. Married to green in all the sweetest flowers,--
11. Forget-me-not,--the Blue bell,--and, that Queen
12. Of secrecy, the Violet: what strange powers
13. Hast thou, as a mere shadow! But how great,
14. When in an Eye thou art alive with fate!
