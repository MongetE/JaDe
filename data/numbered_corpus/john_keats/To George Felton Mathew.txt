1. Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong,
2. And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song;
3. Nor can remembrance, Mathew! bring to view
4. A fate more pleasing, a delight more true
5. Than that in which the brother Poets joy'd,
6. Who with combined powers, their wit employ'd
7. To raise a trophy to the drama's muses.
8. The thought of this great partnership diffuses
9. Over the genius loving heart, a feeling
10. Of all that's high, and great, and good, and healing.

11. Too partial friend! fain would I follow thee
12. Past each horizon of fine poesy;
13. Fain would I echo back each pleasant note
14. As o'er Sicilian seas, clear anthems float
15. 'Mong the light skimming gondolas far parted,
16. Just when the sun his farewell beam has darted:
17. But 'tis impossible, far different cares
18. Beckon me sternly from soft 'Lydian airs,'
19. And hold my faculties so long in thrall,
20. That I am oft in doubt whether at all
21. I shall again see Phoebus in the morning:
22. Or flush'd Aurora in the roseate dawning!
23. Or a white Naiad in a rippling stream;
24. Or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam;
25. Or again witness what with thee I've seen,
26. The dew by fairy feet swept from the green,
27. After a night of some quaint jubilee
28. Which every elf and fay had come to see:
29. When bright processions took their airy march
30. Beneath the curved moon's triumphal arch.

31. But might I now each passing moment give
32. To the coy muse, with me she would not live
33. In this dark city, nor would condescend
34. 'Mid contradictions her delights to lend.
35. Should e'er the fine-eyed maid to me be kind,
36. Ah! surely it must be whene'er I find
37. Some flowery spot, sequester'd, wild, romantic,
38. That often must have seen a poet frantic;
39. Where oaks, that erst the Druid knew, are growing,
40. And flowers, the glory of one day, are blowing;
41. Where the dark-leav'd laburnum's drooping clusters
42. Reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres,
43. And intertwined the cassia's arms unite,
44. With its own drooping buds, but very white.
45. Where on one side are covert branches hung,
46. 'Mong which the nightingales have always sung
47. In leafy quiet; where to pry, aloof,
48. Atween the pillars of the sylvan roof,
49. Would be to find where violet beds were nestling,
50. And where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling.
51. There must be too a ruin dark, and gloomy,
52. To say 'joy not too much in all that's bloomy.'

53. Yet this is vain--O Mathew lend thy aid
54. To find a place where I may greet the maid--
55. Where we may soft humanity put on,
56. And sit, and rhyme and think on Chatterton;
57. And that warm-hearted Shakspeare sent to meet him
58. Four laurell'd spirits, heaven-ward to intreat him.
59. With reverence would we speak of all the sages
60. Who have left streaks of light athwart their ages:
61. And thou shouldst moralize on Milton's blindness,
62. And mourn the fearful dearth of human kindness
63. To those who strove with the bright golden wing
64. Of genius, to flap away each sting
65. Thrown by the pitiless world. We next could tell
66. Of those who in the cause of freedom fell;
67. Of our own Alfred, of Helvetian Tell;
68. Of him whose name to ev'ry heart's a solace,
69. High-minded and unbending William Wallace.
70. While to the rugged north our musing turns
71. We well might drop a tear for him, and Burns.

72. Felton! without incitements such as these,
73. How vain for me the niggard Muse to tease;
74. For thee, she will thy every dwelling grace,
75. And make 'a sunshine in a shady place:'
76. For thou wast once a flowret blooming wild,
77. Close to the source, bright, pure, and undefil'd,
78. Whence gush the streams of song: in happy hour
79. Came chaste Diana from her shady bower,
80. Just as the sun was from the east uprising;
81. And, as for him some gift she was devising,
82. Beheld thee, pluck'd thee, cast thee in the stream
83. To meet her glorious brother’s greeting beam.
84. I marvel much that thou hast never told
85. How, from a flower, into a fish of gold
86. Apollo chang'd thee; how thou next didst seem
87. A black-eyed swan upon the widening stream;
88. And when thou first didst in that mirror trace
89. The placid features of a human face:
90. That thou hast never told thy travels strange,
91. And all the wonders of the mazy range
92. O’er pebbly crystal, and o'er golden sands;
93. Kissing thy daily food from Naiad’s pearly hands.
