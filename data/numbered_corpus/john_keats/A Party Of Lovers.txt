1. Pensive they sit, and roll their languid eyes,
2. Nibble their toast, and cool their tea with sighs,
3. Or else forget the purpose of the night,
4. Forget their tea -- forget their appetite.
5. See with cross'd arms they sit -- ah! happy crew,
6. The fire is going out and no one rings
7. For coals, and therefore no coals Betty brings.
8. A fly is in the milk-pot -- must he die
9. By a humane society?
10. No, no; there Mr. Werter takes his spoon,
11. Inserts it, dips the handle, and lo! soon
12. The little straggler, sav'd from perils dark,
13. Across the teaboard draws a long wet mark.
14. Arise! take snuffers by the handle,
15. There's a large cauliflower in each candle.
16. A winding-sheet, ah me! I must away
17. To No. 7, just beyond the circus gay.
18. 'Alas, my friend! your coat sits very well;
19. Where may your tailor live?' 'I may not tell.
20. O pardon me -- I'm absent now and then.
21. Where might my tailor live? I say again
22. I cannot tell, let me no more be teaz'd --
23. He lives in Wapping, might live where he pleas'd.'
