1. Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell
2. No God, no Demon of severe response,
3. Deigns to reply from Heaven or from Hell
4. Then to my human heart I turn at once:
5. Heart! Thou and I are here sad and alone;
6. I say, why did I laugh? O mortal pain!
7. O Darkness! Darkness! ever must I moan,
8. To question Heaven and Hell and Heart in vain.
9. Why did I laugh? I know this Being's lease,
10. My fancy to its utmost blisses spreads;
11. Yet would I on this very midnight cease,
12. And all the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds;
13. Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed,
14. But Death intenser -- Death is Life's high meed.
