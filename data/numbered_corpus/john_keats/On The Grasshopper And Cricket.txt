1. The poetry of earth is never dead:
2. When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,
3. And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run
4. From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;
5. That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead
6. In summer luxury,--he has never done
7. With his delights; for when tired out with fun
8. He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.
9. The poetry of earth is ceasing never:
10. On a lone winter evening, when the frost
11. Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
12. The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,
13. And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,
14. The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.
