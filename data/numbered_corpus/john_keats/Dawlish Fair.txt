1. Over the hill and over the dale,
2. And over the bourn to Dawlish--
3. Where gingerbread wives have a scanty sale
4. And gingerbread nuts are smallish.
5. -------------
6. Rantipole Betty she ran down a hill
7. And kicked up her petticoats fairly;
8. Says I I'll be Jack if you will be Gill--
9. So she sat on the grass debonairly.

10. Here's somebody coming, here's somebody coming!
11. Says I 'tis the wind at a parley;
12. So without any fuss any hawing and humming
13. She lay on the grass debonairly.

14. Here's somebody here and here's somebody there!
15. Says I hold your tongue you young Gipsey;
16. So she held her tongue and lay plump and fair
17. And dead as a Venus tipsy.

18. O who wouldn't hie to Dawlish fair,
19. O who wouldn't stop in a Meadow,
20. O who would not rumple the daisies there
21. And make the wild fern for a bed do!
