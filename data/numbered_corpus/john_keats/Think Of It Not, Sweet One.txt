1. THINK not of it, sweet one, so;---
2. Give it not a tear;
3. Sigh thou mayst, and bid it go
4. Any---anywhere.

5. Do not lool so sad, sweet one,---
6. Sad and fadingly;
7. Shed one drop then,---it is gone---
8. O 'twas born to die!

9. Still so pale? then, dearest, weep;
10. Weep, I'll count the tears,
11. And each one shall be a bliss
12. For thee in after years.

13. Brighter has it left thine eyes
14. Than a sunny rill;
15. And thy whispering melodies
16. Are tenderer still.

17. Yet---as all things mourn awhile
18. At fleeting blisses,
19. E'en let us too! but be our dirge
20. A dirge of kisses.
