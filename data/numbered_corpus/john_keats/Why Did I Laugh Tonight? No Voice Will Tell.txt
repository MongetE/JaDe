1. Why did I laugh tonight? No voice will tell
2. No God, no demon of severe response
3. Deigns to reply from heaven or from hell
4. Then to my human heart I turn at once:
5. Heart, thou and I are here, sad and alone,
6. Say, why did I laugh? O mortal pain!
7. O darkness! darkness! Forever must I moan
8. To question heaven and hell and heart in vain?
9. Why did I laugh? I know this being's lease
10. My fancy to it's utmost blisses spreads
11. Yet would I on this very midnight cease
12. And all the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds
13. Verse, fame and beauty are intense indeed
14. But death intenser, death is life's high meed.
