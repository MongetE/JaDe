1. Bards of Passion and of Mirth,
2. Ye have left your souls on earth!
3. Have ye souls in heaven too,
4. Double lived in regions new?
5. Yes, and those of heaven commune
6. With the spheres of sun and moon;
7. With the noise of fountains wound'rous,
8. And the parle of voices thund'rous;
9. With the whisper of heaven's trees
10. And one another, in soft ease.

11. Seated on Elysian lawns
12. Brows'd by none but Dian's fawns;
13. Underneath large blue-bells tented,
14. Where the daisies are rose-scented,
15. And the rose herself has got
16. Perfume which on earth is not;
17. Where the nightingale doth sing
18. Not a senseless, tranced thing,
19. But divine melodious truth;
20. Philosophic numbers smooth;
21. Tales and golden histories
22. Of heaven and its mysteries.

23. Thus ye live on high, and then
24. On the earth ye live again;
25. And the souls ye left behind you
26. Teach us, here, the way to find you,
27. Where your other souls are joying,
28. Never slumber'd, never cloying.
29. Here, your earth-born souls still speak
30. To mortals, of their little week;
31. Of their sorrows and delights;
32. Of their passions and their spites;
33. Of their glory and their shame;
34. What doth strengthen and what maim.
35. Thus ye teach us, every day,
36. Wisdom, though fled far away.

37. Bards of Passion and of Mirth,
38. Ye have left your souls on earth!
39. Ye have souls in heaven too,
40. Double-lived in regions new!
