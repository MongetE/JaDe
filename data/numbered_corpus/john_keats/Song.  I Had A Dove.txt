1. I had a dove, and the sweet dove died;
2. And I have thought it died of grieving:
3. O, what could it grieve for? its feet were tied
4. With a single thread of my own hand's weaving;
5. Sweet little red feet, why should you die--
6. Why should you leave me, sweet bird, why?
7. You lived alone in the forest tree,
8. Why, pretty thing! would you not live with me?
9. I kiss'd you oft and gave you white peas;
10. Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees?
