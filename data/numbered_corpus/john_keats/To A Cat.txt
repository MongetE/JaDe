1. Cat! who has pass'd thy grand climacteric,
2. How many mice and rats hast in thy days
3. Destroy'd? How many tit-bits stolen? Gaze
4. With those bright languid segments green, and
5. prick
6. Those velvet ears - but prythee do not stick
7. Thy latent talons in me - and tell me all thy frays,
8. Of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick;
9. Nay, look not down, nor lick thy dainty wrists, -
10. For all the wheezy asthma - and for all
11. Thy tail's tip is nick'd off - and though the fists
12. Of many a maid have given thee many a maul,
13. Still is thy fur as when the lists
14. In youth thou enter'dst on glass-bottled wall.
