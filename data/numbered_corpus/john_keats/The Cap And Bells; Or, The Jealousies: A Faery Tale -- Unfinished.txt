1. I.
2. In midmost Ind, beside Hydaspes cool,
3. There stood, or hover'd, tremulous in the air,
4. A faery city 'neath the potent rule
5. Of Emperor Elfinan; fam'd ev'rywhere
6. For love of mortal women, maidens fair,
7. Whose lips were solid, whose soft hands were made
8. Of a fit mould and beauty, ripe and rare,
9. To tamper his slight wooing, warm yet staid:
10. He lov'd girls smooth as shades, but hated a mere shade.

11. II.
12. This was a crime forbidden by the law;
13. And all the priesthood of his city wept,
14. For ruin and dismay they well foresaw,
15. If impious prince no bound or limit kept,
16. And faery Zendervester overstept;
17. They wept, he sin'd, and still he would sin on,
18. They dreamt of sin, and he sin'd while they slept;
19. In vain the pulpit thunder'd at the throne,
20. Caricature was vain, and vain the tart lampoon.

21. III.
22. Which seeing, his high court of parliament
23. Laid a remonstrance at his Highness' feet,
24. Praying his royal senses to content
25. Themselves with what in faery land was sweet,
26. Befitting best that shade with shade should meet:
27. Whereat, to calm their fears, he promis'd soon
28. From mortal tempters all to make retreat,--
29. Aye, even on the first of the new moon,
30. An immaterial wife to espouse as heaven's boon.

31. IV.
32. Meantime he sent a fluttering embassy
33. To Pigmio, of Imaus sovereign,
34. To half beg, and half demand, respectfully,
35. The hand of his fair daughter Bellanaine;
36. An audience had, and speeching done, they gain
37. Their point, and bring the weeping bride away;
38. Whom, with but one attendant, safely lain
39. Upon their wings, they bore in bright array,
40. While little harps were touch'd by many a lyric fay.

41. V.
42. As in old pictures tender cherubim
43. A child's soul thro' the sapphir'd canvas bear,
44. So, thro' a real heaven, on they swim
45. With the sweet princess on her plumag'd lair,
46. Speed giving to the winds her lustrous hair;
47. And so she journey'd, sleeping or awake,
48. Save when, for healthful exercise and air,
49. She chose to 'promener Ã  l'aile,' or take
50. A pigeon's somerset, for sport or change's sake.

51. VI.
52. 'Dear Princess, do not whisper me so loud,'
53. Quoth Corallina, nurse and confidant,
54. 'Do not you see there, lurking in a cloud,
55. Close at your back, that sly old Crafticant?
56. He hears a whisper plainer than a rant:
57. Dry up your tears, and do not look so blue;
58. He's Elfinan's great state-spy militant,
59. His running, lying, flying foot-man too,--
60. Dear mistress, let him have no handle against you!

61. VII.
62. 'Show him a mouse's tail, and he will guess,
63. With metaphysic swiftness, at the mouse;
64. Show him a garden, and with speed no less,
65. He'll surmise sagely of a dwelling house,
66. And plot, in the same minute, how to chouse
67. The owner out of it; show him a' --- 'Peace!
68. Peace! nor contrive thy mistress' ire to rouse!'
69. Return'd the Princess, 'my tongue shall not cease
70. Till from this hated match I get a free release.

71. VIII.
72. 'Ah, beauteous mortal!' 'Hush!' quoth Coralline,
73. 'Really you must not talk of him, indeed.'
74. 'You hush!' reply'd the mistress, with a shinee
75. Of anger in her eyes, enough to breed
76. In stouter hearts than nurse's fear and dread:
77. 'Twas not the glance itself made nursey flinch,
78. But of its threat she took the utmost heed;
79. Not liking in her heart an hour-long pinch,
80. Or a sharp needle run into her back an inch.

81. IX.
82. So she was silenc'd, and fair Bellanaine,
83. Writhing her little body with ennui,
84. Continued to lament and to complain,
85. That Fate, cross-purposing, should let her be
86. Ravish'd away far from her dear countree;
87. That all her feelings should be set at nought,
88. In trumping up this match so hastily,
89. With lowland blood; and lowland blood she thought
90. Poison, as every staunch true-born Imaian ought.

91. X.
92. Sorely she griev'd, and wetted three or four
93. White Provence rose-leaves with her faery tears,
94. But not for this cause; -- alas! she had more
95. Bad reasons for her sorrow, as appears
96. In the fam'd memoirs of a thousand years,
97. Written by Crafticant, and published
98. By Parpaglion and Co., (those sly compeers
99. Who rak'd up ev'ry fact against the dead,)
100. In Scarab Street, Panthea, at the Jubal's Head.

101. XI.
102. Where, after a long hypercritic howl
103. Against the vicious manners of the age,
104. He goes on to expose, with heart and soul,
105. What vice in this or that year was the rage,
106. Backbiting all the world in every page;
107. With special strictures on the horrid crime,
108. (Section'd and subsection'd with learning sage,)
109. Of faeries stooping on their wings sublime
110. To kiss a mortal's lips, when such were in their prime.

111. XII.
112. Turn to the copious index, you will find
113. Somewhere in the column, headed letter B,
114. The name of Bellanaine, if you're not blind;
115. Then pray refer to the text, and you will see
116. An article made up of calumny
117. Against this highland princess, rating her
118. For giving way, so over fashionably,
119. To this new-fangled vice, which seems a burr
120. Stuck in his moral throat, no coughing e'er could stir.

121. XIII.
122. There he says plainly that she lov'd a man!
123. That she around him flutter'd, flirted, toy'd,
124. Before her marriage with great Elfinan;
125. That after marriage too, she never joy'd
126. In husband's company, but still employ'd
127. Her wits to 'scape away to Angle-land;
128. Where liv'd the youth, who worried and annoy'd
129. Her tender heart, and its warm ardours fann'd
130. To such a dreadful blaze, her side would scorch her hand.

131. XIV.
132. But let us leave this idle tittle-tattle
133. To waiting-maids, and bed-room coteries,
134. Nor till fit time against her fame wage battle.
135. Poor Elfinan is very ill at ease,
136. Let us resume his subject if you please:
137. For it may comfort and console him much,
138. To rhyme and syllable his miseries;
139. Poor Elfinan! whose cruel fate was such,
140. He sat and curs'd a bride he knew he could not touch.

141. XV.
142. Soon as (according to his promises)
143. The bridal embassy had taken wing,
144. And vanish'd, bird-like, o'er the suburb trees,
145. The Emperor, empierc'd with the sharp sting
146. Of love, retired, vex'd and murmuring
147. Like any drone shut from the fair bee-queen,
148. Into his cabinet, and there did fling
149. His limbs upon a sofa, full of spleen,
150. And damn'd his House of Commons, in complete chagrin.

151. XVI.
152. 'I'll trounce some of the members,' cry'd the Prince,
153. 'I'll put a mark against some rebel names,
154. I'll make the Opposition-benches wince,
155. I'll show them very soon, to all their shames,
156. What 'tis to smother up a Prince's flames;
157. That ministers should join in it, I own,
158. Surprises me! -- they too at these high games!
159. Am I an Emperor? Do I wear a crown?
160. Imperial Elfinan, go hang thyself or drown!

161. XVII.
162. 'I'll trounce 'em! -- there's the square-cut chancellor,
163. His son shall never touch that bishopric;
164. And for the nephew of old Palfior,
165. I'll show him that his speeches made me sick,
166. And give the colonelcy to Phalaric;
167. The tiptoe marquis, mortal and gallant,
168. Shall lodge in shabby taverns upon tick;
169. And for the Speaker's second cousin's aunt,
170. She sha'n't be maid of honour,-- by heaven that she sha'n't!

171. XVIII.
172. 'I'll shirk the Duke of A.; I'll cut his brother;
173. I'll give no garter to his eldest son;
174. I won't speak to his sister or his mother!
175. The Viscount B. shall live at cut-and-run;
176. But how in the world can I contrive to stun
177. That fellow's voice, which plagues me worse than any,
178. That stubborn fool, that impudent state-dun,
179. Who sets down ev'ry sovereign as a zany,--
180. That vulgar commoner, Esquire Biancopany?

181. XIX.
182. 'Monstrous affair! Pshaw! pah! what ugly minx
183. Will they fetch from Imaus for my bride?
184. Alas! my wearied heart within me sinks,
185. To think that I must be so near ally'd
186. To a cold dullard fay,--ah, woe betide!
187. Ah, fairest of all human loveliness!
188. Sweet Bertha! what crime can it be to glide
189. About the fragrant plaintings of thy dress,
190. Or kiss thine eyes, or count thy locks, tress after tress?'

191. XX.
192. So said, one minute's while his eyes remaind'
193. Half lidded, piteous, languid, innocent;
194. But, in a wink, their splendour they regain'd,
195. Sparkling revenge with amorous fury blent.
196. Love thwarted in bad temper oft has vent:
197. He rose, he stampt his foot, he rang the bell,
198. And order'd some death-warrants to be sent
199. For signature: -- somewhere the tempest fell,
200. As many a poor fellow does not live to tell.

201. XXI.
202. 'At the same time, Eban,' -- (this was his page,
203. A fay of colour, slave from top to toe,
204. Sent as a present, while yet under age,
205. From the Viceroy of Zanguebar, -- wise, slow,
206. His speech, his only words were 'yes' and 'no,'
207. But swift of look, and foot, and wing was he,--)
208. 'At the same time, Eban, this instant go
209. To Hum the soothsayer, whose name I see
210. Among the fresh arrivals in our empery.

211. XXII.
212. 'Bring Hum to me! But stay -- here, take my ring,
213. The pledge of favour, that he not suspect
214. Any foul play, or awkward murdering,
215. Tho' I have bowstrung many of his sect;
216. Throw in a hint, that if he should neglect
217. One hour, the next shall see him in my grasp,
218. And the next after that shall see him neck'd,
219. Or swallow'd by my hunger-starved asp,--
220. And mention ('tis as well) the torture of the wasp.'

221. XXIII.
222. These orders given, the Prince, in half a pet,
223. Let o'er the silk his propping elbow slide,
224. Caught up his little legs, and, in a fret,
225. Fell on the sofa on his royal side.
226. The slave retreated backwards, humble-ey'd,
227. And with a slave-like silence clos'd the door,
228. And to old Hun thro' street and alley hied;
229. He 'knew the city,' as we say, of yore,
230. And for short cuts and turns, was nobody knew more.

231. XXIV.
232. It was the time when wholesale dealers close
233. Their shutters with a moody sense of wealth,
234. But retail dealers, diligent, let loose
235. The gas (objected to on score of health),
236. Convey'd in little solder'd pipes by stealth,
237. And make it flare in many a brilliant form,
238. That all the powers of darkness it repell'th,
239. Which to the oil-trade doth great scaith and harm,
240. And superseded quite the use of the glow-worm.

241. XXV.
242. Eban, untempted by the pastry-cooks,
243. (Of pastry he got store within the palace,)
244. With hasty steps, wrapp'd cloak, and solemn looks,
245. Incognito upon his errand sallies,
246. His smelling-bottle ready for the allies;
247. He pass'd the Hurdy-gurdies with disdain,
248. Vowing he'd have them sent on board the gallies;
249. Just as he made his vow; it 'gan to rain,
250. Therefore he call'd a coach, and bade it drive amain.

251. XXVI.
252. 'I'll pull the string,' said he, and further said,
253. 'Polluted Jarvey! Ah, thou filthy hack!
254. Whose springs of life are all dry'd up and dead,
255. Whose linsey-woolsey lining hangs all slack,
256. Whose rug is straw, whose wholeness is a crack;
257. And evermore thy steps go clatter-clitter;
258. Whose glass once up can never be got back,
259. Who prov'st, with jolting arguments and bitter,
260. That 'tis of modern use to travel in a litter.

261. XXVII.
262. 'Thou inconvenience! thou hungry crop
263. For all corn! thou snail-creeper to and fro,
264. Who while thou goest ever seem'st to stop,
265. And fiddle-faddle standest while you go;
266. I' the morning, freighted with a weight of woe,
267. Unto some lazar-house thou journeyest,
268. And in the evening tak'st a double row
269. Of dowdies, for some dance or party drest,
270. Besides the goods meanwhile thou movest east and west.

271. XXVIII.
272. 'By thy ungallant bearing and sad mien,
273. An inch appears the utmost thou couldst budge;
274. Yet at the slightest nod, or hint, or sign,
275. Round to the curb-stone patient dost thou trudge,
276. School'd in a beckon, learned in a nudge,
277. A dull-ey'd Argus watching for a fare;
278. Quiet and plodding, thou dost bear no grudge
279. To whisking Tilburies, or Phaetons rare,
280. Curricles, or Mail-coaches, swift beyond compare.'

281. XXIX.
282. Philosophizing thus, he pull'd the check,
283. And bade the Coachman wheel to such a street,
284. Who, turning much his body, more his neck,
285. Louted full low, and hoarsely did him greet:
286. 'Certes, Monsieur were best take to his feet,
287. Seeing his servant can no further drive
288. For press of coaches, that to-night here meet,
289. Many as bees about a straw-capp'd hive,
290. When first for April honey into faint flowers they dive.'

291. XXX.
292. Eban then paid his fare, and tiptoe went
293. To Hum's hotel; and, as he on did pass
294. With head inclin'd, each dusky lineament
295. Show'd in the pearl-pav'd street, as in a glass;
296. His purple vest, that ever peeping was
297. Rich from the fluttering crimson of his cloak,
298. His silvery trowsers, and his silken sash
299. Tied in a burnish'd knot, their semblance took
300. Upon the mirror'd walls, wherever he might look.

301. XXXI.
302. He smil'd at self, and, smiling, show'd his teeth,
303. And seeing his white teeth, he smil'd the more;
304. Lifted his eye-brows, spurn'd the path beneath,
305. Show'd teeth again, and smil'd as heretofore,
306. Until he knock'd at the magician's door;
307. Where, till the porter answer'd, might be seen,
308. In the clear panel more he could adore,--
309. His turban wreath'd of gold, and white, and green,
310. Mustachios, ear-ring, nose-ring, and his sabre keen.

311. XXXII.
312. 'Does not your master give a rout to-night?'
313. Quoth the dark page. 'Oh, no!' return'd the Swiss,
314. 'Next door but one to us, upon the right,
315. The Magazin des Modes now open is
316. Against the Emperor's wedding;--and, sir, this
317. My master finds a monstrous horrid bore;
318. As he retir'd, an hour ago I wis,
319. With his best beard and brimstone, to explore
320. And cast a quiet figure in his second floor.

321. XXXIII.
322. 'Gad! he's oblig'd to stick to business!
323. For chalk, I hear, stands at a pretty price;
324. And as for aqua vitae -- there's a mess!
325. The dentes sapientiae of mice,
326. Our barber tells me too, are on the rise,--
327. Tinder's a lighter article, -- nitre pure
328. Goes off like lightning, -- grains of Paradise
329. At an enormous figure! -- stars not sure! --
330. Zodiac will not move without a slight douceur!

331. XXXIV.
332. 'Venus won't stir a peg without a fee,
333. And master is too partial, entre nous,
334. To' -- 'Hush -- hush!' cried Eban, 'sure that is he
335. Coming down stairs, -- by St. Bartholomew!
336. As backwards as he can, -- is't something new?
337. Or is't his custom, in the name of fun?'
338. 'He always comes down backward, with one shoe'--
339. Return'd the porter -- 'off, and one shoe on,
340. Like, saving shoe for sock or stocking, my man John!'

341. XXXV.
342. It was indeed the great Magician,
343. Feeling, with careful toe, for every stair,
344. And retrograding careful as he can,
345. Backwards and downwards from his own two pair:
346. 'Salpietro!' exclaim'd Hum, 'is the dog there?
347. He's always in my way upon the mat!'
348. 'He's in the kitchen, or the Lord knows where,'--
349. Reply'd the Swiss, -- 'the nasty, yelping brat!'
350. 'Don't beat him!' return'd Hum, and on the floor came pat.

351. XXXVI.
352. Then facing right about, he saw the Page,
353. And said: 'Don't tell me what you want, Eban;
354. The Emperor is now in a huge rage,--
355. 'Tis nine to one he'll give you the rattan!
356. Let us away!' Away together ran
357. The plain-dress'd sage and spangled blackamoor,
358. Nor rested till they stood to cool, and fan,
359. And breathe themselves at th' Emperor's chamber door,
360. When Eban thought he heard a soft imperial snore.

361. XXXVII.
362. 'I thought you guess'd, foretold, or prophesy'd,
363. That's Majesty was in a raving fit?'
364. 'He dreams,' said Hum, 'or I have ever lied,
365. That he is tearing you, sir, bit by bit.'
366. 'He's not asleep, and you have little wit,'
367. Reply'd the page; 'that little buzzing noise,
368. Whate'er your palmistry may make of it,
369. Comes from a play-thing of the Emperor's choice,
370. From a Man-Tiger-Organ, prettiest of his toys.'

371. XXXVIII.
372. Eban then usher'd in the learned Seer:
373. Elfinan's back was turn'd, but, ne'ertheless,
374. Both, prostrate on the carpet, ear by ear,
375. Crept silently, and waited in distress,
376. Knowing the Emperor's moody bitterness;
377. Eban especially, who on the floor 'gan
378. Tremble and quake to death,-- he feared less
379. A dose of senna-tea or nightmare Gorgon
380. Than the Emperor when he play'd on his Man-Tiger-Organ.

381. XXXIX.
382. They kiss'd nine times the carpet's velvet face
383. Of glossy silk, soft, smooth, and meadow-green,
384. Where the close eye in deep rich fur might trace
385. A silver tissue, scantly to be seen,
386. As daisies lurk'd in June-grass, buds in green;
387. Sudden the music ceased, sudden the hand
388. Of majesty, by dint of passion keen,
389. Doubled into a common fist, went grand,
390. And knock'd down three cut glasses, and his best ink-stand.

391. XL.
392. Then turning round, he saw those trembling two:
393. 'Eban,' said he, 'as slaves should taste the fruits
394. Of diligence, I shall remember you
395. To-morrow, or next day, as time suits,
396. In a finger conversation with my mutes,--
397. Begone! -- for you, Chaldean! here remain!
398. Fear not, quake not, and as good wine recruits
399. A conjurer's spirits, what cup will you drain?
400. Sherry in silver, hock in gold, or glass'd champagne?'

401. XLI.
402. 'Commander of the faithful!' answer'd Hum,
403. 'In preference to these, I'll merely taste
404. A thimble-full of old Jamaica rum.'
405. 'A simple boon!' said Elfinan; 'thou may'st
406. Have Nantz, with which my morning-coffee's lac'd.'
407. 'I'll have a glass of Nantz, then,' -- said the Seer,--
408. 'Made racy -- (sure my boldness is misplac'd!)--
409. With the third part -- (yet that is drinking dear!)--
410. Of the least drop of crÃ¨me de citron, crystal clear.'

411. XLII.
412. 'I pledge you, Hum! and pledge my dearest love,
413. My Bertha!' 'Bertha! Bertha!' cry'd the sage,
414. 'I know a many Berthas!' 'Mine's above
415. All Berthas!' sighed the Emperor. 'I engage,'
416. Said Hum, 'in duty, and in vassalage,
417. To mention all the Berthas in the earth;--
418. There's Bertha Watson, -- and Miss Bertha Page,--
419. This fam'd for languid eyes, and that for mirth,--
420. There's Bertha Blount of York, -- and Bertha Knox of Perth.'

421. XLIII.
422. 'You seem to know' -- 'I do know,' answer'd Hum,
423. 'Your Majesty's in love with some fine girl
424. Named Bertha; but her surname will not come,
425. Without a little conjuring.' ''Tis Pearl,
426. 'Tis Bertha Pearl! What makes my brain so whirl?
427. And she is softer, fairer than her name!'
428. 'Where does she live?' ask'd Hum. 'Her fair locks curl
429. So brightly, they put all our fays to shame!--
430. Live? -- O! at Canterbury, with her old grand-dame.'

431. XLIV.
432. 'Good! good!' cried Hum, 'I've known her from a child!
433. She is a changeling of my management;
434. She was born at midnight in an Indian wild;
435. Her mother's screams with the striped tiger's blent,
436. While the torch-bearing slaves a halloo sent
437. Into the jungles; and her palanquin,
438. Rested amid the desert's dreariment,
439. Shook with her agony, till fair were seen
440. The little Bertha's eyes ope on the stars serene.'

441. XLV.
442. 'I can't say,' said the monarch; 'that may be
443. Just as it happen'd, true or else a bam!
444. Drink up your brandy, and sit down by me,
445. Feel, feel my pulse, how much in love I am;
446. And if your science is not all a sham.
447. Tell me some means to get the lady here.'
448. 'Upon my honour!' said the son of Cham,
449. 'She is my dainty changeling, near and dear,
450. Although her story sounds at first a little queer.'

451. XLVI.
452. 'Convey her to me, Hum, or by my crown,
453. My sceptre, and my cross-surmounted globe,
454. I'll knock you' -- 'Does your majesty mean -- down?
455. No, no, you never could my feelings probe
456. To such a depth!' The Emperor took his robe,
457. And wept upon its purple palatine,
458. While Hum continued, shamming half a sob,--
459. 'In Canterbury doth your lady shine?
460. But let me cool your brandy with a little wine.'

461. XLVII.
462. Whereat a narrow Flemish glass he took,
463. That since belong'd to Admiral De Witt,
464. Admir'd it with a connoisseuring look,
465. And with the ripest claret crowned it,
466. And, ere the lively bead could burst and flit,
467. He turn'd it quickly, nimbly upside down,
468. His mouth being held conveniently fit
469. To catch the treasure: 'Best in all the town!'
470. He said, smack'd his moist lips, and gave a pleasant frown.

471. XLVIII.
472. 'Ah! good my Prince, weep not!' And then again
473. He filled a bumper. 'Great Sire, do not weep!
474. Your pulse is shocking, but I'll ease your pain.'
475. 'Fetch me that Ottoman, and prithee keep
476. Your voice low,' said the Emperor; 'and steep
477. Some lady's-fingers nice in Candy wine;
478. And prithee, Hum, behind the screen do peep
479. For the rose-water vase, magician mine!
480. And sponge my forehead, -- so my love doth make me pine.

481. XLIX.
482. 'Ah, cursed Bellanaine!' 'Don't think of her,'
483. Rejoin'd the Mago, 'but on Bertha muse;
484. For, by my choicest best barometer,
485. You shall not throttled be in marriage noose;
486. I've said it, Sire; you only have to choose
487. Bertha or Bellanaine.' So saying, he drew
488. From the left pocket of his threadbare hose,
489. A sampler hoarded slyly, good as new,
490. Holding it by his thumb and finger full in view.

491. L.
492. 'Sire, this is Bertha Pearl's neat handy-work,
493. Her name, see here, Midsummer, ninety-one.'
494. Elfinan snatch'd it with a sudden jerk,
495. And wept as if he never would have done,
496. Honouring with royal tears the poor homespun;
497. Whereon were broider'd tigers with black eyes,
498. And long-tail'd pheasants, and a rising sun,
499. Plenty of posies, great stags, butterflies
500. Bigger than stags,-- a moon,-- with other mysteries.

501. LI.
502. The monarch handled o'er and o'er again
503. Those day-school hieroglyphics with a sigh;
504. Somewhat in sadness, but pleas'd in the main,
505. Till this oracular couplet met his eye
506. Astounded -- Cupid, I do thee defy!
507. It was too much. He shrunk back in his chair,
508. Grew pale as death, and fainted -- very nigh!
509. 'Pho! nonsense!' exclaim'd Hum, 'now don't despair;
510. She does not mean it really. Cheer up, hearty -- there!

511. LII.
512. 'And listen to my words. You say you won't,
513. On any terms, marry Miss Bellanaine;
514. It goes against your conscience -- good! Well, don't.
515. You say you love a mortal. I would fain
516. Persuade your honour's highness to refrain
517. From peccadilloes. But, Sire, as I say,
518. What good would that do? And, to be more plain,
519. You would do me a mischief some odd day,
520. Cut off my ears and limbs, or head too, by my fay!

521. LIII.
522. 'Besides, manners forbid that I should pass any
523. Vile strictures on the conduct of a prince
524. Who should indulge his genius, if he has any,
525. Not, like a subject, foolish matters mince.
526. Now I think on't, perhaps I could convince
527. Your Majesty there is no crime at all
528. In loving pretty little Bertha, since
529. She's very delicate,-- not over tall, --
530. A fairy's hand, and in the waist why -- very small.'

531. LIV.
532. 'Ring the repeater, gentle Hum!' ''Tis five,'
533. Said the gentle Hum; 'the nights draw in apace;
534. The little birds I hear are all alive;
535. I see the dawning touch'd upon your face;
536. Shall I put out the candles, please your Grace?'
537. 'Do put them out, and, without more ado,
538. Tell me how I may that sweet girl embrace,--
539. How you can bring her to me.' 'That's for you,
540. Great Emperor! to adventure, like a lover true.'

541. LV.
542. 'I fetch her!' -- 'Yes, an't like your Majesty;
543. And as she would be frighten'd wide awake
544. To travel such a distance through the sky,
545. Use of some soft manoeuvre you must make,
546. For your convenience, and her dear nerves' sake;
547. Nice way would be to bring her in a swoon,
548. Anon, I'll tell what course were best to take;
549. You must away this morning.' 'Hum! so soon?'
550. 'Sire, you must be in Kent by twelve o'clock at noon.'

551. LVI.
552. At this great Caesar started on his feet,
553. Lifted his wings, and stood attentive-wise.
554. 'Those wings to Canterbury you must beat,
555. If you hold Bertha as a worthy prize.
556. Look in the Almanack -- Moore never lies --
557. April the twenty- fourth, -- this coming day,
558. Now breathing its new bloom upon the skies,
559. Will end in St. Mark's Eve; -- you must away,
560. For on that eve alone can you the maid convey.'

561. LVII.
562. Then the magician solemnly 'gan to frown,
563. So that his frost-white eyebrows, beetling low,
564. Shaded his deep green eyes, and wrinkles brown
565. Plaited upon his furnace-scorched brow:
566. Forth from his hood that hung his neck below,
567. He lifted a bright casket of pure gold,
568. Touch'd a spring-lock, and there in wool or snow,
569. Charm'd into ever freezing, lay an old
570. And legend-leaved book, mysterious to behold.

571. LVIII.
572. 'Take this same book,-- it will not bite you, Sire;
573. There, put it underneath your royal arm;
574. Though it's a pretty weight it will not tire,
575. But rather on your journey keep you warm:
576. This is the magic, this the potent charm,
577. That shall drive Bertha to a fainting fit!
578. When the time comes, don't feel the least alarm,
579. But lift her from the ground, and swiftly flit
580. Back to your palace. * * * * * * * * * *

581. LIX.
582. 'What shall I do with that same book?' 'Why merely
583. Lay it on Bertha's table, close beside
584. Her work-box, and 'twill help your purpose dearly;
585. I say no more.' 'Or good or ill betide,
586. Through the wide air to Kent this morn I glide!'
587. Exclaim'd the Emperor. 'When I return,
588. Ask what you will, -- I'll give you my new bride!
589. And take some more wine, Hum; -- O Heavens! I burn
590. To be upon the wing! Now, now, that minx I spurn!'

591. LX.
592. 'Leave her to me,' rejoin'd the magian:
593. 'But how shall I account, illustrious fay!
594. For thine imperial absence? Pho! I can
595. Say you are very sick, and bar the way
596. To your so loving courtiers for one day;
597. If either of their two archbishops' graces
598. Should talk of extreme unction, I shall say
599. You do not like cold pig with Latin phrases,
600. Which never should be used but in alarming cases.'

601. LXI.
602. 'Open the window, Hum; I'm ready now!'
603. Zooks!' exclaim'd Hum, as up the sash he drew.
604. 'Behold, your Majesty, upon the brow
605. Of yonder hill, what crowds of people!' 'Whew!
606. The monster's always after something new,'
607. Return'd his Highness, 'they are piping hot
608. To see my pigsney Bellanaine. Hum! do
609. Tighten my belt a little, -- so, so, -- not
610. Too tight, -- the book! -- my wand! -- so, nothing is forgot.'

611. LXII.
612. 'Wounds! how they shout!' said Hum, 'and there, -- see, see!
613. Th' ambassador's return'd from Pigmio!
614. The morning's very fine, -- uncommonly!
615. See, past the skirts of yon white cloud they go,
616. Tinging it with soft crimsons! Now below
617. The sable-pointed heads of firs and pines
618. They dip, move on, and with them moves a glow
619. Along the forest side! Now amber lines
620. Reach the hill top, and now throughout the valley shines.'

621. LXIII.
622. 'Why, Hum, you're getting quite poetical!
623. Those 'nows' you managed in a special style.'
624. 'If ever you have leisure, Sire, you shall
625. See scraps of mine will make it worth your while,
626. Tid-bits for Phoebus! -- yes, you well may smile.
627. Hark! hark! the bells!' 'A little further yet,
628. Good Hum, and let me view this mighty coil.'
629. Then the great Emperor full graceful set
630. His elbow for a prop, and snuff'd his mignonnette.

631. LXIV.
632. The morn is full of holiday; loud bells
633. With rival clamours ring from every spire;
634. Cunningly-station'd music dies and swells
635. In echoing places; when the winds respire,
636. Light flags stream out like gauzy tongues of fire;
637. A metropolitan murmur, lifeful, warm,
638. Comes from the northern suburbs; rich attire
639. Freckles with red and gold the moving swarm;
640. While here and there clear trumpets blow a keen alarm.

641. LXV.
642. And now the fairy escort was seen clear,
643. Like the old pageant of Aurora's train,
644. Above a pearl-built minister, hovering near;
645. First wily Crafticant, the chamberlain,
646. Balanc'd upon his grey-grown pinions twain,
647. His slender wand officially reveal'd;
648. Then black gnomes scattering sixpences like rain;
649. Then pages three and three; and next, slave-held,
650. The Imaian 'scutcheon bright, -- one mouse in argent field.

651. LXVI.
652. Gentlemen pensioners next; and after them,
653. A troop of winged Janizaries flew;
654. Then slaves, as presents bearing many a gem;
655. Then twelve physicians fluttering two and two;
656. And next a chaplain in a cassock new;
657. Then Lords in waiting; then (what head not reels
658. For pleasure?) -- the fair Princess in full view,
659. Borne upon wings, -- and very pleas'd she feels
660. To have such splendour dance attendance at her heels.

661. LXVII.
662. For there was more magnificence behind:
663. She wav'd her handkerchief. 'Ah, very grand!'
664. Cry'd Elfinan, and clos'd the window-blind;
665. 'And, Hum, we must not shilly-shally stand,--
666. Adieu! adieu! I'm off for Angle-land!
667. I say, old Hocus, have you such a thing
668. About you, -- feel your pockets, I command,--
669. I want, this instant, an invisible ring,--
670. Thank you, old mummy! -- now securely I take wing.'

671. LXVIII.
672. Then Elfinan swift vaulted from the floor,
673. And lighted graceful on the window-sill;
674. Under one arm the magic book he bore,
675. The other he could wave about at will;
676. Pale was his face, he still look'd very ill;
677. He bow'd at Bellanaine, and said -- 'Poor Bell!
678. Farewell! farewell! and if for ever! still
679. For ever fare thee well!' -- and then he fell
680. A laughing! -- snapp'd his fingers! -- shame it is to tell!

681. LXIX.
682. 'By'r Lady! he is gone!' cries Hum, 'and I --
683. (I own it) -- have made too free with his wine;
684. Old Crafticant will smoke me. By-the-bye!
685. This room is full of jewels as a mine,--
686. Dear valuable creatures, how ye shine!
687. Sometime to-day I must contrive a minute,
688. If Mercury propitiously incline,
689. To examine his scutoire, and see what's in i,
690. For of superfluous diamonds I as well may thin it.

691. LXX.
692. 'The Emperor's horrid bad; yes, that's my cue!'
693. Some histories say that this was Hum's last speech;
694. That, being fuddled, he went reeling through
695. The corridor, and scarce upright could reach
696. The stair-head; that being glutted as a leech,
697. And us'd, as we ourselves have just now said,
698. To manage stairs reversely, like a peach
699. Too ripe, he fell, being puzzled in his head
700. With liquor and the staircase: verdict -- found stone dead.

701. LXXI.
702. This as a falsehood Crafticanto treats;
703. And as his style is of strange elegance,
704. Gentle and tender, full of soft conceits,
705. (Much like our Boswell's,) we will take a glance
706. At his sweet prose, and, if we can, make dance
707. His woven periods into careless rhyme;
708. O, little faery Pegasus! rear -- prance --
709. Trot round the quarto -- ordinary time!
710. March, little Pegasus, with pawing hoof sublime!

711. LXXII.
712. Well, let us see, -- tenth book and chapter nine,--
713. Thus Crafticant pursues his diary:--
714. ''Twas twelve o'clock at night, the weather fine,
715. Latitude thirty-six; our scouts descry
716. A flight of starlings making rapidly
717. Towards Thibet. Mem.: -- birds fly in the night;
718. From twelve to half-past -- wings not fit to fly
719. For a thick fog -- the Princess sulky quite;
720. Call'd for an extra shawl, and gave her nurse a bite.

721. LXXIII.
722. 'Five minutes before one -- brought down a moth
723. With my new double-barrel -- stew'd the thighs
724. And made a very tolerable broth --
725. Princess turn'd dainty, to our great surprise,
726. Alter'd her mind, and thought it very nice;
727. Seeing her pleasant, try'd her with a pun,
728. She frown'd; a monstrous owl across us flies
729. About this time, -- a sad old figure of fun;
730. Bad omen -- this new match can't be a happy one.

731. LXXIV.
732. 'From two to half-past, dusky way we made,
733. Above the plains of Gobi, -- desert, bleak;
734. Beheld afar off, in the hooded shade
735. Of darkness, a great mountain (strange to speak),
736. Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak,
737. A fan-shap'd burst of blood-red, arrowy fire,
738. Turban'd with smoke, which still away did reek,
739. Solid and black from that eternal pyre,
740. Upon the laden winds that scantly could respire.

741. LXXV.
742. 'Just upon three o'clock a falling star
743. Created an alarm among our troop,
744. Kill'd a man-cook, a page, and broke a jar,
745. A tureen, and three dishes, at one swoop,
746. Then passing by the princess, singed her hoop:
747. Could not conceive what Coralline was at,
748. She clapp'd her hands three times and cry'd out 'Whoop!'
749. Some strange Imaian custom. A large bat
750. Came sudden 'fore my face, and brush'd against my hat.

751. LXXVI.
752. 'Five minutes thirteen seconds after three,
753. Far in the west a mighty fire broke out,
754. Conjectur'd, on the instant, it might be,
755. The city of Balk -- 'twas Balk beyond all doubt:
756. A griffin, wheeling here and there about,
757. Kept reconnoitring us -- doubled our guard --
758. Lighted our torches, and kept up a shout,
759. Till he sheer'd off -- the Princess very scar'd --
760. And many on their marrow-bones for death prepar'd.

761. LXXVII.
762. 'At half-past three arose the cheerful moon--
763. Bivouack'd for four minutes on a cloud --
764. Where from the earth we heard a lively tune
765. Of tambourines and pipes, serene and loud,
766. While on a flowery lawn a brilliant crowd
767. Cinque-parted danc'd, some half asleep reposed
768. Beneath the green-fan'd cedars, some did shroud
769. In silken tents, and 'mid light fragrance dozed,
770. Or on the opera turf their soothed eyelids closed.

771. LXXVIII.
772. 'Dropp'd my gold watch, and kill'd a kettledrum--
773. It went for apoplexy -- foolish folks! --
774. Left it to pay the piper -- a good sum --
775. (I've got a conscience, maugre people's jokes,)
776. To scrape a little favour; 'gan to coax
777. Her Highness' pug-dog -- got a sharp rebuff --
778. She wish'd a game at whist -- made three revokes --
779. Turn'd from myself, her partner, in a huff;
780. His majesty will know her temper time enough.

781. LXXIX.
782. 'She cry'd for chess -- I play'd a game with her --
783. Castled her king with such a vixen look,
784. It bodes ill to his Majesty -- (refer
785. To the second chapter of my fortieth book,
786. And see what hoity-toity airs she took).
787. At half-past four the morn essay'd to beam --
788. Saluted, as we pass'd, an early rook --
789. The Princess fell asleep, and, in her dream,
790. Talk'd of one Master Hubert, deep in her esteem.

791. LXXX.
792. 'About this time, -- making delightful way,--
793. Shed a quill-feather from my larboard wing --
794. Wish'd, trusted, hop'd 'twas no sign of decay --
795. Thank heaven, I'm hearty yet! -- 'twas no such thing:--
796. At five the golden light began to spring,
797. With fiery shudder through the bloomed east;
798. At six we heard Panthea's churches ring --
799. The city wall his unhiv'd swarms had cast,
800. To watch our grand approach, and hail us as we pass'd.

801. LXXXI.
802. 'As flowers turn their faces to the sun,
803. So on our flight with hungry eyes they gaze,
804. And, as we shap'd our course, this, that way run,
805. With mad-cap pleasure, or hand-clasp'd amaze;
806. Sweet in the air a mild-ton'd music plays,
807. And progresses through its own labyrinth;
808. Buds gather'd from the green spring's middle-days,
809. They scatter'd, -- daisy, primrose, hyacinth,--
810. Or round white columns wreath'd from capital to plinth.

811. LXXXII.
812. 'Onward we floated o'er the panting streets,
813. That seem'd throughout with upheld faces paved;
814. Look where we will, our bird's-eye vision meets
815. Legions of holiday; bright standards waved,
816. And fluttering ensigns emulously craved
817. Our minute's glance; a busy thunderous roar,
818. From square to square, among the buildings raved,
819. As when the sea, at flow, gluts up once more
820. The craggy hollowness of a wild reefed shore.

821. LXXXIII.
822. 'And 'Bellanaine for ever!' shouted they,
823. While that fair Princess, from her winged chair,
824. Bow'd low with high demeanour, and, to pay
825. Their new-blown loyalty with guerdon fair,
826. Still emptied at meet distance, here and there,
827. A plenty horn of jewels. And here I
828. (Who wish to give the devil her due) declare
829. Against that ugly piece of calumny,
830. Which calls them Highland pebble-stones not worth a fly.

831. LXXXIV.
832. 'Still 'Bellanaine!' they shouted, while we glide
833. 'Slant to a light Ionic portico,
834. The city's delicacy, and the pride
835. Of our Imperial Basilic; a row
836. Of lords and ladies, on each hand, make show
837. Submissive of knee-bent obeisance,
838. All down the steps; and, as we enter'd, lo!
839. The strangest sight -- the most unlook'd for chance --
840. All things turn'd topsy-turvy in a devil's dance.

841. LXXXV.
842. ''Stead of his anxious Majesty and court
843. At the open doors, with wide saluting eyes,
844. CongÃ¨es and scrape-graces of every sort,
845. And all the smooth routine of gallantries,
846. Was seen, to our immoderate surprise,
847. A motley crowd thick gather'd in the hall,
848. Lords, scullions, deputy-scullions, with wild cries
849. Stunning the vestibule from wall to wall,
850. Where the Chief Justice on his knees and hands doth crawl.

851. LXXXVI.
852. 'Counts of the palace, and the state purveyor
853. Of moth's-down, to make soft the royal beds,
854. The Common Council and my fool Lord Mayor
855. Marching a-row, each other slipshod treads;
856. Powder'd bag-wigs and ruffy-tuffy heads
857. Of cinder wenches meet and soil each other;
858. Toe crush'd with heel ill-natur'd fighting breeds,
859. Frill-rumpling elbows brew up many a bother,
860. And fists in the short ribs keep up the yell and pother.

861. LXXXVII.
862. 'A Poet, mounted on the Court-Clown's back,
863. Rode to the Princess swift with spurring heels,
864. And close into her face, with rhyming clack,
865. Began a Prothalamion; -- she reels,
866. She falls, she faints! while laughter peels
867. Over her woman's weakness. 'Where!' cry'd I,
868. 'Where is his Majesty?' No person feels
869. Inclin'd to answer; wherefore instantly
870. I plung'd into the crowd to find him or die.

871. LXXXVIII.
872. 'Jostling my way I gain'd the stairs, and ran
873. To the first landing, where, incredible!
874. I met, far gone in liquor, that old man,
875. That vile impostor Hum. ----'
876. So far so well,--
877. For we have prov'd the Mago never fell
878. Down stairs on Crafticanto's evidence;
879. And therefore duly shall proceed to tell,
880. Plain in our own original mood and tense,
881. The sequel of this day, though labour 'tis immense!
