1. Had I a man's fair form, then might my sighs
2. Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell
3. Thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well
4. Would passion arm me for the enterprize:
5. But ah! I am no knight whose foeman dies;
6. No cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;
7. I am no happy shepherd of the dell
8. Whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes.
9. Yet must I doat upon thee,--call thee sweet,
10. Sweeter by far than Hybla's honied roses
11. When steep'd in dew rich to intoxication.
12. Ah! I will taste that dew, for me 'tis meet,
13. And when the moon her pallid face discloses,
14. I'll gather some by spells, and incantation.
