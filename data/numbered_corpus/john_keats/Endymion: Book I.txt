5. Book I


6. A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
7. Its loveliness increases; it will never
8. Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
9. A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
10. Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
11. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
12. A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
13. Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
14. Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
15. Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
16. Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
17. Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
18. From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
19. Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
20. For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
21. With the green world they live in; and clear rills
22. That for themselves a cooling covert make
23. 'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
24. Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
25. And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
26. We have imagined for the mighty dead;
27. All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
28. An endless fountain of immortal drink,
29. Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.

30. Nor do we merely feel these essences
31. For one short hour; no, even as the trees
32. That whisper round a temple become soon
33. Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,
34. The passion poesy, glories infinite,
35. Haunt us till they become a cheering light
36. Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
37. That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,
38. They alway must be with us, or we die.

39. Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I
40. Will trace the story of Endymion.
41. The very music of the name has gone
42. Into my being, and each pleasant scene
43. Is growing fresh before me as the green
44. Of our own vallies: so I will begin
45. Now while I cannot hear the city's din;
46. Now while the early budders are just new,
47. And run in mazes of the youngest hue
48. About old forests; while the willow trails
49. Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
50. Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year
51. Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer
52. My little boat, for many quiet hours,
53. With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
54. Many and many a verse I hope to write,
55. Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,
56. Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
57. Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,
58. I must be near the middle of my story.
59. O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,
60. See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,
61. With universal tinge of sober gold,
62. Be all about me when I make an end.
63. And now at once, adventuresome, I send
64. My herald thought into a wilderness:
65. There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress
66. My uncertain path with green, that I may speed
67. Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.

68. Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread
69. A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed
70. So plenteously all weed-hidden roots
71. Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.
72. And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,
73. Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep
74. A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,
75. Never again saw he the happy pens
76. Whither his brethren, bleating with content,
77. Over the hills at every nightfall went.
78. Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,
79. That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever
80. From the white flock, but pass'd unworried
81. By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,
82. Until it came to some unfooted plains
83. Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains
84. Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,
85. Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,
86. And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly
87. To a wide lawn, whence one could only see
88. Stems thronging all around between the swell
89. Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell
90. The freshness of the space of heaven above,
91. Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove
92. Would often beat its wings, and often too
93. A little cloud would move across the blue.

94. Full in the middle of this pleasantness
95. There stood a marble altar, with a tress
96. Of flowers budded newly; and the dew
97. Had taken fairy phantasies to strew
98. Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,
99. And so the dawned light in pomp receive.
100. For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire
101. Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre
102. Of brightness so unsullied, that therein
103. A melancholy spirit well might win
104. Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine
105. Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine
106. Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;
107. The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run
108. To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;
109. Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass
110. Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,
111. To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.

112. Now while the silent workings of the dawn
113. Were busiest, into that self-same lawn
114. All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped
115. A troop of little children garlanded;
116. Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry
117. Earnestly round as wishing to espy
118. Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited
119. For many moments, ere their ears were sated
120. With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then
121. Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.
122. Within a little space again it gave
123. Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,
124. To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking
125. Through copse-clad vallies,--ere their death, oer-taking
126. The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.

127. And now, as deep into the wood as we
128. Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light
129. Fair faces and a rush of garments white,
130. Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last
131. Into the widest alley they all past,
132. Making directly for the woodland altar.
133. O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter
134. In telling of this goodly company,
135. Of their old piety, and of their glee:
136. But let a portion of ethereal dew
137. Fall on my head, and presently unmew
138. My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,
139. To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.

140. Leading the way, young damsels danced along,
141. Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;
142. Each having a white wicker over brimm'd
143. With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,
144. A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks
145. As may be read of in Arcadian books;
146. Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,
147. When the great deity, for earth too ripe,
148. Let his divinity o'er-flowing die
149. In music, through the vales of Thessaly:
150. Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,
151. And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound
152. With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,
153. Now coming from beneath the forest trees,
154. A venerable priest full soberly,
155. Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye
156. Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,
157. And after him his sacred vestments swept.
158. From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,
159. Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;
160. And in his left he held a basket full
161. Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:
162. Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still
163. Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.
164. His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,
165. Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth
166. Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd
167. Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud
168. Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,
169. Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd
170. Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,
171. Easily rolling so as scarce to mar
172. The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:
173. Who stood therein did seem of great renown
174. Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,
175. Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;
176. And, for those simple times, his garments were
177. A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,
178. Was hung a silver bugle, and between
179. His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.
180. A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,
181. To common lookers on, like one who dream'd
182. Of idleness in groves Elysian:
183. But there were some who feelingly could scan
184. A lurking trouble in his nether lip,
185. And see that oftentimes the reins would slip
186. Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,
187. And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,
188. Of logs piled solemnly.--Ah, well-a-day,
189. Why should our young Endymion pine away!

190. Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,
191. Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd
192. To sudden veneration: women meek
193. Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek
194. Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.
195. Endymion too, without a forest peer,
196. Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,
197. Among his brothers of the mountain chase.
198. In midst of all, the venerable priest
199. Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,
200. And, after lifting up his aged hands,
201. Thus spake he: "Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!
202. Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:
203. Whether descended from beneath the rocks
204. That overtop your mountains; whether come
205. From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;
206. Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs
207. Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze
208. Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge
209. Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,
210. Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn
211. By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:
212. Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare
213. The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;
214. And all ye gentle girls who foster up
215. Udderless lambs, and in a little cup
216. Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:
217. Yea, every one attend! for in good truth
218. Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.
219. Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
220. Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains
221. Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
222. Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad
223. Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had
224. Great bounty from Endymion our lord.
225. The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd
226. His early song against yon breezy sky,
227. That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity."

228. Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire
229. Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;
230. Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod
231. With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.
232. Now while the earth was drinking it, and while
233. Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,
234. And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright
235. 'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light
236. Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:

237. "O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang
238. From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth
239. Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death
240. Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;
241. Who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress
242. Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;
243. And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken
244. The dreary melody of bedded reeds--
245. In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds
246. The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;
247. Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth
248. Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx--do thou now,
249. By thy love's milky brow!
250. By all the trembling mazes that she ran,
251. Hear us, great Pan!

252. "O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles
253. Passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,
254. What time thou wanderest at eventide
255. Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side
256. Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom
257. Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom
258. Their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees
259. Their golden honeycombs; our village leas
260. Their fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;
261. The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,
262. To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries
263. Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies
264. Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year
265. All its completions--be quickly near,
266. By every wind that nods the mountain pine,
267. O forester divine!

268. "Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies
269. For willing service; whether to surprise
270. The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;
271. Or upward ragged precipices flit
272. To save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;
273. Or by mysterious enticement draw
274. Bewildered shepherds to their path again;
275. Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,
276. And gather up all fancifullest shells
277. For thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,
278. And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;
279. Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,
280. The while they pelt each other on the crown
281. With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown--
282. By all the echoes that about thee ring,
283. Hear us, O satyr king!

284. "O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,
285. While ever and anon to his shorn peers
286. A ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,
287. When snouted wild-boars routing tender corn
288. Anger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,
289. To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:
290. Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,
291. That come a swooning over hollow grounds,
292. And wither drearily on barren moors:
293. Dread opener of the mysterious doors
294. Leading to universal knowledge--see,
295. Great son of Dryope,
296. The many that are come to pay their vows
297. With leaves about their brows!

298. Be still the unimaginable lodge
299. For solitary thinkings; such as dodge
300. Conception to the very bourne of heaven,
301. Then leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,
302. That spreading in this dull and clodded earth
303. Gives it a touch ethereal--a new birth:
304. Be still a symbol of immensity;
305. A firmament reflected in a sea;
306. An element filling the space between;
307. An unknown--but no more: we humbly screen
308. With uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,
309. And giving out a shout most heaven rending,
310. Conjure thee to receive our humble Paean,
311. Upon thy Mount Lycean!

312. Even while they brought the burden to a close,
313. A shout from the whole multitude arose,
314. That lingered in the air like dying rolls
315. Of abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals
316. Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.
317. Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,
318. Young companies nimbly began dancing
319. To the swift treble pipe, and humming string.
320. Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly
321. To tunes forgotten--out of memory:
322. Fair creatures! whose young children's children bred
323. Thermopylæ its heroes--not yet dead,
324. But in old marbles ever beautiful.
325. High genitors, unconscious did they cull
326. Time's sweet first-fruits--they danc'd to weariness,
327. And then in quiet circles did they press
328. The hillock turf, and caught the latter end
329. Of some strange history, potent to send
330. A young mind from its bodily tenement.
331. Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent
332. On either side; pitying the sad death
333. Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath
334. Of Zephyr slew him,--Zephyr penitent,
335. Who now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,
336. Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.
337. The archers too, upon a wider plain,
338. Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,
339. And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft
340. Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,
341. Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope
342. Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee
343. And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,
344. Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young
345. Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue
346. Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,
347. And very, very deadliness did nip
348. Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood
349. By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,
350. Uplifting his strong bow into the air,
351. Many might after brighter visions stare:
352. After the Argonauts, in blind amaze
353. Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,
354. Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,
355. There shot a golden splendour far and wide,
356. Spangling those million poutings of the brine
357. With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine
358. From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;
359. A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.
360. Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,
361. Might turn their steps towards the sober ring
362. Where sat Endymion and the aged priest
363. 'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd
364. The silvery setting of their mortal star.
365. There they discours'd upon the fragile bar
366. That keeps us from our homes ethereal;
367. And what our duties there: to nightly call
368. Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;
369. To summon all the downiest clouds together
370. For the sun's purple couch; to emulate
371. In ministring the potent rule of fate
372. With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;
373. To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons
374. Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,
375. A world of other unguess'd offices.
376. Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,
377. Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse
378. Each one his own anticipated bliss.
379. One felt heart-certain that he could not miss
380. His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,
381. Where every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows
382. Her lips with music for the welcoming.
383. Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,
384. To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,
385. Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:
386. Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,
387. And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;
388. And, ever after, through those regions be
389. His messenger, his little Mercury.
390. Some were athirst in soul to see again
391. Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign
392. In times long past; to sit with them, and talk
393. Of all the chances in their earthly walk;
394. Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores
395. Of happiness, to when upon the moors,
396. Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,
397. And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told
398. Their fond imaginations,--saving him
399. Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,
400. Endymion: yet hourly had he striven
401. To hide the cankering venom, that had riven
402. His fainting recollections. Now indeed
403. His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed
404. The sudden silence, or the whispers low,
405. Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,
406. Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,
407. Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:
408. But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,
409. Like one who on the earth had never stept.
410. Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,
411. Frozen in that old tale Arabian.

412. Who whispers him so pantingly and close?
413. Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,
414. His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,
415. And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade
416. A yielding up, a cradling on her care.
417. Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:
418. She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse
419. Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,
420. Along a path between two little streams,--
421. Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,
422. From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow
423. From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;
424. Until they came to where these streamlets fall,
425. With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,
426. Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush
427. With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.
428. A little shallop, floating there hard by,
429. Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;
430. And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,
431. And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,--
432. Peona guiding, through the water straight,
433. Towards a bowery island opposite;
434. Which gaining presently, she steered light
435. Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,
436. Where nested was an arbour, overwove
437. By many a summer's silent fingering;
438. To whose cool bosom she was used to bring
439. Her playmates, with their needle broidery,
440. And minstrel memories of times gone by.

441. So she was gently glad to see him laid
442. Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,
443. On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,
444. Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves
445. When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,
446. And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.
447. Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:
448. But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest
449. Peona's busy hand against his lips,
450. And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips
451. In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps
452. A patient watch over the stream that creeps
453. Windingly by it, so the quiet maid
454. Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade
455. Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling
456. Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling
457. Among seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.

458. O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,
459. That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
460. Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd
461. Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key
462. To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,
463. Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,
464. Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves
465. And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world
466. Of silvery enchantment!--who, upfurl'd
467. Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,
468. But renovates and lives?--Thus, in the bower,
469. Endymion was calm'd to life again.
470. Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,
471. He said: "I feel this thine endearing love
472. All through my bosom: thou art as a dove
473. Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings
474. About me; and the pearliest dew not brings
475. Such morning incense from the fields of May,
476. As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray
477. From those kind eyes,--the very home and haunt
478. Of sisterly affection. Can I want
479. Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?
480. Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears
481. That, any longer, I will pass my days
482. Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise
483. My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more
484. Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:
485. Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll
486. Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll
487. The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:
488. And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,
489. Again I'll linger in a sloping mead
490. To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed
491. Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,
492. And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat
493. My soul to keep in its resolved course."

494. Hereat Peona, in their silver source,
495. Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,
496. And took a lute, from which there pulsing came
497. A lively prelude, fashioning the way
498. In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay
499. More subtle cadenced, more forest wild
500. Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;
501. And nothing since has floated in the air
502. So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare
503. Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;
504. For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd
505. The quick invisible strings, even though she saw
506. Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw
507. Before the deep intoxication.
508. But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon
509. Her self-possession--swung the lute aside,
510. And earnestly said: "Brother, 'tis vain to hide
511. That thou dost know of things mysterious,
512. Immortal, starry; such alone could thus
513. Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught
514. Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught
515. A Paphian dove upon a message sent?
516. Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,
517. Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen
518. Her naked limbs among the alders green;
519. And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace
520. Something more high perplexing in thy face!"

521. Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,
522. And said, "Art thou so pale, who wast so bland
523. And merry in our meadows? How is this?
524. Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!--
525. Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change
526. Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?
527. Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?
528. Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,
529. That toiling years would put within my grasp,
530. That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp
531. No man e'er panted for a mortal love.
532. So all have set my heavier grief above
533. These things which happen. Rightly have they done:
534. I, who still saw the horizontal sun
535. Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,
536. Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd
537. My spear aloft, as signal for the chace--
538. I, who, for very sport of heart, would race
539. With my own steed from Araby; pluck down
540. A vulture from his towery perching; frown
541. A lion into growling, loth retire--
542. To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,
543. And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast
544. Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.

545. "This river does not see the naked sky,
546. Till it begins to progress silverly
547. Around the western border of the wood,
548. Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood
549. Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:
550. And in that nook, the very pride of June,
551. Had I been used to pass my weary eves;
552. The rather for the sun unwilling leaves
553. So dear a picture of his sovereign power,
554. And I could witness his most kingly hour,
555. When he doth lighten up the golden reins,
556. And paces leisurely down amber plains
557. His snorting four. Now when his chariot last
558. Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,
559. There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed
560. Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:
561. At which I wondered greatly, knowing well
562. That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;
563. And, sitting down close by, began to muse
564. What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,
565. In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;
566. Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook
567. Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,
568. Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth
569. Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,
570. Until my head was dizzy and distraught.
571. Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole
572. A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;
573. And shaping visions all about my sight
574. Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;
575. The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,
576. And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:
577. And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell
578. The enchantment that afterwards befel?
579. Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream
580. That never tongue, although it overteem
581. With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,
582. Could figure out and to conception bring
583. All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay
584. Watching the zenith, where the milky way
585. Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;
586. And travelling my eye, until the doors
587. Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,
588. I became loth and fearful to alight
589. From such high soaring by a downward glance:
590. So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,
591. Spreading imaginary pinions wide.
592. When, presently, the stars began to glide,
593. And faint away, before my eager view:
594. At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,
595. And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;
596. And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge
597. The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er
598. A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar
599. So passionately bright, my dazzled soul
600. Commingling with her argent spheres did roll
601. Through clear and cloudy, even when she went
602. At last into a dark and vapoury tent--
603. Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train
604. Of planets all were in the blue again.
605. To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd
606. My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed
607. By a bright something, sailing down apace,
608. Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:
609. Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,
610. Who from Olympus watch our destinies!
611. Whence that completed form of all completeness?
612. Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?
613. Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where
614. Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?
615. Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;
616. Not--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun
617. Such follying before thee--yet she had,
618. Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;
619. And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,
620. Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,
621. Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;
622. The which were blended in, I know not how,
623. With such a paradise of lips and eyes,
624. Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,
625. That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings
626. And plays about its fancy, till the stings
627. Of human neighbourhood envenom all.
628. Unto what awful power shall I call?
629. To what high fane?--Ah! see her hovering feet,
630. More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet
631. Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose
632. From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows
633. Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;
634. 'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million
635. Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,
636. Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,
637. Handfuls of daisies."--"Endymion, how strange!
638. Dream within dream!"--"She took an airy range,
639. And then, towards me, like a very maid,
640. Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,
641. And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;
642. Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,
643. Yet held my recollection, even as one
644. Who dives three fathoms where the waters run
645. Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,
646. I felt upmounted in that region
647. Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,
648. And eagles struggle with the buffeting north
649. That balances the heavy meteor-stone;--
650. Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,
651. But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.
652. Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,
653. And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;
654. Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd
655. Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:
656. There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd
657. To faint once more by looking on my bliss--
658. I was distracted; madly did I kiss
659. The wooing arms which held me, and did give
660. My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,
661. To take in draughts of life from the gold fount
662. Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count
663. The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd
664. A second self, that each might be redeem'd
665. And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.
666. Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press
667. Her very cheek against my crowned lip,
668. And, at that moment, felt my body dip
669. Into a warmer air: a moment more,
670. Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store
671. Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes
672. A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,
673. Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,
674. Made delicate from all white-flower bells;
675. And once, above the edges of our nest,
676. An arch face peep'd,--an Oread as I guess'd.

677. "Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me
678. In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,
679. Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,
680. And stare them from me? But no, like a spark
681. That needs must die, although its little beam
682. Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream
683. Fell into nothing--into stupid sleep.
684. And so it was, until a gentle creep,
685. A careful moving caught my waking ears,
686. And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,
687. My clenched hands;--for lo! the poppies hung
688. Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung
689. A heavy ditty, and the sullen day
690. Had chidden herald Hesperus away,
691. With leaden looks: the solitary breeze
692. Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze
693. With wayward melancholy; and r thought,
694. Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought
695. Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!--
696. Away I wander'd--all the pleasant hues
697. Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades
698. Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades
699. Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills
700. Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills
701. Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown
702. In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown
703. Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird
704. Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd
705. In little journeys, I beheld in it
706. A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit
707. My soul with under darkness; to entice
708. My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:
709. Therefore I eager followed, and did curse
710. The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,
711. Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!
712. These things, with all their comfortings, are given
713. To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,
714. Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea
715. Of weary life."

716. Thus ended he, and both
717. Sat silent: for the maid was very loth
718. To answer; feeling well that breathed words
719. Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords
720. Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps
721. Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,
722. And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;
723. To put on such a look as would say, Shame
724. On this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,
725. She could as soon have crush'd away the life
726. From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,
727. She said with trembling chance: "Is this the cause?
728. This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!
729. That one who through this middle earth should pass
730. Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave
731. His name upon the harp-string, should achieve
732. No higher bard than simple maidenhood,
733. Singing alone, and fearfully,--how the blood
734. Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray
735. He knew not where; and how he would say, nay,
736. If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;
737. What could it be but love? How a ring-dove
738. Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;
739. And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,
740. The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;
741. And then the ballad of his sad life closes
742. With sighs, and an alas!--Endymion!
743. Be rather in the trumpet's mouth,--anon
744. Among the winds at large--that all may hearken!
745. Although, before the crystal heavens darken,
746. I watch and dote upon the silver lakes
747. Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes
748. The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,
749. Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands
750. With horses prancing o'er them, palaces
751. And towers of amethyst,--would I so tease
752. My pleasant days, because I could not mount
753. Into those regions? The Morphean fount
754. Of that fine element that visions, dreams,
755. And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams
756. Into its airy channels with so subtle,
757. So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,
758. Circled a million times within the space
759. Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,
760. A tinting of its quality: how light
761. Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight
762. Than the mere nothing that engenders them!
763. Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem
764. Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?
765. Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick
766. For nothing but a dream?" Hereat the youth
767. Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth
768. Was in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids
769. Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids
770. A little breeze to creep between the fans
771. Of careless butterflies: amid his pains
772. He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,
773. Full palatable; and a colour grew
774. Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.

775. "Peona! ever have I long'd to slake
776. My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,
777. No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace
778. The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd--
779. Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd
780. And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope
781. Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,
782. To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.
783. Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks
784. Our ready minds to fellowship divine,
785. A fellowship with essence; till we shine,
786. Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold
787. The clear religion of heaven! Fold
788. A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,
789. And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress
790. Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,
791. And with a sympathetic touch unbinds
792. Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:
793. Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;
794. Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;
795. Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave
796. Round every spot where trod Apollo's foot;
797. Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,
798. Where long ago a giant battle was;
799. And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass
800. In every place where infant Orpheus slept.
801. Feel we these things?--that moment have we stept
802. Into a sort of oneness, and our state
803. Is like a floating spirit's. But there are
804. Richer entanglements, enthralments far
805. More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,
806. To the chief intensity: the crown of these
807. Is made of love and friendship, and sits high
808. Upon the forehead of humanity.
809. All its more ponderous and bulky worth
810. Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth
811. A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,
812. There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop
813. Of light, and that is love: its influence,
814. Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,
815. At which we start and fret; till in the end,
816. Melting into its radiance, we blend,
817. Mingle, and so become a part of it,--
818. Nor with aught else can our souls interknit
819. So wingedly: when we combine therewith,
820. Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,
821. And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.
822. Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,
823. That men, who might have tower'd in the van
824. Of all the congregated world, to fan
825. And winnow from the coming step of time
826. All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime
827. Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,
828. Have been content to let occasion die,
829. Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.
830. And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,
831. Than speak against this ardent listlessness:
832. For I have ever thought that it might bless
833. The world with benefits unknowingly;
834. As does the nightingale, upperched high,
835. And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves--
836. She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives
837. How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.
838. Just so may love, although 'tis understood
839. The mere commingling of passionate breath,
840. Produce more than our searching witnesseth:
841. What I know not: but who, of men, can tell
842. That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell
843. To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,
844. The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,
845. The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,
846. The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,
847. Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,
848. If human souls did never kiss and greet?

849. "Now, if this earthly love has power to make
850. Men's being mortal, immortal; to shake
851. Ambition from their memories, and brim
852. Their measure of content; what merest whim,
853. Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,
854. To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim
855. A love immortal, an immortal too.
856. Look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,
857. And never can be born of atomies
858. That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,
859. Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,
860. My restless spirit never could endure
861. To brood so long upon one luxury,
862. Unless it did, though fearfully, espy
863. A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.
864. My sayings will the less obscured seem,
865. When I have told thee how my waking sight
866. Has made me scruple whether that same night
867. Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!
868. Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,
869. Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,
870. Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows
871. Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,
872. And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,
873. And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide
874. Past them, but he must brush on every side.
875. Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,
876. Far as the slabbed margin of a well,
877. Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye
878. Right upward, through the bushes, to the sky.
879. Oft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set
880. Like vestal primroses, but dark velvet
881. Edges them round, and they have golden pits:
882. 'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits
883. In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,
884. When all above was faint with mid-day heat.
885. And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,
886. I'd bubble up the water through a reed;
887. So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships
888. Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,
889. With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be
890. Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,
891. When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,
892. I sat contemplating the figures wild
893. Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.
894. Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew
895. A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;
896. So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver
897. The happy chance: so happy, I was fain
898. To follow it upon the open plain,
899. And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!
900. A wonder, fair as any I have told--
901. The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,
902. Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap
903. Through the cool depth.--It moved as if to flee--
904. I started up, when lo! refreshfully,
905. There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,
906. Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,
907. Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,
908. Bathing my spirit in a new delight.
909. Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss
910. Alone preserved me from the drear abyss
911. Of death, for the fair form had gone again.
912. Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain
913. Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth
914. On the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,
915. 'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.
916. How sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure
917. Of weary days, made deeper exquisite,
918. By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!
919. Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,
920. Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:
921. And a whole age of lingering moments crept
922. Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept
923. Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.
924. Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;
925. Once more been tortured with renewed life.
926. When last the wintry gusts gave over strife
927. With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies
928. Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes
929. In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,--
930. That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,
931. My hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,
932. Chatted with thee, and many days exil'd
933. All torment from my breast;--'twas even then,
934. Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den
935. Of helpless discontent,--hurling my lance
936. From place to place, and following at chance,
937. At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,
938. And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck
939. In the middle of a brook,--whose silver ramble
940. Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,
941. Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,
942. Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave
943. The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,--
944. 'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock
945. Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,
946. Hung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread
947. Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.
948. "Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?"
949. Said I, low voic'd: "Ah whither! 'Tis the grot
950. Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,
951. Doth her resign; and where her tender hands
952. She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:
953. Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,
954. And babbles thorough silence, till her wits
955. Are gone in tender madness, and anon,
956. Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone
957. Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,
958. And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,
959. To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,
960. Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,
961. And weave them dyingly--send honey-whispers
962. Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers
963. May sigh my love unto her pitying!
964. O charitable echo! hear, and sing
965. This ditty to her!--tell her"--so I stay'd
966. My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,
967. Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,
968. And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.
969. Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name
970. Most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:
971. ‘Endymion! the cave is secreter
972. Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir
973. No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise
974. Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys
975. And trembles through my labyrinthine hair."
976. At that oppress'd I hurried in.--Ah! where
977. Are those swift moments? Whither are they fled?
978. I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed
979. Sorrow the way to death, but patiently
980. Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;
981. And come instead demurest meditation,
982. To occupy me wholly, and to fashion
983. My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.
984. No more will I count over, link by link,
985. My chain of grief: no longer strive to find
986. A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind
987. Blustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,
988. Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;
989. What a calm round of hours shall make my days.
990. There is a paly flame of hope that plays
991. Where'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught--
992. And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,
993. Already, a more healthy countenance?
994. By this the sun is setting; we may chance
995. Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car."

996. This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star
997. Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:
998. They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.
