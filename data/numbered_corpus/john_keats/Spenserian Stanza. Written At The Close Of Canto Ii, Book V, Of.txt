1. In after-time, a sage of mickle lore
2. Yclep'd Typographus, the Giant took,
3. And did refit his limbs as heretofore,
4. And made him read in many a learned book,
5. And into many a lively legend look;
6. Thereby in goodly themes so training him,
7. That all his brutishness he quite forsook,
8. When, meeting Artegall and Talus grim,
9. The one he struck stone-blind, the other's eyes wox dim.
