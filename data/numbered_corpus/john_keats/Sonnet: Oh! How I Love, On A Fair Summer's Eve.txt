1. Oh! how I love, on a fair summer's eve,
2. When streams of light pour down the golden west,
3. And on the balmy zephyrs tranquil rest
4. The silver clouds, far -- far away to leave
5. All meaner thoughts, and take a sweet reprieve
6. From little cares; to find, with easy quest,
7. A fragrant wild, with Nature's beauty drest,
8. And there into delight my soul deceive.
9. There warm my breast with patriotic lore,
10. Musing on Milton's fate -- on Sydney's bier --
11. Till their stern forms before my mind arise:
12. Perhaps on wing of Poesy upsoar,
13. Full often dropping a delicious tear,
14. When some melodious sorrow spells mine eyes.
