1. O BLUSH not so! O blush not so!
2. Or I shall think you knowing;
3. And if you smile the blushing while,
4. Then maidenheads are going.

5. There's a blush for want, and a blush for shan't,
6. And a blush for having done it;
7. There's a blush for thought, and a blush for nought,
8. And a blush for just begun it.

9. O sigh not so! O sigh not so!
10. For it sounds of Eve's sweet pippin;
11. By these loosen'd lips you have tasted the pips
12. And fought in an amorous nipping.

13. Will you play once more at nice-cut-core,
14. For it only will last our youth out,
15. And we have the prime of the kissing time,
16. We have not one sweet tooth out.

17. There's a sigh for aye, and a sigh for nay,
18. And a sigh for "I can't bear it!"
19. O what can be done, shall we stay or run?
20. O cut the sweet apple and share it!
