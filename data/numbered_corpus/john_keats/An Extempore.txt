1. When they were come into Faery's Court
2. They rang -- no one at home -- all gone to sport
3. And dance and kiss and love as faerys do
4. For Faries be as human lovers true --
5. Amid the woods they were so lone and wild
6. Where even the Robin feels himself exil'd
7. And where the very books as if affraid
8. Hurry along to some less magic shade.
9. 'No one at home'! the fretful princess cry'd
10. 'And all for nothing such a dre[a]ry ride
11. And all for nothing my new diamond cross
12. No one to see my persian feathers toss
13. No one to see my Ape, my Dwarf, my Fool
14. Or how I pace my Otaheitan mule.
15. Ape, Dwarf and Fool why stand you gaping there
16. Burst the door open, quick -- or I declare
17. I'll switch you soundly and in pieces tear.'
18. The Dwarf began to tremble and the Ape
19. Star'd at the Fool, the Fool was all agape
20. The Princess grasp'd her switch but just in time
21. The Dwarf with piteous face began to rhyme.
22. 'O mighty Princess did you ne'er hear tell
23. What your poor servants know but too too well
24. Know you the three great crimes in faery land
25. The first alas! poor Dwarf I understand
26. I made a whipstock of a faery's wand
27. The next is snoring in their company
28. The next the last the direst of the three
29. Is making free when they are not at home.
30. I was a Prince -- a baby prince -- my doom
31. You see, I made a whipstock of a wand
32. My top has henceforth slept in faery land.
33. He was a Prince the Fool, a grown up Prince
34. But he has never been a King's son since
35. He fell a snoring at a faery Ball
36. Your poor Ape was a Prince and he poor thing
37. But ape -- so pray your highness stay awhile
38. 'Tis sooth indeed we know it to our sorrow --
39. Persist and you may be an ape tomorrow --
40. While the Dwarf spake the Princess all for spite
41. Peal'd the brown hazel twig to lilly white
42. Clench'd her small teeth, and held her lips apart
43. Try'd to look unconcerned with beating heart.
44. They saw her highness had made up her mind
45. And quaver'd like the reeds before the wind
46. And they had had it, but O happy chance
47. The Ape for very fear began to dance
48. And grin'd as all his uglyness did ache--
49. She staid her vixen fingers for his sake
50. He was so very ugly: then she took
51. Her pocket mirror and began to look
52. First at herself and [then] at him and then
53. She smil'd at her own beauteous face again.
54. Yet for all this -- for all her pretty face
55. She took it in her head to see the place.
56. Women gain little from experience
57. Either in Lovers, husbands or expense.
58. The more their beauty the more fortune too
59. Beauty before the wide world never knew.
60. So each fair reasons -- tho' it oft miscarries.
61. She thought her pretty face would please the fa[e]ries.
62. 'My darling Ape I wont whip you today
63. Give me the Picklock sirrah and go play.'
64. They all three wept but counsel was as vain
65. As crying cup biddy to drops of rain.
66. Yet lingeringly did the sad Ape forth draw
67. The Picklock from the Pocket in his Jaw.
68. The Princess took it and dismounting straight
69. Trip'd in blue silver'd slippers to the gate
70. And touch'd the wards, the Door full courteously
71. Opened -- she enter'd with her servants three.
72. Again it clos'd and there was nothing seen
73. But the Mule grasing on the herbage green.
74. End of Canto xii.

75. Canto the xiii.
76. The Mule no sooner saw himself alone
77. Than he prick'd up his Ears -- and said 'well done!
78. At least unhappy Prince I may be free --
79. No more a Princess shall side saddle me
80. O King of Othaiete -- tho' a Mule
81. 'Aye every inch a King' -- tho' 'Fortune's fool.'
82. Well done -- for by what Mr. Dwarfy said
83. I would not give a sixpence for her head.'
84. Even as he spake he trotted in high glee
85. To the knotty side of an old Pollard tree
86. And rub'd his sides against the mossed bark
87. Till his Girths burst and left him naked stark
88. Except his Bridle -- how get rid of that
89. Buckled and tied with many a twist and plait.
90. At last it struck him to pretend to sleep
91. And then the thievish Monkies down would creep
92. And filch the unpleasant trammels quite away.
93. No sooner thought of than adown he lay
94. Sham'd a good snore -- the Monkey-men descended
95. And whom they thought to injure they befriended.
96. They hung his Bridle on a topmost bough
97. And of[f] he went run, trot, or anyhow--
