1. As late I rambled in the happy fields,
2. What time the skylark shakes the tremulous dew
3. From his lush clover covert;â€”when anew
4. Adventurous knights take up their dinted shields;
5. I saw the sweetest flower wild nature yields,
6. A fresh-blown musk-rose; 'twas the first that threw
7. Its sweets upon the summer: graceful it grew
8. As is the wand that Queen Titania wields.
9. And, as I feasted on its fragrancy,
10. I thought the garden-rose it far excelled;
11. But when, O Wells! thy roses came to me,
12. My sense with their deliciousness was spelled:
13. Soft voices had they, that with tender plea
14. Whispered of peace, and truth, and friendliness unquelled.
