2. Exact in capitals your golden name;
3. Or sue the fair Apollo and he will
4. Rouse from his heavy slumber and instill
5. Great love in me for thee and Poesy.
6. Imagine not that greatest mastery
7. And kingdom over all the Realms of verse,
8. Nears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurse
9. And surety give to love and Brotherhood.

10. Anthropophagi in Othello's mood;
11. Ulysses storm'd and his enchanted belt
12. Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt
13. Unbosom'd so and so eternal made,
14. Such tender incense in their laurel shade
15. To all the regent sisters of the Nine
16. As this poor offering to you, sister mine.

17. Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are;
18. Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where;
19. And may it taste to you like good old wine,
20. Take you to real happiness and give
21. Sons, daughters and a home like honied hive.
