1. Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake;
2. His healthful spirit eager and awake
3. To feel the beauty of a silent eve,
4. Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave;
5. The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.
6. He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,
7. And smiles at the far clearness all around,
8. Until his heart is well nigh over wound,
9. And turns for calmness to the pleasant green
10. Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean
11. So elegantly o'er the waters' brim
12. And show their blossoms trim.
13. Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow
14. The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow,
15. Delighting much, to see it half at rest,
16. Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast
17. 'Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon,
18. The widening circles into nothing gone.

19. And now the sharp keel of his little boat
20. Comes up with ripple, and with easy float,
21. And glides into a bed of water lillies:
22. Broad leav'd are they and their white canopies
23. Are upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew.
24. Near to a little island's point they grew;
25. Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view
26. Of this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore
27. Went off in gentle windings to the hoar
28. And light blue mountains: but no breathing man
29. With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan
30. Nature's clear beauty, could pass lightly by
31. Objects that look'd out so invitingly
32. On either side. These, gentle Calidore
33. Greeted, as he had known them long before.

34. The sidelong view of swelling leafiness,
35. Which the glad setting sun, in gold doth dress;
36. Whence ever, and anon the jay outsprings,
37. And scales upon the beauty of its wings.

38. The lonely turret, shatter'd, and outworn,
39. Stands venerably proud; too proud to mourn
40. Its long lost grandeur: fir trees grow around,
41. Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.

42. The little chapel with the cross above
43. Upholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove,
44. That on the windows spreads his feathers light,
45. And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.

46. Green tufted islands casting their soft shades
47. Across the lake; sequester’d leafy glades,
48. That through the dimness of their twilight show
49. Large dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow
50. Of the wild cat’s eyes, or the silvery stems
51. Of delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems
52. A little brook. The youth had long been viewing
53. These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing
54. The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught
55. A trumpet's silver voice. Ah! it was fraught
56. With many joys for him: the warder's ken
57. Had found white coursers prancing in the glen:
58. Friends very dear to him he soon will see;
59. So pushes off his boat most eagerly,
60. And soon upon the lake he skims along,
61. Deaf to the nightingale’s first under-song;
62. Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly:
63. His spirit flies before him so completely.

64. And now he turns a jutting point of land,
65. Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand:
66. Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches,
67. Before the point of his light shallop reaches
68. Those marble steps that through the water dip:
69. Now over them he goes with hasty trip,
70. And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors:
71. Anon he leaps along the oaken floors
72. Of halls and corridors.

73. Delicious sounds! those little bright-eyed things
74. That float about the air on azure wings,
75. Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang
76. Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang,
77. Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain,
78. Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein;
79. While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis
80. They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,
81. What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand!
82. How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann’d!
83. Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone,
84. While whisperings of affection
85. Made him delay to let their tender feet
86. Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet
87. From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent:
88. And whether there were tears of languishment,
89. Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses,
90. He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses
91. With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye
92. All the soft luxury
93. That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,
94. Fair as some wonder out of fairy land,
95. Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers
96. Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers:
97. And this he fondled with his happy cheek
98. As if for joy he would no further seek;
99. When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond
100. Came to his ear, like something from beyond
101. His present being: so he gently drew
102. His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,
103. From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,
104. Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending;
105. While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd
106. A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd;
107. A hand that from the world's bleak promontory
108. Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.
109. Amid the pages, and the torches' glare,
110. There stood a knight, patting the flowing hair
111. Of his proud horse's mane: he was withal
112. A man of elegance, and stature tall:
113. So that the waving of his plumes would be
114. High as the berries of a wild ash tree,
115. Or as the winged cap of Mercury.
116. His armour was so dexterously wrought
117. In shape, that sure no living man had thought
118. It hard, and heavy steel: but that indeed
119. It was some glorious form, some splendid weed,
120. In which a spirit new come from the skies
121. Might live, and show itself to human eyes.
122. 'Tis the far-fam'd, the brave Sir Gondibert,
123. Said the good man to Calidore alert;
124. While the young warrior with a step of grace
125. Came up,--a courtly smile upon his face,
126. And mailed hand held out, ready to greet
127. The large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat
128. Of the aspiring boy; who as he led
129. Those smiling ladies, often turned his head
130. To admire the visor arched so gracefully
131. Over a knightly brow; while they went by
132. The lamps that from the high-roof'd hall were pendent,
133. And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.

134. Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated;
135. The sweet-lipp'd ladies have already greeted
136. All the green leaves that round the window clamber,
137. To show their purple stars, and bells of amber.
138. Sir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel,
139. Gladdening in the free, and airy feel
140. Of a light mantle; and while Clerimond
141. Is looking round about him with a fond,
142. And placid eye, young Calidore is burning
143. To hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning
144. Of all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm
145. Kept off dismay, and terror, and alarm
146. From lovely woman: while brimful of this,
147. He gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss,
148. And had such manly ardour in his eye,
149. That each at other look'd half staringly;
150. And then their features started into smiles
151. Sweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles.

152. Softly the breezes from the forest came,
153. Softly they blew aside the taper's flame;
154. Clear was the song from Philomel's far bower;
155. Grateful the incense from the lime-tree flower;
156. Mysterious, wild, the far-heard trumpet's tone;
157. Lovely the moon in ether, all alone:
158. Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals,
159. As that of busy spirits when the portals
160. Are closing in the west; or that soft humming
161. We hear around when Hesperus is coming.
162. Sweet be their sleep.
