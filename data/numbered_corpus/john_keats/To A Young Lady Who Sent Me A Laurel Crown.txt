1. Fresh morning gusts have blown away all fear
2. From my glad bosom,—now from gloominess
3. I mount for ever—not an atom less
4. Than the proud laurel shall content my bier.
5. No! by the eternal stars! or why sit here
6. In the Sun's eye, and 'gainst my temples press
7. Apollo's very leaves, woven to bless
8. By thy white fingers and thy spirit clear.
9. Lo! who dares say, "Do this"? Who dares call down
10. My will from its high purpose? Who say,"Stand,"
11. Or, "Go"? This mighty moment I would frown
12. On abject Caesars—not the stoutest band
13. Of mailed heroes should tear off my crown:
14. Yet would I kneel and kiss thy gentle hand.
