1. O thou whose face hath felt the Winter's wind,
2. Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in mist
3. And the black elm tops 'mong the freezing stars,
4. To thee the spring will be a harvest-time.
5. O thou, whose only book has been the light
6. Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on
7. Night after night when Phoebus was away,
8. To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn.
9. O fret not after knowledge -- I have none,
10. And yet my song comes native with the warmth.
11. O fret not after knowledge -- I have none,
12. And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens
13. At thought of idleness cannot be idle,
14. And he's awake who thinks himself asleep.
