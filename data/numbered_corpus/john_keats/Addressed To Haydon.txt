1. High-mindedness, a jealousy for good,
2. A loving-kindness for the great man's fame,
3. Dwells here and there with people of no name,
4. In noisome alley, and in pathless wood:
5. And where we think the truth least understood,
6. Oft may be found a "singleness of aim,"
7. That ought to frighten into hooded shame
8. A money-mongering, pitiable brood.
9. How glorious this affection for the cause
10. Of steadfast genius, toiling gallantly!
11. What when a stout unbending champion awes
12. Envy and malice to their native sty?
13. Unnumbered souls breathe out a still applause,
14. Proud to behold him in his country's eye.
