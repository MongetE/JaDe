1. Hadst thou liv'd in days of old,
2. O what wonders had been told
3. Of thy lively countenance,
4. And thy humid eyes that dance
5. In the midst of their own brightness;
6. In the very fane of lightness.
7. Over which thine eyebrows, leaning,
8. Picture out each lovely meaning:
9. In a dainty bend they lie,
10. Like to streaks across the sky,
11. Or the feathers from a crow,
12. Fallen on a bed of snow.
13. Of thy dark hair that extends
14. Into many graceful bends:
15. As the leaves of Hellebore
16. Turn to whence they sprung before.
17. And behind each ample curl
18. Peeps the richness of a pearl.
19. Downward too flows many a tress
20. With a glossy waviness;
21. Full, and round like globes that rise
22. From the censer to the skies
23. Through sunny air. Add too, the sweetness
24. Of thy honied voice; the neatness
25. Of thine ankle lightly turn'd:
26. With those beauties, scarce discern'd,
27. Kept with such sweet privacy,
28. That they seldom meet the eye
29. Of the little loves that fly
30. Round about with eager pry.
31. Saving when, with freshening lave,
32. Thou dipp'st them in the taintless wave;
33. Like twin water lillies, born
34. In the coolness of the morn.
35. O, if thou hadst breathed then,
36. Now the Muses had been ten.
37. Couldst thou wish for lineage higher
38. Than twin sister of Thalia?
39. At least for ever, evermore,
40. Will I call the Graces four.

41. Hadst thou liv'd when chivalry
42. Lifted up her lance on high,
43. Tell me what thou wouldst have been?
44. Ah! I see the silver sheen
45. Of thy broidered, floating vest
46. Cov’ring half thine ivory breast;
47. Which, O heavens! I should see,
48. But that cruel destiny
49. Has placed a golden cuirass there;
50. Keeping secret what is fair.
51. Like sunbeams in a cloudlet nested
52. Thy locks in knightly casque are rested:
53. O’er which bend four milky plumes
54. Like the gentle lilly’s blooms
55. Springing from a costly vase.
56. See with what a stately pace
57. Comes thine alabaster steed;
58. Servant of heroic deed!
59. O'er his loins, his trappings glow
60. Like the northern lights on snow.
61. Mount his back! thy sword unsheath!
62. Sign of the enchanter's death;
63. Bane of every wicked spell;
64. Silencer of dragon's yell.
65. Alas! thou this wilt never do:
66. Thou art an enchantress too,
67. And wilt surely never spill
68. Blood of those whose eyes can kill.
