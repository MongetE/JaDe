1. What though, for showing truth to flattered state,
2. Kind Hunt was shut in prison, yet has he,
3. In his immortal spirit, been as free
4. As the sky-searching lark, and as elate.
5. Minion of grandeur! think you he did wait?
6. Think you he nought but prison-walls did see,
7. Till, so unwilling, thou unturnedst the key?
8. Ah, no! far happier, nobler was his fate!
9. In Spenser's halls he strayed, and bowers fair,
10. Culling enchanted flowers; and he flew
11. With daring Milton through the fields of air:
12. To regions of his own his genius true
13. Took happy flights. Who shall his fame impair
14. When thou art dead, and all thy wretched crew?
