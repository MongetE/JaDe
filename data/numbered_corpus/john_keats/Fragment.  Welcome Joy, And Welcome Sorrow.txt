1. 'Under the flag
2. Of each his faction, they to battle bring
3. Their embryo atoms.' ~ Milton.

4. Welcome joy, and welcome sorrow,
5. Lethe's weed and Hermes' feather;
6. Come to-day, and come to-morrow,
7. I do love you both together!
8. I love to mark sad faces in fair weather;
9. And hear a merry laugh amid the thunder;
10. Fair and foul I love together.
11. Meadows sweet where flames are under,
12. And a giggle at a wonder;
13. Visage sage at pantomine;
14. Funeral, and steeple-chime;
15. Infant playing with a skull;
16. Morning fair, and shipwreck'd hull;
17. Nightshade with the woodbine kissing;
18. Serpents in red roses hissing;
19. Cleopatra regal-dress'd
20. With the aspic at her breast;
21. Dancing music, music sad,
22. Both together, sane and mad;
23. Muses bright and muses pale;
24. Sombre Saturn, Momus hale;--
25. Laugh and sigh, and laugh again;
26. Oh the sweetness of the pain!
27. Muses bright, and muses pale,
28. Bare your faces of the veil;
29. Let me see; and let me write
30. Of the day, and of the night -
31. Both together: - let me slake
32. All my thirst for sweet heart-ache!
33. Let my bower be of yew,
34. Interwreath'd with myrtles new;
35. Pines and lime-trees full in bloom,
36. And my couch a low grass-tomb.
