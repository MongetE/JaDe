1. I.
2. Fame, like a wayward girl, will still be coy
3. To those who woo her with too slavish knees,
4. But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy,
5. And dotes the more upon a heart at ease;
6. She is a Gypsy,-will not speak to those
7. Who have not learnt to be content without her;
8. A Jilt, whose ear was never whisper'd close,
9. Who thinks they scandal her who talk about her;
10. A very Gypsy is she, Nilus-born,
11. Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar;
12. Ye love-sick Bards! repay her scorn for scorn;
13. Ye Artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are!
14. Make your best bow to her and bid adieu,
15. Then, if she likes it, she will follow you.

16. II.
17. 'You cannot eat your cake and have it too.'~Proverb.

18. How fever'd is the man, who cannot look
19. Upon his mortal days with temperate blood,
20. Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book,
21. And robs his fair name of its maidenhood;
22. It is as if the rose should pluck herself,
23. On the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,
24. As if a Naiad, like a meddling elf,
25. Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom:
26. But the rose leaves herself upon the briar,
27. For winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed,
28. And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire,
29. The undisturbed lake has crystal space;
30. Why then should man, teasing the world for grace,
31. Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed?
