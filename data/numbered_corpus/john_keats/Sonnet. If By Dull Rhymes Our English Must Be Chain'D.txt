1. If by dull rhymes our English must be chain'd,
2. And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet
3. Fetter'd, in spite of pained loveliness;
4. Let us find out, if we must be constrain'd,
5. Sandals more interwoven and complete
6. To fit the naked foot of poesy;
7. Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
8. Of every chord, and see what may be gain'd
9. By ear industrious, and attention meet:
10. Misers of sound and syllable, no less
11. Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
12. Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;
13. So, if we may not let the Muse be free,
14. She will be bound with garlands of her own.
