1. Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain,
2. Inconstant, childish, proud, and full of fancies;
3. Without that modest softening that enhances
4. The downcast eye, repentant of the pain
5. That its mild light creates to heal again:
6. E'en then, elate, my spirit leaps, and prances,
7. E'en then my soul with exultation dances
8. For that to love, so long, I've dormant lain:
9. But when I see thee meek, and kind, and tender,
10. Heavens! how desperately do I adore
11. Thy winning graces;--to be thy defender
12. I hotly burn--to be a Calidore--
13. A very Red Cross Knight--a stout Leander--
14. Might I be loved by thee like these of yore.

15. Light feet, dark violet eyes, and parted hair;
16. Soft dimpled hands, white neck, and creamy breast,
17. Are things on which the dazzled senses rest
18. Till the fond, fixed eyes, forget they stare.
19. From such fine pictures, heavens! I cannot dare
20. To turn my admiration, though unpossess'd
21. They be of what is worthy,--though not drest
22. In lovely modesty, and virtues rare.
23. Yet these I leave as thoughtless as a lark;
24. These lures I straight forget--e'en ere I dine,
25. Or thrice my palate moisten: but when I mark
26. Such charms with mild intelligences shine,
27. My ear is open like a greedy shark,
28. To catch the tunings of a voice divine.

29. Ah! who can e'er forget so fair a being?
30. Who can forget her half retiring sweets?
31. God! she is like a milk-white lamb that bleats
32. For man's protection. Surely the All-seeing,
33. Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing,
34. Will never give him pinions, who intreats
35. Such innocence to ruin,--who vilely cheats
36. A dove-like bosom. In truth there is no freeing
37. One's thoughts from such a beauty; when I hear
38. A lay that once I saw her hand awake,
39. Her form seems floating palpable, and near;
40. Had I e'er seen her from an arbour take
41. A dewy flower, oft would that hand appear,
42. And o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake.
