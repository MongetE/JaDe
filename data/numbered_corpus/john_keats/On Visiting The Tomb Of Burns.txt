1. The town, the churchyard, and the setting sun,
2. The clouds, the trees, the rounded hills all seem,
3. Though beautiful, cold- strange- as in a dream
4. I dreamed long ago, now new begun.
5. The short-liv'd, paly summer is but won
6. From winter's ague for one hour's gleam;
7. Through sapphire warm their stars do never beam:
8. All is cold Beauty; pain is never done.
9. For who has mind to relish, Minos-wise,
10. The real of Beauty, free from that dead hue
11. Sickly imagination and sick pride
12. Cast wan upon it? Burns! with honour due
13. I oft have honour'd thee. Great shadow, hide
14. Thy face; I sin against thy native skies.
