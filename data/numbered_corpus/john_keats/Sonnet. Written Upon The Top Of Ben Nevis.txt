1. Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud
2. Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist!
3. I look into the chasms, and a shroud
4. Vapourous doth hide them, -- just so much I wist
5. Mankind do know of hell; I look o'erhead,
6. And there is sullen mist, -- even so much
7. Mankind can tell of heaven; mist is spread
8. Before the earth, beneath me, -- even such,
9. Even so vague is man's sight of himself!
10. Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet,--
11. Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf,
12. I tread on them, -- that all my eye doth meet
13. Is mist and crag, not only on this height,
14. But in the world of thought and mental might!
