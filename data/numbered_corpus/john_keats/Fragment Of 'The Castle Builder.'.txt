1. To-night I'll have my friar -- let me think
2. About my room, -- I'll have it in the pink;
3. It should be rich and sombre, and the moon,
4. Just in its mid-life in the midst of June,
5. Should look thro' four large windows and display
6. Clear, but for gold-fish vases in the way,
7. Their glassy diamonding on Turkish floor;
8. The tapers keep aside, an hour and more,
9. To see what else the moon alone can show;
10. While the night-breeze doth softly let us know
11. My terrace is well bower'd with oranges.
12. Upon the floor the dullest spirit sees
13. A guitar-ribband and a lady's glove
14. Beside a crumple-leaved tale of love;
15. A tambour-frame, with Venus sleeping there,
16. All finish'd but some ringlets of her hair;
17. A viol, bow-strings torn, cross-wise upon
18. A glorious folio of Anacreon;
19. A skull upon a mat of roses lying,
20. Ink'd purple with a song concerning dying;
21. An hour-glass on the turn, amid the trails
22. Of passion-flower; -- just in time there sails
23. A cloud across the moon, -- the lights bring in!
24. And see what more my phantasy can win.
25. It is a gorgeous room, but somewhat sad;
26. The draperies are so, as tho' they had
27. Been made for Cleopatra's winding-sheet;
28. And opposite the stedfast eye doth meet
29. A spacious looking-glass, upon whose face,
30. In letters raven-sombre, you may trace
31. Old 'Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin.'
32. Greek busts and statuary have ever been
33. Held, by the finest spirits, fitter far
34. Than vase grotesque and Siamesian jar;
35. Therefore 'tis sure a want of Attic taste
36. That I should rather love a Gothic waste
37. Of eyesight on cinque-coloured potter's clay,
38. Than on the marble fairness of old Greece.
39. My table-coverlits of Jason's fleece
40. And black Numidian sheep-wool should be wrought,
41. Gold, black, and heavy, from the Lama brought.
42. My ebon sofas should delicious be
43. With down from Leda's cygnet progeny.
44. My pictures all Salvator's, save a few
45. Of Titian's portraiture, and one, though new,
46. Of Haydon's in its fresh magnificence.
47. My wine -- O good! 'tis here at my desire,
48. And I must sit to supper with my friar.
