1. Mother of Hermes! and still youthful Maia!
2. May I sing to thee
3. As thou wast hymned on the shores of Baiae?
4. Or may I woo thee
5. In earlier Sicilian? or thy smiles
6. Seek as they once were sought, in Grecian isles,
7. By bards who died content on pleasant sward,
8. Leaving great verse unto a little clan?
9. O give me their old vigour! and unheard
10. Save of the quiet primrose, and the span
11. Of heaven, and few ears,
12. Rounded by thee, my song should die away
13. Content as theirs,
14. Rich in the simple worship of a day.
