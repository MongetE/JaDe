1. As Hermes once took to his feathers light
2. When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon'd and slept,
3. So on a Delphic reed my idle spright
4. So play'd, so charm'd, so conquer'd, so bereft
5. The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes,
6. And, seeing it asleep, so fled away:
7. Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,
8. Nor unto Tempe where Jove griev'd a day;
9. But to that second circle of sad hell,
10. Where 'mid the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw
11. Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell
12. Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,
13. Pale were the lips I kiss'd, and fair the form
14. I floated with, about that melancholy storm.
