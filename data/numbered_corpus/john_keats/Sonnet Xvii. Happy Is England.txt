1. Happy is England! I could be content
2. To see no other verdure than its own;
3. To feel no other breezes than are blown
4. Through its tall woods with high romances blent:
5. Yet do I sometimes feel a languishment
6. For skies Italian, and an inward groan
7. To sit upon an Alp as on a throne,
8. And half forget what world or worldling meant.
9. Happy is England, sweet her artless daughters;
10. Enough their simple loveliness for me,
11. Enough their whitest arms in silence clinging:
12. Yet do I often warmly burn to see
13. Beauties of deeper glance, and hear their singing,
14. And float with them about the summer waters.
