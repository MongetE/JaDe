1. I
2. You say you love ; but with a voice
3. Chaster than a nun's, who singeth
4. The soft Vespers to herself
5. While the chime-bell ringeth-
6. O love me truly!
7. II
8. You say you love; but with a smile
9. Cold as sunrise in September,
10. As you were Saint Cupid 's nun,
11. And kept his weeks of Ember.
12. O love me truly!
13. III
14. You say you love but then your lips
15. Coral tinted teach no blisses,
16. More than coral in the sea
17. They never pout for kisses
18. O love me truly!
19. IV
20. You say you love ; but then your hand
21. No soft squeeze for squeeze returneth,
22. It is like a statue's dead
23. While mine to passion burneth
24. O love me truly!
25. V
26. O breathe a word or two of fire!
27. Smile, as if those words should bum me,
28. Squeeze as lovers should O kiss
29. And in thy heart inurn me!
30. O love me truly!
