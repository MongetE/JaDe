1. Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port,
2. Away with old Hock and madeira,
3. Too earthly ye are for my sport;
4. There's a beverage brighter and clearer.
5. Instead of a piriful rummer,
6. My wine overbrims a whole summer;
7. My bowl is the sky,
8. And I drink at my eye,
9. Till I feel in the brain
10. A Delphian pain -
11. Then follow, my Caius! then follow:
12. On the green of the hill
13. We will drink our fill
14. Of golden sunshine,
15. Till our brains intertwine
16. With the glory and grace of Apollo!
17. God of the Meridian,
18. And of the East and West,
19. To thee my soul is flown,
20. And my body is earthward press'd. -
21. It is an awful mission,
22. A terrible division;
23. And leaves a gulph austere
24. To be fill'd with worldly fear.
25. Aye, when the soul is fled
26. To high above our head,
27. Affrighted do we gaze
28. After its airy maze,
29. As doth a mother wild,
30. When her young infant child
31. Is in an eagle's claws -
32. And is not this the cause
33. Of madness? - God of Song,
34. Thou bearest me along
35. Through sights I scarce can bear:
36. O let me, let me share
37. With the hot lyre and thee,
38. The staid Philosophy.
39. Temper my lonely hours,
40. And let me see thy bowers
41. More unalarm'd!
