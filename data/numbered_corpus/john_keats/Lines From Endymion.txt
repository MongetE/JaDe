1. A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
2. Its loviliness increases; it will never
3. Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
4. A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
5. Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
6. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
7. A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
8. Spite of despondance, of the inhuman dearth
9. Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
10. Of all the unhealthy and o`er-darkened ways
11. Made for our searching: yes, inspite of all,
12. Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
13. From our dark spirits.
