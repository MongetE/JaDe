1. Souls of Poets dead and gone,
2. What Elysium have ye known,
3. Happy field or mossy cavern,
4. Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?Have ye tippled drink more fine
5. Than mine host's Canary wine?
6. Or are fruits of Paradise
7. Sweeter than those dainty pies
8. Of venison? O generous food!
9. Drest as though bold Robin Hood
10. Would, with his maid Marian,
11. Sup and bowse from horn and can.

12. I have heard that on a day
13. Mine host's sign-board flew away,
14. Nobody knew whither, till
15. An astrologer's old quill
16. To a sheepskin gave the story,
17. Said he saw you in your glory,
18. Underneath a new old sign
19. Sipping beverage divine,
20. And pledging with contented smack
21. The Mermaid in the Zodiac.

22. Souls of Poets dead and gone,
23. What Elysium have ye known,
24. Happy field or mossy cavern,
25. Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?
