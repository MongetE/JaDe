1. When I have fears that I may cease to be
2. Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,
3. Before high-piled books, in charactery,
4. Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;
5. When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,
6. Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
7. And think that I may never live to trace
8. Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;
9. And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
10. That I shall never look upon thee more,
11. Never have relish in the faery power
12. Of unreflecting love; - then on the shore
13. Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
14. Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.
