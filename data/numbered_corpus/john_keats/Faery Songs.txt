1. I.
2. Shed no tear! oh, shed no tear!
3. The flower will bloom another year.
4. Weep no more! oh, weep no more!
5. Young buds sleep in the root's white core.
6. Dry your eyes! oh, dry your eyes!
7. For I was taught in Paradise
8. To ease my breast of melodies,--
9. Shed no tear.

10. Overhead! look overhead!
11. 'Mong the blossoms white and red--
12. Look up, look up! I flutter now
13. On this fresh pomegranate bough.
14. See me! 'tis this silvery bill
15. Ever cures the good man's ill.
16. Shed no tear! oh, shed no tear!
17. The flower will bloom another year.
18. Adieu, adieu -- I fly -- adieu!
19. I vanish in the heavenâ€™s blue,--
20. Adieu, adieu!

21. II.
22. Ah! woe is me! poor silver-wing!
23. That I must chant thy lady's dirge,
24. And death to this fair haunt of spring,
25. Of melody, and streams of flowery verge,--
26. Poor silver-wing! ah! woe is me!
27. That I must see
28. These blossoms snow upon thy lady's pall!
29. Go, pretty page! and in her ear
30. Whisper that the hour is near!
31. Softly tell her not to fear
32. Such calm favonian burial!
33. Go, pretty page! and soothly tell,--
34. The blossoms hang by a melting spell,
35. And fall they must, ere a star wink thrice
36. Upon her closed eyes,
37. That now in vain are weeping their last tears,
38. At sweet life leaving, and these arbours green,--
39. Rich dowry from the Spirit of the Spheres,
40. Alas! poor Queen!
