3. Or I shall think you knowing;
4. And if you smile the blushing while,
5. Then maidenheads are going.

7. There's a blush for want, and a blush for shan't,
8. And a blush for having done it;
9. There's a blush for thought, and a blush for nought,
10. And a blush for just begun it.

12. O sigh not so! O sigh not so!
13. For it sounds of Eve's sweet pippin;
14. By these loosen'd lips you have tasted the pips
15. And fought in an amorous nipping.

17. Will you play once more at nice-cut-core,
18. For it only will last our youth out,
19. And we have the prime of the kissing time,
20. We have not one sweet tooth out.

21. 5.
22. There's a sigh for aye, and a sigh for nay,
23. And a sigh for 'I can't bear it!'
24. O what can be done, shall we stay or run?
25. O cut the sweet apple and share it!
