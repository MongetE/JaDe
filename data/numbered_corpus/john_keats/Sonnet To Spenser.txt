1. Spenser! a jealous honourer of thine,
2. A forester deep in thy midmost trees,
3. Did last eve ask my promise to refine
4. Some English that might strive thine ear to please.
5. But Elfin Poet 'tis impossible
6. For an inhabitant of wintry earth
7. To rise like Phoebus with a golden quill
8. Fire-wing'd and make a morning in his mirth.
9. It is impossible to escape from toil
10. O' the sudden and receive thy spiriting:
11. The flower must drink the nature of the soil
12. Before it can put forth its blossoming:
13. Be with me in the summer days, and I
14. Will for thine honour and his pleasure try.
