1. Brother belov'd if health shall smile again,
2. Upon this wasted form and fever'd cheek:
3. If e'er returning vigour bid these weak
4. And languid limbs their gladsome strength regain,
5. Well may thy brow the placid glow retain
6. Of sweet content and thy pleas'd eye may speak
7. The conscious self applause, but should I seek
8. To utter what this heart can feel, Ah! vain
9. Were the attempt! Yet kindest friends while o'er
10. My couch ye bend, and watch with tenderness
11. The being whom your cares could e'en restore,
12. From the cold grasp of Death, say can you guess
13. The feelings which these lips can ne'er express;
14. Feelings, deep fix'd in grateful memory's store.
