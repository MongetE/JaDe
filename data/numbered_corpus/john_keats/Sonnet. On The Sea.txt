1. It keeps eternal whisperings around
2. Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell
3. Gluts twice ten thousand caverns, till the spell
4. Of Hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound.
5. Often 'tis in such gentle temper found
6. That scarcely will the very smallest shell
7. Be mov'd for days from whence it sometime fell,
8. When last the winds of heaven were unbound.
9. Oh ye! who have your eye-balls vex'd and tir'd,
10. Feast them upon the wideness of the Sea;
11. Oh ye! whose ears are dinn'd with uproar rude,
12. Or fed too much with cloying melody,--
13. Sit ye near some old cavern's mouth, and brood
14. Until ye start, as if the sea-nymphs quir'd!
