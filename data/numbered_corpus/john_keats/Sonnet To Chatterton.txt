1. O Chatterton! how very sad thy fate!
2. Dear child of sorrow -- son of misery!
3. How soon the film of death obscur'd that eye,
4. Whence Genius mildly falsh'd, and high debate.
5. How soon that voice, majestic and elate,
6. Melted in dying numbers! Oh! how nigh
7. Was night to thy fair morning. Thou didst die
8. A half-blown flow'ret which cold blasts amate.
9. But this is past: thou art among the stars
10. Of highest heaven: to the rolling spheres
11. Thou sweetly singest: nought thy hymning mars,
12. Above the ingrate world and human fears.
13. On earth the good man base detraction bars
14. From thy fair name, and waters it with tears.
