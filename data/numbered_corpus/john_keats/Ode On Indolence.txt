1. ONE morn before me were three figures seen,
2. I With bowed necks, and joined hands, side-faced;
3. And one behind the other stepp'd serene,
4. In placid sandals, and in white robes graced;
5. They pass'd, like figures on a marble urn,
6. When shifted round to see the other side;
7. They came again; as when the urn once more
8. Is shifted round, the first seen shades return;
9. And they were strange to me, as may betide
10. With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.

11. How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not?
12. How came ye muffled in so hush a masque?
13. Was it a silent deep-disguised plot
14. To steal away, and leave without a task
15. My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour;
16. The blissful cloud of summer-indolence
17. Benumb'd my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;
18. Pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower:
19. O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense
20. Unhaunted quite of all but---nothingness?

21. A third time came they by;---alas! wherefore?
22. My sleep had been embroider'd with dim dreams;
23. My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er
24. With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams:
25. The morn was clouded, but no shower fell,
26. Tho' in her lids hung the sweet tears of May;
27. The open casement press'd a new-leav'd vine,
28. Let in the budding warmth and throstle's lay;
29. O Shadows! 'twas a time to bid farewell!
30. Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.

31. A third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd
32. Each one the face a moment whiles to me;
33. Then faded, and to follow them I burn'd
34. And ached for wings, because I knew the three;
35. The first was a fair maid, and Love her name;
36. The second was Ambition, pale of cheek,
37. And ever watchful with fatigued eye;
38. The last, whom I love more, the more of blame
39. Is heap'd upon her, maiden most unmeek,---
40. I knew to be my demon Poesy.

41. They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings:
42. O folly! What is Love! and where is it?
43. And for that poor Ambition---it springs
44. From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;
45. For Poesy!---no,---she has not a joy,---
46. At least for me,---so sweet as drowsy noons,
47. And evenings steep'd in honied indolence;
48. O, for an age so shelter'd from annoy,
49. That I may never know how change the moons,
50. Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!

51. So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise
52. My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass;
53. For I would not be dieted with praise,
54. A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!
55. Fade sofdy from my eyes, and be once more
56. In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn;
57. Farewell! I yet have visions for the night,
58. And for the day faint visions there is store;
59. Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright,
60. Into the clouds, and never more return!
