1. Full many a dreary hour have I past,
2. My brain bewildered, and my mind o'ercast
3. With heaviness; in seasons when I've thought
4. No spherey strains by me could e'er be caught
5. From the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze
6. On the far depth where sheeted lightning plays;
7. Or, on the wavy grass outstretched supinely,
8. Pry 'mong the stars, to strive to think divinely:
9. That I should never hear Apollo's song,
10. Though feathery clouds were floating all along
11. The purple west, and, two bright streaks between,
12. The golden lyre itself were dimly seen:
13. That the still murmur of the honey bee
14. Would never teach a rural song to me:
15. That the bright glance from beauty's eyelids slanting
16. Would never make a lay of mine enchanting,
17. Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold
18. Some tale of love and arms in time of old.

19. But there are times, when those that love the bay,
20. Fly from all sorrowing far, far away;
21. A sudden glow comes on them, nought they see
22. In water, earth, or air, but poesy.
23. It has been said, dear George, and true I hold it,
24. (For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it,)
25. That when a Poet is in such a trance,
26. In air her sees white coursers paw, and prance,
27. Bestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel,
28. Who at each other tilt in playful quarrel,
29. And what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call,
30. Is the swift opening of their wide portal,
31. When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear,
32. Whose tones reach nought on earth but Poet's ear.
33. When these enchanted portals open wide,
34. And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide,
35. The Poet's eye can reach those golden halls,
36. And view the glory of their festivals:
37. Their ladies fair, that in the distance seem
38. Fit for the silv'ring of a seraph's dream;
39. Their rich brimmed goblets, that incessant run
40. Like the bright spots that move about the sun;
41. And, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar
42. Pours with the lustre of a falling star.
43. Yet further off, are dimly seen their bowers,
44. Of which, no mortal eye can reach the flowers;
45. And 'tis right just, for well Apollo knows
46. 'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose.
47. All that's revealed from that far seat of blisses
48. Is the clear fountains' interchanging kisses,
49. As gracefully descending, light and thin,
50. Like silver streaks across a dolphin's fin,
51. When he upswimmeth from the coral caves,
52. And sports with half his tail above the waves.

53. These wonders strange he sees, and many more,
54. Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore.
55. Should he upon an evening ramble fare
56. With forehead to the soothing breezes bare,
57. Would he nought see but the dark, silent blue
58. With all its diamonds trembling through and through?
59. Or the coy moon, when in the waviness
60. Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress,
61. And staidly paces higher up, and higher,
62. Like a sweet nun in holy-day attire?
63. Ah, yes! much more would start into his sight—
64. The revelries and mysteries of night:
65. And should I ever see them, I will tell you
66. Such tales as needs must with amazement spell you.

67. These are the living pleasures of the bard:
68. But richer far posterity's reward.
69. What does he murmur with his latest breath,
70. While his proud eye looks though the film of death?
71. "What though I leave this dull and earthly mould,
72. Yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold
73. With after times.—The patriot shall feel
74. My stern alarum, and unsheath his steel;
75. Or, in the senate thunder out my numbers
76. To startle princes from their easy slumbers.
77. The sage will mingle with each moral theme
78. My happy thoughts sententious; he will teem
79. With lofty periods when my verses fire him,
80. And then I'll stoop from heaven to inspire him.
81. Lays have I left of such a dear delight
82. That maids will sing them on their bridal night.
83. Gay villagers, upon a morn of May,
84. When they have tired their gentle limbs with play
85. And formed a snowy circle on the grass,
86. And placed in midst of all that lovely lass
87. Who chosen is their queen,—with her fine head
88. Crowned with flowers purple, white, and red:
89. For there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing,
90. Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying:
91. Between her breasts, that never yet felt trouble,
92. A bunch of violets full blown, and double,
93. Serenely sleep:—she from a casket takes
94. A little book,—and then a joy awakes
95. About each youthful heart,—with stifled cries,
96. And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes:
97. For she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;
98. One that I fostered in my youthful years:
99. The pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep,
100. Must ever and anon with silent creep,
101. Lured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest
102. Shall the dear babe, upon its mother's breast,
103. Be lulled with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu!
104. Thy dales, and hills, are fading from my view:
105. Swiftly I mount, upon wide spreading pinions,
106. Far from the narrow bound of thy dominions.
107. Full joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air,
108. That my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair,
109. And warm thy sons!" Ah, my dear friend and brother,
110. Could I, at once, my mad ambition smother,
111. For tasting joys like these, sure I should be
112. Happier, and dearer to society.
113. At times, 'tis true, I've felt relief from pain
114. When some bright thought has darted through my brain:
115. Through all that day I've felt a greater pleasure
116. Than if I'd brought to light a hidden treasure.
117. As to my sonnets, though none else should heed them,
118. I feel delighted, still, that you should read them.
119. Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment,
120. Stretched on the grass at my best loved employment
121. Of scribbling lines for you. These things I thought
122. While, in my face, the freshest breeze I caught.
123. E'en now I'm pillowed on a bed of flowers
124. That crowns a lofty clift, which proudly towers
125. Above the ocean-waves, The stalks, and blades,
126. Chequer my tablet with their quivering shades.
127. On one side is a field of drooping oats,
128. Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats;
129. So pert and useless, that they bring to mind
130. The scarlet coats that pester human-kind.
131. And on the other side, outspread, is seen
132. Ocean's blue mantle streaked with purple, and green.
133. Now 'tis I see a canvassed ship, and now
134. Mark the bright silver curling round her prow.
135. I see the lark dowm-dropping to his nest,
136. And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest;
137. For when no more he spreads his feathers free,
138. His breast is dancing on the restless sea.
139. Now I direct my eyes into the west,
140. Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest:
141. Why westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu!
142. 'Twas but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you!
