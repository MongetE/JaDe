1. Ah! ken ye what I met the day
2. Out oure the Mountains
3. A coming down by craggi[e]s grey
4. An mossie fountains --
5. A[h] goud hair'd Marie yeve I pray
6. Ane minute's guessing --
7. For that I met upon the way
8. Is past expressing.
9. As I stood where a rocky brig
10. A torrent crosses
11. I spied upon a misty rig
12. A troup o' Horses --
13. And as they trotted down the glen
14. I sped to meet them
15. To see if I might know the Men
16. To stop and greet them.
17. First Willie on his sleek mare came
18. At canting gallop --
19. His long hair rustled like a flame
20. On board a shallop.
21. Then came his brother Rab and then
22. Young Peggy's Mither
23. And Peggy too -- adown the glen
24. They went togither --
25. I saw her wrappit in her hood
26. Fra wind and raining --
27. Her cheek was flush wi' timid blood
28. 'Twixt growth and waning --
29. She turn'd her dazed head full oft
30. For there her Brithers
31. Came riding with her Bridegroom soft
32. And mony ithers.
33. Young Tam came up an' eyed me quick
34. With reddened cheek --
35. Braw Tam was daffed like a chick --
36. He coud na speak --
37. Ah Marie they are all gane hame
38. Through blustering weather
39. An' every heart is full on flame
40. Ah! Marie they are all gone hame
41. Fra happy wedding,
42. Whilst I -- Ah is it not a shame?
43. Sad tears am shedding.
