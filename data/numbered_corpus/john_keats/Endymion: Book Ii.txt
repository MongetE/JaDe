1. O Sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!
2. All records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,
3. And shadowy, through the mist of passed years:
4. For others, good or bad, hatred and tears
5. Have become indolent; but touching thine,
6. One sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,
7. One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.
8. The woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,
9. Stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,
10. Struggling, and blood, and shrieks--all dimly fades
11. Into some backward corner of the brain;
12. Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain
13. The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.
14. Hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!
15. Swart planet in the universe of deeds!
16. Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds
17. Along the pebbled shore of memory!
18. Many old rotten-timber'd boats there be
19. Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified
20. To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,
21. And golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.
22. But wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly
23. About the great Athenian admiral's mast?
24. What care, though striding Alexander past
25. The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?
26. Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers
27. The glutted Cyclops, what care?--Juliet leaning
28. Amid her window-flowers,--sighing,--weaning
29. Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,
30. Doth more avail than these: the silver flow
31. Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,
32. Fair Pastorella in the bandit's den,
33. Are things to brood on with more ardency
34. Than the death-day of empires. Fearfully
35. Must such conviction come upon his head,
36. Who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,
37. Without one muse's smile, or kind behest,
38. The path of love and poesy. But rest,
39. In chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear
40. Than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear
41. Love's standard on the battlements of song.
42. So once more days and nights aid me along,
43. Like legion'd soldiers.

44. Brain-sick shepherd-prince,
45. What promise hast thou faithful guarded since
46. The day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows
47. Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?
48. Alas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,
49. Has he been wandering in uncertain ways:
50. Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;
51. Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes
52. Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,
53. Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.
54. Now he is sitting by a shady spring,
55. And elbow-deep with feverous fingering
56. Stems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree
57. Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see
58. A bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now
59. He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!
60. It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;
61. And, in the middle, there is softly pight
62. A golden butterfly; upon whose wings
63. There must be surely character'd strange things,
64. For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.

65. Lightly this little herald flew aloft,
66. Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:
67. Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands
68. His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies
69. Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.
70. It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;
71. And like a new-born spirit did he pass
72. Through the green evening quiet in the sun,
73. O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,
74. Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams
75. The summer time away. One track unseams
76. A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue
77. Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,
78. He sinks adown a solitary glen,
79. Where there was never sound of mortal men,
80. Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences
81. Melting to silence, when upon the breeze
82. Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,
83. To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet
84. Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,
85. Until it reached a splashing fountain's side
86. That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd
87. Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,
88. And, downward, suddenly began to dip,
89. As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip
90. The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch
91. Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch
92. Even with mealy gold the waters clear.
93. But, at that very touch, to disappear
94. So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,
95. Endymion sought around, and shook each bed
96. Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung
97. Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,
98. What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?
99. It was a nymph uprisen to the breast
100. In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood
101. 'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.
102. To him her dripping hand she softly kist,
103. And anxiously began to plait and twist
104. Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: "Youth!
105. Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,
106. The bitterness of love: too long indeed,
107. Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed
108. Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer
109. All the bright riches of my crystal coffer
110. To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,
111. Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,
112. Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;
113. Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws
114. A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands
115. Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands
116. By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,
117. My charming rod, my potent river spells;
118. Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup
119. Meander gave me,--for I bubbled up
120. To fainting creatures in a desert wild.
121. But woe is me, I am but as a child
122. To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,
123. Is, that I pity thee; that on this day
124. I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far
125. In other regions, past the scanty bar
126. To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en
127. From every wasting sigh, from every pain,
128. Into the gentle bosom of thy love.
129. Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:
130. But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!
131. I have a ditty for my hollow cell."

132. Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,
133. Who brooded o'er the water in amaze:
134. The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool
135. Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,
136. Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,
137. And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill
138. Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,
139. Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr
140. Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;
141. And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown
142. Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,
143. Thus breath'd he to himself: "Whoso encamps
144. To take a fancied city of delight,
145. O what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,
146. After long toil and travelling, to miss
147. The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:
148. Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;
149. Another city doth he set about,
150. Free from the smallest pebble-bead of doubt
151. That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:
152. Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,
153. And onward to another city speeds.
154. But this is human life: the war, the deeds,
155. The disappointment, the anxiety,
156. Imagination's struggles, far and nigh,
157. All human; bearing in themselves this good,
158. That they are sill the air, the subtle food,
159. To make us feel existence, and to shew
160. How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,
161. Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,
162. There is no depth to strike in: I can see
163. Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand
164. Upon a misty, jutting head of land--
165. Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,
166. When mad Eurydice is listening to 't;
167. I'd rather stand upon this misty peak,
168. With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,
169. But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,
170. Than be--I care not what. O meekest dove
171. Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!
172. From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,
173. Glance but one little beam of temper'd light
174. Into my bosom, that the dreadful might
175. And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!
176. Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,
177. Would give a pang to jealous misery,
178. Worse than the torment's self: but rather tie
179. Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out
180. My love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout
181. Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,
182. Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow
183. Not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.
184. O be propitious, nor severely deem
185. My madness impious; for, by all the stars
186. That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars
187. That kept my spirit in are burst--that I
188. Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!
189. How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!
190. How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep
191. Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,
192. How lithe! When this thy chariot attains
193. Is airy goal, haply some bower veils
194. Those twilight eyes? Those eyes!--my spirit fails--
195. Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air
196. Will gulph me--help!"--At this with madden'd stare,
197. And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;
198. Like old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,
199. Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.
200. And, but from the deep cavern there was borne
201. A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;
202. Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan
203. Had more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: "Descend,
204. Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend
205. Into the sparry hollows of the world!
206. Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd
207. As from thy threshold, day by day hast been
208. A little lower than the chilly sheen
209. Of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms
210. Into the deadening ether that still charms
211. Their marble being: now, as deep profound
212. As those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd
213. With immortality, who fears to follow
214. Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,
215. The silent mysteries of earth, descend!"

216. He heard but the last words, nor could contend
217. One moment in reflection: for he fled
218. Into the fearful deep, to hide his head
219. From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.

220. 'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;
221. Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite
222. To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,
223. The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,
224. But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;
225. A dusky empire and its diadems;
226. One faint eternal eventide of gems.
227. Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,
228. Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,
229. With all its lines abrupt and angular:
230. Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,
231. Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,
232. Like Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof
233. Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,
234. It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss
235. Fancy into belief: anon it leads
236. Through winding passages, where sameness breeds
237. Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;
238. Whether to silver grots, or giant range
239. Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge
240. Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge
241. Now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath
242. Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth
243. A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come
244. But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb
245. His bosom grew, when first he, far away,
246. Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray
247. Old darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun
248. Uprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun
249. Came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,
250. He saw not fiercer wonders--past the wit
251. Of any spirit to tell, but one of those
252. Who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,
253. Will be its high remembrancers: who they?
254. The mighty ones who have made eternal day
255. For Greece and England. While astonishment
256. With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went
257. Into a marble gallery, passing through
258. A mimic temple, so complete and true
259. In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd
260. To search it inwards, whence far off appear'd,
261. Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,
262. And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,
263. A quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,
264. The youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye
265. Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old.
266. And when, more near against the marble cold
267. He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread
268. All courts and passages, where silence dead
269. Rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:
270. And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint
271. Himself with every mystery, and awe;
272. Till, weary, he sat down before the maw
273. Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim
274. To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.
275. There, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,
276. And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore
277. The journey homeward to habitual self!
278. A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,
279. Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,
280. Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,
281. Into the bosom of a hated thing.

282. What misery most drowningly doth sing
283. In lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught
284. The goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,
285. The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!
286. He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow
287. Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild
288. In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,
289. The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,
290. Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest
291. Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;
292. But far from such companionship to wear
293. An unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,
294. Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,
295. Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?
296. "No!" exclaimed he, "why should I tarry here?"
297. No! loudly echoed times innumerable.
298. At which he straightway started, and 'gan tell
299. His paces back into the temple's chief;
300. Warming and glowing strong in the belief
301. Of help from Dian: so that when again
302. He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,
303. Moving more near the while. "O Haunter chaste
304. Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,
305. Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen
306. Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,
307. What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?
308. Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos
309. Of thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree
310. Glimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,
311. 'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste
312. Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste
313. Thy loveliness in dismal elements;
314. But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,
315. There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee
316. It feels Elysian, how rich to me,
317. An exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!
318. Within my breast there lives a choking flame--
319. O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!
320. A homeward fever parches up my tongue--
321. O let me slake it at the running springs!
322. Upon my ear a noisy nothing rings--
323. O let me once more hear the linnet's note!
324. Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float--
325. O let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!
326. Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?
327. O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!
328. Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?
329. O think how this dry palate would rejoice!
330. If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,
331. Oh think how I should love a bed of flowers!--
332. Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!
333. Deliver me from this rapacious deep!"

334. Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap
335. His destiny, alert he stood: but when
336. Obstinate silence came heavily again,
337. Feeling about for its old couch of space
338. And airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face
339. Desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.
340. But 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill
341. To its old channel, or a swollen tide
342. To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,
343. And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns
344. Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns
345. Itself, and strives its own delights to hide--
346. Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride
347. In a long whispering birth enchanted grew
348. Before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew
349. Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,
350. Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,
351. Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.

352. Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,
353. Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;
354. So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes
355. One moment with his hand among the sweets:
356. Onward he goes--he stops--his bosom beats
357. As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm
358. Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,
359. This sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:
360. For it came more softly than the east could blow
361. Arion's magic to the Atlantic isles;
362. Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles
363. Of thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre
364. To seas Ionian and Tyrian.

365. O did he ever live, that lonely man,
366. Who lov'd--and music slew not? 'Tis the pest
367. Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;
368. That things of delicate and tenderest worth
369. Are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,
370. By one consuming flame: it doth immerse
371. And suffocate true blessings in a curse.
372. Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,
373. Is miserable. 'Twas even so with this
374. Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;
375. First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,
376. Vanish'd in elemental passion.

377. And down some swart abysm he had gone,
378. Had not a heavenly guide benignant led
379. To where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head
380. Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again
381. Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain
382. Over a bower, where little space he stood;
383. For as the sunset peeps into a wood
384. So saw he panting light, and towards it went
385. Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!
386. Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,
387. Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.

388. After a thousand mazes overgone,
389. At last, with sudden step, he came upon
390. A chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,
391. Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,
392. And more of beautiful and strange beside:
393. For on a silken couch of rosy pride,
394. In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth
395. Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,
396. Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:
397. And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,
398. Or ripe October's faded marigolds,
399. Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds--
400. Not hiding up an Apollonian curve
401. Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve
402. Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;
403. But rather, giving them to the filled sight
404. Officiously. Sideway his face repos'd
405. On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,
406. By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth
407. To slumbery pout; just as the morning south
408. Disparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,
409. Four lily stalks did their white honours wed
410. To make a coronal; and round him grew
411. All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,
412. Together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:
413. The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,
414. Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,
415. Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;
416. Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;
417. The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;
418. And virgin's bower, trailing airily;
419. With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,
420. Stood serene Cupids watching silently.
421. One, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,
422. Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;
423. And, ever and anon, uprose to look
424. At the youth's slumber; while another took
425. A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,
426. And shook it on his hair; another flew
427. In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise
428. Rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.

429. At these enchantments, and yet many more,
430. The breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;
431. Until, impatient in embarrassment,
432. He forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went
433. To that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,
434. Smiling, thus whisper'd: "Though from upper day
435. Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here
436. Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!
437. For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,
438. When some ethereal and high-favouring donor
439. Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;
440. As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence
441. Was I in no wise startled. So recline
442. Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,
443. Alive with sparkles--never, I aver,
444. Since Ariadne was a vintager,
445. So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,
446. Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears
447. Were high about Pomona: here is cream,
448. Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;
449. Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd
450. For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd
451. By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums
452. Ready to melt between an infant's gums:
453. And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,
454. In starlight, by the three Hesperides.
455. Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know
456. Of all these things around us." He did so,
457. Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;
458. And thus: "I need not any hearing tire
459. By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd
460. For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind
461. Him all in all unto her doting self.
462. Who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,
463. He was content to let her amorous plea
464. Faint through his careless arms; content to see
465. An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;
466. Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,
467. When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,
468. Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born
469. Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes
470. Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs
471. Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.
472. Hush! no exclaim--yet, justly mightst thou call
473. Curses upon his head.--I was half glad,
474. But my poor mistress went distract and mad,
475. When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew
476. To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew
477. Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;
478. Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd
479. Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,
480. That same Adonis, safe in the privacy
481. Of this still region all his winter-sleep.
482. Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep
483. Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower
484. Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,
485. Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:
486. The which she fills with visions, and doth dress
487. In all this quiet luxury; and hath set
488. Us young immortals, without any let,
489. To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,
490. Even to a moment's filling up, and fast
491. She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through
492. The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew
493. Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.
494. Look! how those winged listeners all this while
495. Stand anxious: see! behold!"--This clamant word
496. Broke through the careful silence; for they heard
497. A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd
498. Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,
499. The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh
500. Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually
501. Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum
502. Of sudden voices, echoing, "Come! come!
503. Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd
504. Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd
505. Full soothingly to every nested finch:
506. Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch
507. To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!"
508. At this, from every side they hurried in,
509. Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,
510. And doubling overhead their little fists
511. In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:
512. For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive
513. In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,
514. So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air
515. Odorous and enlivening; making all
516. To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call
517. For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green
518. Disparted, and far upward could be seen
519. Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,
520. Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,
521. Spun off a drizzling dew,--which falling chill
522. On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still
523. Nestle and turn uneasily about.
524. Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,
525. And silken traces lighten'd in descent;
526. And soon, returning from love's banishment,
527. Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:
528. Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd
529. A tumult to his heart, and a new life
530. Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,
531. But for her comforting! unhappy sight,
532. But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write
533. Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse
534. To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.

535. O it has ruffled every spirit there,
536. Saving love's self, who stands superb to share
537. The general gladness: awfully he stands;
538. A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;
539. No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;
540. His quiver is mysterious, none can know
541. What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes
542. There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:
543. A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who
544. Look full upon it feel anon the blue
545. Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.
546. Endymion feels it, and no more controls
547. The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,
548. He had begun a plaining of his woe.
549. But Venus, bending forward, said: "My child,
550. Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild
551. With love--he--but alas! too well I see
552. Thou know'st the deepness of his misery.
553. Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,
554. That when through heavy hours I used to rue
555. The endless sleep of this new-born Adon',
556. This stranger ay I pitied. For upon
557. A dreary morning once I fled away
558. Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray
559. For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd
560. Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,
561. Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,
562. I saw this youth as he despairing stood:
563. Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind:
564. Those same full fringed lids a constant blind
565. Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw
566. Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though
567. Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,
568. Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd
569. Some fair immortal, and that his embrace
570. Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace
571. Of this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,
572. And find it is the vainest thing to seek;
573. And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.
574. Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:
575. So still obey the guiding hand that fends
576. Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.
577. 'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;
578. And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam
579. Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!
580. Here must we leave thee."--At these words up flew
581. The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,
582. Up went the hum celestial. High afar
583. The Latmian saw them minish into nought;
584. And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught
585. A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.
586. When all was darkened, with Etnean throe
587. The earth clos'd--gave a solitary moan--
588. And left him once again in twilight lone.

589. He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,
590. For all those visions were o'ergone, and past,
591. And he in loneliness: he felt assur'd
592. Of happy times, when all he had endur'd
593. Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.
594. So, with unusual gladness, on he hies
595. Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,
596. Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,
597. Black polish'd porticos of awful shade,
598. And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,
599. Leading afar past wild magnificence,
600. Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence
601. Stretching across a void, then guiding o'er
602. Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,
603. Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;
604. Then heighten'd just above the silvery heads
605. Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash
606. The waters with his spear; but at the splash,
607. Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose
608. Sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose
609. His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round
610. Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,
611. Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells
612. Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells
613. On this delight; for, every minute's space,
614. The streams with changed magic interlace:
615. Sometimes like delicatest lattices,
616. Cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,
617. Moving about as in a gentle wind,
618. Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,
619. Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,
620. Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries
621. Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.
622. Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;
623. And then the water, into stubborn streams
624. Collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,
625. Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,
626. Of those dusk places in times far aloof
627. Cathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel
628. To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,
629. And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,
630. Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,
631. Blackening on every side, and overhead
632. A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread
633. With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,
634. The solitary felt a hurried change
635. Working within him into something dreary,--
636. Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,
637. And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.
638. But he revives at once: for who beholds
639. New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?
640. Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,
641. Came mother Cybele! alone--alone--
642. In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown
643. About her majesty, and front death-pale,
644. With turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale
645. The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,
646. Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws
647. Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails
648. Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails
649. This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away
650. In another gloomy arch.

651. Wherefore delay,
652. Young traveller, in such a mournful place?
653. Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace
654. The diamond path? And does it indeed end
655. Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend
656. Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne
657. Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;
658. Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;
659. To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost
660. Towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,
661. Without one impious word, himself he flings,
662. Committed to the darkness and the gloom:
663. Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,
664. Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell
665. Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,
666. And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,
667. Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd
668. So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd
669. Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd
670. With airs delicious. In the greenest nook
671. The eagle landed him, and farewel took.

672. It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown
673. With golden moss. His every sense had grown
674. Ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head
675. Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread
676. Was Hesperean; to his capable ears
677. Silence was music from the holy spheres;
678. A dewy luxury was in his eyes;
679. The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs
680. And stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell
681. He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell
682. Of sudden exaltation: but, "Alas!
683. Said he, "will all this gush of feeling pass
684. Away in solitude? And must they wane,
685. Like melodies upon a sandy plain,
686. Without an echo? Then shall I be left
687. So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!
688. Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,
689. My breath of life, where art thou? High above,
690. Dancing before the morning gates of heaven?
691. Or keeping watch among those starry seven,
692. Old Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,
693. One of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?
694. Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,
695. Weaving a coronal of tender scions
696. For very idleness? Where'er thou art,
697. Methinks it now is at my will to start
698. Into thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,
699. And snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main
700. To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off
701. From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff
702. Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.
703. No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives
704. Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.
705. O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee
706. To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!
707. Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil
708. For some few hours the coming solitude."

709. Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued
710. With power to dream deliciously; so wound
711. Through a dim passage, searching till he found
712. The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where
713. He threw himself, and just into the air
714. Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!
715. A naked waist: "Fair Cupid, whence is this?"
716. A well-known voice sigh'd, "Sweetest, here am I!"
717. At which soft ravishment, with doating cry
718. They trembled to each other.--Helicon!
719. O fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!
720. That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er
721. These sorry pages; then the verse would soar
722. And sing above this gentle pair, like lark
723. Over his nested young: but all is dark
724. Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount
725. Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count
726. Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll
727. Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll
728. Is in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes
729. Have seen a new tinge in the western skies:
730. The world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,
731. Although the sun of poesy is set,
732. These lovers did embrace, and we must weep
733. That there is no old power left to steep
734. A quill immortal in their joyous tears.
735. Long time in silence did their anxious fears
736. Question that thus it was; long time they lay
737. Fondling and kissing every doubt away;
738. Long time ere soft caressing sobs began
739. To mellow into words, and then there ran
740. Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.
741. "O known Unknown! from whom my being sips
742. Such darling essence, wherefore may I not
743. Be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot
744. Pillow my chin for ever? ever press
745. These toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?
746. Why not for ever and for ever feel
747. That breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal
748. Away from me again, indeed, indeed--
749. Thou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed
750. My lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!
751. Is--is it to be so? No! Who will dare
752. To pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,
753. Full well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still
754. Let me entwine thee surer, surer--now
755. How can we part? Elysium! who art thou?
756. Who, that thou canst not be for ever here,
757. Or lift me with thee to some starry sphere?
758. Enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,
759. By the most soft completion of thy face,
760. Those lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,
761. And by these tenderest, milky sovereignties--
762. These tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,
763. The passion"--------"O lov'd Ida the divine!
764. Endymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!
765. His soul will 'scape us--O felicity!
766. How he does love me! His poor temples beat
767. To the very tune of love--how sweet, sweet, sweet.
768. Revive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;
769. Revive, or these soft hours will hurry by
770. In tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell
771. Affright this lethargy! I cannot quell
772. Its heavy pressure, and will press at least
773. My lips to thine, that they may richly feast
774. Until we taste the life of love again.
775. What! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!
776. I love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;
777. And so long absence from thee doth bereave
778. My soul of any rest: yet must I hence:
779. Yet, can I not to starry eminence
780. Uplift thee; nor for very shame can own
781. Myself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan
782. Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,
783. And I must blush in heaven. O that I
784. Had done it already; that the dreadful smiles
785. At my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,
786. Had waned from Olympus' solemn height,
787. And from all serious Gods; that our delight
788. Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!
789. And wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone
790. For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:
791. Yet must I be a coward!--Horror rushes
792. Too palpable before me--the sad look
793. Of Jove--Minerva's start--no bosom shook
794. With awe of purity--no Cupid pinion
795. In reverence veiled--my crystaline dominion
796. Half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!
797. But what is this to love? O I could fly
798. With thee into the ken of heavenly powers,
799. So thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,
800. Press me so sweetly. Now I swear at once
801. That I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce--
802. Perhaps her love like mine is but unknown--
803. O I do think that I have been alone
804. In chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,
805. While every eve saw me my hair uptying
806. With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,
807. I was as vague as solitary dove,
808. Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss--
809. Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,
810. An immortality of passion's thine:
811. Ere long I will exalt thee to the shine
812. Of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade
813. Ourselves whole summers by a river glade;
814. And I will tell thee stories of the sky,
815. And breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.
816. My happy love will overwing all bounds!
817. O let me melt into thee; let the sounds
818. Of our close voices marry at their birth;
819. Let us entwine hoveringly--O dearth
820. Of human words! roughness of mortal speech!
821. Lispings empyrean will I sometime teach
822. Thine honied tongue--lute-breathings, which I gasp
823. To have thee understand, now while I clasp
824. Thee thus, and weep for fondness--I am pain'd,
825. Endymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd
826. In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?"--
827. Hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife
828. Melted into a languor. He return'd
829. Entranced vows and tears.

830. Ye who have yearn'd
831. With too much passion, will here stay and pity,
832. For the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty
833. Not of these days, but long ago 'twas told
834. By a cavern wind unto a forest old;
835. And then the forest told it in a dream
836. To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam
837. A poet caught as he was journeying
838. To Phoebus' shrine; and in it he did fling
839. His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,
840. And after, straight in that inspired place
841. He sang the story up into the air,
842. Giving it universal freedom. There
843. Has it been ever sounding for those ears
844. Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers
845. Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it
846. Must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:
847. For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,
848. Made fiercer by a fear lest any part
849. Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.
850. As much as here is penn'd doth always find
851. A resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;
852. Anon the strange voice is upon the wane--
853. And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,
854. That the fair visitant at last unwound
855. Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.--
856. Thus the tradition of the gusty deep.

857. Now turn we to our former chroniclers.--
858. Endymion awoke, that grief of hers
859. Sweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd
860. How lone he was once more, and sadly press'd
861. His empty arms together, hung his head,
862. And most forlorn upon that widow'd bed
863. Sat silently. Love's madness he had known:
864. Often with more than tortured lion's groan
865. Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage
866. Had pass'd away: no longer did he wage
867. A rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.
868. No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:
869. The lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd
870. Forgot all violence, and but commun'd
871. With melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd
872. Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love
873. Henceforth was dove-like.--Loth was he to move
874. From the imprinted couch, and when he did,
875. 'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid
876. In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd
877. Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd
878. Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen
879. Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean
880. Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last
881. It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,
882. O'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,
883. And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,
884. Of every shape and size, even to the bulk
885. In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk
886. Against an endless storm. Moreover too,
887. Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,
888. Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder
889. Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder
890. On all his life: his youth, up to the day
891. When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,
892. He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look
893. Of his white palace in wild forest nook,
894. And all the revels he had lorded there:
895. Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,
896. With every friend and fellow-woodlander--
897. Pass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur
898. Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans
899. To nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:
900. That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:
901. His sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,
902. Until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:
903. Then all its buried magic, till it flush'd
904. High with excessive love. "And now," thought he,
905. "How long must I remain in jeopardy
906. Of blank amazements that amaze no more?
907. Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core
908. All other depths are shallow: essences,
909. Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,
910. Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,
911. And make my branches lift a golden fruit
912. Into the bloom of heaven: other light,
913. Though it be quick and sharp enough to blight
914. The Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,
915. Dark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!
916. My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;
917. Or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells
918. Of noises far away?--list!"--Hereupon
919. He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone
920. Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,
921. On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,
922. A copious spring; and both together dash'd
923. Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd
924. Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,
925. Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot
926. Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise
927. As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize
928. Upon the last few steps, and with spent force
929. Along the ground they took a winding course.
930. Endymion follow'd--for it seem'd that one
931. Ever pursued, the other strove to shun--
932. Follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh
933. He had left thinking of the mystery,--
934. And was now rapt in tender hoverings
935. Over the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings
936. His dream away? What melodies are these?
937. They sound as through the whispering of trees,
938. Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!

939. "O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear
940. Such tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,
941. Why didst thou hear her prayer? O that I
942. Were rippling round her dainty fairness now,
943. Circling about her waist, and striving how
944. To entice her to a dive! then stealing in
945. Between her luscious lips and eyelids thin.
946. O that her shining hair was in the sun,
947. And I distilling from it thence to run
948. In amorous rillets down her shrinking form!
949. To linger on her lily shoulders, warm
950. Between her kissing breasts, and every charm
951. Touch raptur'd!--See how painfully I flow:
952. Fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.
953. Stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,
954. A happy wooer, to the flowery mead
955. Where all that beauty snar'd me."--"Cruel god,
956. Desist! or my offended mistress' nod
957. Will stagnate all thy fountains:--tease me not
958. With syren words--Ah, have I really got
959. Such power to madden thee? And is it true--
960. Away, away, or I shall dearly rue
961. My very thoughts: in mercy then away,
962. Kindest Alpheus for should I obey
963. My own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane."--
964. "O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain
965. Like this of mine, then would I fearless turn
966. And be a criminal."--"Alas, I burn,
967. I shudder--gentle river, get thee hence.
968. Alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense
969. Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.
970. Fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,
971. Ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;
972. But ever since I heedlessly did lave
973. In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow
974. Grew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,
975. And call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty.
976. Not once more did I close my happy eyes
977. Amid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!
978. O 'twas a cruel thing."--"Now thou dost taunt
979. So softly, Arethusa, that I think
980. If thou wast playing on my shady brink,
981. Thou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!
982. Stifle thine heart no more;--nor be afraid
983. Of angry powers: there are deities
984. Will shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs
985. 'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour
986. A dewy balm upon them!--fear no more,
987. Sweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel
988. Sometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal
989. Blushing into my soul, and let us fly
990. These dreary caverns for the open sky.
991. I will delight thee all my winding course,
992. From the green sea up to my hidden source
993. About Arcadian forests; and will shew
994. The channels where my coolest waters flow
995. Through mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,
996. I roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen
997. Than Saturn in his exile; where I brim
998. Round flowery islands, and take thence a skim
999. Of mealy sweets, which myriads of bees
1000. Buzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please
1001. Thyself to choose the richest, where we might
1002. Be incense-pillow'd every summer night.
1003. Doff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,
1004. And let us be thus comforted; unless
1005. Thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream
1006. Hurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,
1007. And pour to death along some hungry sands."--
1008. "What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands
1009. Severe before me: persecuting fate!
1010. Unhappy Arethusa! thou wast late
1011. A huntress free in"--At this, sudden fell
1012. Those two sad streams adown a fearful dell.
1013. The Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,
1014. Save echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er
1015. The name of Arethusa. On the verge
1016. Of that dark gulph he wept, and said: "I urge
1017. Thee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,
1018. By our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,
1019. If thou art powerful, these lovers pains;
1020. And make them happy in some happy plains.

1021. He turn'd--there was a whelming sound--he stept,
1022. There was a cooler light; and so he kept
1023. Towards it by a sandy path, and lo!
1024. More suddenly than doth a moment go,
1025. The visions of the earth were gone and fled--
1026. He saw the giant sea above his head.
