1. Who loves to peer up at the morning sun,
2. With half-shut eyes and comfortable cheek,
3. Let him with this sweet tale full often seek
4. For meadows where the little rivers run;
5. Who loves to linger with that brightest one
6. Of Heaven -- Hesperus -- let him lowly speak
7. These numbers to the night and starlight meek,
8. Or moon, if that her hunting be begun.
9. He who knows these delights, and, too, is prone
10. To moralize upon a smile or tear,
11. Will find at once a region of his own,
12. A bower for his spirit, and will steer
13. To alleys where the fir-tree drops its cone,
14. Where robins hop, and fallen leaves are sear.
