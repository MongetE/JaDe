1. I.
2. Here all the summer could I stay,
3. For there's Bishop's teign
4. And King's teign
5. And Coomb at the clear Teign head--
6. Where close by the stream
7. You may have your cream
8. All spread upon barley bread.

9. II.
10. There's Arch Brook
11. And there's Larch Brook
12. Both turning many a mill,
13. And cooling the drouth
14. Of the salmon's mouth
15. And fattening his silver gill.

16. III.
17. There is Wild wood,
18. A Mild hood
19. To the sheep on the lea o' the down,
20. Where the golden furze,
21. With its green, thin spurs,
22. Doth catch at the maiden's gown.

23. IV.
24. There is Newton Marsh
25. With its spear grass harsh--
26. A pleasant summer level
27. Where the maidens sweet
28. Of the Market Street
29. Do meet in the dusk to revel.

30. V.
31. There's the Barton rich
32. With dyke and ditch
33. And hedge for the thrush to live in,
34. And the hollow tree
35. For the buzzing bee
36. And a bank for the wasp to hive in.

37. VI.
38. And O, and O
39. The daisies blow
40. And the primroses are waken'd,
41. And violets white
42. Sit in silver plight,
43. And the green bud's as long as the spike end.

44. VII.
45. Then who would go
46. Into dark Soho,
47. And chatter with dack'd-hair'd critics,
48. When he can stay
49. For the new-mown hay,
50. And startle the dappled Prickets?
