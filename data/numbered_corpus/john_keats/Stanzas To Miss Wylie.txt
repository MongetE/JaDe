2. O come Georgiana! the rose is full blown,
3. The riches of Flora are lavishly strown,
4. The air is all softness, and crystal the streams,
5. The West is resplendently clothed in beams.

7. O come! let us haste to the freshening shades,
8. The quaintly carv'd seats, and the opening glades;
9. Where the faeries are chanting their evening hymns,
10. And in the last sun-beam the sylph lightly swims.

12. And when thou art weary I'll find thee a bed,
13. Of mosses and flowers to pillow thy head:
14. And there Georgiana I'll sit at thy feet,
15. While my story of love I enraptur'd repeat.

17. So fondly I'll breathe, and so softly I'll sigh,
18. Thou wilt think that some amorous Zephyr is nigh:
19. Yet no -- as I breathe I will press thy fair knee,
20. And then thou wilt know that the sigh comes from me.

21. 5.
22. Ah! why dearest girl should we lose all these blisses?
23. That mortal's a fool who such happiness misses:
24. So smile acquiescence, and give me thy hand,
25. With love-looking eyes, and with voice sweetly bland.
