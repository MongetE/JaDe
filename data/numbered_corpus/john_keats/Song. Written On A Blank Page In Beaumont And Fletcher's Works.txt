1. 1.
2. Spirit here that reignest!
3. Spirit here that painest!
4. Spirit here that burneth!
5. Spirit here that mourneth!
6. Spirit! I bow
7. My forehead low,
8. Enshaded with thy pinions!
9. Spirit! I look
10. All passion struck,
11. Into thy pale dominions!

12. 2.
13. Spirit here that laughest!
14. Spirit here that quaffest!
15. Spirit here that danceth!
16. Spirit here that pranceth!
17. Spirit! with thee
18. I join in the glee,
19. While nudging the elbow of Momus!
20. Spirit! I flush
21. With a Bacchanal blush,
22. Just fresh from the banquet of Comus!
