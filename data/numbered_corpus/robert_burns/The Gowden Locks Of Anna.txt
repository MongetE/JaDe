9. Ye monarchs, take the East and West
10. Frae Indus to Savannah;
11. Gie me, within my straining grasp,
12. The melting form of Anna:


13. There I'll despise Imperial charms,
14. An Empress or Sultana,
15. While dying raptures in her arms
16. I give and take wi' Anna!


17. Awa, thou flaunting God of Day!
18. Awa, thou pale Diana!
19. Ilk Star, gae hide thy twinkling ray,
20. When I'm to meet my Anna!


21. Come, in thy raven plumage, Night,
22. (Sun, Moon, and Stars, withdrawn a';)
23. And bring an angel-pen to write
24. My transports with my Anna!


25. POSTSCRIPTThe Kirk an' State may join an' tell,
26. To do sic things I maunna:
27. The Kirk an' State may gae to hell,
28. And I'll gae to my Anna.

30. To live but her I canna;
31. Had I on earth but wishes three,
32. The first should be my Anna.
