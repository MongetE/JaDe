1. LORD ADVOCATEHE clenched his pamphlet in his fist,
2. He quoted and he hinted,
3. Till, in a declamation-mist,
4. His argument he tint it:
5. He gapèd for't, he grapèd for't,
6. He fand it was awa, man;
7. But what his common sense came short,
8. He eked out wi' law, man.


9. MR. ERSKINECollected, Harry stood awee,
10. Then open'd out his arm, man;
11. His Lordship sat wi' ruefu' e'e,
12. And ey'd the gathering storm, man:
13. Like wind-driven hail it did assail'
14. Or torrents owre a lin, man:
15. The BENCH sae wise, lift up their eyes,
16. Half-wauken'd wi' the din, man.
