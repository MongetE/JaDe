1. SWEET closes the ev'ning on Craigieburn Wood,
2. And blythely awaukens the morrow;
3. But the pride o' the spring in the Craigieburn Wood
4. Can yield to me nothing but sorrow.


5. Chorus.â€”Beyond thee, dearie, beyond thee, dearie,
6. And O to be lying beyond thee!
7. O sweetly, soundly, weel may he sleep
8. That's laid in the bed beyond thee!


9. I see the spreading leaves and flowers,
10. I hear the wild birds singing;
11. But pleasure they hae nane for me,
12. While care my heart is wringing.
13. Beyond thee, &c.

14. I can na tell, I maun na tell,
15. I daur na for your anger;
16. But secret love will break my heart,
17. If I conceal it langer.
18. Beyond thee, &c.

19. I see thee gracefu', straight and tall,
20. I see thee sweet and bonie;
21. But oh, what will my torment be,
22. If thou refuse thy Johnie!
23. Beyond thee, &c.

24. To see thee in another's arms,
25. In love to lie and languish,
26. 'Twad be my dead, that will be seen,
27. My heart wad burst wi' anguish.
28. Beyond thee, &c.

29. But Jeanie, say thou wilt be mine,
30. Say thou lo'es nane before me;
31. And a' may days o' life to come
32. I'll gratefully adore thee,
33. Beyond thee, &c.
