1. O, WERE I on Parnassus hill,
2. Or had o' Helicon my fill,
3. That I might catch poetic skill,
4. To sing how dear I love thee!
5. But Nith maun be my Muse's well,
6. My Muse maun be thy bonie sel',
7. On Corsincon I'll glowr and spell,
8. And write how dear I love thee.


9. Then come, sweet Muse, inspire my lay!
10. For a' the lee-lang simmer's day
11. I couldna sing, I couldna say,
12. How much, how dear, I love thee,
13. I see thee dancing o'er the green,
14. Thy waist sae jimp, thy limbs sae clean,
15. Thy tempting lips, thy roguish een—
16. By Heaven and Earth I love thee!


17. By night, by day, a-field, at hame,
18. The thoughts o' thee my breast inflame:
19. And aye I muse and sing thy name—
20. I only live to love thee.
21. Tho' I were doom'd to wander on,
22. Beyond the sea, beyond the sun,
23. Till my last weary sand was run;
24. Till then—and then I love thee!
