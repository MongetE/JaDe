1. THOU, who thy honour as thy God rever'st,
2. Who, save thy mind's reproach, nought earthly fear'st,
3. To thee this votive offering I impart,
4. The tearful tribute of a broken heart.
5. The Friend thou valued'st, I, the Patron lov'd;
6. His worth, his honour, all the world approved:
7. We'll mourn till we too go as he has gone,
8. And tread the shadowy path to that dark world unknown.
