1. WHERE, braving angry winter's storms,
2. The lofty Ochils rise,
3. Far in their shade my Peggy's charms
4. First blest my wondering eyes;
5. As one who by some savage stream
6. A lonely gem surveys,
7. Astonish'd, doubly marks it beam
8. With art's most polish'd blaze.


9. Blest be the wild, sequester'd shade,
10. And blest the day and hour,
11. Where Peggy's charms I first survey'd,
12. When first I felt their pow'r!
13. The tyrant Death, with grim control,
14. May seize my fleeting breath;
15. But tearing Peggy from my soul
16. Must be a stronger death.
