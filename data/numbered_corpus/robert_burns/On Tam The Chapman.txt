1. AS Tam the chapman on a day,
2. Wi'Death forgather'd by the way,
3. Weel pleas'd, he greets a wight so famous,
4. And Death was nae less pleas'd wi' Thomas,
5. Wha cheerfully lays down his pack,
6. And there blaws up a hearty crack:
7. His social, friendly, honest heart
8. Sae tickled Death, they could na part;
9. Sae, after viewing knives and garters,
10. Death taks him hame to gie him quarters.
