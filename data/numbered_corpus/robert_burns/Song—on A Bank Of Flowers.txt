1. ON a bank of flowers, in a summer day,
2. For summer lightly drest,
3. The youthful, blooming Nelly lay,
4. With love and sleep opprest;
5. When Willie, wand'ring thro' the wood,
6. Who for her favour oft had sued;
7. He gaz'd, he wish'd
8. He fear'd, he blush'd,
9. And trembled where he stood.


10. Her clos√®d eyes, like weapons sheath'd,
11. Were seal'd in soft repose;
12. Her lip, still as she fragrant breath'd,
13. It richer dyed the rose;
14. The springing lilies, sweetly prest,
15. Wild-wanton kissed her rival breast;
16. He gaz'd, he wish'd,
17. He mear'd, he blush'd,
18. His bosom ill at rest.


19. Her robes, light-waving in the breeze,
20. Her tender limbs embrace;
21. Her lovely form, her native ease,
22. All harmony and grace;
23. Tumultuous tides his pulses roll,
24. A faltering, ardent kiss he stole;
25. He gaz'd, he wish'd,
26. He fear'd, he blush'd,
27. And sigh'd his very soul.


28. As flies the partridge from the brake,
29. On fear-inspired wings,
30. So Nelly, starting, half-awake,
31. Away affrighted springs;
32. But Willie follow'd-as he should,
33. He overtook her in the wood;
34. He vow'd, he pray'd,
35. He found the maid
36. Forgiving all, and good.
