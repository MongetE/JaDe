1. Chorusâ€”Mally's meek, Mally's sweet,
2. Mally's modest and discreet;
3. Mally's rare, Mally's fair,
4. Mally's every way complete.


5. AS I was walking up the street,
6. A barefit maid I chanc'd to meet;
7. But O the road was very hard
8. For that fair maiden's tender feet.
9. Mally's meek, &c.

10. It were mair meet that those fine feet
11. Were weel laced up in silken shoon;
12. An' 'twere more fit that she should sit
13. Within yon chariot gilt aboon,
14. Mally's meek, &c.

15. Her yellow hair, beyond compare,
16. Comes trinklin down her swan-like neck,
17. And her two eyes, like stars in skies,
18. Would keep a sinking ship frae wreck,
19. Mally's meek, &c.
