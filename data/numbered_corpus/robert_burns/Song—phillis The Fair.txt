1. WHILE larks, with little wing,
2. Fann'd the pure air,
3. Tasting the breathing Spring,
4. Forth I did fare:
5. Gay the sun's golden eye
6. Peep'd o'er the mountains high;
7. Such thy morn! did I cry,
8. Phillis the fair.

9. In each bird's careless song,
10. Glad I did share;
11. While yon wild-flowers among,
12. Chance led me there!
13. Sweet to the op'ning day,
14. Rosebuds bent the dewy spray;
15. Such thy bloom! did I say,
16. Phillis the fair.

17. Down in a shady walk,
18. Doves cooing were;
19. I mark'd the cruel hawk
20. Caught in a snare:
21. So kind may fortune be,
22. Such make his destiny,
23. He who would injure thee,
24. Phillis the fair.
