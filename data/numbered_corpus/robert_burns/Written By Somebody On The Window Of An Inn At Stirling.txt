1. HERE Stuarts once in glory reigned,
2. And laws for Scotland's weal ordained;
3. But now unroof'd their palace stands,
4. Their sceptre's sway'd by other hands;
5. Fallen indeed, and to the earth
6. Whence groveling reptiles take their birth.
7. The injured Stuart line is gone,
8. A race outlandish fills their throne;
9. An idiot race, to honour lost;
10. Who know them best despise them most.
