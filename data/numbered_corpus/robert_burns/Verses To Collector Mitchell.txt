1. FRIEND of the Poet, tried and leal,
2. Wha, wanting thee, might beg or steal;
3. Alake, alake, the meikle deil
4. Wi' a' his witches
5. Are at it skelpin jig and reel,
6. In my poor pouches?


7. I modestly fu' fain wad hint it,
8. That One-pound-one, I sairly want it;
9. If wi' the hizzie down ye sent it,
10. It would be kind;
11. And while my heart wi' life-blood dunted,
12. I'd bear't in mind.


13. So may the Auld year gang out moanin'
14. To see the New come laden, groanin',
15. Wi' double plenty o'er the loanin',
16. To thee and thine:
17. Domestic peace and comforts crownin'
18. The hale design.


19. POSTSCRIPTYe've heard this while how I've been lickit,
20. And by fell Death was nearly nickit;
21. Grim loon! he got me by the fecket,
22. And sair me sheuk;
23. But by gude luck I lap a wicket,
24. And turn'd a neuk.


25. But by that health, I've got a share o't,
26. But by that life, I'm promis'd mair o't,
27. My hale and wee, I'll tak a care o't,
28. A tentier way;
29. Then farewell folly, hide and hair o't,
30. For ance and aye!
