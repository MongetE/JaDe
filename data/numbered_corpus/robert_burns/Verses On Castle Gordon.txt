1. STREAMS that glide in orient plains,
2. Never bound by Winter's chains;
3. Glowing here on golden sands,
4. There immix'd with foulest stains
5. From Tyranny's empurpled hands;
6. These, their richly gleaming waves,
7. I leave to tyrants and their slaves;
8. Give me the stream that sweetly laves
9. The banks by Castle Gordon.


10. Spicy forests, ever gray,
11. Shading from the burning ray
12. Hapless wretches sold to toil;
13. Or the ruthless native's way,
14. Bent on slaughter, blood, and spoil:
15. Woods that ever verdant wave,
16. I leave the tyrant and the slave;
17. Give me the groves that lofty brave
18. The storms by Castle Gordon.


19. Wildly here, without control,
20. Nature reigns and rules the whole;
21. In that sober pensive mood,
22. Dearest to the feeling soul,
23. She plants the forest, pours the flood:
24. Life's poor day I'll musing rave
25. And find at night a sheltering cave,
26. Where waters flow and wild woods wave,
27. By bonie Castle Gordon.
