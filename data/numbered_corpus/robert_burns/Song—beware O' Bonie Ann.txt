1. YE gallants bright, I rede you right,
2. Beware o' bonie Ann;
3. Her comely face sae fu' o' grace,
4. Your heart she will trepan:
5. Her een sae bright, like stars by night,
6. Her skin sae like the swan;
7. Sae jimply lac'd her genty waist,
8. That sweetly ye might span.


9. Youth, Grace, and Love attendant move,
10. And pleasure leads the van:
11. In a' their charms, and conquering arms,
12. They wait on bonie Ann.
13. The captive bands may chain the hands,
14. But love enslaves the man:
15. Ye gallants braw, I rede you a',
16. Beware o' bonie Ann!
