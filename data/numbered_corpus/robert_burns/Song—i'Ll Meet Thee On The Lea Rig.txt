1. WHEN o'er the hill the eastern star
2. Tells bughtin time is near, my jo,
3. And owsen frae the furrow'd field
4. Return sae dowf and weary O;
5. Down by the burn, where birken buds
6. Wi' dew are hangin clear, my jo,
7. I'll meet thee on the lea-rig,
8. My ain kind Dearie O.

9. At midnight hour, in mirkest glen,
10. I'd rove, and ne'er be eerie, O,
11. If thro' that glen I gaed to thee,
12. My ain kind Dearie O;
13. Altho' the night were ne'er sae wild,
14. And I were ne'er sae weary O,
15. I'll meet thee on the lea-rig,
16. My ain kind Dearie O.

17. The hunter lo'es the morning sun;
18. To rouse the mountain deer, my jo;
19. At noon the fisher seeks the glen
20. Adown the burn to steer, my jo:
21. Gie me the hour o' gloamin' grey,
22. It maks my heart sae cheery O,
23. To meet thee on the lea-rig,
24. My ain kind Dearie O.
