1. NO 1 sculptured marble here, nor pompous lay,
2. "No storied urn nor animated bust;"
3. This simple stone directs pale Scotia's way,
4. To pour her sorrows o'er the Poet's dust.


5. ADDITIONAL STANZASShe mourns, sweet tuneful youth, thy hapless fate;
6. Tho' all the powers of song thy fancy fired,
7. Yet Luxury and Wealth lay by in state,

9. This tribute, with a tear, now gives
10. A brother Bard-he can no more bestow:
11. But dear to fame thy Song immortal lives,
12. A nobler monument than Art can shew.
