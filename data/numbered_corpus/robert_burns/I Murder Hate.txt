1. I MURDER hate by flood or field,
2. Tho' glory's name may screen us;
3. In wars at home I'll spend my bloodâ€”
4. Life-giving wars of Venus.
5. The deities that I adore
6. Are social Peace and Plenty;
7. I'm better pleas'd to make one more,
8. Than be the death of twenty.


9. I would not die like Socrates,
10. For all the fuss of Plato;
11. Nor would I with Leonidas,
12. Nor yet would I with Cato:
13. The zealots of the Church and State
14. Shall ne'er my mortal foes be;
15. But let me have bold Zimri's fate,
16. Within the arms of Cozbi!
