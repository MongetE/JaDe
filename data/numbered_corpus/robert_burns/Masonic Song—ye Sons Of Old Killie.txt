1. YE sons of old Killie, assembled by Willie,
2. To follow the noble vocation;
3. Your thrifty old mother has scarce such another
4. To sit in that honoured station.
5. I've little to say, but only to pray,
6. As praying's the ton of your fashion;
7. A prayer from thee Muse you well may excuse
8. 'Tis seldom her favourite passion.


9. Ye powers who preside o'er the wind, and the tide,
10. Who markèd each element's border;
11. Who formed this frame with beneficent aim,
12. Whose sovereign statute is order:—
13. Within this dear mansion, may wayward Contention
14. Or witherèd Envy ne'er enter;
15. May secrecy round be the mystical bound,
16. And brotherly Love be the centre!
