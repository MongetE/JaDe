1. WITH Pegasus upon a day,
2. Apollo, weary flying,
3. Through frosty hills the journey lay,
4. On foot the way was plying.


5. Poor slipshod giddy Pegasus
6. Was but a sorry walker;
7. To Vulcan then Apollo goes,
8. To get a frosty caulker.


9. Obliging Vulcan fell to work,
10. Threw by his coat and bonnet,
11. And did Sol's business in a crack;
12. Sol paid him with a sonnet.


13. Ye Vulcan's sons of Wanlockhead,
14. Pity my sad disaster;
15. My Pegasus is poorly shod,
16. I'll pay you like my master.
