1. O WERE my love yon Lilac fair,
2. Wi' purple blossoms to the Spring,
3. And I, a bird to shelter there,
4. When wearied on my little wing!
5. How I wad mourn when it was torn
6. By Autumn wild, and Winter rude!
7. But I wad sing on wanton wing,
8. When youthfu' May its bloom renew'd.


9. O gin my love were yon red rose,
10. That grows upon the castle wa';
11. And I myself a drap o' dew,
12. Into her bonie breast to fa'!
13. O there, beyond expression blest,
14. I'd feast on beauty a' the night;
15. Seal'd on her silk-saft faulds to rest,
16. Till fley'd awa by Phoebus' light!
