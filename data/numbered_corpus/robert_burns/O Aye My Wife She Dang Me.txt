1. Chorusâ€”O aye my wife she dang me,
2. An' aft my wife she bang'd me,
3. If ye gie a woman a' her will,
4. Gude faith! she'll soon o'er-gang ye.


5. ON peace an' rest my mind was bent,
6. And, fool I was! I married;
7. But never honest man's intent
8. Sane cursedly miscarried.
9. O aye my wife, &c.

10. Some sairie comfort at the last,
11. When a' thir days are done, man,
12. My pains o' hell on earth is past,
13. I'm sure o' bliss aboon, man,
14. O aye my wife, &c.
