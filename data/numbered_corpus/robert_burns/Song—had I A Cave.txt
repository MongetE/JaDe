1. HAD I a cave on some wild distant shore,
2. Where the winds howl to the wave's dashing roar:
3. There would I weep my woes,
4. There seek my lost repose,
5. Till grief my eyes should close,
6. Ne'er to wake more!


7. Falsest of womankind, can'st thou declare
8. All thy fond, plighted vows fleeting as air!
9. To thy new lover hie,
10. Laugh o'er thy perjury;
11. Then in thy bosom try
12. What peace is there!
