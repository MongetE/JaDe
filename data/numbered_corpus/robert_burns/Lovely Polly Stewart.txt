1. Chorus.â€”O lovely Polly Stewart,
2. O charming Polly Stewart,
3. There's ne'er a flower that blooms in May,
4. That's half so fair as thou art!


5. THE FLOWER it blaws, it fades, it fa's,
6. And art can ne'er renew it;
7. But worth and truth, eternal youth
8. Will gie to Polly Stewart,
9. O lovely Polly Stewart, &c.

10. May he whase arms shall fauld thy charms
11. Possess a leal and true heart!
12. To him be given to ken the heaven
13. He grasps in Polly Stewart!
14. O lovely Polly Stewart, &c.
