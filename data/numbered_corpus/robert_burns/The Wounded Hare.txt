1. INHUMAN man! curse on thy barb'rous art,
2. And blasted be thy murder-aiming eye;
3. May never pity soothe thee with a sigh,
4. Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart!


5. Go live, poor wand'rer of the wood and field!
6. The bitter little that of life remains:
7. No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains
8. To thee a home, or food, or pastime yield.


9. Seek, mangled wretch, some place of wonted rest,
10. No more of rest, but now thy dying bed!
11. The sheltering rushes whistling o'er thy head,
12. The cold earth with thy bloody bosom prest.


13. Perhaps a mother's anguish adds its woe;
14. The playful pair crowd fondly by thy side;
15. Ah! helpless nurslings, who will now provide
16. That life a mother only can bestow!


17. Oft as by winding Nith I, musing, wait
18. The sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn,
19. I'll miss thee sporting o'er the dewy lawn,
20. And curse the ruffian's aim, and mourn thy hapless fate.
