1. O THOU Great Being! what Thou art,
2. Surpasses me to know;
3. Yet sure I am, that known to Thee
4. Are all Thy works below.


5. Thy creature here before Thee stands,
6. All wretched and distrest;
7. Yet sure those ills that wring my soul
8. Obey Thy high behest.


9. Sure, Thou, Almighty, canst not act
10. From cruelty or wrath!
11. O, free my weary eyes from tears,
12. Or close them fast in death!


13. But, if I must afflicted be,
14. To suit some wise design,
15. Then man my soul with firm resolves,
16. To bear and not repine!
