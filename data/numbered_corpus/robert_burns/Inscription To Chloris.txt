1. 'TIS Friendship's pledge, my young, fair Friend,
2. Nor thou the gift refuse,
3. Nor with unwilling ear attend
4. The moralising Muse.


5. Since thou, in all thy youth and charms,
6. Must bid the world adieu,
7. (A world 'gainst Peace in constant arms)
8. To join the Friendly Few.


9. Since, thy gay morn of life o'ercast,
10. Chill came the tempest's lour;
11. (And ne'er Misfortune's eastern blast
12. Did nip a fairer flower.)


13. Since life's gay scenes must charm no more,
14. Still much is left behind,
15. Still nobler wealth hast thou in storeâ€”
16. The comforts of the mind!


17. Thine is the self-approving glow,
18. Of conscious Honour's part;
19. And (dearest gift of Heaven below)
20. Thine Friendship's truest heart.


21. The joys refin'd of Sense and Taste,
22. With every Muse to rove:
23. And doubly were the Poet blest,
24. These joys could he improve.
