1. THE SUN he is sunk in the west,
2. All creatures retirиd to rest,
3. While here I sit, all sore beset,
4. With sorrow, grief, and woe:
5. And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!

6. The prosperous man is asleep,
7. Nor hears how the whirlwinds sweep;
8. But Misery and I must watch
9. The surly tempest blow:
10. And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!

11. There lies the dear partner of my breast;
12. Her cares for a moment at rest:
13. Must I see thee, my youthful pride,
14. Thus brought so very low!
15. And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!

16. There lie my sweet babies in her arms;
17. No anxious fear their little hearts alarms;
18. But for their sake my heart does ache,
19. With many a bitter throe:
20. And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!

21. I once was by Fortune carest:
22. I once could relieve the distrest:
23. Now life's poor support, hardly earn'd
24. My fate will scarce bestow:
25. And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!

26. No comfort, no comfort I have!
27. How welcome to me were the grave!
28. But then my wife and children dear—
29. O, wither would they go!
30. And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!

31. O whither, O whither shall I turn!
32. All friendless, forsaken, forlorn!
33. For, in this world, Rest or Peace
34. I never more shall know!
35. And it's O, fickle Fortune, O!
