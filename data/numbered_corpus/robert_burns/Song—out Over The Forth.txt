1. OUT over the Forth, I look to the North;
2. But what is the north and its Highlands to me?
3. The south nor the east gie ease to my breast,
4. The far foreign land, or the wide rolling sea.


5. But I look to the west when I gae to rest,
6. That happy my dreams and my slumbers may be;
7. For far in the west lives he I loe best,
8. The man that is dear to my babie and me.
