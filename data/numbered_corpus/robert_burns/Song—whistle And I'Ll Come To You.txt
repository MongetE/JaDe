1. Chorus.â€”O WHISTLE, an' I'll come to ye, my lad,
2. O whistle, an' I'll come to ye, my lad,
3. Tho' father an' mother an' a' should gae mad,
4. O whistle, an' I'll come to ye, my lad.


5. But warily tent when ye come to court me,
6. And come nae unless the back-yett be a-jee;
7. Syne up the back-stile, and let naebody see,
8. And come as ye were na comin' to me,
9. And come as ye were na comin' to me.
10. O whistle an' I'll come, &c.

11. At kirk, or at market, whene'er ye meet me,
12. Gang by me as tho' that ye car'd na a flie;
13. But steal me a blink o' your bonie black e'e,
14. Yet look as ye were na lookin' to me,
15. Yet look as ye were na lookin' to me.
16. O whistle an' I'll come, &c.

17. Aye vow and protest that ye care na for me,
18. And whiles ye may lightly my beauty a-wee;
19. But court na anither, tho' jokin' ye be,
20. For fear that she wile your fancy frae me,
21. For fear that she wile your fancy frae me.
22. O whistle an' I'll come, &c.
