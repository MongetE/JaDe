1. THE HEATHER was blooming, the meadows were mawn,
2. Our lads gaed a-hunting ae day at the dawn,
3. O'er moors and o'er mosses and mony a glen,
4. At length they discover'd a bonie moor-hen.


5. Chorus.—I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men,
6. I rede you, beware at the hunting, young men;
7. Take some on the wing, and some as they spring,
8. But cannily steal on a bonie moor-hen.


9. Sweet-brushing the dew from the brown heather bells
10. Her colours betray'd her on yon mossy fells;
11. Her plumage outlustr'd the pride o' the spring
12. And O! as she wanton'd sae gay on the wing.
13. I rede you, &c.

14. Auld Phoebus himself, as he peep'd o'er the hill,
15. In spite at her plumage he tried his skill;
16. He levell'd his rays where she bask'd on the brae—
17. His rays were outshone, and but mark'd where she lay.
18. I rede you,&c.


19. They hunted the valley, they hunted the hill,
20. The best of our lads wi' the best o' their skill;
21. But still as the fairest she sat in their sight,
22. Then, whirr! she was over, a mile at a flight.
23. I rede you, &c.
