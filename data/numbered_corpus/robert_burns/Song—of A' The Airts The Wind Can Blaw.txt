1. OF 1 a' the airts the wind can blaw,
2. I dearly like the west,
3. For there the bonie lassie lives,
4. The lassie I lo'e best:
5. There's wild-woods grow, and rivers row,
6. And mony a hill between:
7. But day and night my fancys' flight
8. Is ever wi' my Jean.


9. I see her in the dewy flowers,
10. I see her sweet and fair:
11. I hear her in the tunefu' birds,
12. I hear her charm the air:
13. There's not a bonie flower that springs,
14. By fountain, shaw, or green;
15. There's not a bonie bird that sings,
16. But minds me o' my Jean.
