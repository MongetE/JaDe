1. O THOU, the first, the greatest friend
2. Of all the human race!
3. Whose strong right hand has ever been
4. Their stay and dwelling place!


5. Before the mountains heav'd their heads
6. Beneath Thy forming hand,
7. Before this ponderous globe itself
8. Arose at Thy command;


9. That Pow'r which rais'd and still upholds
10. This universal frame,
11. From countless, unbeginning time
12. Was ever still the same.


13. Those mighty periods of years
14. Which seem to us so vast,
15. Appear no more before Thy sight
16. Than yesterday that's past.


17. Thou giv'st the word: Thy creature, man,
18. Is to existence brought;
19. Again Thou say'st, "Ye sons of men,
20. Return ye into nought!"


21. Thou layest them, with all their cares,
22. In everlasting sleep;
23. As with a flood Thou tak'st them off
24. With overwhelming sweep.


25. They flourish like the morning flow'r,
26. In beauty's pride array'd;
27. But long ere night cut down it lies
28. All wither'd and decay'd.
