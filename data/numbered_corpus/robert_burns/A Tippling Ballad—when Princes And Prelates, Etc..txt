1. WHEN Princes and Prelates,
2. And hot-headed zealots,
3. A' Europe had set in a low, a low,

7. And comforts himself as he dow.


8. The black-headed eagle,
9. As keen as a beagle,
10. He hunted o'er height and o'er howe,
11. In the braes o' Gemappe,
12. He fell in a trap,
13. E'en let him come out as he dow, dow, dow,
14. E'en let him come out as he dow.
15. · · · · · · · But truce with commotions,
16. And new-fangled notions,
17. A bumper, I trust you'll allow;
18. Here's George our good king,
19. And Charlotte his queen,
20. And lang may they ring as they dow, dow, dow,
21. And lang may they ring as they dow.
