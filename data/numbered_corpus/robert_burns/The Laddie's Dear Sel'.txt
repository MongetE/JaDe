1. THERE'S a youth in this city, it were a great pity
2. That he from our lassies should wander awa';
3. For he's bonie and braw, weel-favor'd witha',
4. An' his hair has a natural buckle an' a'.


5. His coat is the hue o' his bonnet sae blue,
6. His fecket is white as the new-driven snaw;
7. His hose they are blae, and his shoon like the slae,
8. And his clear siller buckles, they dazzle us a'.


9. For beauty and fortune the laddie's been courtin;
10. Weel-featur'd, weel-tocher'd, weel-mounted an' braw;
11. But chiefly the siller that gars him gang till her,
12. The penny's the jewel that beautifies a'.


13. There's Meg wi' the mailen that fain wad a haen him,
14. And Susie, wha's daddie was laird o' the Ha';
15. There's lang-tocher'd Nancy maist fetters his fancy,
16. But the laddie's dear sel', he loes dearest of a'.
