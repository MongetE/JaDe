1. O MERRY hae I been teethin' a heckle,
2. An' merry hae I been shapin' a spoon;
3. O merry hae I been cloutin' a kettle,
4. An' kissin' my Katie when a' was done.
5. O a' the lang day I ca' at my hammer,
6. An' a' the lang day I whistle and sing;
7. O a' the lang night I cuddle my kimmer,
8. An' a' the lang night as happy's a king.


9. Bitter in dool I lickit my winnins
10. O' marrying Bess, to gie her a slave:
11. Blest be the hour she cool'd in her linnens,
12. And blythe be the bird that sings on her grave!
13. Come to my arms, my Katie, my Katie;
14. O come to my arms and kiss me again!
15. Drucken or sober, here's to thee, Katie!
16. An' blest be the day I did it again.
