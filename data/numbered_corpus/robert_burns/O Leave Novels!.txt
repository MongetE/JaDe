1. O LEAVE novels, 1 ye Mauchline belles,
2. Ye're safer at your spinning-wheel;
3. Such witching books are baited hooks
4. For rakish rooks, like Rob Mossgiel;
5. Your fine Tom Jones and Grandisons,
6. They make your youthful fancies reel;
7. They heat your brains, and fire your veins,
8. And then you're prey for Rob Mossgiel.


9. Beware a tongue that's smoothly hung,
10. A heart that warmly seems to feel;
11. That feeling heart but acts a partâ€”
12. 'Tis rakish art in Rob Mossgiel.
13. The frank address, the soft caress,
14. Are worse than poisoned darts of steel;
15. The frank address, and politesse,
16. Are all finesse in Rob Mossgiel.
