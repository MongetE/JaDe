1. BUT lately seen in gladsome green,
2. The woods rejoic'd the day,
3. Thro' gentle showers, the laughing flowers
4. In double pride were gay:
5. But now our joys are fled
6. On winter blasts awa;
7. Yet maiden May, in rich array,
8. Again shall bring them a'.


9. But my white pow, nae kindly thowe
10. Shall melt the snaws of Age;
11. My trunk of eild, but buss or beild,
12. Sinks in Time's wintry rage.
13. Oh, Age has weary days,
14. And nights o' sleepless pain:
15. Thou golden time, o' Youthfu' prime,
16. Why comes thou not again!
