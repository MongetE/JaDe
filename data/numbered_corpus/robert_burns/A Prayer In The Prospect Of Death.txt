1. O THOU unknown, Almighty Cause
2. Of all my hope and fear!
3. In whose dread presence, ere an hour,
4. Perhaps I must appear!


5. If I have wander'd in those paths
6. Of life I ought to shun,
7. As something, loudly, in my breast,
8. Remonstrates I have done;


9. Thou know'st that Thou hast formed me
10. With passions wild and strong;
11. And list'ning to their witching voice
12. Has often led me wrong.


13. Where human weakness has come short,
14. Or frailty stept aside,
15. Do Thou, All-Good-for such Thou artâ€”
16. In shades of darkness hide.


17. Where with intention I have err'd,
18. No other plea I have,
19. But, Thou art good; and Goodness still
20. Delighteth to forgive.
