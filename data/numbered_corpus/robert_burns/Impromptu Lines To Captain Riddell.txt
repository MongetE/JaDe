1. YOUR News and Review, sir.
2. I've read through and through, sir,
3. With little admiring or blaming;
4. The Papers are barren
5. Of home-news or foreign,
6. No murders or rapes worth the naming.


7. Our friends, the Reviewers,
8. Those chippers and hewers,
9. Are judges of mortar and stone, sir;
10. But of meet or unmeet,
11. In a fabric complete,
12. I'll boldly pronounce they are none, sir;


13. My goose-quill too rude is
14. To tell all your goodness
15. Bestow'd on your servant, the Poet;
16. Would to God I had one
17. Like a beam of the sun,
18. And then all the world, sir, should know it!
