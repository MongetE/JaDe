1. ANCE mair I hail thee, thou gloomy December!
2. Ance mair I hail thee wi' sorrow and care;
3. Sad was the parting thou makes me rememberâ€”
4. Parting wi' Nancy, oh, ne'er to meet mair!


5. Fond lovers' parting is sweet, painful pleasure,
6. Hope beaming mild on the soft parting hour;
7. But the dire feeling, O farewell for ever!
8. Anguish unmingled, and agony pure!


9. Wild as the winter now tearing the forest,
10. Till the last leaf o' the summer is flown;
11. Such is the tempest has shaken my bosom,
12. Till my last hope and last comfort is gone.


13. Still as I hail thee, thou gloomy December,
14. Still shall I hail thee wi' sorrow and care;
15. For sad was the parting thou makes me remember,
16. Parting wi' Nancy, oh, ne'er to meet mair.
