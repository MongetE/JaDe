1. LOUD blaw the frosty breezes,
2. The snaws the mountains cover;
3. Like winter on me seizes,
4. Since my young Highland rover
5. Far wanders nations over.
6. Where'er he go, where'er he stray,
7. May heaven be his warden;
8. Return him safe to fair Strathspey,
9. And bonie Castle-Gordon!


10. The trees, now naked groaning,
11. Shall soon wi' leaves be hinging,
12. The birdies dowie moaning,
13. Shall a' be blythely singing,
14. And every flower be springing;
15. Sae I'll rejoice the lee-lang day,
16. When by his mighty Warden
17. My youth's return'd to fair Strathspey,
18. And bonie Castle-Gordon.
