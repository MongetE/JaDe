1. FAREWELL, thou stream that winding flows
2. Around Eliza's dwelling;
3. O mem'ry! spare the cruel thoes
4. Within my bosom swelling.
5. Condemn'd to drag a hopeless chain
6. And yet in secret languish;
7. To feel a fire in every vein,
8. Nor dare disclose my anguish.


9. Love's veriest wretch, unseen, unknown,
10. I fain my griefs would cover;
11. The bursting sigh, th' unweeting groan,
12. Betray the hapless lover.
13. I know thou doom'st me to despair,
14. Nor wilt, nor canst relieve me;
15. But, O Eliza, hear one prayerâ€”
16. For pity's sake forgive me!


17. The music of thy voice I heard,
18. Nor wist while it enslav'd me;
19. I saw thine eyes, yet nothing fear'd,
20. Till fears no more had sav'd me:
21. Th' unwary sailor thus, aghast
22. The wheeling torrent viewing,
23. 'Mid circling horrors sinks at last,
24. In overwhelming ruin.
