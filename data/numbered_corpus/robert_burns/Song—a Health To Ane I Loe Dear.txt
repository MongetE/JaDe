1. Chorus—Here's a health to ane I loe dear,
2. Here's a health to ane I loe dear;
3. Thou art sweet as the smile when fond lovers meet,
4. And soft as their parting tear—Jessy.


5. ALTHO' thou maun never be mine,
6. Altho' even hope is denied;
7. 'Tis sweeter for thee despairing,
8. Than ought in the world beside—Jessy.
9. Here's a health, &c.

10. I mourn thro' the gay, gaudy day,
11. As hopeless I muse on thy charms;
12. But welcome the dream o' sweet slumber,
13. For then I am lockt in thine arms—Jessy.
14. Here's a health, &c.

15. I guess by the dear angel smile,
16. I guess by the love-rolling e'e;
17. But why urge the tender confession,
18. 'Gainst Fortune's fell, cruel decree?—Jessy.
19. Here's a health, &c.
