1. MY blessin's upon thy sweet wee lippie!
2. My blessin's upon thy e'e-brie!
3. Thy smiles are sae like my blythe sodger laddie,
4. Thou's aye the dearer, and dearer to me!


5. But I'll big a bow'r on yon bonie banks,
6. Whare Tay rins wimplin' by sae clear;
7. An' I'll cleed thee in the tartan sae fine,
8. And mak thee a man like thy daddie dear.
