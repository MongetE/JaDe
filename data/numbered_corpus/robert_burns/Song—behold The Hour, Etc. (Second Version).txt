1. BEHOLD the hour, the boat arrive;
2. Thou goest, the darling of my heart;
3. Sever'd from thee, can I survive,
4. But Fate has will'd and we must part.
5. I'll often greet the surging swell,
6. Yon distant Isle will often hail:
7. "E'en here I took the last farewell;
8. There, latest mark'd her vanish'd sail."
9. Along the solitary shore,
10. While flitting sea-fowl round me cry,
11. Across the rolling, dashing roar,
12. I'll westward turn my wistful eye:
13. "Happy thou Indian grove," I'll say,
14. "Where now my Nancy's path may be!
15. While thro' thy sweets she loves to stray,
16. O tell me, does she muse on me!"
