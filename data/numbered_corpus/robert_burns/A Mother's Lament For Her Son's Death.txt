1. FATE gave the word, the arrow sped,
2. And pierc'd my darling's heart;
3. And with him all the joys are fled
4. Life can to me impart.


5. By cruel hands the sapling drops,
6. In dust dishonour'd laid;
7. So fell the pride of all my hopes,
8. My age's future shade.


9. The mother-linnet in the brake
10. Bewails her ravish'd young;
11. So I, for my lost darling's sake,
12. Lament the live-day long.


13. Death, oft I've feared thy fatal blow.
14. Now, fond, I bare my breast;
15. O, do thou kindly lay me low
16. With him I love, at rest!
