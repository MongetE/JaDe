1. WHEN first my brave Johnie lad came to this town,
2. He had a blue bonnet that wanted the crown;
3. But now he has gotten a hat and a feather,
4. Hey, brave Johnie lad, cock up your beaver!

5. Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu' sprush,
6. We'll over the border, and gie them a brush;
7. There's somebody there we'll teach better behaviour,
8. Hey, brave Johnie lad, cock up your beaver!
