1. O KENMURE'S on and awa, Willie,
2. O Kenmure's on and awa:
3. An' Kenmure's lord's the bravest lord
4. That ever Galloway saw.


5. Success to Kenmure's band, Willie!
6. Success to Kenmure's band!
7. There's no a heart that fears a Whig,
8. That rides by kenmure's hand.


9. Here's Kenmure's health in wine, Willie!
10. Here's Kenmure's health in wine!
11. There's ne'er a coward o' Kenmure's blude,
12. Nor yet o' Gordon's line.


13. O Kenmure's lads are men, Willie,
14. O Kenmure's lads are men;
15. Their hearts and swords are metal true,
16. And that their foes shall ken.


17. They'll live or die wi' fame, Willie;
18. They'll live or die wi' fame;
19. But sune, wi' sounding victorie,
20. May Kenmure's lord come hame!


21. Here's him that's far awa, Willie!
22. Here's him that's far awa!
23. And here's the flower that I loe best,
24. The rose that's like the snaw.
