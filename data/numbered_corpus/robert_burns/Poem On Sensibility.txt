1. SENSIBILITY, how charming,
2. Dearest Nancy, thou canst tell;
3. But distress, with horrors arming,
4. Thou alas! hast known too well!


5. Fairest flower, behold the lily
6. Blooming in the sunny ray:
7. Let the blast sweep o'er the valley,
8. See it prostrate in the clay.


9. Hear the wood lark charm the forest,
10. Telling o'er his little joys;
11. But alas! a prey the surest
12. To each pirate of the skies.


13. Dearly bought the hidden treasure
14. Finer feelings can bestow:
15. Chords that vibrate sweetest pleasure
16. Thrill the deepest notes of woe.
