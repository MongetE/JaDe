1. CURSE on ungrateful man, that can be pleased,
2. And yet can starve the author of the pleasure.
3. O thou, my elder brother in misfortune,
4. By far my elder brother in the Muses,
5. With tears I pity thy unhappy fate!
6. Why is the Bard unpitied by the world,
7. Yet has so keen a relish of its pleasures?
