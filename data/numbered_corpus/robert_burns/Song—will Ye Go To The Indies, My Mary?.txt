1. WILL ye go to the Indies, my Mary,
2. And leave auld Scotia's shore?
3. Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary,
4. Across th' Atlantic roar?


5. O sweet grows the lime and the orange,
6. And the apple on the pine;
7. But a' the charms o' the Indies
8. Can never equal thine.


9. I hae sworn by the Heavens to my Mary,
10. I hae sworn by the Heavens to be true;
11. And sae may the Heavens forget me,
12. When I forget my vow!


13. O plight me your faith, my Mary,
14. And plight me your lily-white hand;
15. O plight me your faith, my Mary,
16. Before I leave Scotia's strand.


17. We hae plighted our troth, my Mary,
18. In mutual affection to join;
19. And curst be the cause that shall part us!
20. The hour and the moment o' time!
