1. YON wandering rill that marks the hill,
2. And glances o'er the brae, Sir,
3. Slides by a bower, where mony a flower
4. Sheds fragrance on the day, Sir;
5. There Damon lay, with Sylvia gay,
6. To love they thought no crime, Sir,
7. The wild birds sang, the echoes rang,
8. While Damon's heart beat time, Sir.
