1. THINE am I, my faithful Fair,
2. Thine, my lovely Nancy;
3. Ev'ry pulse along my veins,
4. Ev'ry roving fancy.
5. To thy bosom lay my heart,
6. There to throb and languish;
7. Tho' despair had wrung its core,
8. That would heal its anguish.


9. Take away those rosy lips,
10. Rich with balmy treasure;
11. Turn away thine eyes of love,
12. Lest I die with pleasure!
13. What is life when wanting Love?
14. Night without a morning:
15. Love's the cloudless summer sun,
16. Nature gay adorning.
