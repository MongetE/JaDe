1. NOW, Kennedy, if foot or horse
2. E'er bring you in by Mauchlin corse,
3. (Lord, man, there's lasses there wad force
4. A hermit's fancy;
5. An' down the gate in faith they're worse,
6. An' mair unchancy).


7. But as I'm sayin, please step to Dow's,
8. An' taste sic gear as Johnie brews,
9. Till some bit callan bring me news
10. That ye are there;
11. An' if we dinna hae a bouze,
12. I'se ne'er drink mair.


13. It's no I like to sit an' swallow,
14. Then like a swine to puke an' wallow;
15. But gie me just a true good fallow,
16. Wi' right ingine,
17. And spunkie ance to mak us mellow,
18. An' then we'll shine.


19. Now if ye're ane o' warl's folk,
20. Wha rate the wearer by the cloak,
21. An' sklent on poverty their joke,
22. Wi' bitter sneer,
23. Wi' you nae friendship I will troke,
24. Nor cheap nor dear.


25. But if, as I'm informèd weel,
26. Ye hate as ill's the very deil
27. The flinty heart that canna feel—
28. Come, sir, here's to you!
29. Hae, there's my haun', I wiss you weel,
30. An' gude be wi' you.ROBT. BURNESS.MOSSGIEL, 3rd March, 1786.
