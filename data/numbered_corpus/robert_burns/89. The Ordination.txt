1. KILMARNOCK wabsters, fidge an' claw,
2. An' pour your creeshie nations;
3. An' ye wha leather rax an' draw,
4. Of a' denominations;
5. Swith to the Ligh Kirk, ane an' a'
6. An' there tak up your stations;
7. Then aff to Begbie's in a raw,
8. An' pour divine libations
9. For joy this day.


10. Curst Common-sense, that imp o' hell,
11. Cam in wi' Maggie Lauder; 1
12. But Oliphant 2 aft made her yell,
13. An' Russell 3 sair misca'd her:
14. This day Mackinlay 4 taks the flail,
15. An' he's the boy will blaud her!
16. He'll clap a shangan on her tail,
17. An' set the bairns to daud her
18. Wi' dirt this day.


19. Mak haste an' turn King David owre,
20. And lilt wi' holy clangor;
21. O' double verse come gie us four,
22. An' skirl up the Bangor:
23. This day the kirk kicks up a stoure;
24. Nae mair the knaves shall wrang her,
25. For Heresy is in her pow'r,
26. And gloriously she'll whang her
27. Wi' pith this day.


28. Come, let a proper text be read,
29. An' touch it aff wi' vigour,
30. How graceless Ham 5 leugh at his dad,
31. Which made Canaan a nigger;
32. Or Phineas 6 drove the murdering blade,
33. Wi' whore-abhorring rigour;
34. Or Zipporah, 7 the scauldin jad,
35. Was like a bluidy tiger
36. I' th' inn that day.


37. There, try his mettle on the creed,
38. An' bind him down wi' caution,
39. That stipend is a carnal weed
40. He taks by for the fashion;
41. And gie him o'er the flock, to feed,
42. And punish each transgression;
43. Especial, rams that cross the breed,
44. Gie them sufficient threshin;
45. Spare them nae day.


46. Now, auld Kilmarnock, cock thy tail,
47. An' toss thy horns fu' canty;
48. Nae mair thou'lt rowt out-owre the dale,
49. Because thy pasture's scanty;
50. For lapfu's large o' gospel kail
51. Shall fill thy crib in plenty,
52. An' runts o' grace the pick an' wale,
53. No gi'en by way o' dainty,
54. But ilka day.


55. Nae mair by Babel's streams we'll weep,
56. To think upon our Zion;
57. And hing our fiddles up to sleep,
58. Like baby-clouts a-dryin!
59. Come, screw the pegs wi' tunefu' cheep,
60. And o'er the thairms be tryin;
61. Oh, rare to see our elbucks wheep,
62. And a' like lamb-tails flyin
63. Fu' fast this day.


64. Lang, Patronage, with rod o' airn,
65. Has shor'd the Kirk's undoin;
66. As lately Fenwick, sair forfairn,
67. Has proven to its ruin: 8
68. Our patron, honest man! Glencairn,
69. He saw mischief was brewin;
70. An' like a godly, elect bairn,
71. He's waled us out a true ane,
72. And sound, this day.


73. Now Robertson 9 harangue nae mair,
74. But steek your gab for ever;
75. Or try the wicked town of Ayr,
76. For there they'll think you clever;
77. Or, nae reflection on your lear,
78. Ye may commence a shaver;
79. Or to the Netherton 10 repair,
80. An' turn a carpet weaver
81. Aff-hand this day.


82. Mu'trie 11 and you were just a match,
83. We never had sic twa drones;
84. Auld Hornie did the Laigh Kirk watch,
85. Just like a winkin baudrons,
86. And aye he catch'd the tither wretch,
87. To fry them in his caudrons;
88. But now his Honour maun detach,
89. Wi' a' his brimstone squadrons,
90. Fast, fast this day.


91. See, see auld Orthodoxy's faes
92. She's swingein thro' the city!
93. Hark, how the nine-tail'd cat she plays!
94. I vow it's unco pretty:
95. There, Learning, with his Greekish face,
96. Grunts out some Latin ditty;
97. And Common-sense is gaun, she says,
98. To mak to Jamie Beattie
99. Her plaint this day.


100. But there's Morality himsel',
101. Embracing all opinions;
102. Hear, how he gies the tither yell,
103. Between his twa companions!
104. See, how she peels the skin an' fell,
105. As ane were peelin onions!
106. Now there, they're packed aff to hell,
107. An' banish'd our dominions,
108. Henceforth this day.


109. O happy day! rejoice, rejoice!
110. Come bouse about the porter!
111. Morality's demure decoys
112. Shall here nae mair find quarter:
113. Mackinlay, Russell, are the boys
114. That heresy can torture;
115. They'll gie her on a rape a hoyse,
116. And cowe her measure shorter
117. By th' head some day.


118. Come, bring the tither mutchkin in,
119. And here's—for a conclusion—
120. To ev'ry New Light 12 mother's son,
121. From this time forth, Confusion!
122. If mair they deave us wi' their din,
123. Or Patronage intrusion,
124. We'll light a spunk, and ev'ry skin,
125. We'll rin them aff in fusion
126. Like oil, some day.
