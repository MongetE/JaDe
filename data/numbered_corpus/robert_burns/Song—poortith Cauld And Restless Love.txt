1. O POORTITH cauld, and restless love,
2. Ye wrack my peace between ye;
3. Yet poortith a' I could forgive,
4. An 'twere na for my Jeanie.


5. Chorus.â€”O why should Fate sic pleasure have,
6. Life's dearest bands untwining?
7. Or why sae sweet a flower as love
8. Depend on Fortune's shining?


9. The warld's wealth, when I think on,
10. It's pride and a' the lave o't;
11. O fie on silly coward man,
12. That he should be the slave o't!
13. O why, &c.

14. Her e'en, sae bonie blue, betray
15. How she repays my passion;
16. But prudence is her o'erword aye,
17. She talks o' rank and fashion.
18. O why, &c.

19. O wha can prudence think upon,
20. And sic a lassie by him?
21. O wha can prudence think upon,
22. And sae in love as I am?
23. O why, &c.

24. How blest the simple cotter's fate!
25. He woos his artless dearie;
26. The silly bogles, wealth and state,
27. Can never make him eerie,
28. O why, &c.
