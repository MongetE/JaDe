1. O WILLIE 1 brew'd a peck o' maut,
2. And Rob and Allen cam to see;
3. Three blyther hearts, that lee-lang night,
4. Ye wadna found in Christendie.


5. Chorus.—We are na fou, we're nae that fou,
6. But just a drappie in our ee;
7. The cock may craw, the day may daw
8. And aye we'll taste the barley bree.


9. Here are we met, three merry boys,
10. Three merry boys I trow are we;

12. And mony mae we hope to be!
13. We are na fou, &c.


14. It is the moon, I ken her horn,
15. That's blinkin' in the lift sae hie;
16. She shines sae bright to wyle us hame,
17. But, by my sooth, she'll wait a wee!
18. We are na fou, &c.


19. Wha first shall rise to gang awa,
20. A cuckold, coward loun is he!
21. Wha first beside his chair shall fa',
22. He is the King amang us three.
23. We are na fou, &c.
