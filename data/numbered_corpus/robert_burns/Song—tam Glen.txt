1. MY heart is a-breaking, dear Tittie,
2. Some counsel unto me come len',
3. To anger them a' is a pity,
4. But what will I do wi' Tam Glen?


5. I'm thinking, wi' sic a braw fellow,
6. In poortith I might mak a fen;
7. What care I in riches to wallow,
8. If I maunna marry Tam Glen!


9. There's Lowrie the Laird o' Dumellerâ€”
10. "Gude day to you, brute!" he comes ben:
11. He brags and he blaws o' his siller,
12. But when will he dance like Tam Glen!


13. My minnie does constantly deave me,
14. And bids me beware o' young men;
15. They flatter, she says, to deceive me,
16. But wha can think sae o' Tam Glen!


17. My daddie says, gin I'll forsake him,
18. He'd gie me gude hunder marks ten;
19. But, if it's ordain'd I maun take him,
20. O wha will I get but Tam Glen!


21. Yestreen at the Valentine's dealing,
22. My heart to my mou' gied a sten';
23. For thrice I drew ane without failing,
24. And thrice it was written "Tam Glen"!


25. The last Halloween I was waukin
26. My droukit sark-sleeve, as ye ken,
27. His likeness came up the house staukin,
28. And the very grey breeks o' Tam Glen!


29. Come, counsel, dear Tittie, don't tarry;
30. I'll gie ye my bonie black hen,
31. Gif ye will advise me to marry
32. The lad I lo'e dearly, Tam Glen.
