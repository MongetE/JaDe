1. THERE was a bonie lass, and a bonie, bonie lass,
2. And she lo'ed her bonie laddie dear;
3. Till War's loud alarms tore her laddie frae her arms,
4. Wi' mony a sigh and tear.
5. Over sea, over shore, where the cannons loudly roar,
6. He still was a stranger to fear;
7. And nocht could him quail, or his bosom assail,
8. But the bonie lass he lo'ed sae dear.
