1. FORLORN, my Love, no comfort near,
2. Far, far from thee, I wander here;
3. Far, far from thee, the fate severe,
4. At which I most repine, Love.


5. Chorus.—O wert thou, Love, but near me!
6. But near, near, near me,
7. How kindly thou wouldst cheer me,
8. And mingle sighs with mine, Love.


9. Around me scowls a wintry sky,
10. Blasting each bud of hope and joy;
11. And shelter, shade, nor home have I;
12. Save in these arms of thine, Love.
13. O wert thou, &c.

14. Cold, alter'd friendship's cruel part,
15. To poison Fortune's ruthless dart—
16. Let me not break thy faithful heart,
17. And say that fate is mine, Love.
18. O wert thou, &c.

19. But, dreary tho' the moments fleet,
20. O let me think we yet shall meet;
21. That only ray of solace sweet,
22. Can on thy Chloris shine, Love!
23. O wert thou, &c.
