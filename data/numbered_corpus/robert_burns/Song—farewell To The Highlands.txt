1. FAREWELL to the Highlands, farewell to the North,
2. The birth-place of Valour, the country of Worth;
3. Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,
4. The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.


5. Chorus.â€”My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here,
6. My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
7. Chasing the wild-deer, and following the roe,
8. My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go.


9. Farewell to the mountains, high-cover'd with snow,
10. Farewell to the straths and green vallies below;
11. Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods,
12. Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.
13. My heart's in the Highlands, &c.
