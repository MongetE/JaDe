1. THE NIGHT was still, and o'er the hill
2. The moon shone on the castle wa';
3. The mavis sang, while dew-drops hang
4. Around her on the castle wa';
5. Sae merrily they danced the ring
6. Frae eenin' till the cock did craw;
7. And aye the o'erword o' the spring
8. Was "Irvine's bairns are bonie a'."
