1. I hae seen the hairst o' Rettie, lads,
2. And twa-three aff the throne.
3. I've heard o sax and seven weeks
4. The hairsters girn and groan.
5. But wi' a covie Willie Rae
6. A monthie an' a day
7. Sends a' the jolly hairsters
8. Singin' blithely doon the brae.

9. In a monthie an' a day, my lads,
10. The like was never seen;
11. It beats to sticks the fastest strips
12. O' Vickers' best machine.
13. The Speedwell she taks up the rear,
14. The Victory clears the way;
15. And twenty acres daily yields,
16. Laid doon tae Willie Rae.

17. He drives them roond and roond the field
18. At sic an awfu' rate:
19. Yet guides them gently oot and in
20. At mony's a kittle gate.
21. And wiles them gently ow'r the steens
22. And mony a hidden hole,
23. And he'll come by nae mishanter
24. If ye leave him wi' a pole.

25. O he sharps their teeth tae gar them bite;
26. He taps them on the jaws,
27. And if he sees them dowie-like,
28. He'll brawly ken the cause:
29. A boltie here, or a pinnie there,
30. Tae keep them aye in tune;
31. He'll quickly stop their wild career,
32. And bring the clishack doon.

33. O he whittles aff the corners,
34. And makes crookit bitties straucht,
35. He likes to see that man and beast
36. Are equal in a draucht,
37. An' a' the corners neat an' square
38. And nae a shafe agley;
39. And he'll coont wi' ony dominie
40. Frae the Deveron tae the Spey.

41. Noo he's nae made up wi' mony words
42. Or kent tae puff and lee,
43. But just as keen a little chap
44. As ony you will see.
45. And if you're in search o hairvest work
46. Upon a market day,
47. Take my advice, be there in time
48. And look for Willie Rae.

49. Noo he hae got it in aboot,
50. An' a wer things be ticht,
51. We'll gaither roond the festal board
52. Tae spend a joyfae nicht;
53. Wi' Scottish sangs and mutton broth
54. Tae charm our cares away;
55. We'll drink success tae Rettie,
56. And my bandster Annie Maclean.

57. Noo afore I end my hamely screed,
58. I canna weel forget
59. The gentle dames that guards the hoose
60. And keeps the folk in maet.
61. Lang may they bile the kail
62. And stir the porridge weel.
63. An may never need or want for nail
64. Tae keep the timmer hale.

65. Noo here's tae a' ye Rettie blades,
66. A ringin' cheer - Hurra!
67. A better lot o' workin' chaps
68. A gaffer never saw.
69. They're aye sae willin' for tae pairt,
70. And eager for the fray
71. It was them that made the boatie row,
72. That was steer'd by Willie Rae.
