1. HUMID seal of soft affections,
2. Tenderest pledge of future bliss,
3. Dearest tie of young connections,
4. Love's first snowdrop, virgin kiss!


5. Speaking silence, dumb confession,
6. Passion's birth, and infant's play,
7. Dove-like fondness, chaste concession,
8. Glowing dawn of future day!


9. Sorrowing joy, Adieu's last action,
10. (Lingering lips must now disjoin),
11. What words can ever speak affection
12. So thrilling and sincere as thine!
