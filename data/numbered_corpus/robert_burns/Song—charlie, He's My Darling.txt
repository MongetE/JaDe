1. 'TWAS on a Monday morning,
2. Right early in the year,
3. That Charlie came to our town,
4. The young Chevalier.


5. Chorus.â€”An' Charlie, he's my darling,
6. My darling, my darling,
7. Charlie, he's my darling,
8. The young Chevalier.


9. As he was walking up the street,
10. The city for to view,
11. O there he spied a bonie lass
12. The window looking through,
13. An' Charlie, &c.

14. Sae light's he jumped up the stair,
15. And tirl'd at the pin;
16. And wha sae ready as hersel'
17. To let the laddie in.
18. An' Charlie, &c.

19. He set his Jenny on his knee,
20. All in his Highland dress;
21. For brawly weel he ken'd the way
22. To please a bonie lass.
23. An' Charlie, &c.

24. It's up yon heathery mountain,
25. An' down yon scroggie glen,
26. We daur na gang a milking,
27. For Charlie and his men,
28. An' Charlie, &c.
