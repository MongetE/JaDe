1. THE GLOOMY night is gath'ring fast,
2. Loud roars the wild, inconstant blast,
3. Yon murky cloud is foul with rain,
4. I see it driving o'er the plain;
5. The hunter now has left the moor.
6. The scatt'red coveys meet secure;
7. While here I wander, prest with care,
8. Along the lonely banks of Ayr.


9. The Autumn mourns her rip'ning corn
10. By early Winter's ravage torn;
11. Across her placid, azure sky,
12. She sees the scowling tempest fly:
13. Chill runs my blood to hear it rave;
14. I think upon the stormy wave,
15. Where many a danger I must dare,
16. Far from the bonie banks of Ayr.


17. 'Tis not the surging billow's roar,
18. 'Tis not that fatal, deadly shore;
19. Tho' death in ev'ry shape appear,
20. The wretched have no more to fear:
21. But round my heart the ties are bound,
22. That heart transpierc'd with many a wound;
23. These bleed afresh, those ties I tear,
24. To leave the bonie banks of Ayr.


25. Farewell, old Coila's hills and dales,
26. Her healthy moors and winding vales;
27. The scenes where wretched Fancy roves,
28. Pursuing past, unhappy loves!
29. Farewell, my friends! farewell, my foes!
30. My peace with these, my love with those:
31. The bursting tears my heart declareâ€”
32. Farewell, the bonie banks of Ayr!
