1. HERE'S to thy health, my bonie lass,
2. Gude nicht and joy be wi' thee;
3. I'll come nae mair to thy bower-door,
4. To tell thee that I lo'e thee.
5. O dinna think, my pretty pink,
6. But I can live without thee:
7. I vow and swear I dinna care,
8. How lang ye look about ye.


9. Thou'rt aye sae free informing me,
10. Thou hast nae mind to marry;
11. I'll be as free informing thee,
12. Nae time hae I to tarry:
13. I ken thy frien's try ilka means
14. Frae wedlock to delay thee;
15. Depending on some higher chance,
16. But fortune may betray thee.


17. I ken they scorn my low estate,
18. But that does never grieve me;
19. For I'm as free as any he;
20. Sma' siller will relieve me.
21. I'll count my health my greatest wealth,
22. Sae lang as I'll enjoy it;
23. I'll fear nae scant, I'll bode nae want,
24. As lang's I get employment.


25. But far off fowls hae feathers fair,
26. And, aye until ye try them,
27. Tho' they seem fair, still have a care;
28. They may prove waur than I am.
29. But at twal' at night, when the moon shines bright,
30. My dear, I'll come and see thee;
31. For the man that loves his mistress weel,
32. Nae travel makes him weary.
