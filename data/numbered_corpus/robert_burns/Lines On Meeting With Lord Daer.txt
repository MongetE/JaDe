1. THIS 1 wot ye all whom it concerns,
2. I, Rhymer Robin, alias Burns,
3. October twenty-third,
4. A ne'er-to-be-forgotten day,
5. Sae far I sprackl'd up the brae,
6. I dinner'd wi' a Lord.


7. I've been at drucken writers' feasts,
8. Nay, been bitch-fou 'mang godly priests—
9. Wi' rev'rence be it spoken!—
10. I've even join'd the honour'd jorum,
11. When mighty Squireships of the quorum,
12. Their hydra drouth did sloken.


13. But wi' a Lord!—stand out my shin,
14. A Lord—a Peer—an Earl's son!
15. Up higher yet, my bonnet
16. An' sic a Lord!—lang Scoth ells twa,
17. Our Peerage he o'erlooks them a',
18. As I look o'er my sonnet.


19. But O for Hogarth's magic pow'r!
20. To show Sir Bardie's willyart glow'r,
21. An' how he star'd and stammer'd,
22. When, goavin, as if led wi' branks,
23. An' stumpin on his ploughman shanks,
24. He in the parlour hammer'd.


25. I sidying shelter'd in a nook,
26. An' at his Lordship steal't a look,
27. Like some portentous omen;
28. Except good sense and social glee,
29. An' (what surpris'd me) modesty,
30. I markèd nought uncommon.


31. I watch'd the symptoms o' the Great,
32. The gentle pride, the lordly state,
33. The arrogant assuming;
34. The fient a pride, nae pride had he,
35. Nor sauce, nor state, that I could see,
36. Mair than an honest ploughman.


37. Then from his Lordship I shall learn,
38. Henceforth to meet with unconcern
39. One rank as weel's another;
40. Nae honest, worthy man need care
41. To meet with noble youthful Daer,
42. For he but meets a brother.
