1. THOUGH fickle Fortune has deceived me,
2. She pormis'd fair and perform'd but ill;
3. Of mistress, friends, and wealth bereav'd me,
4. Yet I bear a heart shall support me still.

5. I'll act with prudence as far 's I'm able,
6. But if success I must never find,
7. Then come misfortune, I bid thee welcome,
8. I'll meet thee with an undaunted mind.
