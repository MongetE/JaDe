1. ALTHO' my bed were in yon muir,
2. Amang the heather, in my plaidie;
3. Yet happy, happy would I be,
4. Had I my dear Montgomerie's Peggy.


5. When o'er the hill beat surly storms,
6. And winter nights were dark and rainy;
7. I'd seek some dell, and in my arms
8. I'd shelter dear Montgomerie's Peggy.


9. Were I a baron proud and high,
10. And horse and servants waiting ready;
11. Then a' 'twad gie o' joy to me,â€”
12. The sharin't with Montgomerie's Peggy.
