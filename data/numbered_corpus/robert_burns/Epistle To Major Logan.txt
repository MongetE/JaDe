1. HAIL, thairm-inspirin', rattlin' Willie!
2. Tho' fortune's road be rough an' hilly
3. To every fiddling, rhyming billie,
4. We never heed,
5. But take it like the unback'd filly,
6. Proud o' her speed.


7. When, idly goavin', whiles we saunter,
8. Yirr! fancy barks, awa we canter,
9. Up hill, down brae, till some mischanter,
10. Some black bog-hole,
11. Arrests us; then the scathe an' banter
12. We're forced to thole.


13. Hale be your heart! hale be your fiddle!
14. Lang may your elbuck jink and diddle,
15. To cheer you through the weary widdle
16. O' this wild warl'.
17. Until you on a crummock driddle,
18. A grey hair'd carl.


19. Come wealth, come poortith, late or soon,
20. Heaven send your heart-strings aye in tune,
21. And screw your temper-pins aboon
22. A fifth or mair
23. The melancholious, lazy croon
24. O' cankrie care.


25. May still your life from day to day,
26. Nae "lente largo" in the play,
27. But "allegretto forte" gay,
28. Harmonious flow,
29. A sweeping, kindling, bauld strathspey—
30. Encore! Bravo!


31. A blessing on the cheery gang
32. Wha dearly like a jig or sang,
33. An' never think o' right an' wrang
34. By square an' rule,
35. But, as the clegs o' feeling stang,
36. Are wise or fool.


37. My hand-waled curse keep hard in chase
38. The harpy, hoodock, purse-proud race,
39. Wha count on poortith as disgrace;
40. Their tuneless hearts,
41. May fireside discords jar a base
42. To a' their parts.


43. But come, your hand, my careless brither,
44. I' th' ither warl', if there's anither,
45. An' that there is, I've little swither
46. About the matter;
47. We, cheek for chow, shall jog thegither,
48. I'se ne'er bid better.


49. We've faults and failings—granted clearly,
50. We're frail backsliding mortals merely,
51. Eve's bonie squad, priests wyte them sheerly
52. For our grand fa';
53. But still, but still, I like them dearly—
54. God bless them a'!


55. Ochone for poor Castalian drinkers,
56. When they fa' foul o' earthly jinkers!
57. The witching, curs'd, delicious blinkers
58. Hae put me hyte,
59. And gart me weet my waukrife winkers,
60. Wi' girnin'spite.


61. By by yon moon!—and that's high swearin—
62. An' every star within my hearin!
63. An' by her een wha was a dear ane!
64. I'll ne'er forget;
65. I hope to gie the jads a clearin
66. In fair play yet.


67. My loss I mourn, but not repent it;
68. I'll seek my pursie whare I tint it;
69. Ance to the Indies I were wonted,
70. Some cantraip hour
71. By some sweet elf I'll yet be dinted;
72. Then vive l'amour!


73. Faites mes baissemains respectueuses,
74. To sentimental sister Susie,
75. And honest Lucky; no to roose you,
76. Ye may be proud,
77. That sic a couple Fate allows ye,
78. To grace your blood.


79. Nae mair at present can I measure,
80. An' trowth my rhymin ware's nae treasure;
81. But when in Ayr, some half-hour's leisure,
82. Be't light, be't dark,
83. Sir Bard will do himself the pleasure
84. To call at Park.ROBERT BURNS.Mossgiel, 30th October, 1786.
