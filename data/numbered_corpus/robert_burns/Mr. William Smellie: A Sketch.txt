1. SHREWD Willie Smellie to Crochallan came;
2. The old cock'd hat, the grey surtout the same;
3. His bristling beard just rising in its might,
4. 'Twas four long nights and days to shaving night:
5. His uncomb'd grizzly locks, wild staring, thatch'd
6. A head for thought profound and clear, unmatch'd;
7. Yet tho' his caustic wit was biting-rude,
8. His heart was warm, benevolent, and good.
