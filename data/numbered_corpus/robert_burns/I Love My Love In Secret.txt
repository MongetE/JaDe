1. MY Sandy gied to me a ring,
2. Was a' beset wi' diamonds fine;
3. But I gied him a far better thing,
4. I gied my heart in pledge o' his ring.


5. Chorus.â€”My Sandy O, my Sandy O,
6. My bonie, bonie Sandy O;
7. Tho' the love that I owe
8. To thee I dare na show,
9. Yet I love my love in secret, my Sandy O.


10. My Sandy brak a piece o' gowd,
11. While down his cheeks the saut tears row'd;
12. He took a hauf, and gied it to me,
13. And I'll keep it till the hour I die.
14. My Sand O, &c.
