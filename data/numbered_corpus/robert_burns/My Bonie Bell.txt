1. THE SMILING Spring comes in rejoicing,
2. And surly Winter grimly flies;
3. Now crystal clear are the falling waters,
4. And bonie blue are the sunny skies.
5. Fresh o'er the mountains breaks forth the morning,
6. The ev'ning gilds the ocean's swell;
7. All creatures joy in the sun's returning,
8. And I rejoice in my bonie Bell.


9. The flowery Spring leads sunny Summer,
10. The yellow Autumn presses near;
11. Then in his turn comes gloomy Winter,
12. Till smiling Spring again appear:
13. Thus seasons dancing, life advancing,
14. Old Time and Nature their changes tell;
15. But never ranging, still unchanging,
16. I adore my bonie Bell.
