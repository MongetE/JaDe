1. BEHOLD, my love, how green the groves,
2. The primrose banks how fair;
3. The balmy gales awake the flowers,
4. And wave thy flowing hair.


5. The lav'rock shuns the palace gay,
6. And o'er the cottage sings:
7. For Nature smiles as sweet, I ween,
8. To Shepherds as to Kings.


9. Let minstrels sweep the skilfu' string,
10. In lordly lighted ha':
11. The Shepherd stops his simple reed,
12. Blythe in the birken shaw.


13. The Princely revel may survey
14. Our rustic dance wi' scorn;
15. But are their hearts as light as ours,
16. Beneath the milk-white thorn!


17. The shepherd, in the flowery glen;
18. In shepherd's phrase, will woo:
19. The courtier tells a finer tale,
20. But is his heart as true!


21. These wild-wood flowers I've pu'd, to deck
22. That spotless breast o' thine:
23. The courtiers' gems may witness love,
24. But, 'tis na love like mine.
