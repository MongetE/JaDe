1. A' YE wha live by sowps o' drink,
2. A' ye wha live by crambo-clink,
3. A' ye wha live and never think,
4. Come, mourn wi' me!
5. Our billie 's gien us a' a jink,
6. An' owre the sea!


7. Lament him a' ye rantin core,
8. Wha dearly like a random splore;
9. Nae mair he'll join the merry roar;
10. In social key;
11. For now he's taen anither shore.
12. An' owre the sea!


13. The bonie lasses weel may wiss him,
14. And in their dear petitions place him:
15. The widows, wives, an' a' may bless him
16. Wi' tearfu' e'e;
17. For weel I wat they'll sairly miss him
18. That's owre the sea!


19. O Fortune, they hae room to grumble!
20. Hadst thou taen aff some drowsy bummle,
21. Wha can do nought but fyke an' fumble,
22. 'Twad been nae plea;
23. But he was gleg as ony wumble,
24. That's owre the sea!


25. Auld, cantie Kyle may weepers wear,
26. An' stain them wi' the saut, saut tear;
27. 'Twill mak her poor auld heart, I fear,
28. In flinders flee:
29. He was her Laureat mony a year,
30. That's owre the sea!


31. He saw Misfortune's cauld nor-west
32. Lang mustering up a bitter blast;
33. A jillet brak his heart at last,
34. Ill may she be!
35. So, took a berth afore the mast,
36. An' owre the sea.


37. To tremble under Fortune's cummock,
38. On a scarce a bellyfu' o' drummock,
39. Wi' his proud, independent stomach,
40. Could ill agree;
41. So, row't his hurdies in a hammock,
42. An' owre the sea.


43. He ne'er was gien to great misguidin,
44. Yet coin his pouches wad na bide in;
45. Wi' him it ne'er was under hiding;
46. He dealt it free:
47. The Muse was a' that he took pride in,
48. That's owre the sea.


49. Jamaica bodies, use him weel,
50. An' hap him in cozie biel:
51. Ye'll find him aye a dainty chiel,
52. An' fou o' glee:
53. He wad na wrang'd the vera deil,
54. That's owre the sea.


55. Farewell, my rhyme-composing billie!
56. Your native soil was right ill-willie;
57. But may ye flourish like a lily,
58. Now bonilie!
59. I'll toast you in my hindmost gillie,
60. Tho' owre the sea!
