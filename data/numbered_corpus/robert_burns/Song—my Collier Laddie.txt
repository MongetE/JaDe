1. WHARE live ye, my bonie lass?
2. And tell me what they ca' ye;
3. My name, she says, is mistress Jean,
4. And I follow the Collier laddie.
5. My name, she says, &c.


6. See you not yon hills and dales
7. The sun shines on sae brawlie;
8. They a' are mine, and they shall be thine,
9. Gin ye'll leave your Collier laddie.
10. They a' are mine, &c.


11. Ye shall gang in gay attire,
12. Weel buskit up sae gaudy;
13. And ane to wait on every hand,
14. Gin ye'll leave your Collier laddie.
15. And ane to wait, &c.


16. Tho' ye had a' the sun shines on,
17. And the earth conceals sae lowly,
18. I wad turn my back on you and it a',
19. And embrace my Collier laddie.
20. I wad turn my back, &c.


21. I can win my five pennies in a day,
22. An' spen't at night fu' brawlie:
23. And make my bed in the collier's neuk,
24. And lie down wi' my Collier laddie.
25. And make my bed, &c.


26. Love for love is the bargain for me,
27. Tho' the wee cot-house should haud me;
28. And the warld before me to win my bread,
29. And fair fa' my Collier laddie!
30. And the warld before me, &c.
