1. FOR lords or kings I dinna mourn,
2. E'en let them die-for that they're born:
3. But oh! prodigious to reflec'!
4. A Towmont, sirs, is gane to wreck!
5. O Eighty-eight, in thy sma' space,
6. What dire events hae taken place!
7. Of what enjoyments thou hast reft us!
8. In what a pickle thou has left us!


9. The Spanish empire's tint a head,
10. And my auld teethless, Bawtie's dead:
11. The tulyie's teugh 'tween Pitt and Fox,
12. And 'tween our Maggie's twa wee cocks;
13. The tane is game, a bluidy devil,
14. But to the hen-birds unco civil;
15. The tither's something dour o' treadin,
16. But better stuff ne'er claw'd a middin.


17. Ye ministers, come mount the poupit,
18. An' cry till ye be hearse an' roupit,
19. For Eighty-eight, he wished you weel,
20. An' gied ye a' baith gear an' meal;
21. E'en monc a plack, and mony a peck,
22. Ye ken yoursels, for little feck!


23. Ye bonie lasses, dight your e'en,
24. For some o' you hae tint a frien';
25. In Eighty-eight, ye ken, was taen,
26. What ye'll ne'er hae to gie again.
27. Observe the very nowt an' sheep,
28. How dowff an' daviely they creep;
29. Nay, even the yirth itsel' does cry,
30. For E'nburgh wells are grutten dry.


31. O Eighty-nine, thou's but a bairn,
32. An' no owre auld, I hope, to learn!
33. Thou beardless boy, I pray tak care,
34. Thou now hast got thy Daddy's chair;
35. Nae handcuff'd, mizl'd, hap-shackl'd Regent,
36. But, like himsel, a full free agent,
37. Be sure ye follow out the plan
38. Nae waur than he did, honest man!
39. As muckle better as you can.January, 1, 1789.
