1. FAREWELL, ye dungeons dark and strong,
2. The wretch's destinie!
3. M'Pherson's time will not be long
4. On yonder gallows-tree.


5. Chorus.—Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,
6. Sae dauntingly gaed he;
7. He play'd a spring, and danc'd it round,
8. Below the gallows-tree.


9. O, what is death but parting breath?
10. On many a bloody plain
11. I've dared his face, and in this place
12. I scorn him yet again!
13. Sae rantingly, &c.

14. Untie these bands from off my hands,
15. And bring me to my sword;
16. And there's no a man in all Scotland
17. But I'll brave him at a word.
18. Sae rantingly, &c.

19. I've liv'd a life of sturt and strife;
20. I die by treacherie:
21. It burns my heart I must depart,
22. And not avengèd be.
23. Sae rantingly, &c.

24. Now farewell light, thou sunshine bright,
25. And all beneath the sky!
26. May coward shame distain his name,
27. The wretch that dares not die!
28. Sae rantingly, &c.
