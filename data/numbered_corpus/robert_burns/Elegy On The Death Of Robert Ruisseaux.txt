1. NOW Robin 1 lies in his last lair,
2. He'll gabble rhyme, nor sing nae mair;
3. Cauld poverty, wi' hungry stare,
4. Nae mair shall fear him;
5. Nor anxious fear, nor cankert care,
6. E'er mair come near him.


7. To tell the truth, they seldom fash'd him,
8. Except the moment that they crush'd him;
9. For sune as chance or fate had hush'd 'em
10. Tho' e'er sae short.
11. Then wi' a rhyme or sang he lash'd 'em,
12. And thought it sport.


13. Tho'he was bred to kintra-wark,
14. And counted was baith wight and stark,
15. Yet that was never Robin's mark
16. To mak a man;
17. But tell him, he was learn'd and clark,
18. Ye roos'd him then!
