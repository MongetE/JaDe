1. SWEET are the banksâ€”the banks o' Doon,
2. The spreading flowers are fair,
3. And everything is blythe and glad,
4. But I am fu' o' care.
5. Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
6. That sings upon the bough;
7. Thou minds me o' the happy days
8. When my fause Luve was true:
9. Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
10. That sings beside thy mate;
11. For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
12. And wist na o' my fate.


13. Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon,
14. To see the woodbine twine;
15. And ilka birds sang o' its Luve,
16. And sae did I o' mine:
17. Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose,
18. Upon its thorny tree;
19. But my fause Luver staw my rose
20. And left the thorn wi' me:
21. Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose,
22. Upon a morn in June;
23. And sae I flourished on the morn,
24. And sae was pu'd or noon!
