1. MY 1 heart is wae, and unco wae,
2. To think upon the raging sea,
3. That roars between her gardens green
4. An' the bonie Lass of Albany.


5. This lovely maid's of royal blood
6. That ruled Albion's kingdoms three,
7. But oh, alas! for her bonie face,
8. They've wrang'd the Lass of Albany.


9. In the rolling tide of spreading Clyde
10. There sits an isle of high degree,
11. And a town of fame whose princely name
12. Should grace the Lass of Albany.


13. But there's a youth, a witless youth,
14. That fills the place where she should be;
15. We'll send him o'er to his native shore,
16. And bring our ain sweet Albany.


17. Alas the day, and woe the day,
18. A false usurper wan the gree,
19. Who now commands the towers and landsâ€”
20. The royal right of Albany.


21. We'll daily pray, we'll nightly pray,
22. On bended knees most fervently,
23. The time may come, with pipe an' drum
24. We'll welcome hame fair Albany.
