1. Chorusâ€”Long, long the night,
2. Heavy comes the morrow
3. While my soul's delight
4. Is on her bed of sorrow.


5. CAN I cease to care?
6. Can I cease to languish,
7. While my darling Fair
8. Is on the couch of anguish?
9. Long, long, &c.

10. Ev'ry hope is fled,
11. Ev'ry fear is terror,
12. Slumber ev'n I dread,
13. Ev'ry dream is horror.
14. Long, long, &c.

15. Hear me, Powers Divine!
16. Oh, in pity, hear me!
17. Take aught else of mine,
18. But my Chloris spare me!
19. Long, long, &c.
