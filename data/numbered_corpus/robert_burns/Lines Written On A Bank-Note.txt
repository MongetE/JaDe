1. WAE worth thy power, thou cursed leaf!
2. Fell source o' a' my woe and grief!
3. For lack o' thee I've lost my lass!
4. For lack o' thee I scrimp my glass!
5. I see the children of affliction
6. Unaided, through thy curst restriction:
7. I've seen the oppressor's cruel smile
8. Amid his hapless victim's spoil;
9. And for thy potence vainly wished,
10. To crush the villain in the dust:
11. For lack o' thee, I leave this much-lov'd shore,
12. Never, perhaps, to greet old Scotland more.R. B.
