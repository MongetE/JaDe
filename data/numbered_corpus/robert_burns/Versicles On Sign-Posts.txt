1. CURS'D be the man, the poorest wretch in life,
2. The crouching vassal to a tyrant wife!
3. Who has no will but by her high permission,
4. Who has not sixpence but in her possession;
5. Who must to he, his dear friend's secrets tell,
6. Who dreads a curtain lecture worse than hell.
7. Were such the wife had fallen to my part,
8. I'd break her spirit or I'd break her heart;
9. I'd charm her with the magic of a switch,
10. I'd kiss her maids, and kick the perverse b——h.
