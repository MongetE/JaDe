1. HERE lies Johnie Pigeon;
2. What was his religion?
3. Whae'er desires to ken,
4. To some other warl'
5. Maun follow the carl,
6. For here Johnie Pigeon had nane!


7. Strong ale was ablution,
8. Small beer persecution,
9. A dram was memento mori;
10. But a full-flowing bowl
11. Was the saving his soul,
12. And port was celestial glory.
