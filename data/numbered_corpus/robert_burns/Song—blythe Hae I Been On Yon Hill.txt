1. BLYTHE hae I been on yon hill,
2. As the lambs before me;
3. Careless ilka thought and free,
4. As the breeze flew o'er me;
5. Now nae langer sport and play,
6. Mirth or sang can please me;
7. LESLEY is sae fair and coy,
8. Care and anguish seize me.


9. Heavy, heavy is the task,
10. Hopeless love declaring;
11. Trembling, I dow nocht but glow'r,
12. Sighing, dumb despairing!
13. If she winna ease the thraws
14. In my bosom swelling,
15. Underneath the grass-green sod,
16. Soon maun be my dwelling.
