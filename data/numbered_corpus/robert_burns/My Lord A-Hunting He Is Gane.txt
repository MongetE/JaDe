1. Chorus.â€”MY lady's gown, there's gairs upon't,
2. And gowden flowers sae rare upon't;
3. But Jenny's jimps and jirkinet,
4. My lord thinks meikle mair upon't.


5. My lord a-hunting he is gone,
6. But hounds or hawks wi' him are nane;
7. By Colin's cottage lies his game,
8. If Colin's Jenny be at hame.
9. My lady's gown, &c.

10. My lady's white, my lady's red,
11. And kith and kin o' Cassillis' blude;
12. But her ten-pund lands o' tocher gude;
13. Were a' the charms his lordship lo'ed.
14. My lady's gown, &c.

15. Out o'er yon muir, out o'er yon moss,
16. Whare gor-cocks thro' the heather pass,
17. There wons auld Colin's bonie lass,
18. A lily in a wilderness.
19. My lady's gown, &c.

20. Sae sweetly move her genty limbs,
21. Like music notes o'lovers' hymns:
22. The diamond-dew in her een sae blue,
23. Where laughing love sae wanton swims.
24. My lady's gown, &c.

25. My lady's dink, my lady's drest,
26. The flower and fancy o' the west;
27. But the lassie than a man lo'es best,
28. O that's the lass to mak him blest.
29. My lady's gown, &c.
