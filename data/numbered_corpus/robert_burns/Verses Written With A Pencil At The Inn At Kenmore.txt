1. ADMIRING Nature in her wildest grace,
2. These northern scenes with weary feet I trace;
3. O'er many a winding dale and painful steep,
4. Th' abodes of covey'd grouse and timid sheep,
5. My savage journey, curious, I pursue,
6. Till fam'd Breadalbane opens to my view.—
7. The meeting cliffs each deep-sunk glen divides,
8. The woods wild scatter'd, clothe their ample sides;
9. Th' outstretching lake, imbosomed 'mong the hills,
10. The eye with wonder and amazement fills;
11. The Tay meand'ring sweet in infant pride,
12. The palace rising on his verdant side,
13. The lawns wood-fring'd in Nature's native taste,
14. The hillocks dropt in Nature's careless haste,
15. The arches striding o'er the new-born stream,
16. The village glittering in the noontide beam—
17. · · · · · ·Poetic ardours in my bosom swell,
18. Lone wand'ring by the hermit's mossy cell;
19. The sweeping theatre of hanging woods,
20. Th' incessant roar of headlong tumbling floods—
21. · · · · · ·Here Poesy might wake her heav'n-taught lyre,
22. And look through Nature with creative fire;
23. Here, to the wrongs of Fate half reconcil'd,
24. Misfortunes lighten'd steps might wander wild;
25. And Disappointment, in these lonely bounds,
26. Find balm to soothe her bitter, rankling wounds:
27. Here heart-struck Grief might heav'nward stretch her scan,
28. And injur'd Worth forget and pardon man.
