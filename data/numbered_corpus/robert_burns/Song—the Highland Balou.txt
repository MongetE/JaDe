1. HEE balou, my sweet wee Donald,
2. Picture o' the great Clanronald;
3. Brawlie kens our wanton Chief
4. Wha gat my young Highland thief.


5. Leeze me on thy bonie craigie,
6. An' thou live, thou'll steal a naigie,
7. Travel the country thro' and thro',
8. And bring hame a Carlisle cow.


9. Thro' the Lawlands, o'er the Border,
10. Weel, my babie, may thou furder!
11. Herry the louns o' the laigh Countrie,
12. Syne to the Highlands hame to me.
