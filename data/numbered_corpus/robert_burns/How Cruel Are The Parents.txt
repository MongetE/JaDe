1. HOW cruel are the parents
2. Who riches only prize,
3. And to the wealthy booby
4. Poor Woman sacrifice!
5. Meanwhile, the hapless Daughter
6. Has but a choice of strife;
7. To shun a tyrant Father's hateâ€”
8. Become a wretched Wife.


9. The ravening hawk pursuing,
10. The trembling dove thus flies,
11. To shun impelling ruin,
12. Awhile her pinions tries;
13. Till, of escape despairing,
14. No shelter or retreat,
15. She trusts the ruthless Falconer,
16. And drops beneath his feet.
