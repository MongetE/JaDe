1. ALTHO' my back be at the wa',
2. And tho' he be the fautor;
3. Altho' my back be at the wa',
4. Yet, here's his health in water.
5. O wae gae by his wanton sides,
6. Sae brawlie's he could flatter;
7. Till for his sake I'm slighted sair,
8. And dree the kintra clatter:
9. But tho' my back be at the wa',
10. And tho' he be the fautor;
11. But tho' my back be at the wa',
12. Yet here's his health in water!
