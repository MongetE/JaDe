1. THE FRIEND whom, wild from Wisdom's way,
2. The fumes of wine infuriate send,
3. (Not moony madness more astray)
4. Who but deplores that hapless friend?


5. Mine was th' insensate frenzied part,
6. Ah! why should I such scenes outlive?
7. Scenes so abhorrent to my heart!â€”
8. 'Tis thine to pity and forgive.
