1. STOP, passenger! my story's brief,
2. And truth I shall relate, man;
3. I tell nae common tale o' grief,
4. For Matthew was a great man.


5. If thou uncommon merit hast,
6. Yet spurn'd at Fortune's door, man;
7. A look of pity hither cast,
8. For Matthew was a poor man.


9. If thou a noble sodger art,
10. That passest by this grave, man;
11. There moulders here a gallant heart,
12. For Matthew was a brave man.


13. If thou on men, their works and ways,
14. Canst throw uncommon light, man;
15. Here lies wha weel had won thy praise,
16. For Matthew was a bright man.


17. If thou, at Friendship's sacred ca',
18. Wad life itself resign, man:
19. Thy sympathetic tear maun fa',
20. For Matthew was a kind man.


21. If thou art staunch, without a stain,
22. Like the unchanging blue, man;
23. This was a kinsman o' thy ain,
24. For Matthew was a true man.


25. If thou hast wit, and fun, and fire,
26. And ne'er guid wine did fear, man;
27. This was thy billie, dam, and sire,
28. For Matthew was a queer man.


29. If ony whiggish, whingin' sot,
30. To blame poor Matthew dare, man;
31. May dool and sorrow be his lot,
32. For Matthew was a rare man.


33. But now, his radiant course is run,
34. For Matthew's was a bright one!
35. His soul was like the glorious sun,
36. A matchless, Heavenly light, man.
