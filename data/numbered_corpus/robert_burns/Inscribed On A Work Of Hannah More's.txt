1. THOU flatt'ring mark of friendship kind,
2. Still may thy pages call to mind
3. The dear, the beauteous donor;
4. Tho' sweetly female ev'ry part,
5. Yet such a head, and more the heart
6. Does both the sexes honour:
7. She show'd her taste refin'd and just,
8. When she selected thee;
9. Yet deviating, own I must,
10. For sae approving me:
11. But kind still I'll mind still
12. The giver in the gift;
13. I'll bless her, an' wiss her
14. A Friend aboon the lift.
