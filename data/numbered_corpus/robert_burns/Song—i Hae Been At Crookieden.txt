1. I HAE been at Crookieden,
2. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie,
3. Viewing Willie and his men,
4. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie.There our foes that burnt and slew,
5. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie,
6. There, at last, they gat their due,
7. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie.

8. Satan sits in his black neuk,
9. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie,
10. Breaking sticks to roast the Duke,
11. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie,
12. The bloody monster gae a yell,
13. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie.And loud the laugh gied round a' hell
14. My bonie laddie, Highland laddie.
