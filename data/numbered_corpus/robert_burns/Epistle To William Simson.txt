1. I GAT your letter, winsome Willie;
2. Wi' gratefu' heart I thank you brawlie;
3. Tho' I maun say't, I wad be silly,
4. And unco vain,
5. Should I believe, my coaxin billie
6. Your flatterin strain.


7. But I'se believe ye kindly meant it:
8. I sud be laith to think ye hinted
9. Ironic satire, sidelins sklented
10. On my poor Musie;
11. Tho' in sic phraisin terms ye've penn'd it,
12. I scarce excuse ye.


13. My senses wad be in a creel,
14. Should I but dare a hope to speel
15. Wi' Allan, or wi' Gilbertfield,
16. The braes o' fame;
17. Or Fergusson, the writer-chiel,
18. A deathless name.


19. (O Fergusson! thy glorious parts
20. Ill suited law's dry, musty arts!
21. My curse upon your whunstane hearts,
22. Ye E'nbrugh gentry!
23. The tithe o' what ye waste at cartes
24. Wad stow'd his pantry!)


25. Yet when a tale comes i' my head,
26. Or lassies gie my heart a screedâ€”
27. As whiles they're like to be my dead,
28. (O sad disease!)
29. I kittle up my rustic reed;
30. It gies me ease.


31. Auld Coila now may fidge fu' fain,
32. She's gotten poets o' her ain;
33. Chiels wha their chanters winna hain,
34. But tune their lays,
35. Till echoes a' resound again
36. Her weel-sung praise.


37. Nae poet thought her worth his while,
38. To set her name in measur'd style;
39. She lay like some unkenn'd-of-isle
40. Beside New Holland,
41. Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil
42. Besouth Magellan.


43. Ramsay an' famous Fergusson
44. Gied Forth an' Tay a lift aboon;
45. Yarrow an' Tweed, to monie a tune,
46. Owre Scotland rings;
47. While Irwin, Lugar, Ayr, an' Doon
48. Naebody sings.


49. Th' Illissus, Tiber, Thames, an' Seine,
50. Glide sweet in monie a tunefu' line:
51. But Willie, set your fit to mine,
52. An' cock your crest;
53. We'll gar our streams an' burnies shine
54. Up wi' the best!


55. We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells,
56. Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells,
57. Her banks an' braes, her dens and dells,
58. Whare glorious Wallace
59. Aft bure the gree, as story tells,
60. Frae Suthron billies.


61. At Wallace' name, what Scottish blood
62. But boils up in a spring-tide flood!
63. Oft have our fearless fathers strode
64. By Wallace' side,
65. Still pressing onward, red-wat-shod,
66. Or glorious died!


67. O, sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods,
68. When lintwhites chant amang the buds,
69. And jinkin hares, in amorous whids,
70. Their loves enjoy;
71. While thro' the braes the cushat croods
72. With wailfu' cry!


73. Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me,
74. When winds rave thro' the naked tree;
75. Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree
76. Are hoary gray;
77. Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee,
78. Dark'ning the day!


79. O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms
80. To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms!
81. Whether the summer kindly warms,
82. Wi' life an light;
83. Or winter howls, in gusty storms,
84. The lang, dark night!


85. The muse, nae poet ever fand her,
86. Till by himsel he learn'd to wander,
87. Adown some trottin burn's meander,
88. An' no think lang:
89. O sweet to stray, an' pensive ponder
90. A heart-felt sang!


91. The war'ly race may drudge an' drive,
92. Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch, an' strive;
93. Let me fair Nature's face descrive,
94. And I, wi' pleasure,
95. Shall let the busy, grumbling hive
96. Bum owre their treasure.


97. Fareweel, "my rhyme-composing" brither!
98. We've been owre lang unkenn'd to ither:
99. Now let us lay our heads thegither,
100. In love fraternal:
101. May envy wallop in a tether,
102. Black fiend, infernal!


103. While Highlandmen hate tools an' taxes;
104. While moorlan's herds like guid, fat braxies;
105. While terra firma, on her axis,
106. Diurnal turns;
107. Count on a friend, in faith an' practice,
108. In Robert Burns.


109. POSTCRIPTMY memory's no worth a preen;
110. I had amaist forgotten clean,
111. Ye bade me write you what they mean
112. By this "new-light,"
113. 'Bout which our herds sae aft hae been
114. Maist like to fight.


115. In days when mankind were but callans
116. At grammar, logic, an' sic talents,
117. They took nae pains their speech to balance,
118. Or rules to gie;
119. But spak their thoughts in plain, braid lallans,
120. Like you or me.


121. In thae auld times, they thought the moon,
122. Just like a sark, or pair o' shoon,
123. Wore by degrees, till her last roon
124. Gaed past their viewin;
125. An' shortly after she was done
126. They gat a new ane.


127. This passed for certain, undisputed;
128. It ne'er cam i' their heads to doubt it,
129. Till chiels gat up an' wad confute it,
130. An' ca'd it wrang;
131. An' muckle din there was about it,
132. Baith loud an' lang.


133. Some herds, weel learn'd upo' the beuk,
134. Wad threap auld folk the thing misteuk;
135. For 'twas the auld moon turn'd a neuk
136. An' out of' sight,
137. An' backlins-comin to the leuk
138. She grew mair bright.


139. This was deny'd, it was affirm'd;
140. The herds and hissels were alarm'd
141. The rev'rend gray-beards rav'd an' storm'd,
142. That beardless laddies
143. Should think they better wer inform'd,
144. Than their auld daddies.


145. Frae less to mair, it gaed to sticks;
146. Frae words an' aiths to clours an' nicks;
147. An monie a fallow gat his licks,
148. Wi' hearty crunt;
149. An' some, to learn them for their tricks,
150. Were hang'd an' brunt.


151. This game was play'd in mony lands,
152. An' auld-light caddies bure sic hands,
153. That faith, the youngsters took the sands
154. Wi' nimble shanks;
155. Till lairds forbad, by strict commands,
156. Sic bluidy pranks.


157. But new-light herds gat sic a cowe,
158. Folk thought them ruin'd stick-an-stowe;
159. Till now, amaist on ev'ry knowe
160. Ye'll find ane plac'd;
161. An' some their new-light fair avow,
162. Just quite barefac'd.


163. Nae doubt the auld-light flocks are bleatin;
164. Their zealous herds are vex'd an' sweatin;
165. Mysel', I've even seen them greetin
166. Wi' girnin spite,
167. To hear the moon sae sadly lied on
168. By word an' write.


169. But shortly they will cowe the louns!
170. Some auld-light herds in neebor touns
171. Are mind't, in things they ca' balloons,
172. To tak a flight;
173. An' stay ae month amang the moons
174. An' see them right.


175. Guid observation they will gie them;
176. An' when the auld moon's gaun to lea'e them,
177. The hindmaist shaird, they'll fetch it wi' them
178. Just i' their pouch;
179. An' when the new-light billies see them,
180. I think they'll crouch!


181. Sae, ye observe that a' this clatter
182. Is naething but a "moonshine matter";
183. But tho' dull prose-folk Latin splatter
184. In logic tulyie,
185. I hope we bardies ken some better
186. Than mind sic brulyie.
