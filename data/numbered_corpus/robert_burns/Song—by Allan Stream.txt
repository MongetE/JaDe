1. BY Allan stream I chanc'd to rove,
2. While Phoebus sank beyond Benledi;
3. The winds are whispering thro' the grove,
4. The yellow corn was waving ready:
5. I listen'd to a lover's sang,
6. An' thought on youthfu' pleasures mony;
7. And aye the wild-wood echoes rang—
8. "O, dearly do I love thee, Annie!


9. "O, happy be the woodbine bower,
10. Nae nightly bogle make it eerie;
11. Nor ever sorrow stain the hour,
12. The place and time I met my Dearie!
13. Her head upon my throbbing breast,
14. She, sinking, said, ‘I'm thine for ever!'
15. While mony a kiss the seal imprest—
16. The sacred vow we ne'er should sever."


17. The haunt o' Spring's the primrose-brae,
18. The Summer joys the flocks to follow;
19. How cheery thro' her short'ning day,
20. Is Autumn in her weeds o' yellow;
21. But can they melt the glowing heart,
22. Or chain the soul in speechless pleasure?
23. Or thro' each nerve the rapture dart,
24. Like meeting her, our bosom's treasure?
