1. STAY my charmer, can you leave me?
2. Cruel, cruel to deceive me;
3. Well you know how much you grieve me;
4. Cruel charmer, can you go!
5. Cruel charmer, can you go!


6. By my love so ill-requited,
7. By the faith you fondly plighted,
8. By the pangs of lovers slighted,
9. Do not, do not liave me so!
10. Do not, do not leave me so!
