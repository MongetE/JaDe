1. AN HONEST man here lies at rest
2. As e'er God with his image blest;
3. The friend of man, the friend of truth,
4. The friend of age, and guide of youth:
5. Few hearts like his, with virtue warm'd,
6. Few heads with knowledge so informed:
7. If there's another world, he lives in bliss;
8. If there is none, he made the best of this.
