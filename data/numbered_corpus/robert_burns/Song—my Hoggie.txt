1. WHAT will I do gin my Hoggie die?
2. My joy, my pride, my Hoggie!
3. My only beast, I had nae mae,
4. And vow but I was vogie!
5. The lee-lang night we watch'd the fauld,
6. Me and my faithfu' doggie;
7. We heard nocht but the roaring linn,
8. Amang the braes sae scroggie.


9. But the houlet cry'd frau the castle wa',
10. The blitter frae the boggie;
11. The tod reply'd upon the hill,
12. I trembled for my Hoggie.
13. When day did daw, and cocks did craw,
14. The morning it was foggie;
15. An unco tyke, lap o'er the dyke,
16. And maist has kill'd my Hoggie!
