1. In the glad springtime when leaves were green,
2. O merrily the throstle sings!
3. I sought, amid the tangled sheen,
4. Love whom mine eyes had never seen,
5. O the glad dove has golden wings!

6. Between the blossoms red and white,
7. O merrily the throstle sings!
8. My love first came into my sight,
9. O perfect vision of delight,
10. O the glad dove has golden wings!

11. The yellow apples glowed like fire,
12. O merrily the throstle sings!
13. O Love too great for lip or lyre,
14. Blown rose of love and of desire,
15. O the glad dove has golden wings!

16. But now with snow the tree is grey,
17. Ah, sadly now the throstle sings!
18. My love is dead: ah! well-a-day,
19. See at her silent feet I lay
20. A dove with broken wings!
21. Ah, Love! ah, Love! that thou wert slain -
22. Fond Dove, fond Dove return again!
