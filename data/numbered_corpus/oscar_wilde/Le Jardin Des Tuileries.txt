1. This winter air is keen and cold,
2. And keen and cold this winter sun,
3. But round my chair the children run
4. Like little things of dancing gold.

5. Sometimes about the painted kiosk
6. The mimic soldiers strut and stride,
7. Sometimes the blue-eyed brigands hide
8. In the bleak tangles of the bosk.

9. And sometimes, while the old nurse cons
10. Her book, they steal across the square,
11. And launch their paper navies where
12. Huge Triton writhes in greenish bronze.

13. And now in mimic flight they flee,
14. And now they rush, a boisterous band -
15. And, tiny hand on tiny hand,
16. Climb up the black and leafless tree.

17. Ah! cruel tree! if I were you,
18. And children climbed me, for their sake
19. Though it be winter I would break
20. Into spring blossoms white and blue!
