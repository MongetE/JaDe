1. A RING of gold and a milk-white dove
2. Are goodly gifts for thee,
3. And a hempen rope for your own love
4. To hang upon a tree.

5. For you a House of Ivory
6. (Roses are white in the rose-bower)!
7. A narrow bed for me to lie
8. (White, O white, is the hemlock flower)!

9. Myrtle and jessamine for you
10. (O the red rose is fair to see)!
11. For me the cypress and the rue
12. (Fairest of all is rose-mary)!

13. For you three lovers of your hand
14. (Green grass where a man lies dead)!
15. For me three paces on the sand
16. (Plant lilies at my head)!
