1. Against these turbid turquoise skies
2. The light and luminous balloons
3. Dip and drift like satin moons
4. Drift like silken butterflies;

5. Reel with every windy gust,
6. Rise and reel like dancing girls,
7. Float like strange transparent pearls,
8. Fall and float like silver dust.

9. Now to the low leaves they cling,
10. Each with coy fantastic pose,
11. Each a petal of a rose
12. Straining at a gossamer string.

13. Then to the tall trees they climb,
14. Like thin globes of amethyst,
15. Wandering opals keeping tryst
16. With the rubies of the lime.
