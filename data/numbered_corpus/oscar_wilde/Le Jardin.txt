1. The lily's withered chalice falls
2. Around its rod of dusty gold,
3. And from the beech-trees on the wold
4. The last wood-pigeon coos and calls.

5. The gaudy leonine sunflower
6. Hangs black and barren on its stalk,
7. And down the windy garden walk
8. The dead leaves scatter, - hour by hour.

9. Pale privet-petals white as milk
10. Are blown into a snowy mass:
11. The roses lie upon the grass
12. Like little shreds of crimson silk.
