1. Beautiful star with the crimson lips
2. And flagrant daffodil hair,
3. Come back, come back, in the shaking ships
4. O'er the much-overrated sea,
5. To the hearts that are sick for thee
6. With a woe worse than mal de mer-
7. O beautiful stars with the crimson lips
8. And the flagrant daffodil hair. -
9. O ship that shakes on the desolate sea,
10. Neath the flag of the wan White Star,
11. Thou bringest a brighter star with thee
12. From the land of the Philistine,
13. Where Niagara's reckoned fine
14. And Tupper is popular-
15. O ship that shakes on the desolate sea,
16. Neath the flag of the wan White Star.
