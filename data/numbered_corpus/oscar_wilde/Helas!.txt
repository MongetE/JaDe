1. To drift with every passion till my soul
2. Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play,
3. Is it for this that I have given away
4. Mine ancient wisdom, and austere control?-
5. Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll
6. Scrawled over on some boyish holiday
7. With idle songs for pipe and virelay
8. Which do but mar the secret of the whole.
9. Surely that was a time I might have trod
10. The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance
11. Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God;
12. is that time dead? lo! with a little rod
13. I did but touch the honey of romance-
14. And must I lose a soul's inheritance?
