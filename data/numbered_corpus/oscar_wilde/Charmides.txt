1. HE was a Grecian lad, who coming home
2. With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily
3. Stood at his galley's prow, and let the foam
4. Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,
5. And holding wave and wind in boy's despite
6. Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night

7. Till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear
8. Like a thin thread of gold against the sky,
9. And hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,
10. And bade the pilot head her lustily
11. Against the nor'west gale, and all day long
12. Held on his way, and marked the rowers' time with measured song,

13. And when the faint Corinthian hills were red
14. Dropped anchor in a little sandy bay,
15. And with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,
16. And brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,
17. And washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold
18. Brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,

19. And a rich robe stained with the fishes' juice
20. Which of some swarthy trader he had bought
21. Upon the sunny quay at Syracuse,
22. And was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,
23. And by the questioning merchants made his way
24. Up through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day

25. Had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,
26. Clomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet
27. Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd
28. Of busy priests, and from some dark retreat
29. Watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring
30. The firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling

31. The crackling salt upon the flame, or hang
32. His studded crook against the temple wall
33. To Her who keeps away the ravenous fang
34. Of the base wolf from homestead and from stall;
35. And then the clear-voiced maidens 'gan to sing,
36. And to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,

37. A beechen cup brimming with milky foam,
38. A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery
39. Of hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb
40. Dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee
41. Had ceased from building, a black skin of oil
42. Meet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked
43. spoil

44. Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid
45. To please Athena, and the dappled hide
46. Of a tall stag who in some mountain glade
47. Had met the shaft; and then the herald cried,
48. And from the pillared precinct one by one
49. Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had
50. done.

51. And the old priest put out the waning fires
52. Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed
53. For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres
54. Came fainter on the wind, as down the road
55. In joyous dance these country folk did pass,
56. And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.

57. Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,
58. And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,
59. And the rose-petals falling from the wreath
60. As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,
61. And seemed to be in some entrancèd swoon
62. Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon

63. Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,
64. When from his nook upleapt the venturous lad,
65. And flinging wide the cedar-carven door
66. Beheld an awful image saffron-clad
67. And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared
68. From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared

69. Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled
70. The Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,
71. And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,
72. And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold
73. In passion impotent, while with blind gaze
74. The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.

75. The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp
76. Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast
77. The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp
78. Of horses smite the waves, and a wild blast
79. Divide the folded curtains of the night,
80. And knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.

81. And guilty lovers in their venery
82. Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,
83. Deeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;
84. And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats
85. Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,
86. Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.

87. For round the temple rolled the clang of arms,
88. And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,
89. And the air quaked with dissonant alarums
90. Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,
91. And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,
92. And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.

93. Ready for death with parted lips he stood,
94. And well content at such a price to see
95. That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,
96. The marvel of that pitiless chastity,
97. Ah! well content indeed, for never wight
98. Since Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.

99. Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air
100. Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,
101. And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,
102. And from his limbs he threw the cloak away,
103. For whom would not such love make desperate,
104. And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate

105. Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,
106. And bared the breasts of polished ivory,
107. Till from the waist the peplos falling down
108. Left visible the secret mystery
109. Which to no lover will Athena show,
110. The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of snow.

111. Those who have never known a lover's sin
112. Let them not read my ditty, it will be
113. To their dull ears so musicless and thin
114. That they will have no joy of it, but ye
115. To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,
116. Ye who have learned who Eros is,--O listen yet a-while.

117. A little space he let his greedy eyes
118. Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight
119. Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,
120. And then his lips in hungering delight
121. Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck
122. He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.

123. Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,
124. For all night long he murmured honeyed word,
125. And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed
126. Her pale and argent body undisturbed,
127. And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed
128. His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.

129. It was as if Numidian javelins
130. Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,
131. And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins
132. In exquisite pulsation, and the pain
133. Was such sweet anguish that he never drew
134. His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.

135. They who have never seen the daylight peer
136. Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,
137. And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear
138. And worshipped body risen, they for certain
139. Will never know of what I try to sing,
140. How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.

141. The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,
142. The sign which shipmen say is ominous
143. Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,
144. And the low lightening east was tremulous
145. With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,
146. Ere from the silent sombre shrine this lover had withdrawn.

147. Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast
148. Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,
149. And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,
150. And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran
151. Like a young fawn unto an olive wood
152. Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood.

153. And sought a little stream, which well he knew,
154. For oftentimes with boyish careless shout
155. The green and crested grebe he would pursue,
156. Or snare in woven net the silver trout,
157. And down amid the startled reeds he lay
158. Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.

159. On the green bank he lay, and let one hand
160. Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,
161. And soon the breath of morning came and fanned
162. His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly
163. The tangled curls from off his forehead, while
164. He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.

165. And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak
166. With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,
167. And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke
168. Curled through the air across the ripening oats,
169. And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed
170. As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.

171. And when the light-foot mower went afield
172. Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,
173. And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,
174. And from its nest the waking corn-crake flew,
175. Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream
176. And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,

177. Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,
178. 'It is young Hylas, that false runaway
179. Who with a Naiad now would make his bed
180. Forgetting Herakles,' but others, 'Nay,
181. It is Narcissus, his own paramour,
182. Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.'

183. And when they nearer came a third one cried,
184. 'It is young Dionysos who has hid
185. His spear and fawnskin by the river side
186. Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,
187. And wise indeed were we away to fly
188. They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.'

189. So turned they back, and feared to look behind,
190. And told the timid swain how they had seen
191. Amid the reeds some woodland God reclined,
192. And no man dared to cross the open green,
193. And on that day no olive-tree was slain,
194. Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain.

195. Save when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail
196. Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound
197. Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail
198. Hoping that he some comrade new had found,
199. And gat no answer, and then half afraid
200. Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade

201. A little girl ran laughing from the farm
202. Not thinking of love's secret mysteries,
203. And when she saw the white and gleaming arm
204. And all his manlihood, with longing eyes
205. Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity
206. Watched him a-while, and then stole back sadly and wearily.

207. Far off he heard the city's hum and noise,
208. And now and then the shriller laughter where
209. The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys
210. Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,
211. And now and then a little tinkling bell
212. As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.

213. Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,
214. The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,
215. In sleek and oily coat the water-rat
216. Breasting the little ripples manfully
217. Made for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough
218. Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough.

219. On the faint wind floated the silky seeds,
220. As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,
221. The ousel-cock splashed circles in the reeds
222. And flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,
223. Which scarce had caught again its imagery
224. Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragonfly.

225. But little care had he for any thing
226. Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,
227. And from the copse the linnet 'gan to sing
228. To her brown mate her sweetest serenade,
229. Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen
230. The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.

231. But when the herdsman called his straggling goats
232. With whistling pipe across the rocky road,
233. And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes
234. Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode
235. Of coming storm, and the belated crane
236. Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain

237. Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,
238. And from the gloomy forest went his way
239. Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,
240. And came at last unto a little quay,
241. And called his mates a-board, and took his seat
242. On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping
243. sheet,

244. And steered across the bay, and when nine suns
245. Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,
246. And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons
247. To the chaste stars their confessors, or told
248. Their dearest secret to the downy moth
249. That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth

250. Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes
251. And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked
252. As though the lading of three argosies
253. Were in the hold, and flapped its wings, and shrieked,
254. And darkness straightway stole across the deep,
255. Sheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,

256. And the moon hid behind a tawny mask
257. Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge
258. Rose the red plume, the huge and hornèd casque,
259. The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!
260. And clad in bright and burnished panoply
261. Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!

262. To the dull sailors' sight her loosened locks
263. Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet
264. Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,
265. And marking how the rising waters beat
266. Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried
267. To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side.

268. But he, the over-bold adulterer,
269. A dear profaner of great mysteries,
270. An ardent amorous idolater,
271. When he beheld those grand relentless eyes
272. Laughed loud for joy, and crying out 'I come'
273. Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.

274. Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,
275. One dancer left the circling galaxy,
276. And back to Athens on her clattering car
277. In all the pride of venged divinity
278. Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,
279. And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.

280. And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew
281. With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,
282. And the old pilot bade the trembling crew
283. Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen
284. Close to the stern a dim and giant form,
285. And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.

286. And no man dared to speak of Charmides
287. Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,
288. And when they reached the strait Symplegades
289. They beached their galley on the shore, and sought
290. The toll-gate of the city hastily,
291. And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.

292. II.
293. But some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare
294. The boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,
295. And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair
296. And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand,
297. Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,
298. And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.

299. And when he neared his old Athenian home,
300. A mighty billow rose up suddenly
301. Upon whose oily back the clotted foam
302. Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,
303. And clasping him unto its glassy breast,
304. Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!

305. Now where Colonos leans unto the sea
306. There lies a long and level stretch of lawn,
307. The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee
308. For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun
309. Is not afraid, for never through the day
310. Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.

311. But often from the thorny labyrinth
312. And tangled branches of the circling wood
313. The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth
314. Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood
315. Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,
316. Nor dares to wind his horn, or--else at the first break of day

317. The Dyrads come and throw the leathern ball
318. Along the reedy shore, and circumvent
319. Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal
320. For fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,
321. And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,
322. Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.

323. On this side and on that a rocky cave,
324. Hung with the yellow-bell'd laburnum, stands,
325. Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave
326. Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,
327. As though it feared to be too soon forgot
328. By the green rush, its playfellow,--and yet, it is a spot

329. So small, that the inconstant butterfly
330. Could steal the hoarded honey from each flower
331. Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy
332. Its over-greedy love,--within an hour
333. A sailor boy, were he but rude enow
334. To land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,

335. Would almost leave the little meadow bare,
336. For it knows nothing of great pageantry,
337. Only a few narcissi here and there
338. Stand separate in sweet austerity,
339. Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,
340. And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimetars.

341. Hither the billow brought him, and was glad
342. Of such dear servitude, and where the land
343. Was virgin of all waters laid the lad
344. Upon the golden margent of the strand,
345. And like a lingering lover oft returned
346. To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,

347. Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,
348. That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,
349. Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost
350. Had withered up those lilies white and red
351. Which, while the boy would through the forest range,
352. Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counterchange.

353. And when at dawn the woodnymphs, hand-in-hand,
354. Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied
355. The boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,
356. And feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,
357. And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade,
358. Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.

359. Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be
360. So dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms
361. Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,
362. And longed to listen to those subtle charms
363. Insidious lovers weave when they would win
364. Some fencèd fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin

365. To yield her treasure unto one so fair,
366. And lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,
367. Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,
368. And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth
369. Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid
370. Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,

371. Returned to fresh assault, and all day long
372. Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,
373. And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,
374. Then frowned to see how froward was the boy
375. Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,
376. Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine,

377. Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,
378. But said, 'He will awake, I know him well,
379. He will awake at evening when the sun
380. Hangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel,
381. This sleep is but a cruel treachery
382. To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea

383. Deeper than ever falls the fisher's line
384. Already a huge Triton blows his horn,
385. And weaves a garland from the crystalline
386. And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn
387. The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,
388. For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral-crownèd head,

389. We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,
390. And a blue wave will be our canopy,
391. And at our feet the water-snakes will curl
392. In all their amethystine panoply
393. Of diamonded mail, and we will mark
394. The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,

395. Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold
396. Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep
397. His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,
398. And we will see the painted dolphins sleep
399. Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks
400. Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.

401. And tremulous opal-hued anemones
402. Will wave their purple fringes where we tread
403. Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies
404. Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread
405. The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,
406. And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.'

407. But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun
408. With gaudy pennon flying passed away
409. Into his brazen House, and one by one
410. The little yellow stars began to stray
411. Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed
412. She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,

413. And cried, 'Awake, already the pale moon
414. Washes the trees with silver, and the wave
415. Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,
416. The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave
417. The night-jar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,
418. And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky
419. grass.

420. Nay, though thou art a God, be not so coy,
421. For in yon stream there is a little reed
422. That often whispers how a lovely boy
423. Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,
424. Who when his cruel pleasure he had done
425. Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.

426. Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still
427. With great Apollo's kisses, and the fir
428. Whose clustering sisters fringe the sea-ward hill
429. Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher
430. Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen
431. The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.

432. Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,
433. And every morn a young and ruddy swain
434. Wooes me with apples and with locks of hair,
435. And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain
436. By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;
437. But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove

438. With little crimson feet, which with its store
439. Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad
440. Had stolen from the lofty sycamore
441. At day-break, when her amorous comrade had
442. Flown off in search of berried juniper
443. Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager

444. Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency
445. So constant as this simple shepherd-boy
446. For my poor lips, his joyous purity
447. And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy
448. A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;
449. For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss,

450. His argent forehead, like a rising moon
451. Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,
452. Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon
453. Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse
454. For Cytheræa, the first silky down
455. Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and
456. brown:

457. And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds
458. Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,
459. And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds
460. Is in his homestead for the thievish fly
461. To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead
462. Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.

463. And yet I love him not, it was for thee
464. I kept my love, I knew that thou would'st come
465. To rid me of this pallid chastity;
466. Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam
467. Of all the wide Ægean, brightest star
468. Of ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!

469. I knew that thou would'st come, for when at first
470. The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of Spring
471. Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst
472. To myriad multitudinous blossoming
473. Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons
474. That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes' rapturous tunes

475. Startled the squirrel from its granary,
476. And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,
477. Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy
478. Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein
479. Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,
480. And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.

481. The trooping fawns at evening came and laid
482. Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs
483. And on my topmost branch the blackbird made
484. A little nest of grasses for his spouse,
485. And now and then a twittering wren would light
486. On a thin twig which hardly bare the weigh of such delight.

487. I was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,
488. Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,
489. And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase
490. The timorous girl, till tired out with play
491. She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,
492. And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare.

493. Then come away unto my ambuscade
494. Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy
495. For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade
496. Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify
497. The dearest rites of love, there in the cool
498. And green recesses of its farthest depth there is a pool,

499. The ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,
500. For round its rim great creamy lilies float
501. Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,
502. Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat
503. Steered by a dragon-fly,--be not afraid
504. To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place were made

505. For lovers such as we, the Cyprian Queen,
506. One arm around her boyish paramour,
507. Strays often there at eve, and I have seen
508. The moon strip off her misty vestiture
509. For young Endymion's eyes, be not afraid,
510. The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.

511. Nay if thou wil'st, back to the beating brine,
512. Back to the boisterous billow let us go,
513. And walk all day beneath the hyaline
514. Huge vault of Neptune's watery portico,
515. And watch the purple monsters of the deep
516. Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.

517. For if my mistress find me lying here
518. She will not ruth or gentle pity show,
519. But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere
520. Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,
521. And draw the feathered notch against her breast,
522. And loose the archèd cord, ay, even now upon the quest

523. I hear her hurrying feet,--awake, awake,
524. Thou laggard in love's battle! once at least
525. Let me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake
526. My parchèd being with the nectarous feast
527. Which even Gods affect! O come Love come,
528. Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.'

529. Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees
530. Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air
531. Grew conscious of a God, and the grey seas
532. Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare
533. Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,
534. And like a flame a barbèd reed flew whizzing down the glade.

535. And where the little flowers of her breast
536. Just brake into their milky blossoming,
537. This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,
538. Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,
539. And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,
540. And dug a long red road, and cleft with wingèd death her heart.

541. Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry
542. On the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,
543. Sobbing for incomplete virginity,
544. And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,
545. And all the pain of things unsatisfied,
546. And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing
547. side.

548. Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,
549. And very pitiful to see her die
550. Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known
551. The joy of passion, that dread mystery
552. Which not to know is not to live at all,
553. And yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.

554. But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,
555. Who with Adonis all night long had lain
556. Within some shepherd's hut in Arcady,
557. On team of silver doves and gilded wane
558. Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar
559. From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,

560. And when low down she spied the hapless pair,
561. And heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,
562. Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air
563. As though it were a viol, hastily
564. She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,
565. And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous
566. doom.

567. For as a gardener turning back his head
568. To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows
569. With careless scythe too near some flower bed,
570. And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,
571. And with the flower's loosened loveliness
572. Strews the brown mould, or as some shepherd lad in wantonness

573. Driving his little flock along the mead
574. Treads down two daffodils which side by side
575. Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede
576. And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,
577. Treads down their brimming golden chalices
578. Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages,

579. Or as a schoolboy tired of his book
580. Flings himself down upon the reedy grass
581. And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,
582. And for a time forgets the hour glass,
583. Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,
584. And lets the hot sun kill them, even so these lovers lay.

585. And Venus cried, 'It is dread Artemis
586. Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,
587. Or else that mightier may whose care it is
588. To guard her strong and stainless majesty
589. Upon the hill Athenian,--alas!
590. That they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should pass.

591. So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl
592. In the great golden waggon tenderly,
593. Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl
594. Just threaded with a blue vein's tapestry
595. Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast
596. Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest.

597. And then each pigeon spread its milky van,
598. The bright car soared into the dawning sky,
599. And like a cloud the aerial caravan
600. Passed over the Ægean silently,
601. Till the faint air was troubled with the song
602. From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.

603. But when the doves had reached their wonted goal
604. Where the wide stair of orbèd marble dips
605. Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul
606. Just shook the trembling petals of her lips
607. And passed into the void, and Venus knew
608. That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,

609. And bade her servants carve a cedar chest
610. With all the wonder of this history,
611. Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest
612. Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky
613. On the low hills of Paphos, and the faun
614. Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.

615. Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere
616. The morning bee had stung the daffodil
617. With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair
618. The waking stag had leapt across the rill
619. And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept
620. Athwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.

621. And when day brake, within that silver shrine
622. Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,
623. Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine
624. That she whose beauty made Death amorous
625. Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,
626. And let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.

627. III.
628. In melancholy moonless Acheron,
629. Far from the goodly earth and joyous day,
630. Where no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun
631. Weighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May
632. Chequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,
633. Where thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,

634. There by a dim and dark Lethæan well
635. Young Charmides was lying, wearily
636. He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,
637. And with its little rifled treasury
638. Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,
639. And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a
640. dream,

641. When as he gazed into the watery glass
642. And through his brown hair's curly tangles scanned
643. His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass
644. Across the mirror, and a little hand
645. Stole into his, and warm lips timidly
646. Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh.

647. Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,
648. And ever nigher still their faces came,
649. And nigher ever did their young mouths draw
650. Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,
651. And longing arms around her neck he cast,
652. And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,

653. And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,
654. And all her maidenhood was his to slay,
655. And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss
656. Their passion waxed and waned,--O why essay
657. To pipe again of love too venturous reed!
658. Enough, enough that Erôs laughed upon that flowerless mead.

659. Too venturous poesy O why essay
660. To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings
661. O'er daring Icarus and bid thy lay
662. Sleep hidden in the lyre's silent strings,
663. Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,
664. Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho's golden quill!

665. Enough, enough that he whose life had been
666. A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,
667. Could in the loveless land of Hades glean
668. One scorching harvest from those fields of flame
669. Where passion walks with naked unshod feet
670. And is not wounded,--ah! enough that once their lips could meet

671. In that wild throb when all existences
672. Seem narrowed to one single ecstasy
673. Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress
674. Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone
675. Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne
676. Of the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone.
