1. (To Sarah Bernhardt)

2. How vain and dull this common world must seem
3. To such a One as thou, who should'st have talked
4. At Florence with Mirandola, or walked
5. Through the cool olives of the Academe:
6. Thou should'st have gathered reeds from a green stream
7. For Goat-foot Pan's shrill piping, and have played
8. With the white girls in that Phaeacian glade
9. Where grave Odysseus wakened from his dream.

10. Ah! surely once some urn of Attic clay
11. Held thy wan dust, and thou hast come again
12. Back to this common world so dull and vain,
13. For thou wert weary of the sunless day,
14. The heavy fields of scentless asphodel,
15. The loveless lips with which men kiss in Hell.
