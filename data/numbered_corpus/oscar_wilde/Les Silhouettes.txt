1. The sea is flecked with bars of grey,
2. The dull dead wind is out of tune,
3. And like a withered leaf the moon
4. Is blown across the stormy bay.

5. Etched clear upon the pallid sand
6. Lies the black boat: a sailor boy
7. Clambers aboard in careless joy
8. With laughing face and gleaming hand.

9. And overhead the curlews cry,
10. Where through the dusky upland grass
11. The young brown-throated reapers pass,
12. Like silhouettes against the sky.
