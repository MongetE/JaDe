1. THIS English Thames is holier far than Rome,
2. Those harebells like a sudden flush of sea
3. Breaking across the woodland, with the foam
4. Of meadow-sweet and white anemone
5. To fleck their blue waves,--God is likelier there,
6. Than hidden in that crystal-hearted star the pale monks bear!

7. Those violet-gleaming butterflies that take
8. Yon creamy lily for their pavilion
9. Are monsignores, and where the rushes shake
10. A lazy pike lies basking in the sun
11. His eyes half-shut,--He is some mitred old
12. Bishop in partibus! look at those gaudy scales all green and gold.

13. The wind the restless prisoner of the trees
14. Does well for Palæstrina, one would say
15. The mighty master's hands were on the keys
16. Of the Maria organ, which they play
17. When early on some sapphire Easter morn
18. In a high litter red as blood or sin the Pope is borne

19. From his dark House out to the Balcony
20. Above the bronze gates and the crowded square,
21. Whose very fountains seem for ecstasy
22. To toss their silver lances in the air,
23. And stretching out weak hands to East and West
24. In vain sends peace to peaceless lands, to restless nations rest.

25. Is not yon lingering orange afterglow
26. That stays to vex the moon more fair than all
27. Rome's lordliest pageants! strange, a year ago
28. I knelt before some crimson Cardinal
29. Who bare the Host across the Esquiline,
30. And now--those common poppies in the wheat seem twice as fine.

31. The blue-green beanfields yonder, tremulous
32. With the last shower, sweeter perfume bring
33. Through this cool evening than the odorous
34. Flame-jewelled censers the young deacons swing,
35. When the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine,
36. And makes God's body from the common fruit of corn and vine.

37. Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the mass
38. Were out of tune now, for a small brown bird
39. Sings overhead, and through the long cool grass
40. I see that throbbing throat which once I heard
41. On starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady,
42. Once where the white and crescent sand of Salamis meets sea.

43. Sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves
44. At daybreak, when the mower whets his scythe,
45. And stock-doves murmur, and the milkmaid leaves
46. Her little lonely bed, and carols blithe
47. To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait
48. Stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard gate.

49. And sweet the hops upon the Kentish leas,
50. And sweet the wind that lifts the new-mown hay,
51. And sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees
52. That round and round the linden blossoms play;
53. And sweet the heifer breathing in the stall,
54. And the green bursting figs that hang upon the red-brick wall.

55. And sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring
56. While the last violet loiters by the well,
57. And sweet to hear the shepherd Daphnis sing
58. The song of Linus through a sunny dell
59. Of warm Arcadia where the corn is gold
60. And the slight lithe-limbed reapers dance about the wattled fold.

61. And sweet with young Lycoris to recline
62. In some Illyrian valley far away,
63. Where canopied on herbs amaracine
64. We too might waste the summer-trancèd day
65. Matching our reeds in sportive rivalry,
66. While far beneath us frets the troubled purple of the sea.

67. But sweeter far if silver-sandalled foot
68. Of some long-hidden God should ever tread
69. The Nuneham meadows, if with reeded flute
70. Pressed to his lips some Faun might raise his head
71. By the green water-flags, ah! sweet indeed
72. To see the heavenly herdsman call his white-fleeced flock to feed.

73. Then sing to me thou tuneful chorister,
74. Though what thou sing'st be thine own requiem!
75. Tell me thy tale thou hapless chronicler
76. Of thine own tragedies! do not contemn
77. These unfamiliar haunts, this English field,
78. For many a lovely coronal our northern isle can yield,

79. Which Grecian meadows know not, many a rose,
80. Which all day long in vales Æolian
81. A lad might seek in vain for, overgrows
82. Our hedges like a wanton courtezan
83. Unthrifty of her beauty, lilies too
84. Ilissus never mirrored star our streams, and cockles blue

85. Dot the green wheat which, though they are the signs
86. For swallows going south, would never spread
87. Their azure tents between the Attic vines;
88. Even that little weed of ragged red,
89. Which bids the robin pipe, in Arcady
90. Would be a trespasser, and many an unsung elegy

91. Sleeps in the reeds that fringe our winding Thames
92. Which to awake were sweeter ravishment
93. Than ever Syrinx wept for, diadems
94. Of brown bee-studded orchids which were meant
95. For Cytheræa's brows are hidden here
96. Unknown to Cytheræa, and by yonder pasturing steer

97. There is a tiny yellow daffodil,
98. The butterfly can see it from afar,
99. Although one summer evening's dew could fill
100. Its little cup twice over ere the star
101. Had called the lazy shepherd to his fold
102. And be no prodigal, each leaf is flecked with spotted gold

103. As if Jove's gorgeous leman Danaé
104. Hot from his gilded arms had stooped to kiss
105. The trembling petals, or young Mercury
106. Low-flying to the dusky ford of Dis
107. Had with one feather of his pinions
108. Just brushed them!--the slight stem which bears the burden of its
109. suns

110. Is hardly thicker than the gossamer,
111. Or poor Arachne's silver tapestry,--
112. Men say it bloomed upon the sepulchre
113. Of One I sometime worshipped, but to me
114. It seems to bring diviner memories
115. Of faun-loved Heliconian glades and blue nymph-haunted seas,

116. Of an untrodden vale at Tempe where
117. On the clear river's marge Narcissus lies,
118. The tangle of the forest in his hair,
119. The silence of the woodland in his eyes,
120. Wooing that drifting imagery which is
121. No sooner kissed than broken, memories of Salmacis

122. Who is not boy or girl and yet is both,
123. Fed by two fires and unsatisfied
124. Through their excess, each passion being loth
125. For love's own sake to leave the other's side
126. Yet killing love by staying, memories
127. Of Oreads peeping through the leaves of silent moon-lit trees,

128. Of lonely Ariadne on the wharf
129. At Naxos, when she saw the treacherous crew
130. Far out at sea, and waved her crimson scarf
131. And called false Theseus back again nor knew
132. That Dionysos on an amber pard
133. Was close behind her, memories of what Maeonia's bard

134. With sightless eyes beheld, the wall of Troy,
135. Queen Helen lying in the carven room,
136. And at her side an amorous red-lipped boy
137. Trimming with dainty hand his helmet's plume,
138. And far away the moil, the shout, the groan,
139. As Hector shielded off the spear and Ajax hurled the stone;

140. Of wingèd Perseus with his flawless sword
141. Cleaving the snaky tresses of the witch,
142. And all those tales imperishably stored
143. In little Grecian urns, freightage more rich
144. Than any gaudy galleon of Spain
145. Bare from the Indies ever! these at least bring back again,

146. For well I know they are not dead at all,
147. The ancient Gods of Grecian poesy,
148. They are asleep, and when they hear thee call
149. Will wake and think 't is very Thessaly,
150. This Thames the Daulian waters, this cool glade
151. The yellow-irised mead where once young Itys laughed and played.

152. If it was thou dear jasmine-cradled bird
153. Who from the leafy stillness of thy throne
154. Sang to the wondrous boy, until he heard
155. The horn of Atalanta faintly blown
156. Across the Cumner hills, and wandering
157. Through Bagley wood at evening found the Attic poets' spring,--

158. Ah! tiny sober-suited advocate
159. That pleadest for the moon against the day!
160. If thou didst make the shepherd seek his mate
161. On that sweet questing, when Proserpina
162. Forgot it was not Sicily and leant
163. Across the mossy Sandford stile in ravished wonderment,--

164. Light-winged and bright-eyed miracle of the wood!
165. If ever thou didst soothe with melody
166. One of that little clan, that brotherhood
167. Which loved the morning-star of Tuscany
168. More than the perfect sun of Raphael
169. And is immortal, sing to me! for I too love thee well,

170. Sing on! sing on! let the dull world grow young,
171. Let elemental things take form again,
172. And the old shapes of Beauty walk among
173. The simple garths and open crofts, as when
174. The son of Leto bare the willow rod,
175. And the soft sheep and shaggy goats followed the boyish God.

176. Sing on! sing on! and Bacchus will be here
177. Astride upon his gorgeous Indian throne,
178. And over whimpering tigers shake the spear
179. With yellow ivy crowned and gummy cone,
180. While at his side the wanton Bassarid
181. Will throw the lion by the mane and catch the mountain kid!

182. Sing on! and I will wear the leopard skin,
183. And steal the moonéd wings of Ashtaroth,
184. Upon whose icy chariot we could win
185. Cithæron in an hour e'er the froth
186. Has overbrimmed the wine-vat or the Faun
187. Ceased from the treading! ay, before the flickering lamp of dawn

188. Has scared the hooting owlet to its nest,
189. And warned the bat to close its filmy vans,
190. Some Mænad girl with vine-leaves on her breast
191. Will filch their beechnuts from the sleeping Pans
192. So softly that the little nested thrush
193. Will never wake, and then with shrilly laugh and leap will rush

194. Down the green valley where the fallen dew
195. Lies thick beneath the elm and count her store,
196. Till the brown Satyrs in a jolly crew
197. Trample the loosestrife down along the shore,
198. And where their hornèd master sits in state
199. Bring strawberries and bloomy plums upon a wicker crate!

200. Sing on! and soon with passion-wearied face
201. Through the cool leaves Apollo's lad will come,
202. The Tyrian prince his bristled boar will chase
203. Adown the chestnut-copses all a-bloom,
204. And ivory-limbed, grey-eyed, with look of pride,
205. After yon velvet-coated deer the virgin maid will ride.

206. Sing on! and I the dying boy will see
207. Stain with his purple blood the waxen bell
208. That overweighs the jacinth, and to me
209. The wretched Cyprian her woe will tell,
210. And I will kiss her mouth and streaming eyes,
211. And lead her to the myrtle-hidden grove where Adon lies!

212. Cry out aloud on Itys! memory
213. That foster-brother of remorse and pain
214. Drops poison in mine ear,--O to be free,
215. To burn one's old ships! and to launch again
216. Into the white-plumed battle of the waves
217. And fight old Proteus for the spoil of coral-flowered caves!

218. O for Medea with her poppied spell!
219. O for the secret of the Colchian shrine!
220. O for one leaf of that pale asphodel
221. Which binds the tired brows of Proserpine,
222. And sheds such wondrous dews at eve that she
223. Dreams of the fields of Enna, by the far Sicilian sea,

224. Where oft the golden-girdled bee she chased
225. From lily to lily on the level mead,
226. Ere yet her sombre Lord had bid her taste
227. The deadly fruit of that pomegranate seed,
228. Ere the black steeds had harried her away
229. Down to the faint and flowerless land, the sick and sunless day.

230. O for one midnight and as paramour
231. The Venus of the little Melian farm!
232. O that some antique statue for one hour
233. Might wake to passion, and that I could charm
234. The Dawn at Florence from its dumb despair
235. Mix with those mighty limbs and make that giant breast my lair!

236. Sing on! sing on! I would be drunk with life,
237. Drunk with the trampled vintage of my youth,
238. I would forget the wearying wasted strife,
239. The riven vale, the Gorgon eyes of Truth,
240. The prayerless vigil and the cry for prayer,
241. The barren gifts, the lifted arms, the dull insensate air!

242. Sing on! sing on! O feathered Niobe,
243. Thou canst make sorrow beautiful, and steal
244. From joy its sweetest music, not as we
245. Who by dead voiceless silence strive to heal
246. Our too untented wounds, and do but keep
247. Pain barricadoed in our hearts, and murder pillowed sleep.

248. Sing louder yet, why must I still behold
249. The wan white face of that deserted Christ,
250. Whose bleeding hands my hands did once enfold,
251. Whose smitten lips my lips so oft have kissed,
252. And now in mute and marble misery
253. Sits in his lone dishonoured House and weeps, perchance for me.

254. O memory cast down thy wreathèd shell!
255. Break thy hoarse lute O sad Melpomene!
256. O sorrow sorrow keep thy cloistered cell
257. Nor dim with tears this limpid Castaly!
258. Cease, cease, sad bird, thou dost the forest wrong
259. To vex its sylvan quiet with such wild impassioned song!

260. Cease, cease, or if 'tis anguish to be dumb
261. Take from the pastoral thrush her simpler air,
262. Whose jocund carelessness doth more become
263. This English woodland than thy keen despair,
264. Ah! cease and let the northwind bear thy lay
265. Back to the rocky hills of Thrace, the stormy Daulian bay.

266. A moment more, the startled leaves had stirred,
267. Endymion would have passed across the mead
268. Moonstruck with love, and this still Thames had heard
269. Pan plash and paddle groping for some reed
270. To lure from her blue cave that Naiad maid
271. Who for such piping listens half in joy and half afraid.

272. A moment more, the waking dove had cooed,
273. The silver daughter of the silver sea
274. With the fond gyves of clinging hands had wooed
275. Her wanton from the chase, and Dryope
276. Had thrust aside the branches of her oak
277. To see the lusty gold-haired lad rein in his snorting yoke.

278. A moment more, the trees had stooped to kiss
279. Pale Daphne just awakening from the swoon
280. Of tremulous laurels, lonely Salmacis
281. Had bared his barren beauty to the moon,
282. And through the vale with sad voluptuous smile
283. Antinous had wandered, the red lotus of the Nile

284. Down leaning from his black and clustering hair
285. To shade those slumberous eyelids' caverned bliss,
286. Or else on yonder grassy slope with bare
287. High-tuniced limbs unravished Artemis
288. Had bade her hounds give tongue, and roused the deer
289. From his green ambuscade with shrill halloo and pricking spear.

290. Lie still, lie still, O passionate heart, lie still!
291. O Melancholy, fold thy raven wing!
292. O sobbing Dryad, from thy hollow hill
293. Come not with such desponded answering!
294. No more thou wingèd Marsyas complain,
295. Apollo loveth not to hear such troubled songs of pain!

296. It was a dream, the glade is tenantless,
297. No soft Ionian laughter moves the air,
298. The Thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness,
299. And from the copse left desolate and bare
300. Fled is young Bacchus with his revelry,
301. Yet still from Nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody

302. So sad, that one might think a human heart
303. Brake in each separate note, a quality
304. Which music sometimes has, being the Art
305. Which is most nigh to tears and memory,
306. Poor mourning Philomel, what dost thou fear?
307. Thy sister doth not haunt these fields, Pandion is not here,

308. Here is no cruel Lord with murderous blade,
309. No woven web of bloody heraldries,
310. But mossy dells for roving comrades made,
311. Warm valleys where the tired student lies
312. With half-shut book, and many a winding walk
313. Where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk.

314. The harmless rabbit gambols with its young
315. Across the trampled towing-path, where late
316. A troop of laughing boys in jostling throng
317. Cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight;
318. The gossamer, with ravelled silver threads,
319. Works at its little loom, and from the dusky red-eaved sheds

320. Of the lone Farm a flickering light shines out
321. Where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock
322. Back to their wattled sheep-cotes, a faint shout
323. Comes from some Oxford boat at Sandford lock,
324. And starts the moor-hen from the sedgy rill,
325. And the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill.

326. The heron passes homeward to the mere,
327. The blue mist creeps among the shivering trees,
328. Gold world by world the silent stars appear,
329. And like a blossom blown before the breeze,
330. A white moon drifts across the shimmering sky,
331. Mute arbitress of all thy sad, thy rapturous threnody.

332. She does not heed thee, wherefore should she heed,
333. She knows Endymion is not far away,
334. 'Tis I, 'tis I, whose soul is as the reed
335. Which has no message of its own to play,
336. So pipes another's bidding, it is I,
337. Drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery.

338. Ah! the brown bird has ceased: one exquisite trill
339. About the sombre woodland seems to cling,
340. Dying in music, else the air is still,
341. So still that one might hear the bat's small wing
342. Wander and wheel above the pines, or tell
343. Each tiny dewdrop dripping from the blue-bell's brimming cell.

344. And far away across the lengthening wold,
345. Across the willowy flats and thickets brown,
346. Magdalen's tall tower tipped with tremulous gold
347. Marks the long High Street of the little town,
348. And warns me to return; I must not wait,
349. Hark! 'tis the curfew booming from the bell at Christ Church gate.
