1. I.
2. THE corn has turned from grey to red,
3. Since first my spirit wandered forth
4. From the drear cities of the north,
5. And to Italia's mountains fled.

6. And here I set my face towards home,
7. For all my pilgrimage is done,
8. Although, methinks, yon blood-red sun
9. Marshals the way to Holy Rome.

10. O Blessed Lady, who dost hold
11. Upon the seven hills thy reign!
12. O Mother without blot or stain,
13. Crowned with bright crowns of triple gold!

14. O Roma, Roma, at thy feet
15. I lay this barren gift of song!
16. For, ah! the way is steep and long
17. That leads unto thy sacred street.

18. II.

19. And yet what joy it were for me
20. To turn my feet unto the south,
21. And journeying towards the Tiber mouth
22. To kneel again at Fiesole!

23. And wandering through the tangled pines
24. That break the gold of Arno's stream,
25. To see the purple mist and gleam
26. Of morning on the Apennines.

27. By many a vineyard-hidden home,
28. Orchard, and olive-garden grey,
29. Till from the drear Campagna's way
30. The seven hills bear up the dome!

31. III.

32. A pilgrim from the northern seas--
33. What joy for me to seek alone
34. The wondrous Temple, and the throne
35. Of Him who holds the awful keys!

36. When, bright with purple and with gold,
37. Come priest and holy Cardinal,
38. And borne above the heads of all
39. The gentle Shepherd of the Fold.

40. O joy to see before I die
41. The only God-anointed King,
42. And hear the silver trumpets ring
43. A triumph as He passes by!

44. Or at the altar of the shrine
45. Holds high the mystic sacrifice,
46. And shows a God to human eyes
47. Beneath the veil of bread and wine.

48. IV.

49. For lo, what changes time can bring!
50. The cycles of revolving years
51. May free my heart from all its fears,--
52. And teach my lips a song to sing.

53. Before yon field of trembling gold
54. Is garnered into dusty sheaves,
55. Or ere the autumn's scarlet leaves
56. Flutter as birds adown the wold,

57. I may have run the glorious race,
58. And caught the torch while yet aflame,
59. And called upon the holy name
60. Of Him who now doth hide His face.
