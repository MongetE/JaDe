1. From his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect
2. knowledge of God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of the
3. saints, as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of
4. his birth, had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of
5. his answers.

6. And when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood
7. he kissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that he
8. might speak to the world about God. For there were at that time
9. many in the world who either knew not God at all, or had but an
10. incomplete knowledge of Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwell
11. in groves and have no care of their worshippers.

12. And he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without
13. sandals, as he had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdle
14. a leathern wallet and a little water-bottle of burnt clay.

15. And as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that
16. comes from the perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises unto
17. God without ceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land in
18. which there were many cities.

19. And he passed through eleven cities. And some of these cities were
20. in valleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, and
21. others were set on hills. And in each city he found a disciple who
22. loved him and followed him, and a great multitude also of people
23. followed him from each city, and the knowledge of God spread in the
24. whole land, and many of the rulers were converted, and the priests
25. of the temples in which there were idols found that half of their
26. gain was gone, and when they beat upon their drums at noon none, or
27. but a few, came with peacocks and with offerings of flesh as had
28. been the custom of the land before his coming.

29. Yet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number of
30. his disciples, the greater became his sorrow. And he knew not why
31. his sorrow was so great. For he spake ever about God, and out of
32. the fulness of that perfect knowledge of God which God had Himself
33. given to him.

34. And one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was a
35. city of Armenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people
36. followed after him; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on
37. a rock that was on the mountain, and his disciples stood round him,
38. and the multitude knelt in the valley.

39. And he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul,
40. 'Why is it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of my
41. disciples is an enemy that walks in the noonday?' And his Soul
42. answered him and said, 'God filled thee with the perfect knowledge
43. of Himself, and thou hast given this knowledge away to others. The
44. pearl of great price thou hast divided, and the vesture without
45. seam thou hast parted asunder. He who giveth away wisdom robbeth
46. himself. He is as one who giveth his treasure to a robber. Is not
47. God wiser than thou art? Who art thou to give away the secret that
48. God hath told thee? I was rich once, and thou hast made me poor.
49. Once I saw God, and now thou hast hidden Him from me.'

50. And he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him,
51. and that he had given to others the perfect knowledge of God, and
52. that he was as one clinging to the skirts of God, and that his
53. faith was leaving him by reason of the number of those who believed
54. in him.

55. And he said to himself, 'I will talk no more about God. He who
56. giveth away wisdom robbeth himself.'

57. And after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and
58. bowed themselves to the ground and said, 'Master, talk to us about
59. God, for thou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and no man save
60. thee hath this knowledge.'

61. And he answered them and said, 'I will talk to you about all other
62. things that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not
63. talk to you. Neither now, nor at any time, will I talk to you
64. about God.'

65. And they were wroth with him and said to him, 'Thou hast led us
66. into the desert that we might hearken to thee. Wilt thou send us
67. away hungry, and the great multitude that thou hast made to follow
68. thee?'

69. And he answered them and said, 'I will not talk to you about God.'

70. And the multitude murmured against him and said to him, 'Thou hast
71. led us into the desert, and hast given us no food to eat. Talk to
72. us about God and it will suffice us.'

73. But he answered them not a word. For he knew that if he spake to
74. them about God he would give away his treasure.

75. And his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people
76. returned to their own homes. And many died on the way.

77. And when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, and
78. journeyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any
79. answer. And when the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert
80. which is the desert of the Great River. And having found a cavern
81. in which a Centaur had once dwelt, he took it for his place of
82. dwelling, and made himself a mat of reeds on which to lie, and
83. became a hermit. And every hour the Hermit praised God that He had
84. suffered him to keep some knowledge of Him and of His wonderful
85. greatness.

86. Now, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern in
87. which he had made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man of
88. evil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with
89. empty hands. Every evening with empty hands the young man passed
90. by, and every morning he returned with his hands full of purple and
91. pearls. For he was a Robber and robbed the caravans of the
92. merchants.

93. And the Hermit looked at him and pitied him. But he spake not a
94. word. For he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.

95. And one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full of
96. purple and pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon
97. the sand, and said to the Hermit: 'Why do you look at me ever in
98. this manner as I pass by? What is it that I see in your eyes? For
99. no man has looked at me before in this manner. And the thing is a
100. thorn and a trouble to me.'

101. And the Hermit answered him and said, 'What you see in my eyes is
102. pity. Pity is what looks out at you from my eyes.'

103. And the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in a
104. bitter voice, and said to him, 'I have purple and pearls in my
105. hands, and you have but a mat of reeds on which to lie. What pity
106. should you have for me? And for what reason have you this pity?'

107. 'I have pity for you,' said the Hermit, 'because you have no
108. knowledge of God.'

109. 'Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?' asked the young man,
110. and he came close to the mouth of the cavern.

111. 'It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the
112. world,' answered the Hermit.

113. 'And have you got it?' said the young Robber, and he came closer
114. still.

115. 'Once, indeed,' answered the Hermit, 'I possessed the perfect
116. knowledge of God. But in my foolishness I parted with it, and
117. divided it amongst others. Yet even now is such knowledge as
118. remains to me more precious than purple or pearls.'

119. And when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple and
120. the pearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharp
121. sword of curved steel he said to the Hermit, 'Give me, forthwith
122. this knowledge of God that you possess, or I will surely slay you.
123. Wherefore should I not slay him who has a treasure greater than my
124. treasure?'

125. And the Hermit spread out his arms and said, 'Were it not better
126. for me to go unto the uttermost courts of God and praise Him, than
127. to live in the world and have no knowledge of Him? Slay me if that
128. be your desire. But I will not give away my knowledge of God.'

129. And the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermit
130. would not talk to him about God, nor give him his Treasure, and the
131. young Robber rose up and said to the Hermit, 'Be it as you will.
132. As for myself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is but
133. three days' journey from this place, and for my purple they will
134. give me pleasure, and for my pearls they will sell me joy.' And he
135. took up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away.

136. And the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him. For
137. the space of three days he followed the young Robber on the road
138. and entreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of the
139. Seven Sins.

140. And ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit and
141. called to him, and said, 'Will you give me this knowledge of God
142. which is more precious than purple and pearls? If you will give me
143. that, I will not enter the city.'

144. And ever did the Hermit answer, 'All things that I have I will give
145. thee, save that one thing only. For that thing it is not lawful
146. for me to give away.'

147. And in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great
148. scarlet gates of the City of the Seven Sins. And from the city
149. there came the sound of much laughter.

150. And the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at the
151. gate. And as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him by
152. the skirts of his raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth your
153. hands, and set your arms around my neck, and put your ear close to
154. my lips, and I will give you what remains to me of the knowledge of
155. God.' And the young Robber stopped.

156. And when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he fell
157. upon the ground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him the
158. city and the young Robber, so that he saw them no more.

159. And as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standing
160. beside him; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brass
161. and hair like fine wool. And He raised the Hermit up, and said to
162. him: 'Before this time thou hadst the perfect knowledge of God.
163. Now thou shalt have the perfect love of God. Wherefore art thou
164. weeping?' And he kissed him.
