1. ALBEIT nurtured in democracy,
2. And liking best that state republican
3. Where every man is Kinglike and no man
4. Is crowned above his fellows, yet I see,
5. Spite of this modern fret for Liberty,
6. Better the rule of One, whom all obey,
7. Than to let clamorous demagogues betray
8. Our freedom with the kiss of anarchy.
9. Wherefore I love them not whose hands profane
10. Plant the red flag upon the piled-up street
11. For no right cause, beneath whose ignorant reign
12. Arts, Culture, Reverence, Honour, all things fade,
13. Save Treason and the dagger of her trade,
14. And Murder with his silent bloody feet.
