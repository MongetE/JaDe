1. EAGLE of Austerlitz! where were thy wings
2. When far away upon a barbarous strand,
3. In fight unequal, by an obscure hand,
4. Fell the last scion of thy brood of Kings!

5. Poor boy! thou wilt not flaunt thy cloak of red,
6. Nor ride in state through Paris in the van
7. Of thy returning legions, but instead
8. Thy mother France, free and republican,

9. Shall on thy dead and crownless forehead place
10. The better laurels of a soldier's crown,
11. That not dishonoured should thy soul go down
12. To tell the mighty Sire of thy race

13. That France hath kissed the mouth of Liberty,
14. And found it sweeter than his honied bees,
15. And that the giant wave Democracy
16. Breaks on the shores where Kings lay crouched at ease.
