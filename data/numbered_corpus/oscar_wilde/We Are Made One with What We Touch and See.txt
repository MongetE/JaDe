1. We are resolved into the supreme air,
2. We are made one with what we touch and see,
3. With our heart's blood each crimson sun is fair,
4. With our young lives each spring-impassioned tree
5. Flames into green, the wildest beasts that range
6. The moor our kinsmen are, all life is one, and all is change.

7. With beat of systole and of diastole
8. One grand great life throbs through earth's giant heart,
9. And mighty waves of single Being roll
10. From nerve-less germ to man, for we are part
11. Of every rock and bird and beast and hill,
12. One with the things that prey on us, and one with what we kill. . . .

13. One sacrament are consecrate, the earth
14. Not we alone hath passions hymeneal,
15. The yellow buttercups that shake for mirth
16. At daybreak know a pleasure not less real
17. Than we do, when in some fresh-blossoming wood
18. We draw the spring into our hearts, and feel that life is good. . . .

19. Is the light vanished from our golden sun,
20. Or is this daedal-fashioned earth less fair,
21. That we are nature's heritors, and one
22. With every pulse of life that beats the air?
23. Rather new suns across the sky shall pass,
24. New splendour come unto the flower, new glory to the grass.

25. And we two lovers shall not sit afar,
26. Critics of nature, but the joyous sea
27. Shall be our raiment, and the bearded star
28. Shoot arrows at our pleasure! We shall be
29. Part of the mighty universal whole,
30. And through all Aeons mix and mingle with the Kosmic Soul!

31. We shall be notes in that great Symphony
32. Whose cadence circles through the rhythmic spheres,
33. And all the live World's throbbing heart shall be
34. One with our heart, the stealthy creeping years
35. Have lost their terrors now, we shall not die,
36. The Universe itself shall be our Immortality!
