1. Now when the darkness came over the earth Joseph of Arimathea,
2. having lighted a torch of pinewood, passed down from the hill into
3. the valley. For he had business in his own home.

4. And kneeling on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation he saw
5. a young man who was naked and weeping. His hair was the colour of
6. honey, and his body was as a white flower, but he had wounded his
7. body with thorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown.

8. And he who had great possessions said to the young man who was
9. naked and weeping, 'I do not wonder that your sorrow is so great,
10. for surely He was a just man.'

11. And the young man answered, 'It is not for Him that I am weeping,
12. but for myself. I too have changed water into wine, and I have
13. healed the leper and given sight to the blind. I have walked upon
14. the waters, and from the dwellers in the tombs I have cast out
15. devils. I have fed the hungry in the desert where there was no
16. food, and I have raised the dead from their narrow houses, and at
17. my bidding, and before a great multitude, of people, a barren fig-
18. tree withered away. All things that this man has done I have done
19. also. And yet they have not crucified me.'
