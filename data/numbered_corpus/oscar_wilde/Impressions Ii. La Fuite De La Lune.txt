1. TO outer senses there is peace,
2. A dreamy peace on either hand,
3. Deep silence in the shadowy land,
4. Deep silence where the shadows cease.

5. Save for a cry that echoes shrill
6. From some lone bird disconsolate;
7. A corncrake calling to its mate;
8. The answer from the misty hill.

9. And suddenly the moon withdraws
10. Her sickle from the lightening skies,
11. And to her sombre cavern flies,
12. Wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze.
