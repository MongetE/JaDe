1. In a dim corner of my room for longer than
2. my fancy thinks
3. A beautiful and silent Sphinx has watched me
4. through the shifting gloom.

5. Inviolate and immobile she does not rise she
6. does not stir
7. For silver moons are naught to her and naught
8. to her the suns that reel.

9. Red follows grey across the air, the waves of
10. moonlight ebb and flow
11. But with the Dawn she does not go and in the
12. night-time she is there.

13. Dawn follows Dawn and Nights grow old and
14. all the while this curious cat
15. Lies couching on the Chinese mat with eyes of
16. satin rimmed with gold.

17. Upon the mat she lies and leers and on the
18. tawny throat of her
19. Flutters the soft and silky fur or ripples to her
20. pointed ears.

21. Come forth, my lovely seneschal! so somnolent,
22. so statuesque!
23. Come forth you exquisite grotesque! half woman
24. and half animal!

25. Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx! and
26. put your head upon my knee!
27. And let me stroke your throat and see your
28. body spotted like the Lynx!

29. And let me touch those curving claws of yellow
30. ivory and grasp
31. The tail that like a monstrous Asp coils round
32. your heavy velvet paws!


33. A thousand weary centuries are thine
34. while I have hardly seen
35. Some twenty summers cast their green for
36. Autumn's gaudy liveries.

37. But you can read the Hieroglyphs on the
38. great sandstone obelisks,
39. And you have talked with Basilisks, and you
40. have looked on Hippogriffs.

41. O tell me, were you standing by when Isis to
42. Osiris knelt?
43. And did you watch the Egyptian melt her union
44. for Antony

45. And drink the jewel-drunken wine and bend
46. her head in mimic awe
47. To see the huge proconsul draw the salted tunny
48. from the brine?

49. And did you mark the Cyprian kiss white Adon
50. on his catafalque?
51. And did you follow Amenalk, the God of
52. Heliopolis?

53. And did you talk with Thoth, and did you hear
54. the moon-horned Io weep?
55. And know the painted kings who sleep beneath
56. the wedge-shaped Pyramid?


57. Lift up your large black satin eyes which are
58. like cushions where one sinks!
59. Fawn at my feet, fantastic Sphinx! and sing me
60. all your memories!

61. Sing to me of the Jewish maid who wandered
62. with the Holy Child,
63. And how you led them through the wild, and
64. how they slept beneath your shade.

65. Sing to me of that odorous green eve when
66. crouching by the marge
67. You heard from Adrian's gilded barge the
68. laughter of Antinous

69. And lapped the stream and fed your drouth and
70. watched with hot and hungry stare
71. The ivory body of that rare young slave with
72. his pomegranate mouth!

73. Sing to me of the Labyrinth in which the twi-
74. formed bull was stalled!
75. Sing to me of the night you crawled across the
76. temple's granite plinth

77. When through the purple corridors the screaming
78. scarlet Ibis flew
79. In terror, and a horrid dew dripped from the
80. moaning Mandragores,

81. And the great torpid crocodile within the tank
82. shed slimy tears,
83. And tare the jewels from his ears and staggered
84. back into the Nile,

85. And the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as
86. in your claws you seized their snake
87. And crept away with it to slake your passion by
88. the shuddering palms.


89. Who were your lovers? who were they
90. who wrestled for you in the dust?
91. Which was the vessel of your Lust? What
92. Leman had you, every day?

93. Did giant Lizards come and crouch before you
94. on the reedy banks?
95. Did Gryphons with great metal flanks leap on
96. you in your trampled couch?

97. Did monstrous hippopotami come sidling toward
98. you in the mist?
99. Did gilt-scaled dragons writhe and twist with
100. passion as you passed them by?

101. And from the brick-built Lycian tomb what
102. horrible Chimera came
103. With fearful heads and fearful flame to breed
104. new wonders from your womb?


105. Or had you shameful secret quests and did
106. you harry to your home
107. Some Nereid coiled in amber foam with curious
108. rock crystal breasts?

109. Or did you treading through the froth call to
110. the brown Sidonian
111. For tidings of Leviathan, Leviathan or
112. Behemoth?

113. Or did you when the sun was set climb up the
114. cactus-covered slope
115. To meet your swarthy Ethiop whose body was
116. of polished jet?

117. Or did you while the earthen skiffs dropped
118. down the grey Nilotic flats
119. At twilight and the flickering bats flew round
120. the temple's triple glyphs

121. Steal to the border of the bar and swim across
122. the silent lake
123. And slink into the vault and make the Pyramid
124. your lupanar

125. Till from each black sarcophagus rose up the
126. painted swathed dead?
127. Or did you lure unto your bed the ivory-horned
128. Tragelaphos?

129. Or did you love the god of flies who plagued
130. the Hebrews and was splashed
131. With wine unto the waist? or Pasht, who had
132. green beryls for her eyes?

133. Or that young god, the Tyrian, who was more
134. amorous than the dove
135. Of Ashtaroth? or did you love the god of the
136. Assyrian

137. Whose wings, like strange transparent talc, rose
138. high above his hawk-faced head,
139. Painted with silver and with red and ribbed with
140. rods of Oreichalch?

141. Or did huge Apis from his car leap down and
142. lay before your feet
143. Big blossoms of the honey-sweet and honey-
144. coloured nenuphar?


145. How subtle-secret is your smile! Did you
146. love none then? Nay, I know
147. Great Ammon was your bedfellow! He lay with
148. you beside the Nile!

149. The river-horses in the slime trumpeted when
150. they saw him come
151. Odorous with Syrian galbanum and smeared with
152. spikenard and with thyme.

153. He came along the river bank like some tall
154. galley argent-sailed,
155. He strode across the waters, mailed in beauty,
156. and the waters sank.

157. He strode across the desert sand: he reached
158. the valley where you lay:
159. He waited till the dawn of day: then touched
160. your black breasts with his hand.

161. You kissed his mouth with mouths of flame:
162. you made the horned god your own:
163. You stood behind him on his throne: you called
164. him by his secret name.

165. You whispered monstrous oracles into the
166. caverns of his ears:
167. With blood of goats and blood of steers you
168. taught him monstrous miracles.

169. White Ammon was your bedfellow! Your
170. chamber was the steaming Nile!
171. And with your curved archaic smile you watched
172. his passion come and go.


173. With Syrian oils his brows were bright:
174. and wide-spread as a tent at noon
175. His marble limbs made pale the moon and lent
176. the day a larger light.

177. His long hair was nine cubits' span and coloured
178. like that yellow gem
179. Which hidden in their garment's hem the
180. merchants bring from Kurdistan.

181. His face was as the must that lies upon a vat of
182. new-made wine:
183. The seas could not insapphirine the perfect azure
184. of his eyes.

185. His thick soft throat was white as milk and
186. threaded with thin veins of blue:
187. And curious pearls like frozen dew were
188. broidered on his flowing silk.


189. On pearl and porphyry pedestalled he was
190. too bright to look upon:
191. For on his ivory breast there shone the wondrous
192. ocean-emerald,

193. That mystic moonlit jewel which some diver of
194. the Colchian caves
195. Had found beneath the blackening waves and
196. carried to the Colchian witch.

197. Before his gilded galiot ran naked vine-wreathed
198. corybants,
199. And lines of swaying elephants knelt down to
200. draw his chariot,

201. And lines of swarthy Nubians bare up his litter
202. as he rode
203. Down the great granite-paven road between the
204. nodding peacock-fans.

205. The merchants brought him steatite from Sidon
206. in their painted ships:
207. The meanest cup that touched his lips was
208. fashioned from a chrysolite.

209. The merchants brought him cedar chests of rich
210. apparel bound with cords:
211. His train was borne by Memphian lords: young
212. kings were glad to be his guests.

213. Ten hundred shaven priests did bow to Ammon's
214. altar day and night,
215. Ten hundred lamps did wave their light through
216. Ammon's carven house - and now

217. Foul snake and speckled adder with their young
218. ones crawl from stone to stone
219. For ruined is the house and prone the great
220. rose-marble monolith!

221. Wild ass or trotting jackal comes and couches
222. in the mouldering gates:
223. Wild satyrs call unto their mates across the
224. fallen fluted drums.

225. And on the summit of the pile the blue-faced
226. ape of Horus sits
227. And gibbers while the fig-tree splits the pillars
228. of the peristyle


229. The god is scattered here and there: deep
230. hidden in the windy sand
231. I saw his giant granite hand still clenched in
232. impotent despair.

233. And many a wandering caravan of stately
234. negroes silken-shawled,
235. Crossing the desert, halts appalled before the
236. neck that none can span.

237. And many a bearded Bedouin draws back his
238. yellow-striped burnous
239. To gaze upon the Titan thews of him who was
240. thy paladin.


241. Go, seek his fragments on the moor and
242. wash them in the evening dew,
243. And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated
244. paramour!

245. Go, seek them where they lie alone and from
246. their broken pieces make
247. Thy bruised bedfellow! And wake mad passions
248. in the senseless stone!

249. Charm his dull ear with Syrian hymns! he loved
250. your body! oh, be kind,
251. Pour spikenard on his hair, and wind soft rolls
252. of linen round his limbs!

253. Wind round his head the figured coins! stain
254. with red fruits those pallid lips!
255. Weave purple for his shrunken hips! and purple
256. for his barren loins!


257. Away to Egypt! Have no fear. Only one
258. God has ever died.
259. Only one God has let His side be wounded by a
260. soldier's spear.

261. But these, thy lovers, are not dead. Still by the
262. hundred-cubit gate
263. Dog-faced Anubis sits in state with lotus-lilies
264. for thy head.

265. Still from his chair of porphyry gaunt Memnon
266. strains his lidless eyes
267. Across the empty land, and cries each yellow
268. morning unto thee.

269. And Nilus with his broken horn lies in his black
270. and oozy bed
271. And till thy coming will not spread his waters on
272. the withering corn.

273. Your lovers are not dead, I know. They will
274. rise up and hear your voice
275. And clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to
276. kiss your mouth! And so,

277. Set wings upon your argosies! Set horses to
278. your ebon car!
279. Back to your Nile! Or if you are grown sick of
280. dead divinities

281. Follow some roving lion's spoor across the copper-
282. coloured plain,
283. Reach out and hale him by the mane and bid
284. him be your paramour!

285. Couch by his side upon the grass and set your
286. white teeth in his throat
287. And when you hear his dying note lash your
288. long flanks of polished brass

289. And take a tiger for your mate, whose amber
290. sides are flecked with black,
291. And ride upon his gilded back in triumph
292. through the Theban gate,

293. And toy with him in amorous jests, and when
294. he turns, and snarls, and gnaws,
295. O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise
296. him with your agate breasts!


297. Why are you tarrying? Get hence! I
298. weary of your sullen ways,
299. I weary of your steadfast gaze, your somnolent
300. magnificence.

301. Your horrible and heavy breath makes the light
302. flicker in the lamp,
303. And on my brow I feel the damp and dreadful
304. dews of night and death.

305. Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver
306. in some stagnant lake,
307. Your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances
308. to fantastic tunes,

309. Your pulse makes poisonous melodies, and your
310. black throat is like the hole
311. Left by some torch or burning coal on Saracenic
312. tapestries.

313. Away! The sulphur-coloured stars are hurrying
314. through the Western gate!
315. Away! Or it may be too late to climb their silent
316. silver cars!

317. See, the dawn shivers round the grey gilt-dialled
318. towers, and the rain
319. Streams down each diamonded pane and blurs
320. with tears the wannish day.

321. What snake-tressed fury fresh from Hell, with
322. uncouth gestures and unclean,
323. Stole from the poppy-drowsy queen and led you
324. to a student's cell?


325. What songless tongueless ghost of sin crept
326. through the curtains of the night,
327. And saw my taper burning bright, and knocked,
328. and bade you enter in?

329. Are there not others more accursed, whiter with
330. leprosies than I?
331. Are Abana and Pharphar dry that you come here
332. to slake your thirst?

333. Get hence, you loathsome mystery! Hideous
334. animal, get hence!
335. You wake in me each bestial sense, you make me
336. what I would not be.

337. You make my creed a barren sham, you wake
338. foul dreams of sensual life,
339. And Atys with his blood-stained knife were
340. better than the thing I am.

341. False Sphinx! False Sphinx! By reedy Styx
342. old Charon, leaning on his oar,
343. Waits for my coin. Go thou before, and leave
344. me to my crucifix,

345. Whose pallid burden, sick with pain, watches
346. the world with wearied eyes,
347. And weeps for every soul that dies, and weeps
348. for every soul in vain.
