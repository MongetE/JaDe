1. OFT have we trod the vales of Castaly
2. And heard sweet notes of sylvan music blown
3. From antique reeds to common folk unknown:
4. And often launched our bark upon that sea
5. Which the nine Muses hold in empery,
6. And ploughed free furrows through the wave and foam,
7. Nor spread reluctant sail for more safe home
8. Till we had freighted well our argosy.
9. Of which despoil√®d treasures these remain,
10. Sordello's passion, and the honied line
11. Of young Endymion, lordly Tamburlaine
12. Driving his pampered jades, and more than these,
13. The seven-fold vision of the Florentine,
14. And grave-browed Milton's solemn harmonies.
