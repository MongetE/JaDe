1. I -
2. There is no peace beneath the moon,-
3. Ah! in those meadows is there peace
4. Where, girdled with a silver fleece,
5. As a bright shepherd, strays the moon? -
6. Queen of the gardens of the sky,
7. Where stars like lilies, white and fair,
8. Shine through the mists of frosty air,
9. Oh, tarry, for the dawn is nigh! -
10. Oh, tarry, for the envious day
11. Stretches long hands to catch thy feet.
12. Alas! but thou art overfleet,
13. Alas! I know thou wilt not stay.

14. II -
15. Eastward the dawn has broken red,
16. The circling mists and shadows flee;
17. Aurora rises from the sea,
18. And leaves the crocus-flowered bed. -
19. Eastward the silver arrows fall,
20. Splintering the veil of holy night:
21. And a long wave of yellow light
22. Breaks silently on tower and hall. -
23. And speeding wide across the wold
24. Wakes into flight some fluttering bird;
25. And all the chestnut tops are stirred,
26. And all the branches streaked with gold.

27. III -
28. To outer senses there is peace,
29. A dream-like peace on either hand,
30. Deep silence in the shadowy land,
31. Deep silence where the shadows cease, -
32. Save for a cry that echoes shrill
33. From some lone bird disconsolate;
34. A curlew calling to its mate;
35. The answer from the distant hill. -
36. And, herald of my love to Him
37. Who, waiting for the dawn, doth lie,
38. The orbed maiden leaves the sky,
39. And the white firs grow more dim.

40. IV -
41. Up sprang the sun to run his race,
42. The breeze blew fair on meadow and lea,
43. But in the west I seemed to see
44. The likeness of a human face. -
45. A linnet on the hawthorn spray
46. Sang of the glories of the spring,
47. And made the flow'ring copses ring
48. With gladness for the new-born day. -
49. A lark from out the grass I trod
50. Flew wildly, and was lost to view
51. In the great seamless veil of blue
52. That hangs before the face of God. -
53. The willow whispered overhead
54. That death is but a newer life
55. And that with idle words of strife
56. We bring dishonour on the dead. -
57. I took a branch from off the tree,
58. And hawthorn branches drenched with dew,
59. I bound them with a sprig of yew,
60. And made a garland fair to see. -
61. I laid the flowers where He lies
62. (Warm leaves and flowers on the stones):
63. What joy I had to sit alone
64. Till evening broke on tired eyes: -
65. Till all the shifting clouds had spun
66. A robe of gold for God to wear
67. And into seas of purple air
68. Sank the bright galley of the sun.

69. V -
70. Shall I be gladdened for the day,
71. And let my inner heart be stirred
72. By murmuring tree or song of bird,
73. And sorrow at the wild winds' play? -
74. Not so, such idle dreams belong
75. To souls of lesser depth than mine;
76. I feel that I am half divine;
77. I that I am great and strong. -
78. I know that every forest tree
79. By labour rises from the root
80. I know that none shall gather fruit
81. By sailing on the barren sea.
