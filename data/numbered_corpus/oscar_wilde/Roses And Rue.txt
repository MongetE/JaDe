1. Could we dig up this long-buried treasure,
2. Were it worth the pleasure,
3. We never could learn love's song,
4. We are parted too long

5. Could the passionate past that is fled
6. Call back its dead,
7. Could we live it all over again,
8. Were it worth the pain!

9. I remember we used to meet
10. By an ivied seat,
11. And you warbled each pretty word
12. With the air of a bird;

13. And your voice had a quaver in it,
14. Just like a linnet,
15. And shook, as the blackbird's throat
16. With its last big note;

17. And your eyes, they were green and grey
18. Like an April day,
19. But lit into amethyst
20. When I stooped and kissed;

21. And your mouth, it would never smile
22. For a long, long while,
23. Then it rippled all over with laughter
24. Five minutes after.

25. You were always afraid of a shower,
26. Just like a flower:
27. I remember you started and ran
28. When the rain began.

29. I remember I never could catch you,
30. For no one could match you,
31. You had wonderful, luminous, fleet,
32. Little wings to your feet.

33. I remember your hair - did I tie it?
34. For it always ran riot -
35. Like a tangled sunbeam of gold:
36. These things are old.

37. I remember so well the room,
38. And the lilac bloom
39. That beat at the dripping pane
40. In the warm June rain;

41. And the colour of your gown,
42. It was amber-brown,
43. And two yellow satin bows
44. From the shoulders rose.

45. And the handkerchief of French lace
46. Which you held to your face-
47. Had a small tear left a stain?
48. Or was it the rain?

49. On your hand as it waved adieu
50. There were veins of blue;
51. In your voice as it said good-bye
52. Was a petulant cry,

53. "You have only wasted your life."
54. (Ah, that was the knife!)
55. When I rushed through the garden gate
56. It was all too late.

57. Could we live it over again,
58. Were it worth the pain,
59. Could the passionate past that is fled
60. Call back its dead!

61. Well, if my heart must break,
62. Dear love, for your sake,
63. It will break in music, I know,
64. Poets' hearts break so.

65. But strange that I was not told
66. That the brain can hold
67. In a tiny ivory cell
68. God's heaven and hell.
