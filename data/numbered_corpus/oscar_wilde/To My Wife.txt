1. With a Copy of My Poems

2. I can write no stately proem
3. As a prelude to my lay;
4. From a poet to a poem
5. I would dare to say.

6. For if of these fallen petals
7. One to you seem fair,
8. Love will waft it till it settles
9. On your hair.

10. And when wind and winter harden
11. All the loveless land,
12. It will whisper of the garden,
13. You will understand.
