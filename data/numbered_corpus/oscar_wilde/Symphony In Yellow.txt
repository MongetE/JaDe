1. An omnibus across the bridge
2. Crawls like a yellow butterfly,
3. And, here and there a passer-by
4. Shows like a little restless midge.

5. Big barges full of yellow hay
6. Are moored against the shadowy wharf,
7. And, like a yellow silken scarf,
8. The thick fog hangs along the quay.

9. The yellow leaves begin to fade
10. And flutter from the temple elms,
11. And at my feet the pale green Thames
12. Lies like a rod of rippled jade.
