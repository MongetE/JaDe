1. AS one who poring on a Grecian urn
2. Scans the fair shapes some Attic hand hath made,
3. God with slim goddess, goodly man with maid,
4. And for their beauty's sake is loth to turn
5. And face the obvious day, must I not yearn
6. For many a secret moon of indolent bliss,
7. When in the midmost shrine of Artemis
8. I see thee standing, antique-limbed, and stern?

9. And yet--methinks I'd rather see thee play
10. That serpent of old Nile, whose witchery
11. Made Emperors drunken,--come, great Egypt, shake
12. Our stage with all thy mimic pageants! Nay,
13. I am grown sick of unreal passions, make
14. The world thine Actium, me thine Antony!
