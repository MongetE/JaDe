1. NAY, let us walk from fire unto fire,
2. From passionate pain to deadlier delight,--
3. I am too young to live without desire,
4. Too young art thou to waste this summer night
5. Asking those idle questions which of old
6. Man sought of seer and oracle, and no reply was told.

7. For, sweet, to feel is better than to know,
8. And wisdom is a childless heritage,
9. One pulse of passion--youth's first fiery glow,--
10. Are worth the hoarded proverbs of the sage:
11. Vex not thy soul with dead philosophy,
12. Have we not lips to kiss with, hearts to love, and eyes to see!

13. Dost thou not hear the murmuring nightingale
14. Like water bubbling from a silver jar,
15. So soft she sings the envious moon is pale,
16. That high in heaven she is hung so far
17. She cannot hear that love-enraptured tune,--
18. Mark how she wreathes each horn with mist, yon late and labouring
19. moon.

20. White lilies, in whose cups the gold bees dream,
21. The fallen snow of petals where the breeze
22. Scatters the chestnut blossom, or the gleam
23. Of boyish limbs in water,--are not these
24. Enough for thee, dost thou desire more?
25. Alas! the Gods will give nought else from their eternal store.

26. For our high Gods have sick and wearied grown
27. Of all our endless sins, our vain endeavour
28. For wasted days of youth to make atone
29. By pain or prayer or priest, and never, never,
30. Hearken they now to either good or ill,
31. But send their rain upon the just and the unjust at will.

32. They sit at ease, our Gods they sit at ease,
33. Strewing with leaves of rose their scented wine,
34. They sleep, they sleep, beneath the rocking trees
35. Where asphodel and yellow lotus twine,
36. Mourning the old glad days before they knew
37. What evil things the heart of man could dream, and dreaming do.

38. And far beneath the brazen floor they see
39. Like swarming flies the crowd of little men,
40. The bustle of small lives, then wearily
41. Back to their lotus-haunts they turn again
42. Kissing each other's mouths, and mix more deep
43. The poppy-seeded draught which brings soft purple-lidded sleep.

44. There all day long the golden-vestured sun,
45. Their torch-bearer, stands with his torch a-blaze,
46. And when the gaudy web of noon is spun
47. By its twelve maidens through the crimson haze
48. Fresh from Endymion's arms comes forth the moon,
49. And the immortal Gods in toils of mortal passions swoon.

50. There walks Queen Juno through some dewy mead
51. Her grand white feet flecked with the saffron dust
52. Of wind-stirred lilies, while young Ganymede
53. Leaps in the hot and amber-foaming must,
54. His curls all tossed, as when the eagle bare
55. The frightened boy from Ida through the blue Ionian air.

56. There in the green heart of some garden close
57. Queen Venus with the shepherd at her side,
58. Her warm soft body like the briar rose
59. Which would be white yet blushes at its pride,
60. Laughs low for love, till jealous Salmacis
61. Peers through the myrtle-leaves and sighs for pain of lonely
62. bliss.

63. There never does that dreary north-wind blow
64. Which leaves our English forests bleak and bare,
65. Nor ever falls the swift white-feathered snow,
66. Nor doth the red-toothed lightning ever dare
67. To wake them in the silver-fretted night
68. When we lie weeping for some sweet sad sin, some dead delight.

69. Alas! they know the far Lethæan spring,
70. The violet-hidden waters well they know,
71. Where one whose feet with tired wandering
72. Are faint and broken may take heart and go,
73. And from those dark depths cool and crystalline
74. Drink, and draw balm, and sleep for sleepless souls, and anodyne.

75. But we oppress our natures, God or Fate
76. Is our enemy, we starve and feed
77. On vain repentance--O we are born too late!
78. What balm for us in bruisèd poppy seed
79. Who crowd into one finite pulse of time
80. The joy of infinite love and the fierce pain of infinite crime.

81. O we are wearied of this sense of guilt,
82. Wearied of pleasure's paramour despair,
83. Wearied of every temple we have built,
84. Wearied of every right, unanswered prayer,
85. For man is weak; God sleeps: and heaven is high:
86. One fiery-coloured moment: one great love; and lo! we die.

87. Ah! but no ferry-man with labouring pole
88. Nears his black shallop to the flowerless strand,
89. No little coin of bronze can bring the soul
90. Over Death's river to the sunless land,
91. Victim and wine and vow are all in vain,
92. The tomb is sealed; the soldiers watch; the dead rise not again.

93. We are resolved into the supreme air,
94. We are made one with what we touch and see,
95. With our heart's blood each crimson sun is fair,
96. With our young lives each spring-impassioned tree
97. Flames into green, the wildest beasts that range
98. The moor our kinsmen are, all life is one, and all is change.

99. With beat of systole and of diastole
100. One grand great life throbs through earth's giant heart,
101. And mighty waves of single Being roll
102. From nerve-less germ to man, for we are part
103. Of every rock and bird and beast and hill,
104. One with the things that prey on us, and one with what we kill.

105. From lower cells of waking life we pass
106. To full perfection; thus the world grows old:
107. We who are godlike now were once a mass
108. Of quivering purple flecked with bars of gold,
109. Unsentient or of joy or misery,
110. And tossed in terrible tangles of some wild and wind-swept sea.

111. This hot hard flame with which our bodies burn
112. Will make some meadow blaze with daffodil,
113. Ay! and those argent breasts of thine will turn
114. To water-lilies; the brown fields men till
115. Will be more fruitful for our love to-night,
116. Nothing is lost in nature, all things live in Death's despite.

117. The boy's first kiss, the hyacinth's first bell,
118. The man's last passion, and the last red spear
119. That from the lily leaps, the asphodel
120. Which will not let its blossoms blow for fear
121. Of too much beauty, and the timid shame
122. Of the young bride-groom at his lover's eyes,--these with the
123. same

124. One sacrament are consecrate, the earth
125. Not we alone hath passions hymeneal,
126. The yellow buttercups that shake for mirth
127. At daybreak know a pleasure not less real
128. Than we do, when in some fresh-blossoming wood
129. We draw the spring into our hearts, and feel that life is good.

130. So when men bury us beneath the yew
131. Thy crimson-stainèd mouth a rose will be,
132. And thy soft eyes lush bluebells dimmed with dew,
133. And when the white narcissus wantonly
134. Kisses the wind its playmate, some faint joy
135. Will thrill our dust, and we will be again fond maid and boy.

136. And thus without life's conscious torturing pain
137. In some sweet flower we will feel the sun,
138. And from the linnet's throat will sing again,
139. And as two gorgeous-mailèd snakes will run
140. Over our graves, or as two tigers creep
141. Through the hot jungle where the yellow-eyed huge lions sleep

142. And give them battle! How my heart leaps up
143. To think of that grand living after death
144. In beast and bird and flower, when this cup,
145. Being filled too full of spirit, bursts for breath,
146. And with the pale leaves of some autumn day
147. The soul earth's earliest conqueror becomes earth's last great prey.

148. O think of it! We shall inform ourselves
149. Into all sensuous life, the goat-foot Faun,
150. The Centaur, or the merry bright-eyed Elves
151. That leave their dancing rings to spite the dawn
152. Upon the meadows, shall not be more near
153. Than you and I to nature's mysteries, for we shall hear

154. The thrush's heart beat, and the daisies grow,
155. And the wan snowdrop sighing for the sun
156. On sunless days in winter, we shall know
157. By whom the silver gossamer is spun,
158. Who paints the diapered fritillaries,
159. On what wide wings from shivering pine to pine the eagle flies.

160. Ay! had we never loved at all, who knows
161. If yonder daffodil had lured the bee
162. Into its gilded womb, or any rose
163. Had hung with crimson lamps its little tree!
164. Methinks no leaf would ever bud in spring,
165. But for the lovers' lips that kiss, the poets' lips that sing.

166. Is the light vanished from our golden sun,
167. Or is this dædal-fashioned earth less fair,
168. That we are nature's heritors, and one
169. With every pulse of life that beats the air?
170. Rather new suns across the sky shall pass,
171. New splendour come unto the flower, new glory to the grass.

172. And we two lovers shall not sit afar,
173. Critics of nature, but the joyous sea
174. Shall be our raiment, and the bearded star
175. Shoot arrows at our pleasure! We shall be
176. Part of the mighty universal whole,
177. And through all æons mix and mingle with the Kosmic Soul!

178. We shall be notes in that great Symphony
179. Whose cadence circles through the rhythmic spheres,
180. And all the live World's throbbing heart shall be
181. One with our heart, the stealthy creeping years
182. Have lost their terrors now, we shall not die,
183. The Universe itself shall be our Immortality!
