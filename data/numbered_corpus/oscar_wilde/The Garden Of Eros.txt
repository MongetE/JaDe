1. IT is full summer now, the heart of June,
2. Not yet the sun-burnt reapers are a-stir
3. Upon the upland meadow where too soon
4. Rich autumn time, the season's usurer,
5. Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,
6. And see his treasure scattered by the wild and spendthrift breeze.

7. Too soon indeed! yet here the daffodil,
8. That love-child of the Spring, has lingered on
9. To vex the rose with jealousy, and still
10. The harebell spreads her azure pavilion,
11. And like a strayed and wandering reveller
12. Abandoned of its brothers, whom long since June's messenger

13. The missel-thrush has frighted from the glade,
14. One pale narcissus loiters fearfully
15. Close to a shadowy nook, where half afraid
16. Of their own loveliness some violets lie
17. That will not look the gold sun in the face
18. For fear of too much splendour,--ah! methinks it is a place

19. Which should be trodden by Persephone
20. When wearied of the flowerless fields of Dis!
21. Or danced on by the lads of Arcady!
22. The hidden secret of eternal bliss
23. Known to the Grecian here a man might find,
24. Ah! you and I may find it now if Love and Sleep be kind.

25. There are the flowers which mourning Herakles
26. Strewed on the tomb of Hylas, columbine,
27. Its white doves all a-flutter where the breeze
28. Kissed them too harshly, the small celandine,
29. That yellow-kirtled chorister of eve,
30. And lilac lady's-smock,--but let them bloom alone, and leave

31. Yon spired holly-hock red-crocketed
32. To sway its silent chimes, else must the bee,
33. Its little bellringer, go seek instead
34. Some other pleasaunce; the anemone
35. That weeps at daybreak, like a silly girl
36. Before her love, and hardly lets the butterflies unfurl

37. Their painted wings beside it,--bid it pine
38. In pale virginity; the winter snow
39. Will suit it better than those lips of thine
40. Whose fires would but scorch it, rather go
41. And pluck that amorous flower which blooms alone,
42. Fed by the pander wind with dust of kisses not its own.

43. The trumpet-mouths of red convolvulus
44. So dear to maidens, creamy meadow-sweet
45. Whiter than Juno's throat and odorous
46. As all Arabia, hyacinths the feet
47. Of Huntress Dian would be loth to mar
48. For any dappled fawn,--pluck these, and those fond flowers which are

49. Fairer than what Queen Venus trod upon
50. Beneath the pines of Ida, eucharis,
51. That morning star which does not dread the sun,
52. And budding marjoram which but to kiss
53. Would sweeten Cytheræa's lips and make
54. Adonis jealous,--these for thy head,--and for thy girdle take

55. Yon curving spray of purple clematis
56. Whose gorgeous dye outflames the Tyrian King,
57. And fox-gloves with their nodding chalices,
58. But that one narciss which the startled Spring
59. Let from her kirtle fall when first she heard
60. In her own woods the wild tempestuous song of summer's bird,

61. Ah! leave it for a subtle memory
62. Of those sweet tremulous days of rain and sun,
63. When April laughed between her tears to see
64. The early primrose with shy footsteps run
65. From the gnarled oak-tree roots till all the wold,
66. Spite of its brown and trampled leaves, grew bright with shimmering
67. gold.

68. Nay, pluck it too, it is not half so sweet
69. As thou thyself, my soul's idolatry!
70. And when thou art a-wearied at thy feet
71. Shall oxlips weave their brightest tapestry,
72. For thee the woodbine shall forget its pride
73. And vail its tangled whorls, and thou shalt walk on daisies pied.

74. And I will cut a reed by yonder spring
75. And make the wood-gods jealous, and old Pan
76. Wonder what young intruder dares to sing
77. In these still haunts, where never foot of man
78. Should tread at evening, lest he chance to spy
79. The marble limbs of Artemis and all her company.

80. And I will tell thee why the jacinth wears
81. Such dread embroidery of dolorous moan,
82. And why the hapless nightingale forbears
83. To sing her song at noon, but weeps alone
84. When the fleet swallow sleeps, and rich men feast,
85. And why the laurel trembles when she sees the lightening east.

86. And I will sing how sad Proserpina
87. Unto a grave and gloomy Lord was wed,
88. And lure the silver-breasted Helena
89. Back from the lotus meadows of the dead,
90. So shalt thou see that awful loveliness
91. For which two mighty Hosts met fearfuly in war's abyss!

92. And then I 'll pipe to thee that Grecian tale
93. How Cynthia loves the lad Endymion,
94. And hidden in a grey and misty veil
95. Hies to the cliffs of Latmos once the Sun
96. Leaps from his ocean bed in fruitless chase
97. Of those pale flying feet which fade away in his embrace.

98. And if my flute can breathe sweet melody,
99. We may behold Her face who long ago
100. Dwelt among men by the Ægean sea,
101. And whose sad house with pillaged portico
102. And friezeless wall and columns toppled down
103. Looms o'er the ruins of that fair and violet-cinctured town.

104. Spirit of Beauty! tarry still a-while,
105. They are not dead, thine ancient votaries,
106. Some few there are to whom thy radiant smile
107. Is better than a thousand victories,
108. Though all the nobly slain of Waterloo
109. Rise up in wrath against them! tarry still, there are a few.

110. Who for thy sake would give their manlihood
111. And consecrate their being, I at least
112. Have done so, made thy lips my daily food,
113. And in thy temples found a goodlier feast
114. Than this starved age can give me, spite of all
115. Its new-found creeds so sceptical and so dogmatical.

116. Here not Cephissos, not Ilissos flows,
117. The woods of white Colonos are not here,
118. On our bleak hills the olive never blows,
119. No simple priest conducts his lowing steer
120. Up the steep marble way, nor through the town
121. Do laughing maidens bear to thee the crocus-flowered gown.

122. Yet tarry! for the boy who loved thee best,
123. Whose very name should be a memory
124. To make thee linger, sleeps in silent rest
125. Beneath the Roman walls, and melody
126. Still mourns her sweetest lyre, none can play
127. The lute of Adonais, with his lips Song passed away.

128. Nay, when Keats died the Muses still had left
129. One silver voice to sing his threnody,
130. But ah! too soon of it we were bereft
131. When on that riven night and stormy sea
132. Panthea claimed her singer as her own,
133. And slew the mouth that praised her; since which time we walk alone,

134. Save for that fiery heart, that morning star
135. Of re-arisen England, whose clear eye
136. Saw from our tottering throne and waste of war
137. The grand Greek limbs of young Democracy
138. Rise mightily like Hesperus and bring
139. The great Republic! him at least thy love hath taught to sing,

140. And he hath been with thee at Thessaly,
141. And seen white Atalanta fleet of foot
142. In passionless and fierce virginity
143. Hunting the tuskéd boar, his honied lute
144. Hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill,
145. And Venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still.

146. And he hath kissed the lips of Proserpine,
147. And sung the Galilæan's requiem,
148. That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine
149. He hath discrowned, the Ancient Gods in him
150. Have found their last, most ardent worshipper,
151. And the new Sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror.

152. Spirit of Beauty! tarry with us still,
153. It is not quenched the torch of poesy,
154. The star that shook above the Eastern hill
155. Holds unassailed its argent armoury
156. From all the gathering gloom and fretful fight--
157. O tarry with us still! for through the long and common night,

158. Morris, our sweet and simple Chaucer's child,
159. Dear heritor of Spenser's tuneful reed,
160. With soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled
161. The weary soul of man in troublous need,
162. And from the far and flowerless fields of ice
163. Has brought fair flowers meet to make an earthly paradise.

164. We know them all, Gudrun the strong men's bride,
165. Aslaug and Olafson we know them all,
166. How giant Grettir fought and Sigurd died,
167. And what enchantment held the king in thrall
168. When lonely Brynhild wrestled with the powers
169. That war against all passion, ah! how oft through summer hours,

170. Long listless summer hours when the noon
171. Being enamoured of a damask rose
172. Forgets to journey westward, till the moon
173. The pale usurper of its tribute grows
174. From a thin sickle to a silver shield
175. And chides its loitering car--how oft, in some cool grassy field

176. Far from the cricket-ground and noisy eight,
177. At Bagley, where the rustling bluebells come
178. Almost before the blackbird finds a mate
179. And overstay the swallow, and the hum
180. Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves,
181. Have I lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves,

182. And through their unreal woes and mimic pain
183. Wept for myself, and so was purified,
184. And in their simple mirth grew glad again;
185. For as I sailed upon that pictured tide
186. The strength and splendour of the storm was mine
187. Without the storm's red ruin, for the singer is divine,

188. The little laugh of water falling down
189. Is not so musical, the clammy gold
190. Close hoarded in the tiny waxen town
191. Has less of sweetness in it, and the old
192. Half-withered reeds that waved in Arcady
193. Touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony.

194. Spirit of Beauty tarry yet a-while!
195. Although the cheating merchants of the mart
196. With iron roads profane our lovely isle,
197. And break on whirling wheels the limbs of Art,
198. Ay! though the crowded factories beget
199. The blind-worm Ignorance that slays the soul, O tarry yet!

200. For One at least there is,--He bears his name
201. From Dante and the seraph Gabriel,--
202. Whose double laurels burn with deathless flame
203. To light thine altar; He too loves thee well,
204. Who saw old Merlin lured in Vivien's snare,
205. And the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair,

206. Loves thee so well, that all the World for him
207. A gorgeous-coloured vestiture must wear,
208. And Sorrow take a purple diadem,
209. Or else be no more Sorrow, and Despair
210. Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be
211. Even in anguish beautiful;--such is the empery

212. Which Painters hold, and such the heritage
213. This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,
214. Being a better mirror of his age
215. In all his pity, love, and weariness,
216. Than those who can but copy common things,
217. And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.

218. But they are few, and all romance has flown,
219. And men can prophesy about the sun,
220. And lecture on his arrows--how, alone,
221. Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,
222. How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,
223. And that no more 'mid English reeds a Naïad shows her head.

224. Methinks these new Actæons boast too soon
225. That they have spied on beauty; what if we
226. Have analyzed the rainbow, robbed the moon
227. Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,
228. Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope
229. Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope!

230. What profit if this scientific age
231. Burst through our gates with all its retinue
232. Of modern miracles! Can it assuage
233. One lover's breaking heart? what can it do
234. To make one life more beautiful, one day
235. More god-like in its period? but now the Age of Clay

236. Returns in horrid cycle, and the earth
237. Hath borne again a noisy progeny
238. Of ignorant Titans, whose ungodly birth
239. Hurls them against the august hierarchy
240. Which sat upon Olympus, to the Dust
241. They have appealed, and to that barren arbiter they must

242. Repair for judgment, let them, if they can,
243. From Natural Warfare and insensate Chance,
244. Create the new Ideal rule for man!
245. Methinks that was not my inheritance;
246. For I was nurtured otherwise, my soul
247. Passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme goal.

248. Lo! while we spake the earth did turn away
249. Her visage from the God, and Hecate's boat
250. Rose silver-laden, till the jealous day
251. Blew all its torches out: I did not note
252. The waning hours, to young Endymions
253. Time's palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns!--

254. Mark how the yellow iris wearily
255. Leans back its throat, as though it would be kissed
256. By its false chamberer, the dragon-fly,
257. Who, like a blue vein on a girl's white wrist,
258. Sleeps on that snowy primrose of the night,
259. Which 'gins to flush with crimson shame, and die beneath the light.

260. Come let us go, against the pallid shield
261. Of the wan sky the almond blossoms gleam,
262. The corn-crake nested in the unmown field
263. Answers its mate, across the misty stream
264. On fitful wing the startled curlews fly,
265. And in his sedgy bed the lark, for joy that Day is nigh,

266. Scatters the pearléd dew from off the grass,
267. In tremulous ecstasy to greet the sun,
268. Who soon in gilded panoply will pass
269. Forth from yon orange-curtained pavilion
270. Hung in the burning east, see, the red rim
271. O'ertops the expectant hills! it is the God! for love of him

272. Already the shrill lark is out of sight,
273. Flooding with waves of song this silent dell,--
274. Ah! there is something more in that bird's flight
275. Than could be tested in a crucible!--
276. But the air freshens, let us go,--why soon
277. The woodmen will be here; how we have lived this night of June!
