1. To that gaunt House of Art which lacks for naught
2. Of all the great things men have saved from Time,
3. The withered body of a girl was brought
4. Dead ere the world's glad youth had touched its prime,
5. And seen by lonely Arabs lying hid
6. In the dim wound of some black pyramid.

7. But when they had unloosed the linen band
8. Which swathed the Egyptian's body,- lo! was found
9. Closed in the wasted hollow of her hand
10. A little seed, which sown in English ground
11. Did wondrous snow of starry blossoms bear,
12. And spread rich odors through our springtide air.

13. With such strange arts this flower did allure
14. That all forgotten was the asphodel,
15. And the brown bee, the lily's paramour,
16. Forsook the cup where he was wont to dwell,
17. For not a thing of earth it seemed to be,
18. But stolen from some heavenly Arcady.

19. In vain the sad narcissus, wan and white
20. At its own beauty, hung across the stream,
21. The purple dragon-fly had no delight
22. With its gold-dust to make his wings a-gleam,
23. Ah! no delight the jasmine-bloom to kiss,
24. Or brush the rain-pearls from the eucharis.

25. For love of it the passionate nightingale
26. Forgot the hills of Thrace, the cruel king,
27. And the pale dove no longer cared to sail
28. Through the wet woods at time of blossoming,
29. But round this flower of Egypt sought to float,
30. With silvered wing and amethystine throat.

31. While the hot sun blazed in his tower of blue
32. A cooling wind crept from the land of snows,
33. And the warm south with tender tears of dew
34. Drenched its white leaves when Hesperos uprose
35. Amid those sea-green meadows of the sky
36. On which the scarlet bars of sunset lie.

37. But when o'er wastes of lily-haunted field
38. The tired birds had stayed their amorous tune,
39. And broad and glittering like an argent shield
40. High in the sapphire heavens hung the moon,
41. Did no strange dream or evil memory make
42. Each tremulous petal of its blossoms shake?

43. Ah no! to this bright flower a thousand years
44. Seemed but the lingering of a summer's day,
45. It never knew the tide of cankering fears
46. Which turn a boy's gold hair to withered gray,
47. The dread desire of death it never knew,
48. Or how all folk that they were born must rue.

49. For we to death with pipe and dancing go,
50. Nor would we pass the ivory gate again,
51. As some sad river wearied of its flow
52. Through the dull plains, the haunts of common men,
53. Leaps lover-like into the terrible sea!
54. And counts it gain to die so gloriously.

55. We mar our lordly strength in barren strife
56. With the world's legions led by clamorous care,
57. It never feels decay but gathers life
58. From the pure sunlight and the supreme air,
59. We live beneath Time's wasting sovereignty,
60. It is the child of all eternity.
