1. Her ivory hands on the ivory keys
2. Strayed in a fitful fantasy,
3. Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees
4. Rustle their pale-leaves listlessly,
5. Or the drifting foam of a restless sea
6. When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze.

7. Her gold hair fell on the wall of gold
8. Like the delicate gossamer tangles spun
9. On the burnished disk of the marigold,
10. Or the sunflower turning to meet the sun
11. When the gloom of the dark blue night is done,
12. And the spear of the lily is aureoled.

13. And her sweet red lips on these lips of mine
14. Burned like the ruby fire set
15. In the swinging lamp of a crimson shrine,
16. Or the bleeding wounds of the pomegranate,
17. Or the heart of the lotus drenched and wet
18. With the spilt-out blood of the rose-red wine.
