1. IN the lone tent, waiting for victory,
2. She stands with eyes marred by the mists of pain,
3. Like some wan lily overdrenched with rain:
4. The clamorous clang of arms, the ensanguined sky,
5. War's ruin, and the wreck of chivalry,
6. To her proud soul no common fear can bring:
7. Bravely she tarrieth for her Lord the King,
8. Her soul a-flame with passionate ecstasy.
9. O Hair of Gold! O Crimson Lips! O Face
10. Made for the luring and the love of man!
11. With thee I do forget the toil and stress,
12. The loveless road that knows no resting place,
13. Time's straitened pulse, the soul's dread weariness,
14. My freedom and my life republican!
