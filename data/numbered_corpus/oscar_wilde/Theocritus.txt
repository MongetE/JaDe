1. O SINGER of Persephone!
2. In the dim meadows desolate
3. Dost thou remember Sicily?
4. Still through the ivy flits the bee
5. Where Amaryllis lies in state;
6. O Singer of Persephone!

7. Sim√¶tha calls on Hecate
8. And hears the wild dogs at the gate;
9. Dost thou remember Sicily?
10. Still by the light and laughing sea
11. Poor Polypheme bemoans his fate:
12. O Singer of Persephone!

13. And still in boyish rivalry
14. Young Daphnis challenges his mate:
15. Dost thou remember Sicily?
16. Slim Lacon keeps a goat for thee,
17. For thee the jocund shepherds wait,
18. O Singer of Persephone!
19. Dost thou remember Sicily?
