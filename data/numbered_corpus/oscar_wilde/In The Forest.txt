1. Out of the mid-wood's twilight
2. Into the meadow's dawn,
3. Ivory limbed and brown-eyed,
4. Flashes my Faun!

5. He skips through the copses singing,
6. And his shadow dances along,
7. And I know not which I should follow,
8. Shadow or song!

9. O Hunter, snare me his shadow!
10. O Nightingale, catch me his strain!
11. Else moonstruck with music and madness
12. I track him in vain!
