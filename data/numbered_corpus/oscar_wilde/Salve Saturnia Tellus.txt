1. I reached the Alps: the soul within me burned
2. Italia, my Italia, at thy name:
3. And when from out the mountain's heart I came
4. And saw the land for which my life had yearned,
5. I laughed as one who some great prize had earned:
6. And musing on the story of thy fame
7. I watched the day, till marked with wounds of flame
8. The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned
9. The pine-trees waved as waves a woman's hair,
10. And in the orchards every twining spray
11. Was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam:
12. But when I knew that far away at Rome
13. In evil bonds a second Peter lay,
14. I wept to see the land so very fair.
