1. SEE, I have climbed the mountain side
2. Up to this holy house of God,
3. Where once that Angel-Painter trod
4. Who saw the heavens opened wide,

5. And throned upon the crescent moon
6. The Virginal white Queen of Grace,--
7. Mary! could I but see thy face
8. Death could not come at all too soon.

9. O crowned by God with thorns and pain!
10. Mother of Christ! O mystic wife!
11. My heart is weary of this life
12. And over-sad to sing again.

13. O crowned by God with love and flame!
14. O crowned by Christ the Holy One!
15. O listen ere the searching sun
16. Show to the world my sin and shame.
