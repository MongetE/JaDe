1. 1.

2. O goat-foot God of Arcady!
3. This modern world is grey and old,
4. And what remains to us of thee?

5. No more the shepherd lads in glee
6. Throw apples at thy wattled fold,
7. O goat-foot God of Arcady!

8. Nor through the laurels can one see
9. Thy soft brown limbs, thy beard of gold,
10. And what remains to us of thee?

11. And dull and dead our Thames would be,
12. For here the winds are chill and cold,
13. O goat-foot God of Arcady!

14. Then keep the tomb of Helice,
15. Thine olive-woods, thy vine-clad wold,
16. And what remains to us of thee?

17. Though many an unsung elegy
18. Sleeps in the reeds our rivers hold,
19. O goat-foot God of Arcady!
20. Ah, what remains to us of thee?

21. 2.

22. Ah, leave the hills of Arcady,
23. Thy satyrs and their wanton play,
24. This modern world hath need of thee.

25. No nymph of Faun indeed have we,
26. For Faun and nymph are old and grey,
27. Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!

28. This is the land where liberty
29. Lit grave-browed Milton on his way,
30. This modern world hath need of thee!
31. A land of ancient chivalry
32. Where gentle Sidney saw the day,
33. Ah, leave the hills of Arcady.

34. This fierce sea-lion of the sea,
35. This England lacks some stronger lay,
36. This modern world hath need of thee!
37. Then blow some trumpet loud and free,
38. And give thine oaten pipe away,
39. Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!
40. This modern world hath need of thee!
