1. I have no store
2. Of gryphon-guarded gold;
3. Now, as before,
4. Bare is the shepherd's fold.
5. Rubies nor pearls
6. Have I to gem thy throat;
7. Yet woodland girls
8. Have loved the shepherd's note.

9. Then pluck a reed
10. And bid me sing to thee,
11. For I would feed
12. Thine ears with melody,
13. Who art more fair
14. Than fairest fleur-de-lys,
15. More sweet and rare
16. Than sweetest ambergris.

17. What dost thou fear?
18. Young Hyacinth is slain,
19. Pan is not here,
20. And will not come again.
21. No horned Faun
22. Treads down the yellow leas,
23. No God at dawn
24. Steals through the olive trees.

25. Hylas is dead,
26. Nor will he e'er divine
27. Those little red
28. Rose-petalled lips of thine.
29. On the high hill
30. No ivory dryads play,
31. Silver and still
32. Sinks the sad autumn day.
