1. I STOOD by the unvintageable sea
2. Till the wet waves drenched face and hair with spray,
3. The long red fires of the dying day
4. Burned in the west; the wind piped drearily;
5. And to the land the clamorous gulls did flee:
6. 'Alas!' I cried, 'my life is full of pain,
7. And who can garner fruit or golden grain,
8. From these waste fields which travail ceaselessly!'
9. My nets gaped wide with many a break and flaw
10. Nathless I threw them as my final cast
11. Into the sea, and waited for the end.
12. When lo! a sudden glory! and I saw
13. The argent splendour of white limbs ascend,
14. And in that joy forgot my tortured past.
