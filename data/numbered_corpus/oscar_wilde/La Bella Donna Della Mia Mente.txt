1. MY limbs are wasted with a flame,
2. My feet are sore with travelling,
3. For calling on my Lady's name
4. My lips have now forgot to sing.

5. O Linnet in the wild-rose brake
6. Strain for my Love thy melody,
7. O Lark sing louder for love's sake,
8. My gentle Lady passeth by.

9. She is too fair for any man
10. To see or hold his heart's delight,
11. Fairer than Queen or courtezan
12. Or moon-lit water in the night.

13. Her hair is bound with myrtle leaves,
14. (Green leaves upon her golden hair!)
15. Green grasses through the yellow sheaves
16. Of autumn corn are not more fair.

17. Her little lips, more made to kiss
18. Than to cry bitterly for pain,
19. Are tremulous as brook-water is,
20. Or roses after evening rain.

21. Her neck is like white melilote
22. Flushing for pleasure of the sun,
23. The throbbing of the linnet's throat
24. Is not so sweet to look upon.

25. As a pomegranate, cut in twain,
26. White-seeded, is her crimson mouth,
27. Her cheeks are as the fading stain
28. Where the peach reddens to the south.

29. O twining hands! O delicate
30. White body made for love and pain!
31. O House of love! O desolate
32. Pale flower beaten by the rain!
