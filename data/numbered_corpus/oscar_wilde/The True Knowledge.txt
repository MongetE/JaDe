1. Thou knowest all; I seek in vain
2. What lands to till or sow with seed -
3. The land is black with briar and weed,
4. Nor cares for falling tears or rain.

5. Thou knowest all; I sit and wait
6. With blinded eyes and hands that fail,
7. Till the last lifting of the veil
8. And the first opening of the gate.

9. Thou knowest all; I cannot see.
10. I trust I shall not live in vain,
11. I know that we shall meet again
12. In some divine eternity.
