1. CHRIST, dost thou live indeed? or are thy bones
2. Still straightened in their rock-hewn sepulchre?
3. And was thy Rising only dreamed by Her
4. Whose love of thee for all her sin atones?
5. For here the air is horrid with men's groans,
6. The priests who call upon thy name are slain,
7. Dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain
8. From those whose children lie upon the stones?
9. Come down, O Son of God! incestuous gloom
10. Curtains the land, and through the starless night
11. Over thy Cross the Crescent moon I see!
12. If thou in very truth didst burst the tomb
13. Come down, O Son of Man! and show thy might,
14. Lest Mahomet be crowned instead of Thee!
