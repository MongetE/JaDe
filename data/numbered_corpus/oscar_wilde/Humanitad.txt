1. IT is full Winter now: the trees are bare,
2. Save where the cattle huddle from the cold
3. Beneath the pine, for it doth never wear
4. The Autumn's gaudy livery whose gold
5. Her jealous brother pilfers, but is true
6. To the green doublet; bitter is the wind, as though it blew

7. From Saturn's cave; a few thin wisps of hay
8. Lie on the sharp black hedges, where the wain
9. Dragged the sweet pillage of a summer's day
10. From the low meadows up the narrow lane;
11. Upon the half-thawed snow the bleating sheep
12. Press close against the hurdles, and the shivering house-dogs creep

13. From the shut stable to the frozen stream
14. And back again disconsolate, and miss
15. The bawling shepherds and the noisy team;
16. And overhead in circling listlessness
17. The cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack,
18. Or crowd the dripping boughs; and in the fen the ice-pools crack

19. Where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds
20. And flaps his wings, and stretches back his neck,
21. And hoots to see the moon; across the meads
22. Limps the poor frightened hare, a little speck;
23. And a stray seamew with its fretful cry
24. Flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky.

25. Full winter: and the lusty goodman brings
26. His load of faggots from the chilly byre,
27. And stamps his feet upon the hearth, and flings
28. The sappy billets on the waning fire,
29. And laughs to see the sudden lightening scare
30. His children at their play; and yet,--the Spring is in the air,

31. Already the slim crocus stirs the snow,
32. And soon yon blanchèd fields will bloom again
33. With nodding cowslips for some lad to mow,
34. For with the first warm kisses of the rain
35. The winter's icy sorrow breaks to tears,
36. And the brown thrushes mate, and with bright eyes the rabbit peers

37. From the dark warren where the fir-cones lie,
38. And treads one snowdrop under foot, and runs
39. Over the mossy knoll, and blackbirds fly
40. Across our path at evening, and the suns
41. Stay longer with us; ah! how good to see
42. Grass-girdled Spring in all her joy of laughing greenery

43. Dance through the hedges till the early rose,
44. (That sweet repentance of the thorny briar!)
45. Burst from its sheathèd emerald and disclose
46. The little quivering disk of golden fire
47. Which the bees know so well, for with it come
48. Pale boys-love, sops-in-wine, and daffadillies all in bloom.

49. Then up and down the field the sower goes,
50. While close behind the laughing younker scares
51. With shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows,
52. And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears,
53. And on the grass the creamy blossom falls
54. In odorous excess, and faint half-whispered madrigals

55. Steal from the bluebells' nodding carillons
56. Each breezy morn, and then white jessamine,
57. That star of its own heaven, snapdragons
58. With lolling crimson tongues, and eglantine
59. In dusty velvets clad usurp the bed
60. And woodland empery, and when the lingering rose hath shed

61. Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply,
62. And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes,
63. Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy
64. Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise,
65. And violets getting overbold withdraw
66. From their shy nooks, and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw.

67. O happy field! and O thrice happy tree!
68. Soon will your queen in daisy-flowered smock
69. And crown of flowre-de-luce trip down the lea,
70. Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock
71. Back to the pasture by the pool, and soon
72. Through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at
73. noon.

74. Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour,
75. The flower which wantons love, and those sweet nuns
76. Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture
77. Will tell their beaded pearls, and carnations
78. With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind,
79. And straggling traveller's joy each hedge with yellow stars will
80. bind.

81. Dear Bride of Nature and most bounteous Spring!
82. That can'st give increase to the sweet-breath'd kine,
83. And to the kid its little horns, and bring
84. The soft and silky blossoms to the vine,
85. Where is that old nepenthe which of yore
86. Man got from poppy root and glossy-berried mandragore!

87. There was a time when any common bird
88. Could make me sing in unison, a time
89. When all the strings of boyish life were stirred
90. To quick response or more melodious rhyme
91. By every forest idyll;--do I change?
92. Or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range?

93. Nay, nay, thou art the same: 'tis I who seek
94. To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,
95. And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek
96. Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;
97. Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare
98. To taint such wine with the salt poison of his own despair!

99. Thou art the same: 'tis I whose wretched soul
100. Takes discontent to be its paramour,
101. And gives its kingdom to the rude control
102. Of what should be its servitor,--for sure
103. Wisdom is somewhere, though the stormy sea
104. Contain it not, and the huge deep answer ''Tis not in me.'

105. To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect
106. In natural honour, not to bend the knee
107. In profitless prostrations whose effect
108. Is by itself condemned, what alchemy
109. Can teach me this? what herb Medea brewed
110. Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?

111. The minor chord which ends the harmony,
112. And for its answering brother waits in vain,
113. Sobbing for incompleted melody
114. Dies a Swan's death; but I the heir of pain
115. A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes
116. Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.

117. The quenched-out torch, the lonely cypress-gloom,
118. The little dust stored in the narrow urn,
119. The gentle XAIPE of the Attic tomb,--
120. Were not these better far than to return
121. To my old fitful restless malady,
122. Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?

123. Nay! for perchance that poppy-crownèd God
124. Is like the watcher by a sick man's bed
125. Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod
126. Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,
127. Death is too rude, too obvious a key
128. To solve one single secret in a life's philosophy.

129. And Love! that noble madness, whose august
130. And inextinguishable might can slay
131. The soul with honied drugs,--alas! I must
132. From such sweet ruin play the runaway,
133. Although too constant memory never can
134. Forget the archèd splendour of those brows Olympian

135. Which for a little season made my youth
136. So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence
137. That all the chiding of more prudent Truth
138. Seemed the thin voice of jealousy,--O Hence
139. Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!
140. Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss

141. My lips have drunk enough,--no more, no more,--
142. Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow
143. Back to the troubled waters of this shore
144. Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now
145. The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,
146. Hence! Hence! I pass unto a life more barren, more austere.

147. More barren--ay, those arms will never lean
148. Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul
149. In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;
150. Some other head must wear that aureole,
151. For I am Hers who loves not any man
152. Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.

153. Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,
154. And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,
155. With net and spear and hunting equipage
156. Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,
157. But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell
158. Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel.

159. Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy
160. Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud
161. Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy
162. And knew the coming of the Queen, and bowed
163. In wonder at her feet, not for the sake
164. Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.

165. Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!
166. And, if my lips be musicless, inspire
167. At least my life: was not thy glory hymned
168. By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre
169. Like Æschylus at well-fought Marathon,
170. And died to show that Milton's England still could bear a son!

171. And yet I cannot tread the Portico
172. And live without desire, fear, and pain,
173. Or nurture that wise calm which long ago
174. The grave Athenian master taught to men,
175. Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,
176. To watch the world's vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.

177. Alas! that serene brow, those eloquent lips,
178. Those eyes that mirrored all eternity,
179. Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse
180. Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne
181. Is childless; in the night which she had made
182. For lofty secure flight Athena's owl itself hath strayed.

183. Nor much with Science do I care to climb,
184. Although by strange and subtle witchery
185. She draw the moon from heaven: the Muse of Time
186. Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry
187. To no less eager eyes; often indeed
188. In the great epic of Polymnia's scroll I love to read

189. How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war
190. Against a little town, and panoplied
191. In gilded mail with jewelled scimetar,
192. White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede
193. Between the waving poplars and the sea
194. Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopylæ

195. Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,
196. And on the nearer side a little brood
197. Of careless lions holding festival!
198. And stood amazèd at such hardihood,
199. And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,
200. And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o'er

201. Some unfrequented height, and coming down
202. The autumn forests treacherously slew
203. What Sparta held most dear and was the crown
204. Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew
205. How God had staked an evil net for him
206. In the small bay of Salamis,--and yet, the page grows dim,

207. Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel
208. With such a goodly time too out of tune
209. To love it much: for like the Dial's wheel
210. That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon
211. Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes
212. Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.

213. O for one grand unselfish simple life
214. To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills
215. Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife
216. Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,
217. Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly
218. Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!

219. Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is He
220. Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul
221. Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty
222. Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal
223. Where Love and Duty mingle! Him at least
224. The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom's feast,

225. But we are Learning's changelings, know by rote
226. The clarion watchword of each Grecian school
227. And follow none, the flawless sword which smote
228. The pagan Hydra is an effete tool
229. Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now
230. Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?

231. One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!
232. Gone is that last dear son of Italy,
233. Who being man died for the sake of God,
234. And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully.
235. O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower,
236. Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour

237. Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or
238. The Arno with its tawny troubled gold
239. O'erleap its marge, no mightier conqueror
240. Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old
241. When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty
242. Walked like a Bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery

243. Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell
244. With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,
245. Fled shuddering for that immemorial knell
246. With which oblivion buries dynasties
247. Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,
248. As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.

249. He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,
250. He drave the base wolf from the lion's lair,
251. And now lies dead by that empyreal dome
252. Which overtops Valdarno hung in air
253. By Brunelleschi--O Melpomene
254. Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!

255. Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies
256. That Joy's self may grow jealous, and the Nine
257. Forget a-while their discreet emperies,
258. Mourning for him who on Rome's lordliest shrine
259. Lit for men's lives the light of Marathon,
260. And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!

261. O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower,
262. Let some young Florentine each eventide
263. Bring coronals of that enchanted flower
264. Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,
265. And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies
266. Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes.

267. Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,
268. Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim
269. Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings
270. Of the eternal chanting Cherubim
271. Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away
272. Into a moonless void,--and yet, though he is dust and clay,

273. He is not dead, the immemorial Fates
274. Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain,
275. Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!
276. Ye argent clarions sound a loftier strain!
277. For the vile thing he hated lurks within
278. Its sombre house, alone with God and memories of sin.

279. Still what avails it that she sought her cave
280. That murderous mother of red harlotries?
281. At Munich on the marble architrave
282. The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas
283. Which wash Ægina fret in loneliness
284. Not mirroring their beauty, so our lives grow colourless

285. For lack of our ideals, if one star
286. Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust
287. Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war
288. Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust
289. Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe
290. For all her stony sorrows hath her sons, but Italy!

291. What Easter Day shall make her children rise,
292. Who were not Gods yet suffered? what sure feet
293. Shall find their graveclothes folded? what clear eyes
294. Shall see them bodily? O it were meet
295. To roll the stone from off the sepulchre
296. And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of Her

297. Our Italy! our mother visible!
298. Most blessed among nations and most sad,
299. For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell
300. That day at Aspromonte and was glad
301. That in an age when God was bought and sold
302. One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold,

303. See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves
304. Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty
305. Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives
306. Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,
307. And no word said:--O we are wretched men
308. Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen

309. Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword
310. Which slew its master righteously? the years
311. Have lost their ancient leader, and no word
312. Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:
313. While as a ruined mother in some spasm
314. Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm

315. Genders unlawful children, Anarchy
316. Freedom's own Judas, the vile prodigal
317. Licence who steals the gold of Liberty
318. And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real
319. One Fratricide since Cain, Envy the asp
320. That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp

321. Is in its extent stiffened, monied Greed
322. For whose dull appetite men waste away
323. Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed
324. Of things which slay their sower, these each day
325. Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet
326. Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.

327. What even Cromwell spared is desecrated
328. By weed and worm, left to the stormy play
329. Of wind and beating snow, or renovated
330. By more destructful hands: Time's worst decay
331. Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,
332. But these new Vandals can but make a rainproof barrenness.

333. Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing
334. Through Lincoln's lofty choir, till the air
335. Seems from such marble harmonies to ring
336. With sweeter song than common lips can dare
337. To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now
338. The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow

339. For Southwell's arch, and carved the House of One
340. Who loved the lilies of the field with all
341. Our dearest English flowers? the same sun
342. Rises for us: the seasons natural
343. Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:
344. The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.

345. And yet perchance it may be better so,
346. For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,
347. Murder her brother is her bedfellow,
348. And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene
349. And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;
350. Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!

351. For gentle brotherhood, the harmony
352. Of living in the healthful air, the swift
353. Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free
354. And women chaste, these are the things which lift
355. Our souls up more than even Agnolo's
356. Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o'er the scroll of human woes,

357. Or Titian's little maiden on the stair
358. White as her own sweet lily and as tall,
359. Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair,--
360. Ah! somehow life is bigger after all
361. Than any painted angel could we see
362. The God that is within us! The old Greek serenity

363. Which curbs the passion of that level line
364. Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes
365. And chastened limbs ride round Athena's shrine
366. And mirror her divine economies,
367. And balanced symmetry of what in man
368. Would else wage ceaseless warfare,--this at least within the span

369. Between our mother's kisses and the grave
370. Might so inform our lives, that we could win
371. Such mighty empires that from her cave
372. Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin
373. Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,
374. And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.

375. To make the Body and the Spirit one
376. With all right things, till no thing live in vain
377. From morn to noon, but in sweet unison
378. With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain
379. The Soul in flawless essence high enthroned,
380. Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,

381. Mark with serene impartiality
382. The strife of things, and yet be comforted,
383. Knowing that by the chain causality
384. All separate existences are wed
385. Into one supreme whole, whose utterance
386. Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance

387. Of Life in most august omnipresence,
388. Through which the rational intellect would find
389. In passion its expression, and mere sense,
390. Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,
391. And being joined with in harmony
392. More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,

393. Strike from their several tones one octave chord
394. Whose cadence being measureless would fly
395. Through all the circling spheres, then to its Lord
396. Return refreshed with its new empery
397. And more exultant power,--this indeed
398. Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed.

399. Ah! it was easy when the world was young
400. To keep one's life free and inviolate,
401. From our sad lips another song is rung,
402. By our own hands our heads are desecrate,
403. Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed
404. Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest.

405. Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,
406. And of all men we are most wretched who
407. Must live each other's lives and not our own
408. For very pity's sake and then undo
409. All that we live for--it was otherwise
410. When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.

411. But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
412. With weary feet to the new Calvary,
413. Where we behold, as one who in a glass
414. Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,
415. And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze
416. Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.

417. O smitten mouth! O forehead crowned with thorn!
418. O chalice of all common miseries!
419. Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne
420. An agony of endless centuries,
421. And we were vain and ignorant nor knew
422. That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we
423. slew.

424. Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,
425. The night that covers and the lights that fade,
426. The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,
427. The lips betraying and the life betrayed;
428. The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we
429. Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.

430. Is this the end of all that primal force
431. Which, in its changes being still the same,
432. From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,
433. Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,
434. Till the suns met in heaven and began
435. Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!

436. Nay, nay, we are but crucified and though
437. The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain,
438. Loosen the nails--we shall come down I know,
439. Staunch the red wounds--we shall be whole again,
440. No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,
441. That which is purely human, that is Godlike, that is God.
