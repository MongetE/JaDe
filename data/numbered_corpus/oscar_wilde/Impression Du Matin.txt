1. THE Thames nocturne of blue and gold
2. Changed to a Harmony in grey:
3. A barge with ochre-coloured hay
4. Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold

5. The yellow fog came creeping down
6. The bridges, till the houses' walls
7. Seemed changed to shadows, and S. Paul's
8. Loomed like a bubble o'er the town.

9. Then suddenly arose the clang
10. Of waking life; the streets were stirred
11. With country waggons: and a bird
12. Flew to the glistening roofs and sang.

13. But one pale woman all alone,
14. The daylight kissing her wan hair,
15. Loitered beneath the gas lamps' flare,
16. With lips of flame and heart of stone.
