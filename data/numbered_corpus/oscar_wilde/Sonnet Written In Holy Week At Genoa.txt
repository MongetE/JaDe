1. I WANDERED in Scoglietto's green retreat,
2. The oranges on each o'erhanging spray
3. Burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day;
4. Some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet
5. Made snow of all the blossoms, at my feet
6. Like silver moons the pale narcissi lay:
7. And the curved waves that streaked the sapphire bay
8. Laughed i' the sun, and life seemed very sweet.
9. Outside the young boy-priest passed singing clear,
10. "Jesus the Son of Mary has been slain,
11. O come and fill his sepulchre with flowers."
12. Ah, God! Ah, God! those dear Hellenic hours
13. Had drowned all memory of Thy bitter pain,
14. The Cross, the Crown, the Soldiers, and the Spear.
