1. WAS this His coming! I had hoped to see
2. A scene of wondrous glory, as was told
3. Of some great God who in a rain of gold
4. Broke open bars and fell on Danae:
5. Or a dread vision as when Semele
6. Sickening for love and unappeased desire
7. Prayed to see God's clear body, and the fire
8. Caught her white limbs and slew her utterly:
9. With such glad dreams I sought this holy place,
10. And now with wondering eyes and heart I stand
11. Before this supreme mystery of Love:
12. A kneeling girl with passionless pale face,
13. An angel with a lily in his hand,
14. And over both with outstretched wings the Dove.
