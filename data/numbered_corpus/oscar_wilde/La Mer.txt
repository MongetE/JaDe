1. A white mist drifts across the shrouds,
2. A wild moon in this wintry sky
3. Gleams like an angry lion's eye
4. Out of a mane of tawny clouds.

5. The muffled steersman at the wheel
6. Is but a shadow in the gloom; -
7. And in the throbbing engine-room
8. Leap the long rods of polished steel.

9. The shattered storm has left its trace
10. Upon this huge and heaving dome,
11. For the thin threads of yellow foam
12. Float on the waves like ravelled lace.
