1. NOT that I love thy children, whose dull eyes
2. See nothing save their own unlovely woe,
3. Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,--
4. But that the roar of thy Democracies,
5. Thy reigns of Terror, thy great Anarchies,
6. Mirror my wildest passions like the sea,--
7. And give my rage a brother----! Liberty!
8. For this sake only do thy dissonant cries
9. Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings
10. By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades
11. Rob nations of their rights inviolate
12. And I remain unmoved--and yet, and yet,
13. These Christs that die upon the barricades,
14. God knows it I am with them, in some things.
