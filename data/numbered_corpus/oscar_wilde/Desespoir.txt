1. The seasons send their ruin as they go,
2. For in the spring the narciss shows its head
3. Nor withers till the rose has flamed to red,
4. And in the autumn purple violets blow,
5. And the slim crocus stirs the winter snow;
6. Wherefore yon leafless trees will bloom again
7. And this grey land grow green with summer rain
8. And send up cowslips for some boy to mow.

9. But what of life whose bitter hungry sea
10. Flows at our heels, and gloom of sunless night
11. Covers the days which never more return?
12. Ambition, love and all the thoughts that burn
13. We lose too soon, and only find delight
14. In withered husks of some dead memory.
