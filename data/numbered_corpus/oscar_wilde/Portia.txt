1. I MARVEL not Bassanio was so bold
2. To peril all he had upon the lead,
3. Or that proud Aragon bent low his head,
4. Or that Morocco's fiery heart grew cold:
5. For in that gorgeous dress of beaten gold
6. Which is more golden than the golden sun,
7. No woman Veronesé looked upon
8. Was half so fair as thou whom I behold.
9. Yet fairer when with wisdom as your shield
10. The sober-suited lawyer's gown you donned
11. And would not let the laws of Venice yield
12. Antonio's heart to that accursèd Jew--
13. O Portia! take my heart: it is thy due:
14. I think I will not quarrel with the Bond.
