1. The sin was mine; I did not understand.
2. So now is music prisoned in her cave,
3. Save where some ebbing desultory wave
4. Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand.
5. And in the withered hollow of this land
6. Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave,
7. That hardly can the leaden willow crave
8. One silver blossom from keen Winter's hand.

9. But who is this who cometh by the shore?
10. (Nay, love, look up and wonder!) Who is this
11. Who cometh in dyed garments from the South?
12. It is thy new-found Lord, and he shall kiss
13. The yet unravished roses of thy mouth,
14. And I shall weep and worship, as before.
