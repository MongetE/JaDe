1. THERE was a time in Europe long ago
2. When no man died for freedom anywhere,
3. But England's lion leaping from its lair
4. Laid hands on the oppressor! it was so
5. While England could a great Republic show.
6. Witness the men of Piedmont, chiefest care
7. Of Cromwell, when with impotent despair
8. The Pontiff in his painted portico
9. Trembled before our stern ambassadors.
10. How comes it then that from such high estate
11. We have thus fallen, save that Luxury
12. With barren merchandise piles up the gate
13. Where nobler thoughts and deeds should enter by:
14. Else might we still be Milton's heritors.
