1. THE silver trumpets rang across the Dome:
2. The people knelt upon the ground with awe:
3. And borne upon the necks of men I saw,
4. Like some great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.
5. Priest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,
6. And, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,
7. Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head:
8. In splendour and in light the Pope passed home.
9. My heart stole back across wide wastes of years
10. To One who wandered by a lonely sea,
11. And sought in vain for any place of rest:
12. 'Foxes have holes, and every bird its nest,
13. I, only I, must wander wearily,
14. And bruise my feet, and drink wine salt with tears.'
