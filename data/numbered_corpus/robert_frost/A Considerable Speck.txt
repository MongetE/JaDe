1. (Microscopic)

2. A speck that would have been beneath my sight
3. On any but a paper sheet so white
4. Set off across what I had written there.
5. And I had idly poised my pen in air
6. To stop it with a period of ink
7. When something strange about it made me think,
8. This was no dust speck by my breathing blown,
9. But unmistakably a living mite
10. With inclinations it could call its own.
11. It paused as with suspicion of my pen,
12. And then came racing wildly on again
13. To where my manuscript was not yet dry;
14. Then paused again and either drank or smelt--
15. With loathing, for again it turned to fly.
16. Plainly with an intelligence I dealt.
17. It seemed too tiny to have room for feet,
18. Yet must have had a set of them complete
19. To express how much it didn't want to die.
20. It ran with terror and with cunning crept.
21. It faltered: I could see it hesitate;
22. Then in the middle of the open sheet
23. Cower down in desperation to accept
24. Whatever I accorded it of fate.
25. I have none of the tenderer-than-thou
26. Collectivistic regimenting love
27. With which the modern world is being swept.
28. But this poor microscopic item now!
29. Since it was nothing I knew evil of
30. I let it lie there till I hope it slept.

31. I have a mind myself and recognize
32. Mind when I meet with it in any guise
33. No one can know how glad I am to find
34. On any sheet the least display of mind.
