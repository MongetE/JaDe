1. I left you in the morning,
2. And in the morning glow,
3. You walked a way beside me
4. To make me sad to go.
5. Do you know me in the gloaming,
6. Gaunt and dusty gray with roaming?
7. Are you dumb because you know me not,
8. Or dumb because you know?

9. All for me And not a question
10. For the faded flowers gay
11. That could take me from beside you
12. For the ages of a day?
13. They are yours, and be the measure
14. Of their worth for you to treasure,
15. The measure of the little while
16. That I've been long away.
