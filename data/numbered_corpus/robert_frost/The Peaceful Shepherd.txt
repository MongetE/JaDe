1. If heaven were to do again,
2. And on the pasture bars,
3. I leaned to line the figures in
4. Between the dotted stars,

5. I should be tempted to forget,
6. I fear, the Crown of Rule,
7. The Scales of Trade, the Cross of Faith,
8. As hardly worth renewal.

9. For these have governed in our lives,
10. And see how men have warred.
11. The Cross, the Crown, the Scales may all
12. As well have been the Sword.
