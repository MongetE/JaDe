1. I had for my winter evening walk-
2. No one at all with whom to talk,
3. But I had the cottages in a row
4. Up to their shining eyes in snow.

5. And I thought I had the folk within:
6. I had the sound of a violin;
7. I had a glimpse through curtain laces
8. Of youthful forms and youthful faces.

9. I had such company outward bound.
10. I went till there were no cottages found.
11. I turned and repented, but coming back
12. I saw no window but that was black.

13. Over the snow my creaking feet
14. Disturbed the slumbering village street
15. Like profanation, by your leave,
16. At ten o'clock of a winter eve.
