1. When the spent sun throws up its rays on cloud
2. And goes down burning into the gulf below,
3. No voice in nature is heard to cry aloud
4. At what has happened. Birds, at least must know
5. It is the change to darkness in the sky.
6. Murmuring something quiet in her breast,
7. One bird begins to close a faded eye;
8. Or overtaken too far from his nest,
9. Hurrying low above the grove, some waif
10. Swoops just in time to his remembered tree.
11. At most he thinks or twitters softly, 'Safe!
12. Now let the night be dark for all of me.
13. Let the night bee too dark for me to see
14. Into the future. Let what will be, be.'
