1. A saturated meadow,
2. Sun-shaped and jewel-small,
3. A circle scarcely wider
4. Than the trees around were tall;
5. Where winds were quite excluded,
6. And the air was stifling sweet
7. With the breath of many flowers, --
8. A temple of the heat.

9. There we bowed us in the burning,
10. As the sun's right worship is,
11. To pick where none could miss them
12. A thousand orchises;
13. For though the grass was scattered,
14. yet every second spear
15. Seemed tipped with wings of color,
16. That tinged the atmosphere.

17. We raised a simple prayer
18. Before we left the spot,
19. That in the general mowing
20. That place might be forgot;
21. Or if not all so favored,
22. Obtain such grace of hours,
23. that none should mow the grass there
24. While so confused with flowers.
