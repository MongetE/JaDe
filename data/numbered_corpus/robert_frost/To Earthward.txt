1. Love at the lips was touch
2. As sweet as I could bear;
3. And once that seemed too much;
4. I lived on air

5. That crossed me from sweet things,
6. The flow of - was it musk
7. From hidden grapevine springs
8. Down hill at dusk?

9. I had the swirl and ache
10. From sprays of honeysuckle
11. That when they're gathered shake
12. Dew on the knuckle.

13. I craved strong sweets, but those
14. Seemed strong when I was young;
15. The petal of the rose
16. It was that stung.

17. Now no joy but lacks salt
18. That is not dashed with pain
19. And weariness and fault;
20. I crave the stain

21. Of tears, the aftermark
22. Of almost too much love,
23. The sweet of bitter bark
24. And burning clove.

25. When stiff and sore and scarred
26. I take away my hand
27. From leaning on it hard
28. In grass and sand,

29. The hurt is not enough:
30. I long for weight and strength
31. To feel the earth as rough
32. To all my length.
