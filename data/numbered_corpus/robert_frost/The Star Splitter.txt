1. `You know Orion always comes up sideways.
2. Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,
3. And rising on his hands, he looks in on me
4. Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something
5. I should have done by daylight, and indeed,
6. After the ground is frozen, I should have done
7. Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful
8. Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
9. To make fun of my way of doing things,
10. Or else fun of Orion's having caught me.
11. Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights
12. These forces are obliged to pay respect to?'
13. So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk
14. Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,
15. Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming
16. He burned his house down for the fire insurance
17. And spent the proceeds on a telescope
18. To satisfy a lifelong curiosity
19. About our place among the infinities.

20. `What do you want with one of those blame things?'
21. I asked him well beforehand. `Don't you get one!'

22. `Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything
23. More blameless in the sense of being less
24. A weapon in our human fight,' he said.
25. `I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.'
26. There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
27. And plowed between the rocks he couldn't move,
28. Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years
29. Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,
30. He burned his house down for the fire insurance
31. And bought the telescope with what it came to.
32. He had been heard to say by several:
33. `The best thing that we're put here for's to see;
34. The strongest thing that's given us to see with's
35. A telescope. Someone in every town
36. Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.
37. In Littleton it might as well be me.'
38. After such loose talk it was no surprise
39. When he did what he did and burned his house down.

40. Mean laughter went about the town that day
41. To let him know we weren't the least imposed on,
42. And he could wait---we'd see to him tomorrow.
43. But the first thing next morning we reflected
44. If one by one we counted people out
45. For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long
46. To get so we had no one left to live with.
47. For to be social is to be forgiving.
48. Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,
49. We don't cut off from coming to church suppers,
50. But what we miss we go to him and ask for.
51. He promptly gives it back, that is if still
52. Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of.
53. It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad
54. About his telescope. Beyond the age
55. Of being given one for Christmas gift,
56. He had to take the best way he knew how
57. To find himself in one. Well, all we said was
58. He took a strange thing to be roguish over.
59. Some sympathy was wasted on the house,
60. A good old-timer dating back along;
61. But a house isn't sentient; the house
62. Didn't feel anything. And if it did,
63. Why not regard it as a sacrifice,
64. And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,
65. Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?

66. Out of a house and so out of a farm
67. At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn
68. To earn a living on the Concord railroad,
69. As under-ticket-agent at a station
70. Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets,
71. Was setting out, up track and down, not plants
72. As on a farm, but planets, evening stars
73. That varied in their hue from red to green.

74. He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.
75. His new job gave him leisure for stargazing.
76. Often he bid me come and have a look
77. Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,
78. At a star quaking in the other end.
79. I recollect a night of broken clouds
80. And underfoot snow melted down to ice,
81. And melting further in the wind to mud.
82. Bradford and I had out the telescope.
83. We spread our two legs as we spread its three,
84. Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,
85. And standing at our leisure till the day broke,
86. Said some of the best things we ever said.
87. That telescope was christened the Star-Splitter,
88. Because it didn't do a thing but split
89. A star in two or three, the way you split
90. A globule of quicksilver in your hand
91. With one stroke of your finger in the middle.
92. It's a star-splitter if there ever was one,
93. And ought to do some good if splitting stars
94. 'Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood.

95. We've looked and looked, but after all where are we?
96. Do we know any better where we are,
97. And how it stands between the night tonight
98. And a man with a smoky lantern chimney?
99. How different from the way it ever stood?
