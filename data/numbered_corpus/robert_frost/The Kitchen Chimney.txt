1. Builder, in building the little house,
2. In every way you may please yourself;
3. But please please me in the kitchen chimney:
4. Don't build me a chimney upon a shelf.

5. However far you must go for bricks,
6. Whatever they cost a-piece or a pound,
7. But me enough for a full-length chimney,
8. And build the chimney clear from the ground.

9. It's not that I'm greatly afraid of fire,
10. But I never heard of a house that throve
11. (And I know of one that didn't thrive)
12. Where the chimney started above the stove.

13. And I dread the ominous stain of tar
14. That there always is on the papered walls,
15. And the smell of fire drowned in rain
16. That there always is when the chimney's false.

17. A shelf's for a clock or vase or picture,
18. But I don't see why it should have to bear
19. A chimney that only would serve to remind me
20. Of castles I used to build in air.
