1. Two fairies it was
2. On a still summer day
3. Came forth in the woods
4. With the flowers to play.
5. The flowers they plucked
6. They cast on the ground
7. For others, and those
8. For still others they found.
9. Flower-guided it was
10. That they came as they ran
11. On something that lay
12. In the shape of a man.
13. The snow must have made
14. The feathery bed
15. When this one fell
16. On the sleep of the dead.
17. But the snow was gone
18. A long time ago,
19. And the body he wore
20. Nigh gone with the snow.
21. The fairies drew near
22. And keenly espied
23. A ring on his hand
24. And a chain at his side.
25. They knelt in the leaves
26. And eerily played
27. With the glittering things,
28. And were not afraid.
29. And when they went home
30. To hide in their burrow,
31. They took them along
32. To play with to-morrow.
33. When you came on death,
34. Did you not come flower-guided
35. Like the elves in the wood?
36. I remember that I did.
37. But I recognised death
38. With sorrow and dread,
39. And I hated and hate
40. The spoils of the dead.
