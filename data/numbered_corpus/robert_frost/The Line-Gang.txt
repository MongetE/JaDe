1. Here come the line-gang pioneering by,
2. They throw a forest down less cut than broken.
3. They plant dead trees for living, and the dead
4. They string together with a living thread.
5. They string an instrument against the sky
6. Wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
7. Will run as hushed as when they were a thought
8. But in no hush they string it: they go past
9. With shouts afar to pull the cable taught,
10. To hold it hard until they make it fast,
11. To ease away -- they have it. With a laugh,
12. An oath of towns that set the wild at naught
13. They bring the telephone and telegraph.
