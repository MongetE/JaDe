1. Why make so much of fragmentary blue
2. In here and there a bird, or butterfly,
3. Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,
4. When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?

5. Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)--
6. Though some savants make earth include the sky;
7. And blue so far above us comes so high,
8. It only gives our wish for blue a whet.
