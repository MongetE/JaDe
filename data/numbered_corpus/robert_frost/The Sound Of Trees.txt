1. I wonder about the trees.
2. Why do we wish to bear
3. Forever the noise of these
4. More than another noise
5. So close to our dwelling place?
6. We suffer them by the day
7. Till we lose all measure of pace,
8. And fixity in our joys,
9. And acquire a listening air.
10. They are that that talks of going
11. But never gets away;
12. And that talks no less for knowing,
13. As it grows wiser and older,
14. That now it means to stay.
15. My feet tug at the floor
16. And my head sways to my shoulder
17. Sometimes when I watch trees sway,
18. From the window or the door.
19. I shall set forth for somewhere,
20. I shall make the reckless choice
21. Some day when they are in voice
22. And tossing so as to scare
23. The white clouds over them on.
24. I shall have less to say,
25. But I shall be gone.
