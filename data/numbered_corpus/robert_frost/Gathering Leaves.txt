1. Spades take up leaves
2. No better than spoons,
3. And bags full of leaves
4. Are light as balloons.

5. I make a great noise
6. Of rustling all day
7. Like rabbit and deer
8. Running away.

9. But the mountains I raise
10. Elude my embrace,
11. Flowing over my arms
12. And into my face.

13. I may load and unload
14. Again and again
15. Till I fill the whole shed,
16. And what have I then?

17. Next to nothing for weight,
18. And since they grew duller
19. From contact with earth,
20. Next to nothing for color.

21. Next to nothing for use.
22. But a crop is a crop,
23. And who's to say where
24. The harvest shall stop?
