1. Thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,
2. And the daft sun-assaulter, he
3. That frighted thee so oft, is fled or dead:
4. Save only me
5. (Nor is it sad to thee!)
6. Save only me
7. There is none left to mourn thee in the fields.
8. The gray grass is not dappled with the snow;
9. Its two banks have not shut upon the river;
10. But it is long ago-
11. It seems forever-
12. Since first I saw thee glance,
13. With all the dazzling other ones,
14. In airy dalliance,
15. Precipitate in love,
16. Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,
17. Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance.
18. When that was, the soft mist
19. Of my regret hung not on all the land,
20. And I was glad for thee,
21. And glad for me, I wist.
22. Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,
23. That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,
24. With those great careless wings,
25. Nor yet did I.
26. And there were other things:
27. It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp:
28. Then fearful he had let thee win
29. Too far beyond him to be gathered in,
30. Snatched thee, o'er eager, with ungentle grasp.
31. Ah! I remember me
32. How once conspiracy was rife
33. Against my life-
34. The languor of it and the dreaming fond;
35. Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,
36. The breeze three odors brought,
37. And a gem-flower waved in a wand!
38. Then when I was distraught
39. And could not speak,
40. Sidelong, full on my cheek,
41. What should that reckless zephyr fling
42. But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!
43. I found that wing broken to-day!
44. For thou are dead, I said,
45. And the strange birds say.
46. I found it with the withered leaves
47. Under the eaves.
