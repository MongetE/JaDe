1. A neighbor of mine in the village
2. Likes to tell how one spring
3. When she was a girl on the farm, she did
4. A childlike thing.

5. One day she asked her father
6. To give her a garden plot
7. To plant and tend and reap herself,
8. And he said, 'Why not?'

9. In casting about for a corner
10. He thought of an idle bit
11. Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,
12. And he said, 'Just it.'

13. And he said, 'That ought to make you
14. An ideal one-girl farm,
15. And give you a chance to put some strength
16. On your slim-jim arm.'

17. It was not enough of a garden
18. Her father said, to plow;
19. So she had to work it all by hand,
20. But she don't mind now.

21. She wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow
22. Along a stretch of road;
23. But she always ran away and left
24. Her not-nice load,

25. And hid from anyone passing.
26. And then she begged the seed.
27. She says she thinks she planted one
28. Of all things but weed.

29. A hill each of potatoes,
30. Radishes, lettuce, peas,
31. Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn,
32. And even fruit trees.

33. And yes, she has long mistrusted
34. That a cider-apple
35. In bearing there today is hers,
36. Or at least may be.

37. Her crop was a miscellany
38. When all was said and done,
39. A little bit of everything,
40. A great deal of none.

41. Now when she sees in the village
42. How village things go,
43. Just when it seems to come in right,
44. She says, 'I know!

45. 'It's as when I was a farmer...'
46. Oh never by way of advice!
47. And she never sins by telling the tale
48. To the same person twice.
