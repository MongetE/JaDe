1. Now close the windows and hush all the fields:
2. If the trees must, let them silently toss;
3. No bird is singing now, and if there is,
4. Be it my loss.

5. It will be long ere the marshes resume,
6. I will be long ere the earliest bird:
7. So close the windows and not hear the wind,
8. But see all wind-stirred.
