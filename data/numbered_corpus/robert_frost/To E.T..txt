1. I slumbered with your poems on my breast
2. Spread open as I dropped them half-read through
3. Like dove wings on a figure on a tomb
4. To see, if in a dream they brought of you,

5. I might not have the chance I missed in life
6. Through some delay, and call you to your face
7. First soldier, and then poet, and then both,
8. Who died a soldier-poet of your race.

9. I meant, you meant, that nothing should remain
10. Unsaid between us, brother, and this remained--
11. And one thing more that was not then to say:
12. The Victory for what it lost and gained.

13. You went to meet the shell's embrace of fire
14. On Vimy Ridge; and when you fell that day
15. The war seemed over more for you than me,
16. But now for me than you--the other way.

17. How over, though, for even me who knew
18. The foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine,
19. If I was not to speak of it to you
20. And see you pleased once more with words of mine?
