1. I stay;
2. But it isn't as if
3. There wasn't always Hudson's Bay
4. And the fur trade,
5. A small skiff
6. And a paddle blade.

7. I can just see my tent pegged,
8. And me on the floor,
9. Cross-legged,
10. And a trapper looking in at the door
11. With furs to sell.

12. His name's Joe,
13. Alias John,
14. And between what he doesn't know
15. And won't tell
16. About where Henry Hudson's gone,
17. I can't say he's much help;
18. But we get on.

19. The seal yelp
20. On an ice cake.
21. It's not men by some mistake?
22. No,
23. There's not a soul
24. For a windbreak
25. Between me and the North Pole—

26. Except always John-Joe,
27. My French Indian Esquimaux,
28. And he's off setting traps
29. In one himself perhaps.

30. Give a headshake
31. Over so much bay
32. Thrown away
33. In snow and mist
34. That doesn't exist,

35. I was going to say,
36. For God, man, or beast's sake,
37. Yet does perhaps for all three.

38. Don't ask Joe
39. What it is to him.
40. It's sometimes dim
41. What it is to me,
42. Unless it be
43. It's the old captain's dark fate
44. Who failed to find or force a strait
45. In its two-thousand-mile coast;
46. And his crew left him where be failed,
47. And nothing came of all be sailed.

48. It's to say, 'You and I—'
49. To such a ghost—
50. You and I
51. Off here
52. With the dead race of the Great Auk!'
53. And, 'Better defeat almost,
54. If seen clear,
55. Than life's victories of doubt
56. That need endless talk-talk
57. To make them out.'
