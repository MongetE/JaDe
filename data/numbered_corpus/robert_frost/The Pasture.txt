1. I'm going out to clean the pasture spring;
2. I'll only stop to rake the leaves away
3. (And wait to watch the water clear, I may):
4. I shan't be gone long. -- You come too.
5. I'm going out to fetch the little calf
6. That's standing by the mother. It's so young,
7. It totters when she licks it with her tongue.
8. I shan't be gone long. -- You come too.
