1. The west was getting out of gold,
2. The breath of air had died of cold,
3. When shoeing home across the white,
4. I thought I saw a bird alight.

5. In summer when I passed the place
6. I had to stop and lift my face;
7. A bird with an angelic gift
8. Was singing in it sweet and swift.

9. No bird was singing in it now.
10. A single leaf was on a bough,
11. And that was all there was to see
12. In going twice around the tree.

13. From my advantage on a hill
14. I judged that such a crystal chill
15. Was only adding frost to snow
16. As gilt to gold that wouldn't show.

17. A brush had left a crooked stroke
18. Of what was either cloud or smoke
19. From north to south across the blue;
20. A piercing little star was through.
