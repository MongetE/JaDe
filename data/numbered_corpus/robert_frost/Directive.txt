1. Back out of all this now too much for us,
2. Back in a time made simple by the loss
3. Of detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off
4. Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,
5. There is a house that is no more a house
6. Upon a farm that is no more a farm
7. And in a town that is no more a town.
8. The road there, if you'll let a guide direct you
9. Who only has at heart your getting lost,
10. May seem as if it should have been a quarry -
11. Great monolithic knees the former town
12. Long since gave up pretense of keeping covered.
13. And there's a story in a book about it:
14. Besides the wear of iron wagon wheels
15. The ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,
16. The chisel work of an enormous Glacier
17. That braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.
18. You must not mind a certain coolness from him
19. Still said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.
20. Nor need you mind the serial ordeal
21. Of being watched from forty cellar holes
22. As if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.
23. As for the woods' excitement over you
24. That sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,
25. Charge that to upstart inexperience.
26. Where were they all not twenty years ago?
27. They think too much of having shaded out
28. A few old pecker-fretted apple trees.
29. Make yourself up a cheering song of how
30. Someone's road home from work this once was,
31. Who may be just ahead of you on foot
32. Or creaking with a buggy load of grain.
33. The height of the adventure is the height
34. Of country where two village cultures faded
35. Into each other. Both of them are lost.
36. And if you're lost enough to find yourself
37. By now, pull in your ladder road behind you
38. And put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.
39. Then make yourself at home. The only field
40. Now left's no bigger than a harness gall.
41. First there's the children's house of make-believe,
42. Some shattered dishes underneath a pine,
43. The playthings in the playhouse of the children.
44. Weep for what little things could make them glad.
45. Then for the house that is no more a house,
46. But only a belilaced cellar hole,
47. Now slowly closing like a dent in dough.
48. This was no playhouse but a house in earnest.
49. Your destination and your destiny's
50. A brook that was the water of the house,
51. Cold as a spring as yet so near its source,
52. Too lofty and original to rage.
53. (We know the valley streams that when aroused
54. Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)
55. I have kept hidden in the instep arch
56. Of an old cedar at the waterside
57. A broken drinking goblet like the Grail
58. Under a spell so the wrong ones can't find it,
59. So can't get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn't.
60. (I stole the goblet from the children's playhouse.)
61. Here are your waters and your watering place.
62. Drink and be whole again beyond confusion.
