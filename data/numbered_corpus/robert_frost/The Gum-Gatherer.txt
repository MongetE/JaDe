1. There overtook me and drew me in
2. To his down-hill, early-morning stride,
3. And set me five miles on my road
4. Better than if he had had me ride,
5. A man with a swinging bag for'load
6. And half the bag wound round his hand.
7. We talked like barking above the din
8. Of water we walked along beside.
9. And for my telling him where I'd been
10. And where I lived in mountain land
11. To be coming home the way I was,
12. He told me a little about himself.
13. He came from higher up in the pass
14. Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks
15. Is blocks split off the mountain mass --
16. And hop. eless grist enough it looks
17. Ever to grind to soil for grass.
18. (The way it is will do for moss.)
19. There he had built his stolen shack.
20. It had to be a stolen shack
21. Because of the fears of fire and logs
22. That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:
23. Visions of half the world burned black
24. And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.
25. We know who when they come to town
26. Bring berries under the wagon seat,
27. Or a basket of eggs between their feet;
28. What this man brought in a cotton sack
29. Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce.
30. He showed me lumps of the scented stuff
31. Like uncut jewels, dull and rough
32. It comes to market golden brown;
33. But turns to pink between the teeth.
34. I told him this is a pleasant life
35. To set your breast to the bark of trees
36. That all your days are dim beneath,
37. And reaching up with a little knife,
38. To loose the resin and take it down
39. And bring it to market when you please
