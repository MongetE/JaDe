1. Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day,
2. I paused and said, "I will turn back from here.
3. No, I will go on farther -- and we shall see."
4. The hard snow held me, save where now and then
5. One foot went through. The view was all in lines
6. Straight up and down of tall slim trees
7. Too much alike to mark or name a place by
8. So as to say for certain I was here
9. Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.
10. A small bird flew before me. He was careful
11. To put a tree between us when he lighted,
12. And say no word to tell me who he was
13. Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.
14. He thought that I was after him for a feather --
15. The white one in his tail; like one who takes
16. Everything said as personal to himself.
17. One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.
18. And then there was a pile of wood for which
19. I forgot him and let his little fear
20. Carry him off the way I might have gone,
21. Without so much as wishing him good-night.
22. He went behind it to make his last stand.
23. It was a cord of maple, cut and split
24. And piled -- and measured, four by four by eight.
25. And not another like it could I see.
26. No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.
27. And it was older sure than this year's cutting,
28. Or even last year's or the year's before.
29. The wood was gray and the bark warping off it
30. And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis
31. Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.
32. What held it though on one side was a tree
33. Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,
34. These latter about to fall. I thought that only
35. Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
36. Could so forget his handiwork on which
37. He spent himself, the labor of his ax,
38. And leave it there far from a useful fireplace
39. To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
40. With the slow smokeless burning of decay.
