1. I had withdrawn in forest, and my song
2. Was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
3. And to the forest edge you came one day
4. (This was my dream) and looked and pondered long,
5. But did not enter, though the wish was strong:
6. You shook your pensive head as who should say,
7. ‘I dare not—too far in his footsteps stray—
8. He must seek me would he undo the wrong.

9. Not far, but near, I stood and saw it all
10. Behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
11. And the sweet pang it cost me not to call
12. And tell you that I saw does still abide.
13. But ’tis not true that thus I dwelt aloof,
14. For the wood wakes, and you are here for proof.
