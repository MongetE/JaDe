1. It was long I lay
2. Awake that night
3. Wishing that night
4. Would name the hour
5. And tell me whether
6. To call it day
7. (Though not yet light)
8. And give up sleep.
9. The snow fell deep
10. With the hiss of spray;
11. Two winds would meet,
12. One down one street,
13. One down another,
14. And fight in a smother
15. Of dust and feather.
16. I could not say,
17. But feared the cold
18. Had checked the pace
19. Of the tower clock
20. By tying together
21. Its hands of gold
22. Before its face.

23. Then cane one knock!
24. A note unruffled
25. Of earthly weather,
26. Though strange and muffled.
27. The tower said, 'One!'
28. And then a steeple.
29. They spoke to themselves
30. And such few people
31. As winds might rouse
32. From sleeping warm
33. (But not unhouse).
34. They left the storm
35. That struck en masse
36. My window glass
37. Like a beaded fur.
38. In that grave One
39. They spoke of the sun
40. And moon and stars,
41. Saturn and Mars
42. And Jupiter.
43. Still more unfettered,
44. They left the named
45. And spoke of the lettered,
46. The sigmas and taus
47. Of constellations.
48. They filled their throats
49. With the furthest bodies
50. To which man sends his
51. Speculation,
52. Beyond which God is;
53. The cosmic motes
54. Of yawning lenses.
55. Their solemn peals
56. Were not their own:
57. They spoke for the clock
58. With whose vast wheels
59. Theirs interlock.
60. In that grave word
61. Uttered alone
62. The utmost star
63. Trembled and stirred,
64. Though set so far
65. Its whirling frenzies
66. Appear like standing
67. in one self station.
68. It has not ranged,
69. And save for the wonder
70. Of once expanding
71. To be a nova,
72. It has not changed
73. To the eye of man
74. On planets over
75. Around and under
76. It in creation
77. Since man began
78. To drag down man
79. And nation nation.
