1. I met a lady from the South who said
2. (You won't believe she said it, but she said it):
3. 'None of my family ever worked, or had
4. A thing to sell.' I don't suppose the work
5. Much matters. You may work for all of me.
6. I've seen the time I've had to work myself.
7. The having anything to sell is what
8. Is the disgrace in man or state or nation.

9. I met a traveler from Arkansas
10. Who boasted of his state as beautiful
11. For diamonds and apples. 'Diamonds
12. And apples in commercial quantities?'
13. I asked him, on my guard. 'Oh, yes,' he answered,
14. Off his. The time was evening in the Pullman.
15. I see the porter's made your bed,' I told him.

16. I met a Californian who would
17. Talk California—a state so blessed,
18. He said, in climate, none bad ever died there
19. A natural death, and Vigilance Committees
20. Had had to organize to stock the graveyards
21. And vindicate the state's humanity.
22. 'Just the way Stefansson runs on,' I murmured,
23. 'About the British Arctic. That's what comes
24. Of being in the market with a climate.'

25. I met a poet from another state,
26. A zealot full of fluid inspiration,
27. Who in the name of fluid inspiration,
28. But in the best style of bad salesmanship,
29. Angrily tried to male me write a protest
30. (In verse I think) against the Volstead Act.
31. He didn't even offer me a drink
32. Until I asked for one to steady him.
33. This is called having an idea to sell.

34. It never could have happened in New Hampshire.

35. The only person really soiled with trade
36. I ever stumbled on in old New Hampshire
37. Was someone who had just come back ashamed
38. From selling things in California.
39. He'd built a noble mansard roof with balls
40. On turrets, like Constantinople, deep
41. In woods some ten miles from a railroad station,
42. As if to put forever out of mind
43. The hope of being, as we say, received.
44. I found him standing at the close of day
45. Inside the threshold of his open barn,
46. Like a lone actor on a gloomy stage—
47. And recognized him, through the iron gray
48. In which his face was muffled to the eyes,
49. As an old boyhood friend, and once indeed
50. A drover with me on the road to Brighton.
51. His farm was 'grounds,' and not a farm at all;
52. His house among the local sheds and shanties
53. Rose like a factor's at a trading station.
54. And be was rich, and I was still a rascal.
55. I couldn't keep from asking impolitely,
56. Where bad he been and what had he been doing?
57. How did he get so? (Rich was understood.)
58. In dealing in 'old rags' in San Francisco.
59. Ob, it was terrible as well could be.
60. We both of us turned over in our graves.

61. Just specimens is all New Hampshire has,
62. One each of everything as in a showcase,
63. Which naturally she doesn't care to sell.

64. She had one President. (Pronounce him Purse,
65. And make the most of it for better or worse.
66. He's your one chance to score against the state.)
67. She had one Daniel Webster. He was all
68. The Daniel Webster ever was or shall be.
69. She had the Dartmouth' needed to produce him.

70. I call her old. She has one family
71. Whose claim is good to being settled here
72. Before the era of colonization,
73. And before that of exploration even.
74. John Smith remarked them as be coasted by,
75. Dangling their legs and fishing off a wharf
76. At the Isles of Shoals, and satisfied himself
77. They weren't Red Indians but veritable
78. Pre-primitives of the white race, dawn people,
79. Like those who furnished Adam's sons with wives;
80. However uninnocent they may have been
81. In being there so early in our history.
82. They'd been there then a hundred years or more.
83. Pity he didn't ask what they were up to
84. At that date with a wharf already built,
85. And take their name. They've since told me their name—
86. Today an honored one in Nottingham.
87. As for what they were up to more than fishing—
88. Suppose they weren't behaving Puritanly,
89. The hour bad not yet struck for being good,
90. Mankind had not yet gone on the Sabbatical.
91. It became an explorer of the deep
92. Not to explore too deep in others' business.

93. Did you but know of him, New Hampshire has
94. One real reformer who would change the world
95. So it would be accepted by two classes,
96. Artists the minute they set up as artists,
97. Before, that is, they are themselves accepted,
98. And boys the minute they get out of college.
99. I can't help thinking those are tests to go by.

100. And she has one I don't know what to call him,
101. Who comes from Philadelphia every year
102. With a great flock of chickens of rare breeds
103. He wants to give the educational
104. Advantages of growing almost wild
105. Under the watchful eye of hawk and eagle
106. Dorkings because they're spoken of by Chaucer,
107. Sussex because they're spoken of by Herrick.

108. She has a touch of gold. New Hampshire gold—
109. You may have heard of it. I had a farm
110. Offered me not long since up Berlin way
111. With a mine on it that was worked for gold;
112. But not gold in commercial quantities,
113. Just enough gold to make the engagement rings
114. And marriage rings of those who owned the farm.
115. What gold more innocent could one have asked for?
116. One of my children ranging after rocks
117. Lately brought home from Andover or Canaan
118. A specimen of beryl with a trace
119. Of radium. I know with radium
120. The trace would have to be the merest trace
121. To be below the threshold of commercial;
122. But trust New Hampshire not to have enough
123. Of radium or anything to sell.

124. A specimen of everything, I said.
125. She has one witch—old style. She lives in Colebrook.
126. (The only other witch I ever met
127. Was lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston.
128. There were four candles and four people present.
129. The witch was young, and beautiful (new style),
130. And open-minded. She was free to question
131. Her gift for reading letters locked in boxes.
132. Why was it so much greater when the boxes
133. Were metal than it was when they were wooden?
134. It made the world seem so mysterious.
135. The S'ciety for Psychical Research
136. Was cognizant. Her husband was worth millions.
137. I think he owned some shares in Harvard College.)

138. New Hampshire used to have at Salem
139. A company we called the White Corpuscles,
140. Whose duty was at any hour of night
141. To rush in sheets and fool's caps where they smelled
142. A thing the least bit doubtfully perscented
143. And give someone the Skipper Ireson's Ride.

144. One each of everything as in a showcase.

145. More than enough land for a specimen
146. You'll say she has, but there there enters in
147. Something else to protect her from herself.
148. There quality makes up for quantity.
149. Not even New Hampshire farms are much for sale.
150. The farm I made my home on in the mountains
151. 1 had to take by force rather than buy.

152. I caught the owner outdoors by himself
153. Raking.up after winter, and I said,
154. "I'm going to put you off this farm: I want it.'
155. "Where are you going to put me? In the road?"
156. "I'm going to put you on the farm next to it."
157. "Why won't the farm next to it do for you?'
158. 'I like this better.' It was really better.

159. Apples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed,
160. With no suspicion in stern end or blossom end
161. Of vitriol or arsenate of lead,
162. And so not good for anything but cider.
163. Her unpruned grapes are flung like lariats
164. Far up the birches out of reach of man.

165. A state producing precious metals, stones,
166. And—writing; none of these except perhaps
167. The precious literature in quantity
168. Or quality to worry the producer
169. About disposing of it. Do you know,
170. Considering the market, there are more
171. Poems produced than any other thing?
172. No wonder poets sometimes have to seem
173. So much more businesslike than businessmen.
174. Their wares are so much harder to get rid of.

175. She's one of the two best states in the Union.
176. Vermont's the other. And the two have been
177. Yokefellows in the sap yoke from of old
178. In many Marches. And they lie like wedges,
179. Thick end to thin end and thin end to thick end,
180. And are a figure of the way the strong
181. Of mind and strong of arm should fit together,
182. One thick where one is thin and vice versa.


183. New Hampshire raises the Connecticut

184. In a trout hatchery near Canada,
185. But soon divides the river with Vermont.
186. Both are delightful states for their absurdly
187. Small towns—Lost Nation, Bungey, Muddy Boo,
188. Poplin, Still Corners (so called not because
189. The place is silent all day long, nor yet
190. Because it boasts a whisky still—because
191. It set out once to be a city and still
192. Is only corners, crossroads in a wood).
193. And I remember one whose name appeared
194. Between the pictures on a movie screen
195. Election night once in Franconia,
196. When everything had gone Republican
197. And Democrats were sore in need of comfort:
198. Easton goes Democratic, Wilson 4
199. Hughes 2. And everybody to the saddest
200. Laughed the loud laugh the big laugh at the little.
201. New York (five million) laughs at Manchester,
202. Manchester (sixty or seventy thousand) laughs
203. At Littleton (four thousand), Littleton
204. Laughs at Franconia (seven hundred), and
205. Franconia laughs, I fear—-did laugh that night­-
206. At Easton. What has Easton left to laugh at,
207. And like the actress exclaim 'Oh, my God' at?
208. There's Bungey; and for Bungey there are towns,
209. Whole townships named but without population.

210. Anything I can say about New Hampshire
211. Will serve almost as well about Vermont,
212. Excepting that they differ in their mountains.
213. The Vermont mountains stretch extended straight;
214. New Hampshire mountains Curl up in a coil.

215. I had been coming to New Hampshire mountains.
216. And here I am and what am I to say?
217. Here first my theme becomes embarrassing.
218. Emerson said, 'The God who made New Hampshire
219. Taunted the lofty land with little men.'
220. Anotner Massachusetts poet said,
221. 'I go no more to summer in New Hampshire.
222. I've given up my summer place in Dublin.'
223. But when I asked to know what ailed New Hampshire,
224. She said she couldn't stand the people in it,
225. The little men (it's Massachusetts speaking).
226. And when I asked to know what ailed the people,
227. She said, 'Go read your own books and find out.'
228. I may as well confess myself the author
229. Of several books against the world in general.
230. To take them as against a special state
231. Or even nation's to restrict my meaning.
232. I'm what is called a sensibilitist,
233. Or otherwise an environmentalist.
234. I refuse to adapt myself a mite
235. To any change from hot to cold, from wet
236. To dry, from poor to rich, or back again.
237. I make a virtue of my suffering
238. From nearly everything that goes on round me.
239. In other words, I know wherever I am,
240. Being the creature of literature I am,
241. 1 sball not lack for pain to keep me awake.
242. Kit Marlowe taught me how to say my prayers:
243. 'Why, this is Hell, nor am I out of it.'
244. Samoa, Russia, Ireland I complain of,
245. No less than England, France, and Italy.
246. Because I wrote my novels in New Hampshire
247. Is no proof that I aimed them at New Hampshire.
248. When I left Massachusetts years ago
249. Between two days, the reason why I sought
250. New Hampshire, not Connecticut,
251. Rhode Island, New York, or Vermont was this:
252. Where I was living then, New Hampshire offered
253. The nearest boundary to escape across.
254. I hadn't an illusion in my handbag
255. About the people being better there
256. Than those I left behind. I thought they weren't.
257. I thought they couldn't be. And yet they were.
258. I'd sure had no such friends in Massachusetts
259. As Hall of Windham, Gay of Atkinson,
260. Bartlett of Raymond (now of Colorado),
261. Harris of Derry, and Lynch of Bethlehem.

262. The glorious bards of Massachusetts seem
263. To want to make New Hampshire people over.
264. They taunt the lofty land with little men.
265. I don't know what to say about the people.
266. For art's sake one could almost wish them worse
267. Rather than better. How are we to write
268. The Russian novel in America
269. As long as life goes so unterribly?
270. There is the pinch from which our only outcry
271. In literature to date is heard to come.
272. We get what little misery we can
273. Out of not having cause for misery.
274. It makes the guild of novel writers sick
275. To be expected to be Dostoievskis
276. On nothing worse than too much luck and comfort.
277. This is not sorrow, though; it's just the vapors,
278. And recognized as such in Russia itself
279. Under the new regime, and so forbidden.

280. If well it is with Russia, then feel free
281. To say so or be stood against the wall
282. And shot. It's Pollyanna now or death.
283. This, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of;
284. And very sensible. No state can build
285. A literature that shall at once be sound
286. And sad on a foundation of well-being.

287. To show the level of intelligence
288. Among us: it was just a Warren farmer
289. Whose horse had pulled him short up in the road
290. By me, a stranger. This is what he said,
291. From nothing but embarrassment and want
292. Of anything more sociable to say:
293. 'You hear those bound dogs sing on Moosilauke?
294. Well, they remind me of the hue and cry
295. We've heard against the Mid - Victorians
296. And never rightly understood till Bryan
297. Retired from politics and joined the chorus.
298. The matter with the Mid-Victorians
299. Seems to have been a man named Joh n L. Darwin.'
300. 'Go 'long,' I said to him, he to his horse.

301. I knew a man who failing as a farmer
302. Burned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance,
303. And spent the proceeds on a telescope
304. To satisfy a lifelong curiosity
305. About our place among the infinities.
306. And how was that for otherworldliness?

307. If I must choose which I would elevate —
308. The people or the already lofty mountains
309. I'd elevate the already lofty mountains
310. The only fault I find with old New Hampshire
311. Is that her mountains aren't quite high enough.
312. I was not always so; I've come to be so.
313. How, to my sorrow, how have I attained
314. A height from which to look down critical
315. On mountains? What has given me assurance
316. To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains,
317. Or any mountains? Can it be some strength
318. I feel, as of an earthquake in my back,
319. To heave them higher to the morning star?
320. Can it be foreign travel in the Alps?
321. Or having seen and credited a moment
322. The solid molding of vast peaks of cloud
323. Behind the pitiful reality
324. Of Lincoln, Lafayette, and Liberty?
325. Or some such sense as says bow high shall jet
326. The fountain in proportion to the basin?
327. No, none of these has raised me to my throne
328. Of intellectual dissatisfaction,
329. But the sad accident of having seen
330. Our actual mountains given in a map
331. Of early times as twice the height they are—
332. Ten thousand feet instead of only five—
333. Which shows how sad an accident may be.
334. Five thousand is no longer high enough.
335. Whereas I never had a good idea
336. About improving people in the world,
337. Here I am overfertile in suggestion,
338. And cannot rest from planning day or night
339. How high I'd thrust the peaks in summer snow
340. To tap the upper sky and draw a flow
341. Of frosty night air on the vale below
342. Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry.

343. The more the sensibilitist I am
344. The more I seem to want my mountains wild;
345. The way the wiry gang-boss liked the logjam.
346. After he'd picked the lock and got it started,
347. He dodged a log that lifted like an arm
348. Against the sky to break his back for him,
349. Then came in dancing, skipping with his life
350. Across the roar and chaos, and the words
351. We saw him say along the zigzag journey
352. Were doubtless as the words we heard him say
353. On coming nearer: 'Wasn't she an i-deal
354. Son-of-a-bitch? You bet she was an i-deal.'

355. For all her mountains fall a little short,
356. Her people not quite short enough for Art,
357. She's still New Hampshire; a most restful state.

358. Lately in converse with a New York alec
359. About the new school of the pseudo-phallic,
360. I found myself in a close corner where
361. I bad to make an almost funny choice.
362. 'Choose you which you will be—a prude, or puke,
363. Mewling and puking in the public arms.'
364. 'Me for the hills where I don't have to choose."
365. 'But if you bad to choose, which would you be?'
366. 1 wouldn't be a prude afraid of nature.
367. I know a man who took a double ax
368. And went alone against a grove of trees;
369. But his heart failing him, he dropped the ax
370. And ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold:
371. ''Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood':
372. There s been enough shed without shedding mine.
373. Remember Birnam Wood! The wood's in flux!'

374. He had a special terror of the flux
375. That showed itself in dendrophobia.
376. The only decent tree had been to mill
377. And educated into boards, be said.
378. He knew too well for any earthly use
379. The line where man leaves off and nature starts.
380. And never overstepped it save in dreams.
381. He stood on the safe side of the line talking—
382. Which is sheer Matthew Arnoldism,
383. The cult of one who owned himself 'a foiled
384. Circuitous wanderer,' and 'took dejectedly
385. His seat upon the intellectual throne'—
386. Agreed in 'frowning on these improvised
387. Altars the woods are full of nowadays,
388. Again as in the days when Ahaz sinned
389. By worship under green trees in the open.
390. Scarcely a mile but that I come on one,
391. A black-checked stone and stick of rain-washed charcoal.
392. Even to say the groves were God's first temples
393. Comes too near to Ahaz' sin for safety.
394. Nothing not built with hands of course is sacred.
395. But here is not a question of what's sacred;
396. Rather of what to face or run away from.
397. I'd hate to be a runaway from nature.
398. And neither would I choose to be a puke
399. Who cares not what be does in company,
400. And when he can't do anything, falls back
401. On words, and tries his worst to make words speak
402. Louder than actions, and sometimes achieves it.
403. It seems a narrow choice the age insists on
404. 8ow about being a good Greek, for instance)
405. That course, they tell me, isn't offered this year.
406. 'Come, but this isn't choosing—puke or prude?'

407. Well, if I have to choose one or the other,
408. I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer
409. With an income in cash of, say, a thousand
410. (From, say, a publisher in New York City).
411. It's restful to arrive at a decision,
412. And restful just to think about New Hampshire.
413. At present I am living in Vermont.
