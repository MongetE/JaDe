1. When the wind works against us in the dark,
2. And pelts with snow
3. The lowest chamber window on the east,
4. And whispers with a sort of stifled bark,
5. The beast,
6. 'Come out! Come out!'-
7. It costs no inward struggle not to go,
8. Ah, no!
9. I count our strength,
10. Two and a child,
11. Those of us not asleep subdued to mark
12. How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,-
13. How drifts are piled,
14. Dooryard and road ungraded,
15. Till even the comforting barn grows far away
16. And my heart owns a doubt
17. Whether 'tis in us to arise with day
18. And save ourselves unaided.
