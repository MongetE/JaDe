1. It was far in the sameness of the wood;
2. I was running with joy on the Demon’s trail,
3. Though I knew what I hunted was no true god.
4. It was just as the light was beginning to fail
5. That I suddenly heard—all I needed to hear:
6. It has lasted me many and many a year.

7. The sound was behind me instead of before,
8. A sleepy sound, but mocking half,
9. As of one who utterly couldn’t care.
10. The Demon arose from his wallow to laugh,
11. Brushing the dirt from his eye as he went;
12. And well I knew what the Demon meant.

13. I shall not forget how his laugh rang out.
14. I felt as a fool to have been so caught,
15. And checked my steps to make pretence
16. It was something among the leaves I sought
17. (Though doubtful whether he stayed to see).
18. Thereafter I sat me against a tree.
