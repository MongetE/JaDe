1. The same leaves over and over again!
2. They fall from giving shade above
3. To make one texture of faded brown
4. And fit the earth like a leather glove.

5. Before the leaves can mount again
6. To fill the trees with another shade,
7. They must go down past things coming up.
8. They must go down into the dark decayed.

9. They must be pierced by flowers and put
10. Beneath the feet of dancing flowers.
11. However it is in some other world
12. I know that this is way in ours.
