1. My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
2. Toward heaven still.
3. And there's a barrel that I didn't fill
4. Beside it, and there may be two or three
5. Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.
6. But I am done with apple-picking now.
7. Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
8. The scent of apples; I am drowsing off.
9. I cannot shake the shimmer from my sight
10. I got from looking through a pane of glass
11. I skimmed this morning from the water-trough,
12. And held against the world of hoary grass.
13. It melted, and I let it fall and break.
14. But I was well
15. Upon my way to sleep before it fell,
16. And I could tell
17. What form my dreaming was about to take.
18. Magnified apples appear and reappear,
19. Stem end and blossom end,
20. And every fleck of russet showing clear.
21. My instep arch not only keeps the ache,
22. It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
23. And I keep hearing from the cellar-bin
24. That rumbling sound
25. Of load on load of apples coming in.
26. For I have had too much
27. Of apple-picking; I am overtired
28. Of the great harvest I myself desired.
29. There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
30. Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall,
31. For all
32. That struck the earth,
33. No matter if not bruised, or spiked with stubble,
34. Went surely to the cider-apple heap
35. As of no worth.
36. One can see what will trouble
37. This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.
38. Were he not gone,
39. The woodchuck could say whether it's like his
40. Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,
41. Or just some human sleep.
