1. I found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
2. On a white heal-all, holding up a moth
3. Like a white piece of rigid satin cloth --
4. Assorted characters of death and blight
5. Mixed ready to begin the morning right,
6. Like the ingredients of a witches' broth --
7. A snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,
8. And dead wings carried like a paper kite.

9. What had that flower to do with being white,
10. The wayside blue and innocent heal-all?
11. What brought the kindred spider to that height,
12. Then steered the white moth thither in the night?
13. What but design of darkness to appall?--
14. If design govern in a thing so small.
