1. There sandy seems the golden sky
2. And golden seems the sandy plain.
3. No habitation meets the eye
4. Unless in the horizon rim,
5. Some halfway up the limestone wall,
6. That spot of black is not a stain
7. Or shadow, but a cavern hole,
8. Where someone used to climb and crawl
9. To rest from his besetting fears.
10. I see the callus on his soul
11. The disappearing last of him
12. And of his race starvation slim,
13. Oh years ago - ten thousand years.
