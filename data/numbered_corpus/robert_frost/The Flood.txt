1. Blood has been harder to dam back than water.
2. Just when we think we have it impounded safe
3. Behind new barrier walls (and let it chafe!),
4. It breaks away in some new kind of slaughter.
5. We choose to say it is let loose by the devil;
6. But power of blood itself releases blood.
7. It goes by might of being such a flood
8. Held high at so unnatural a level.
9. It will have outlet, brave and not so brave.
10. weapons of war and implements of peace
11. Are but the points at which it finds release.
12. And now it is once more the tidal wave
13. That when it has swept by leaves summits stained.
14. Oh, blood will out. It cannot be contained.
