1. As I came to the edge of the woods,
2. Thrush music -- hark!
3. Now if it was dusk outside,
4. Inside it was dark.

5. Too dark in the woods for a bird
6. By sleight of wing
7. To better its perch for the night,
8. Though it still could sing.

9. The last of the light of the sun
10. That had died in the west
11. Still lived for one song more
12. In a thrush's breast.

13. Far in the pillared dark
14. Thrush music went --
15. Almost like a call to come in
16. To the dark and lament.

17. But no, I was out for stars;
18. I would not come in.
19. I meant not even if asked;
20. And I hadn't been.
