1. How countlessly they congregate
2. O'er our tumultuous snow,
3. Which flows in shapes as tall as trees
4. When wintry winds do blow!--

5. As if with keenness for our fate,
6. Our faltering few steps on
7. To white rest, and a place of rest
8. Invisible at dawn,--

9. And yet with neither love nor hate,
10. Those stars like some snow-white
11. Minerva's snow-white marble eyes
12. Without the gift of sight.
