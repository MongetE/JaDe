1. I dwell in a lonely house I know
2. That vanished many a summer ago,
3. And left no trace but the cellar walls,
4. And a cellar in which the daylight falls,
5. And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.

6. O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield
7. The woods come back to the mowing field;
8. The orchard tree has grown one copse
9. Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;
10. The footpath down to the well is healed.

11. I dwell with a strangely aching heart
12. In that vanished abode there far apart
13. On that disused and forgotten road
14. That has no dust-bath now for the toad.
15. Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;

16. The whippoorwill is coming to shout
17. And hush and cluck and flutter about:
18. I hear him begin far enough away
19. Full many a time to say his say
20. Before he arrives to say it out.

21. It is under the small, dim, summer star.
22. I know not who these mute folk are
23. Who share the unlit place with me--
24. Those stones out under the low-limbed tree
25. Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.

26. They are tireless folk, but slow and sad,
27. Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,--
28. With none among them that ever sings,
29. And yet, in view of how many things,
30. As sweet companions as might be had.
