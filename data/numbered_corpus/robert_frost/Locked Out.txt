1. As told to a child


2. When we locked up the house at night,
3. We always locked the flowers outside
4. And cut them off from window light.
5. The time I dreamed the door was tried
6. And brushed with buttons upon sleeves,
7. The flowers were out there with the thieves.
8. Yet nobody molested them!
9. We did find one nasturtium
10. Upon the steps with bitten stem.
11. I may have been to blame for that:
12. I always thought it must have been
13. Some Hower I played with as I sat
14. At dusk to watch the moon down early.
