1. NOW that they've got it settled whose I be,
2. I'm going to tell them something they won't like:
3. They've got it settled wrong, and I can prove it.
4. Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting
5. To make a present of me to each other.
6. They don't dispose me, either one of them,
7. To spare them any trouble. Double trouble's
8. Always the witch's motto anyway.
9. I'll double theirs for both of them- you watch me.
10. They'll find they've got the whole thing to do over,
11. That is, if facts is what they want to go by.
12. They set a lot (now don't they?) by a record
13. Of Arthur Amy's having once been up
14. For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren.
15. I could have told them any time this twelvemonth
16. The Arthur Amy I was married to
17. Couldn't have been the one they say was up
18. In Warren at March Meeting for the reason
19. He wa'n't but fifteen at the time they say.
20. The Arthur Amy I was married to
21. voted the only times he ever voted,
22. Which wasn't many, in the town of Wentworth.
23. One of the times was when 'twas in the warrant
24. To see if the town wanted to take over
25. The tote road to our clearing where we lived.
26. I'll tell you who'd remember- Heman Lapish.
27. Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine.
28. So now they've dragged it through the law courts once
29. I guess they'd better drag it through again.
30. Wentworth and Warren's both good towns to live in,
31. Only I happen to prefer to live
32. In Wentworth from now on; and when all's said,
33. Right's right, and the temptation to do right
34. When I can hurt someone by doing it
35. Has always been too much for me, it has.
36. I know of some folks that'd be set up
37. At having in their town a noted witch:
38. But most would have to think of the expense
39. That even I would be. They ought to know
40. That as a witch I'd often milk a bat
41. And that'd be enough to last for days.
42. It'd make my position stronger, I think,
43. If I was to consent to give some sign
44. To make it surer that I was a witch?
45. It wa'n't no sign, I s'pose, when Mallice Huse
46. Said that I took him out in his old age
47. And rode all over everything on him
48. Until I'd had him worn to skin and bones,
49. And if I'd left him hitched unblanketed
50. In front of one Town Hall, I'd left him hitched
51. In front of every one in Grafton County.
52. Some cried shame on me not to blanket him,
53. The poor old man. It would have been all right
54. If some one hadn't said to gnaw the posts
55. He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,
56. So they could recognize them. Not a post
57. That they could hear tell of was scarified.
58. They made him keep on gnawing till he whined.
59. Then that same smarty someone said to look-
60. He'd bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed
61. The crib he slept in- and as sure's you're born
62. They found he'd gnawed the four posts of his bed,
63. All four of them to splinters. What did that prove?
64. Not that he hadn't gnawed the hitching posts
65. He said he had besides. Because a horse
66. Gnaws in the stable ain't no proof to me
67. He don't gnaw trees and posts and fences too.
68. But everybody took it for proof.
69. I was a strapping girl of twenty then.
70. The smarty someone who spoiled everything
71. Was Arthur Amy. You know who he was.
72. That was the way he started courting me.
73. He never said much after we were married,
74. But I mistrusted he was none too proud
75. Of having interfered in the Huse business.
76. I guess he found he got more out of me
77. By having me a witch. Or something happened
78. To turn him round. He got to saying things
79. To undo what he'd done and make it right,
80. Like, 'No, she ain't come back from kiting yet.
81. Last night was one of her nights out. She's kiting.
82. She thinks when the wind makes a night of it
83. She might as well herself.' But he liked best
84. To let on he was plagued to death with me:
85. If anyone had seen me coming home
86. Over the ridgepole, 'stride of a broomstick,
87. As often as he had in the tail of the night,
88. He guessed they'd know what he had to put up with.
89. Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough
90. Off from the house as far as we could keep
91. And from barn smells you can't wash out of ploughed ground
92. With all the rain and snow of seven years;
93. And I don't mean just skulls of Roger's Rangers
94. On Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,
95. Only bewitched so I would last him longer.
96. Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,
97. I made him gather me wet snow berries
98. On slippery rocks beside a waterfall.
99. I made him do it for me in the dark.
100. And he liked everything I made him do.
101. I hope if he is where he sees me now
102. He's so far off he can't see what I've come to.
103. You _can_ come down from everything to nothing.
104. All is, if I'd a-known when I was young
105. And full of it, that this would be the end,
106. It doesn't seem as if I'd had the courage
107. To make so free and kick up in folks' faces.
108. I might have, but it doesn't seem as if.
