1. It is blue-butterfly day here in spring,
2. And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry
3. There is more unmixed color on the wing
4. Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry.

5. But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:
6. And now from having ridden out desire
7. They lie closed over in the wind and cling
8. Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.
