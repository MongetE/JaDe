1. We make ourselves a place apart
2. Behind light words that tease and flout,
3. But oh, the agitated heart
4. Till someone find us really out.

5. 'Tis pity if the case require
6. (Or so we say) that in the end
7. We speak the literal to inspire
8. The understanding of a friend.

9. But so with all, from babes that play
10. At hide-and-seek to God afar,
11. So all who hide too well away
12. Must speak and tell us where they are.
