1. For every parcel I stoop down to seize
2. I lose some other off my arms and knees,
3. And the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns --
4. Extremes too hard to comprehend at once,
5. Yet nothing I should care to leave behind.
6. With all I have to hold with hand and mind
7. And heart, if need be, I will do my best
8. To keep their building balanced at my breast.
9. I crouch down to prevent them as they fall;
10. Then sit down in the middle of them all.
11. I had to drop the armful in the road
12. And try to stack them in a better load.
