1. It was too lonely for her there,
2. And too wild,
3. And since there were but two of them,
4. And no child,

5. And work was little in the house,
6. She was free,
7. And followed where he furrowed field,
8. Or felled tree.

9. She rested on a log and tossed
10. The fresh chips,
11. With a song only to herself
12. On her lips.

13. And once she went to break a bough
14. Of black alder.
15. She strayed so far she scarcely heard
16. When he called her-

17. And didn't answer-didn't speak-
18. Or return.
19. She stood, and then she ran and hid
20. In the fern.

21. He never found her, though he looked
22. Everywhere,
23. And he asked at her mother's house
24. Was she there.

25. Sudden and swift and light as that
26. The ties gave,
27. And he learned of finalities
28. Besides the grave.
