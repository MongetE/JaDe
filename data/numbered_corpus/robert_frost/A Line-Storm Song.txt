1. The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,
2. The road is forlorn all day,
3. Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,
4. And the hoof-prints vanish away.
5. The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
6. Expend their bloom in vain.
7. Come over the hills and far with me,
8. And be my love in the rain.
9. The birds have less to say for themselves
10. In the wood-world’s torn despair
11. Than now these numberless years the elves,
12. Although they are no less there:
13. All song of the woods is crushed like some
14. Wild, easily shattered rose.
15. Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
16. Where the boughs rain when it blows.

17. There is the gale to urge behind
18. And bruit our singing down,
19. And the shallow waters aflutter with wind
20. From which to gather your gown.
21. What matter if we go clear to the west,
22. And come not through dry-shod?
23. For wilding brooch shall wet your breast
24. The rain-fresh goldenrod.

25. Oh, never this whelming east wind swells
26. But it seems like the sea’s return
27. To the ancient lands where it left the shells
28. Before the age of the fern;
29. And it seems like the time when after doubt
30. Our love came back amain.
31. Oh, come forth into the storm and rout
32. And be my love in the rain.
