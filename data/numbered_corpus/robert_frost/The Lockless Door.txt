1. It went many years,
2. But at last came a knock,
3. And I thought of the door
4. With no lock to lock.

5. I blew out the light,
6. I tip-toed the floor,
7. And raised both hands
8. In prayer to the door.

9. But the knock came again
10. My window was wide;
11. I climbed on the sill
12. And descended outside.

13. Back over the sill
14. I bade a "Come in"
15. To whoever the knock
16. At the door may have been.

17. So at a knock
18. I emptied my cage
19. To hide in the world
20. And alter with age.
