1. Lovers, forget your love,
2. And list to the love of these,
3. She a window flower,
4. And he a winter breeze.
5. When the frosty window veil
6. Was melted down at noon,
7. And the cag√®d yellow bird
8. Hung over her in tune,
9. He marked her through the pane,
10. He could not help but mark,
11. And only passed her by,
12. To come again at dark.
13. He was a winter wind,
14. Concerned with ice and snow,
15. Dead weeds and unmated birds,
16. And little of love could know.
17. But he sighed upon the sill,
18. He gave the sash a shake,
19. As witness all within
20. Who lay that night awake.
21. Perchance he half prevailed
22. To win her for the flight
23. From the firelit looking-glass
24. And warm stove-window light.
25. But the flower leaned aside
26. And thought of naught to say,
27. And morning found the breeze
28. A hundred miles away.
