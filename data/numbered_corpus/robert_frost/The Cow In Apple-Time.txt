1. Something inspires the only cow of late
2. To make no more of a wall than an open gate,
3. And think no more of wall-builders than fools.
4. Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
5. A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit,
6. She scorns a pasture withering to the root.
7. She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten.
8. The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.
9. She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.
10. She bellows on a knoll against the sky.
11. Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.
