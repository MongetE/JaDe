1. You'll wait a long, long time for anything much
2. To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud
3. And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves.
4. The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch,
5. Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud.
6. The planets seem to interfere in their curves -
7. But nothing ever happens, no harm is done.
8. We may as well go patiently on with our life,
9. And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun
10. For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane.
11. It is true the longest drout will end in rain,
12. The longest peace in China will end in strife.
13. Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake
14. In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break
15. On his particular time and personal sight.
16. That calm seems certainly safe to last to-night.
