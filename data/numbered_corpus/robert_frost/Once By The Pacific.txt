1. The shattered water made a misty din.
2. Great waves looked over others coming in,
3. And thought of doing something to the shore
4. That water never did to land before.
5. The clouds were low and hairy in the skies,
6. Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes.
7. You could not tell, and yet it looked as if
8. The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,
9. The cliff in being backed by continent;
10. It looked as if a night of dark intent
11. Was coming, and not only a night, an age.
12. Someone had better be prepared for rage.
13. There would be more than ocean-water broken
14. Before God's last Put out the light was spoken.
