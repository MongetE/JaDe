1. God made a beatous garden
2. With lovely flowers strown,
3. But one straight, narrow pathway
4. That was not overgrown.
5. And to this beauteous garden
6. He brought mankind to live,
7. And said: 'To you, my children,
8. These lovely flowers I give.
9. Prune ye my vines and fig trees,
10. With care my flowerets tend,
11. But keep the pathway open
12. Your home is at the end.'

13. Then came another master,
14. Who did not love mankind,
15. And planted on the pathway
16. Gold flowers for them to find.
17. And mankind saw the bright flowers,
18. That, glitt'ring in the sun,
19. Quite hid the thorns of av'rice
20. That poison blood and bone;
21. And far off many wandered,
22. And when life's night came on,
23. They still were seeking gold flowers,
24. Lost, helpless and alone.


25. O, cease to heed the glamour
26. That blinds your foolish eyes,
27. Look upward to the glitter
28. Of stars in God's clear skies.
29. Their ways are pure and harmless
30. And will not lead astray,
31. Bid aid your erring footsteps
32. To keep the narrow way.
33. And when the sun shines brightly
34. Tend flowers that God has given
35. And keep the pathway open
36. That leads you on to heaven.
