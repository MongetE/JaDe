1. From where I lingered in a lull in March
2. outside the sugar-house one night for choice,
3. I called the fireman with a careful voice
4. And bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch:
5. 'O fireman, give the fire another stoke,
6. And send more sparks up chimney with the smoke.'
7. I thought a few might tangle, as they did,
8. Among bare maple boughs, and in the rare
9. Hill atmosphere not cease to glow,
10. And so be added to the moon up there.
11. The moon, though slight, was moon enough to show
12. On every tree a bucket with a lid,
13. And on black ground a bear-skin rug of snow.
14. The sparks made no attempt to be the moon.
15. They were content to figure in the trees
16. As Leo, Orion, and the Pleiades.
17. And that was what the boughs were full of soon.
