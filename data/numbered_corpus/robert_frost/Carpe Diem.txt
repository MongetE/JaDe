1. Age saw two quiet children
2. Go loving by at twilight,
3. He knew not whether homeward,
4. Or outward from the village,
5. Or (chimes were ringing) churchward,
6. He waited, (they were strangers)
7. Till they were out of hearing
8. To bid them both be happy.
9. 'Be happy, happy, happy,
10. And seize the day of pleasure.'
11. The age-long theme is Age's.
12. 'Twas Age imposed on poems
13. Their gather-roses burden
14. To warn against the danger
15. That overtaken lovers
16. From being overflooded
17. With happiness should have it.
18. And yet not know they have it.
19. But bid life seize the present?
20. It lives less in the present
21. Than in the future always,
22. And less in both together
23. Than in the past. The present
24. Is too much for the senses,
25. Too crowding, too confusing-
26. Too present to imagine.
