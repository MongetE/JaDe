1. Brown lived at such a lofty farm
2. That everyone for miles could see
3. His lantern when he did his chores
4. In winter after half-past three.

5. And many must have seen him make
6. His wild descent from there one night,
7. 'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything,
8. Describing rings of lantern light.

9. Between the house and barn the gale
10. Got him by something he had on
11. And blew him out on the icy crust
12. That cased the world, and he was gone!

13. Walls were all buried, trees were few:
14. He saw no stay unless he stove
15. A hole in somewhere with his heel.
16. But though repeatedly he strove

17. And stamped and said things to himself,
18. And sometimes something seemed to yield,
19. He gained no foothold, but pursued
20. His journey down from field to field.

21. Sometimes he came with arms outspread
22. Like wings, revolving in the scene
23. Upon his longer axis, and
24. With no small dignity of mien.

25. Faster or slower as he chanced,
26. Sitting or standing as he chose,
27. According as he feared to risk
28. His neck, or thought to spare his clothes,

29. He never let the lantern drop.
30. And some exclaimed who saw afar
31. The figures he described with it,
32. "I wonder what those signals are

33. Brown makes at such an hour of night!
34. He's celebrating something strange.
35. I wonder if he's sold his farm,
36. Or been made Master of the Grange."

37. He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;
38. He fell and made the lantern rattle
39. (But saved the light from going out.)
40. So half-way down he fought the battle

41. Incredulous of his own bad luck.
42. And then becoming reconciled
43. To everything, he gave it up
44. And came down like a coasting child.

45. "Well—I—be—" that was all he said,
46. As standing in the river road,
47. He looked back up the slippery slope
48. (Two miles it was) to his abode.

49. Sometimes as an authority
50. On motor-cars, I'm asked if I
51. Should say our stock was petered out,
52. And this is my sincere reply:

53. Yankees are what they always were.
54. Don't think Brown ever gave up hope
55. Of getting home again because
56. He couldn't climb that slippery slope;

57. Or even thought of standing there
58. Until the January thaw
59. Should take the polish off the crust.
60. He bowed with grace to natural law,

61. And then went round it on his feet,
62. After the manner of our stock;
63. Not much concerned for those to whom,
64. At that particular time o'clock,

65. It must have looked as if the course
66. He steered was really straight away
67. From that which he was headed for—
68. Not much concerned for them, I say:

69. No more so than became a man—
70. And politician at odd seasons.
71. I've kept Brown standing in the cold
72. While I invested him with reasons;

73. But now he snapped his eyes three times;
74. Then shook his lantern, saying, "Ile's
75. 'Bout out!" and took the long way home
76. By road, a matter of several miles.
