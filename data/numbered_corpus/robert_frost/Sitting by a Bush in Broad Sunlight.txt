1. When I spread out my hand here today,
2. I catch no more than a ray
3. To feel of between thumb and fingers;
4. No lasting effect of it lingers.

5. There was one time and only the one
6. When dust really took in the sun;
7. And from that one intake of fire
8. All creatures still warmly suspire.

9. And if men have watched a long time
10. And never seen sun-smitten slime
11. Again come to life and crawl off,
12. We not be too ready to scoff.

13. God once declared he was true
14. And then took the veil and withdrew,
15. And remember how final a hush
16. Then descended of old on the bush.

17. God once spoke to people by name.
18. The sun once imparted its flame.
19. One impulse persists as our breath;
20. The other persists as our faith.
