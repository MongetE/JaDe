1. At the end of the row
2. I stepped on the toe
3. Of an unemployed hoe.
4. It rose in offense
5. And struck me a blow
6. In the seat of my sense.
7. It wasn't to blame
8. But I called it a name.
9. And I must say it dealt
10. Me a blow that I felt
11. Like a malice prepense.
12. You may call me a fool,
13. But was there a rule
14. The weapon should be
15. Turned into a tool?
16. And what do we see?
17. The first tool I step on
18. Turned into a weapon.
