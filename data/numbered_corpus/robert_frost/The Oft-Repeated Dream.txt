1. She had no saying dark enough
2. For the dark pine that kept
3. Forever trying the window latch
4. Of the room where they slept.

5. The tireless but ineffectual hands
6. That with every futile pass
7. Made the great tree seem as a little bird
8. Before the mystery of glass!

9. It never had been inside the room,
10. And only one of the two
11. Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream
12. Of what the tree might do.
