1. I've known ere now an interfering branch
2. Of alder catch my lifted axe behind me.
3. But that was in the woods, to hold my hand
4. From striking at another alder's roots,
5. And that was, as I say, an alder branch.
6. This was a man, Baptiste, who stole one day
7. Behind me on the snow in my own yard
8. Where I was working at the chopping block,
9. And cutting nothing not cut down already.
10. He caught my axe expertly on the rise,
11. When all my strength put forth was in his favor,
12. Held it a moment where it was, to calm me,
13. Then took it from me - and I let him take it.
14. I didn't know him well enough to know
15. What it was all about. There might be something
16. He had in mind to say to a bad neighbour
17. He might prefer to say to him disarmed.
18. But all he had to tell me in French-English
19. Was what he thought of- not me, but my axe;
20. Me only as I took my axe to heart.
21. It was the bad axe-helve some one had sold me -
22. 'Made on machine,' he said, ploughing the grain
23. With a thick thumbnail to show how it ran
24. Across the handle's long, drawn serpentine,
25. Like the two strokes across a dollar sign.
26. 'You give her 'one good crack, she's snap raght off.
27. Den where's your hax-ead flying t'rough de hair?'
28. Admitted; and yet, what was that to him?
29. 'Come on my house and I put you one in
30. What's las' awhile - good hick'ry what's grow crooked,
31. De second growt' I cut myself-tough, tough!'

32. Something to sell? That wasn't how it sounded.

33. 'Den when you say you come? It's cost you nothing.
34. To-naght?'

35. As well to-night as any night.

36. Beyond an over-warmth of kitchen stove
37. My welcome differed from no other welcome.
38. Baptiste knew best why I was where I was.
39. So long as he would leave enough unsaid,
40. I shouldn't mind his being overjoyed
41. (If overjoyed he was) at having got me
42. Where I must judge if what he knew about an axe
43. That not everybody else knew was to count
44. For nothing in the measure of a neighbour.
45. Hard if, though cast away for life with Yankees,
46. A Frenchman couldn't get his human rating.

47. Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair
48. That had as many motions as the world:
49. One back and forward, in and out of shadow,
50. That got her nowhere; one more gradual,
51. Sideways, that would have run her on the stove
52. In time, had she not realized her danger
53. And caught herself up bodily, chair and all,
54. And set herself back where she, started from.
55. 'She ain't spick too much Henglish- dat's too bad.'
56. I was afraid, in brightening first on me,
57. Then on Baptiste, as if she understood
58. 'What passed between us, she was only reigning.
59. Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more
60. Than for himself, so placed he couldn't hope
61. To keep his bargain of the morning with me
62. In time to keep me from suspecting him
63. Of really never having meant to keep it.

64. Needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out,
65. A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me
66. To have the best he had, or had to spare -
67. Not for me to ask which, when what he took
68. Had beauties he had to point me out at length
69. To ensure their not being wasted on me.
70. He liked to have it slender as a whipstock,
71. Free from the least knot, equal to the strain
72. Of bending like a sword across the knee.
73. He showed me that the lines of a good helve
74. Were native to the grain before the knife
75. Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves
76. Put on it from without. And there its strength lay
77. For the hard work. He chafed its long white body
78. From end to end with his rough hand shut round it.
79. He tried it at the eye-hold in the axe-head.
80. 'Hahn, hahn,' he mused, 'don't need much taking down.'
81. Baptiste knew how to make a short job long
82. For love of it, and yet not waste time either.

83. Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?
84. Baptiste on his defence about the children
85. He kept from school, or did his best to keep -
86. Whatever school and children and our doubts
87. Of laid-on education had to do
88. With the curves of his axe-helves and his having
89. Used these unscrupulously to bring me
90. To see for once the inside of his house.
91. Was I desired in friendship, partly as some one
92. To leave it to, whether the right to hold
93. Such doubts of education should depend
94. Upon the education of those who held them.
95. But now he brushed the shavings from his knee
96. And stood the axe there on its horse's hoof,
97. Erect, but not without its waves, as when
98. The snake stood up for evil in the Garden'-
99. Top-heavy with a heaviness his short,
100. Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down
101. And in a little - a French touch in that.
102. Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased;
103. 'See how she's cock her head.
