1. The fisherman's swapping a yarn for a yarn
2. Under the hand of the village barber,
3. And her in the angle of house and barn
4. His deep-sea dory has found a harbor.

5. At anchor she rides the sunny sod
6. As full to the gunnel of flowers growing
7. As ever she turned her home with cod
8. From George's bank when winds were blowing.

9. And I judge from that elysian freight
10. That all they ask is rougher weather,
11. And dory and master will sail by fate
12. To seek the Happy Isles together.
