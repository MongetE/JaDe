1. More than halfway up the pass
2. Was a spring with a broken drinking glass,
3. And whether the farmer drank or not
4. His mare was sure to observe the spot
5. By cramping the wheel on a water-bar,
6. turning her forehead with a star,
7. And straining her ribs for a monster sigh;
8. To which the farmer would make reply,
9. 'A sigh for every so many breath,
10. And for every so many sigh a death.
11. That's what I always tell my wife
12. Is the multiplication table of life.'
13. The saying may be ever so true;
14. But it's just the kind of a thing that you
15. Nor I, nor nobody else may say,
16. Unless our purpose is doing harm,
17. And then I know of no better way
18. To close a road, abandon a farm,
19. Reduce the births of the human race,
20. And bring back nature in people's place.
