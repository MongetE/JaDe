2. Saying... And she could have him. And before

6. How else? They are not known to send the dead
7. And not disfigured visibly. His face?
8. His hands? She had to look, and ask,
9. "What was it, dear?" And she had given all
10. And still she had all they had they the lucky!

17. And medicine and rest, and you a week,
18. Can cure me of to go again." The same

23. They had given him back to her, but not to keep.
