1. To think to know the country and now know
2. The hillside on the day the sun lets go
3. Ten million silver lizards out of snow!
4. As often as I've seen it done before
5. I can't pretend to tell the way it's done.
6. It looks as if some magic of the sun
7. Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor
8. And the light breaking on them made them run.
9. But if I though to stop the wet stampede,
10. And caught one silver lizard by the tail,
11. And put my foot on one without avail,
12. And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed
13. In front of twenty others' wriggling speed,-
14. In the confusion of them all aglitter,
15. And birds that joined in the excited fun
16. By doubling and redoubling song and twitter,
17. I have no doubt I'd end by holding none.

18. It takes the moon for this. The sun's a wizard
19. By all I tell; but so's the moon a witch.
20. From the high west she makes a gentle cast
21. And suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,
22. She has her speel on every single lizard.
23. I fancied when I looked at six o'clock
24. The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.
25. The moon was waiting for her chill effect.
26. I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock
27. In every lifelike posture of the swarm,
28. Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.
29. Across each other and side by side they lay.
30. The spell that so could hold them as they were
31. Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm
32. To make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.
33. It was the moon's: She held them until day.
34. One lizard at the end of every ray.
