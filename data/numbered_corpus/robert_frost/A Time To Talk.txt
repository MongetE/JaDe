1. When a friend calls to me from the road
2. And slows his horse to a meaning walk,
3. I don't stand still and look around
4. On all the hills I haven't hoed,
5. And shout from where I am, What is it?
6. No, not as there is a time to talk.
7. I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
8. Blade-end up and five feet tall,
9. And plod: I go up to the stone wall
10. For a friendly visit.
