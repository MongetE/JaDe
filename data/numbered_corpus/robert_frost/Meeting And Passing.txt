1. As I went down the hill along the wall
2. There was a gate I had leaned at for the view
3. And had just turned from when I first saw you
4. As you came up the hill. We met. But all
5. We did that day was mingle great and small
6. Footprints in summer dust as if we drew
7. The figure of our being less than two
8. But more than one as yet. Your parasol
9. Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust.
10. And all the time we talked you seemed to see
11. Something down there to smile at in the dust.
12. (Oh, it was without prejudice to me!)
13. Afterward I went past what you had passed
14. Before we met and you what I had passed.
