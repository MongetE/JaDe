1. An ant on the tablecloth
2. Ran into a dormant moth
3. Of many times his size.
4. He showed not the least surprise.
5. His business wasn't with such.
6. He gave it scarcely a touch,
7. And was off on his duty run.
8. Yet if he encountered one
9. Of the hive's enquiry squad
10. Whose work is to find out God
11. And the nature of time and space,
12. He would put him onto the case.

37. Seizes the dead by the middle,
38. And heaving him high in air,
39. Carries him out of there.
40. No one stands round to stare.
41. It is nobody else's affair
42. It couldn't be called ungentle
43. But how thoroughly departmental
