1. Out of the mud two strangers came
2. And caught me splitting wood in the yard,
3. And one of them put me off my aim
4. By hailing cheerily "Hit them hard!"
5. I knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
6. And let the other go on a way.
7. I knew pretty well what he had in mind:
8. He wanted to take my job for pay.

9. Good blocks of oak it was I split,
10. As large around as the chopping block;
11. And every piece I squarely hit
12. Fell splinterless as a cloven rock.
13. The blows that a life of self-control
14. Spares to strike for the common good,
15. That day, giving a loose my soul,
16. I spent on the unimportant wood.

17. The sun was warm but the wind was chill.
18. You know how it is with an April day
19. When the sun is out and the wind is still,
20. You're one month on in the middle of May.
21. But if you so much as dare to speak,
22. A cloud comes over the sunlit arch,
23. A wind comes off a frozen peak,
24. And you're two months back in the middle of March.

25. A bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
26. And turns to the wind to unruffle a plume,
27. His song so pitched as not to excite
28. A single flower as yet to bloom.
29. It is snowing a flake; and he half knew
30. Winter was only playing possum.
31. Except in color he isn't blue,
32. But he wouldn't advise a thing to blossom.

33. The water for which we may have to look
34. In summertime with a witching wand,
35. In every wheelrut's now a brook,
36. In every print of a hoof a pond.
37. Be glad of water, but don't forget
38. The lurking frost in the earth beneath
39. That will steal forth after the sun is set
40. And show on the water its crystal teeth.

41. The time when most I loved my task
42. The two must make me love it more
43. By coming with what they came to ask.
44. You'd think I never had felt before
45. The weight of an ax-head poised aloft,
46. The grip of earth on outspread feet,
47. The life of muscles rocking soft
48. And smooth and moist in vernal heat.

49. Out of the wood two hulking tramps
50. (From sleeping God knows where last night,
51. But not long since in the lumber camps).
52. They thought all chopping was theirs of right.
53. Men of the woods and lumberjacks,
54. They judged me by their appropriate tool.
55. Except as a fellow handled an ax
56. They had no way of knowing a fool.

57. Nothing on either side was said.
58. They knew they had but to stay their stay

59. And all their logic would fill my head:
60. As that I had no right to play
61. With what was another man's work for gain.
62. My right might be love but theirs was need.
63. And where the two exist in twain
64. Theirs was the better right--agreed.

65. But yield who will to their separation,
66. My object in living is to unite
67. My avocation and my vocation
68. As my two eyes make one in sight.
69. Only where love and need are one,
70. And the work is play for mortal stakes,
71. Is the deed ever really done
72. For Heaven and the future's sakes.
