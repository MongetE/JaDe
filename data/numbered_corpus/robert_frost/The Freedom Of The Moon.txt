1. I've tried the new moon tilted in the air
2. Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster
3. As you might try a jewel in your hair.
4. I've tried it fine with little breadth of luster,
5. Alone, or in one ornament combining
6. With one first-water start almost shining.

7. I put it shining anywhere I please.
8. By walking slowly on some evening later,
9. I've pulled it from a crate of crooked trees,
10. And brought it over glossy water, greater,
11. And dropped it in, and seen the image wallow,
12. The color run, all sorts of wonder follow.
