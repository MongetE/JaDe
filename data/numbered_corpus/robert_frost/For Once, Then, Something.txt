1. Others taught me with having knelt at well-curbs
2. Always wrong to the light, so never seeing
3. Deeper down in the well than where the water
4. Gives me back in a shining surface picture
5. Me myself in the summer heaven godlike
6. Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs.
7. Once, when trying with chin against a well-curb,
8. I discerned, as I thought, beyond the picture,
9. Through the picture, a something white, uncertain,
10. Something more of the depths--and then I lost it.
11. Water came to rebuke the too clear water.
12. One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple
13. Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,
14. Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that whiteness?
15. Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, something.
