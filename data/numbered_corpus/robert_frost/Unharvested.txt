1. A scent of ripeness from over a wall.
2. And come to leave the routine road
3. And look for what had made me stall,
4. There sure enough was an apple tree
5. That had eased itself of its summer load,
6. And of all but its trivial foliage free,
7. Now breathed as light as a lady's fan.
8. For there had been an apple fall
9. As complete as the apple had given man.
10. The ground was one circle of solid red.

11. May something go always unharvested!
12. May much stay out of our stated plan,
13. Apples or something forgotten and left,
14. So smelling their sweetness would be no theft.
