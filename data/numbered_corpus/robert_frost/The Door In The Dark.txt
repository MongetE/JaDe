1. In going from room to room in the dark,
2. I reached out blindly to save my face,
3. But neglected, however lightly, to lace
4. My fingers and close my arms in an arc.
5. A slim door got in past my guard,
6. And hit me a blow in the head so hard
7. I had my native simile jarred.
8. So people and things don't pair any more
9. With what they used to pair with before.
