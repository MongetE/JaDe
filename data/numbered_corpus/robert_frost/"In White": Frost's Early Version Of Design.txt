1. A dented spider like a snow drop white
2. On a white Heal-all, holding up a moth
3. Like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
4. Saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
5. Portent in little, assorted death and blight
6. Like the ingredients of a witches' broth? -
7. The beady spider, the flower like a froth,
8. And the moth carried like a paper kite.

9. What had that flower to do with being white,
10. The blue prunella every child's delight.
11. What brought the kindred spider to that height?
12. (Make we no thesis of the miller's plight.)
13. What but design of darkness and of night?
14. Design, design! Do I use the word aright?
