1. When I go up through the mowing field,
2. The headless aftermath,
3. Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,
4. Half closes the garden path.

5. And when I come to the garden ground,
6. The whir of sober birds
7. Up from the tangle of withered weeds
8. Is sadder than any words

9. A tree beside the wall stands bare,
10. But a leaf that lingered brown,
11. Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,
12. Comes softly rattling down.

13. I end not far from my going forth
14. By picking the faded blue
15. Of the last remaining aster flower
16. To carry again to you.
