1. ALWAYS the same, when on a fated night
2. At last the gathered snow lets down as white
3. As may be in dark woods, and with a song
4. It shall not make again all winter long
5. Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground,
6. I almost stumble looking up and round,
7. As one who overtaken by the end
8. Gives up his errand, and lets death descend
9. Upon him where he is, with nothing done
10. To evil, no important triumph won,
11. More than if life had never been begun.

12. Yet all the precedent is on my side:
13. I know that winter death has never tried
14. The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap
15. In long storms an undrifted four feet deep
16. As measured against maple, birch and oak,
17. It cannot check the peeper's silver croak;
18. And I shall see the snow all go down hill
19. In water of a slender April rill
20. That flashes tail through last year's withered brake
21. And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake.
22. Nothing will be left white but here a birch,
23. And there a clump of houses with a church.
