1. Thus of old the Douglas did:
2. He left his land as he was bid
3. With the royal heart of Robert the Bruce
4. In a golden case with a golden lid,
5. To carry the same to the Holy Land;
6. By which we see and understand
7. That that was the place to carry a heart
8. At loyalty and love's command,
9. And that was the case to carry it in.
10. The Douglas had not far to win
11. Before he came to the land of Spain,
12. Where long a holy war had been
13. Against the too-victorious Moor;
14. And there his courage could not endure
15. Not to strike a blow for God
16. Before he made his errand sure.
17. And ever it was intended so,
18. That a man for God should strike a blow,
19. No matter the heart he has in charge
20. For the Holy Land where hearts should go.
21. But when in battle the foe were met,
22. The Douglas found him sore beset,
23. With only strength of the fighting arm
24. For one more battle passage yet-
25. And that as vain to save the day
26. As bring his body safe away-
27. Only a signal deed to do
28. And a last sounding word to say.
29. The heart he wore in a golden chain
30. He swung and flung forth into the plain,
31. And followed it crying 'Heart or death!'
32. And fighting over it perished fain.
33. So may another do of right,
34. Give a heart to the hopeless fight,
35. The more of right the more he loves;
36. So may another redouble might
37. For a few swift gleams of the angry brand,
38. Scorning greatly not to demand
39. In equal sacrifice with his
40. The heart he bore to the Holy Land.
