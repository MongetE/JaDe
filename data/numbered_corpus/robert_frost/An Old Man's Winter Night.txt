1. All out of doors looked darkly in at him
2. Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,
3. That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
4. What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
5. Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
6. What kept him from remembering what it was
7. That brought him to that creaking room was age.
8. He stood with barrels round him -- at a loss.
9. And having scared the cellar under him
10. In clomping there, he scared it once again
11. In clomping off; -- and scared the outer night,
12. Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar
13. Of trees and crack of branches, common things,
14. But nothing so like beating on a box.
15. A light he was to no one but himself
16. Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,
17. A quiet light, and then not even that.
18. He consigned to the moon, such as she was,
19. So late-arising, to the broken moon
20. As better than the sun in any case
21. For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,
22. His icicles along the wall to keep;
23. And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt
24. Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,
25. And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.
26. One aged man -- one man -- can't keep a house,
27. A farm, a countryside, or if he can,
28. It's thus he does it of a winter night.
