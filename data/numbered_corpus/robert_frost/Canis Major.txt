1. The great Overdog
2. That heavenly beast
3. With a star in one eye
4. Gives a leap in the east.
5. He dances upright
6. All the way to the west
7. And never once drops
8. On his forefeet to rest.
9. I'm a poor underdog,
10. But to-night I will bark
11. With the great Overdog
12. That romps through the dark.
