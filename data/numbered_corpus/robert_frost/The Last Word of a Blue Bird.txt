1. As told to a child


2. As I went out a Crow
3. In a low voice said, 'Oh,
4. I was looking for you.
5. How do you do?
6. I just came to tell you
7. To tell Lesley (will you?)
8. That her little Bluebird
9. Wanted me to bring word
10. That the north wind last night
11. That made the stars bright
12. And made ice on the trough
13. Almost made him cough
14. His tail feathers off.
15. He just had to fly!
16. But he sent her Good-by,
17. And said to be good,
18. And wear her red hood,
19. And look for the skunk tracks
20. In the snow with an ax-
21. And do everything!
22. And perhaps in the spring
23. He would come back and sing.'
