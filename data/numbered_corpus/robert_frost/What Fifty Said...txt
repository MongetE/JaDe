2. I gave up fire for form till I was cold.
3. I suffered like a metal being cast.
4. I went to school to age to learn the past.

5. Now when I am old my teachers are the young.
6. What can't be molded must be cracked and sprung.
7. I strain at lessons fit to start a suture.
8. I got to school to youth to learn the future.
