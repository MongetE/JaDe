1. Love has earth to which she clings
2. With hills and circling arms about-
3. Wall within wall to shut fear out.
4. But Thought has need of no such things,
5. For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings.

6. On snow and sand and turn, I see
7. Where Love has left a printed trace
8. With straining in the world's embrace.
9. And such is Love and glad to be
10. But Thought has shaken his ankles free.

11. Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
12. And sits in Sirius' disc all night,
13. Till day makes him retrace his flight
14. With smell of burning on every plume,
15. Back past the sun to an earthly room.

16. His gains in heaven are what they are.
17. Yet some say Love by being thrall
18. And simply staying possesses all
19. In several beauty that Thought fares far
20. To find fused in another star.
