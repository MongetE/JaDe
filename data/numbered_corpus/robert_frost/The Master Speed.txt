1. No speed of wind or water rushing by
2. But you have speed far greater. You can climb
3. Back up a stream of radiance to the sky,
4. And back through history up the stream of time.
5. And you were given this swiftness, not for haste
6. Nor chiefly that you may go where you will,
7. But in the rush of everything to waste,
8. That you may have the power of standing still-
9. Off any still or moving thing you say.
10. Two such as you with such a master speed
11. Cannot be parted nor be swept away
12. From one another once you are agreed
13. That life is only life forevermore
14. Together wing to wing and oar to oar
