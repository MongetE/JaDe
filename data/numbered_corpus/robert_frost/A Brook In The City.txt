1. The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
2. With the new city street it has to wear
3. A number in. But what about the brook
4. That held the house as in an elbow-crook?
5. I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
6. And impulse, having dipped a finger length
7. And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed
8. A flower to try its currents where they crossed.
9. The meadow grass could be cemented down
10. From growing under pavements of a town;
11. The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.
12. Is water wood to serve a brook the same?
13. How else dispose of an immortal force
14. No longer needed? Staunch it at its source
15. With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown
16. Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
17. In fetid darkness still to live and run --
18. And all for nothing it had ever done
19. Except forget to go in fear perhaps.
20. No one would know except for ancient maps
21. That such a brook ran water. But I wonder
22. If from its being kept forever under,
23. The thoughts may not have risen that so keep
24. This new-built city from both work and sleep.
