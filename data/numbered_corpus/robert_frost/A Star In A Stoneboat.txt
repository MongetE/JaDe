1. For Lincoln MacVeagh

2. Never tell me that not one star of all
3. That slip from heaven at night and softly fall
4. Has been picked up with stones to build a wall.

5. Some laborer found one faded and stone-cold,
6. And saving that its weight suggested gold
7. And tugged it from his first too certain hold,

8. He noticed nothing in it to remark.
9. He was not used to handling stars thrown dark
10. And lifeless from an interrupted arc.

11. He did not recognize in that smooth coal
12. The one thing palpable besides the soul
13. To penetrate the air in which we roll.

14. He did not see how like a flying thing
15. It brooded ant eggs, and bad one large wing,
16. One not so large for flying in a ring,

17. And a long Bird of Paradise's tail
18. (Though these when not in use to fly and trail
19. It drew back in its body like a snail):

20. Nor know that be might move it from the spot—
21. The harm was done: from having been star-shot
22. The very nature of the soil was hot

23. And burning to yield flowers instead of grain,
24. Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain
25. Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.

26. He moved it roughly with an iron bar,
27. He loaded an old stoneboat with the star
28. And not, as you might think, a flying car,

29. Such as even poets would admit perforce
30. More practical than Pegasus the horse
31. If it could put a star back in its course.

32. He dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace
33. But faintly reminiscent of the race
34. Of jostling rock in interstellar space.

35. It went for building stone, and I, as though
36. Commanded in a dream, forever go
37. To right the wrong that this should have been so.

38. Yet ask where else it could have gone as well,
39. I do not know—I cannot stop to tell:
40. He might have left it lying where it fell.

41. From following walls I never lift my eye,
42. Except at night to places in the sky
43. Where showers of charted meteors let fly.

44. Some may know what they seek in school and church,
45. And why they seek it there; for what I search
46. I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch;

47. Sure that though not a star of death and birth,
48. So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth
49. To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth—

50. Though not, I say, a star of death and sin,
51. It yet has poles, and only needs a spin
52. To show its worldly nature and begin

53. To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm
54. And run off in strange tangents with my arm,
55. As fish do with the line in first alarm.

56. Such as it is, it promises the prize
57. Of the one world complete in any size
58. That I am like to compass, fool or wise.
