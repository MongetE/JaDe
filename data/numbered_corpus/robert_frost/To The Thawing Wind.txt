1. Come with rain. O loud Southwester!
2. Bring the singer, bring the nester;
3. Give the buried flower a dream;
4. Make the settled snowbank steam;
5. Find the brown beneath the white;
6. But whate'er you do tonight,
7. Bath my window, make it flow,
8. Melt it as the ice will go;
9. Melt the glass and leave the sticks
10. Like a hermit's crucifix;
11. Burst into my narrow stall;
12. Swing the picture on the wall;
13. Run the rattling pages o'er;
14. Scatter poems on the floor;
15. Turn the poet out of door.
