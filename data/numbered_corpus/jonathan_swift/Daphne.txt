1. Daphne knows, with equal ease,
2. How to vex, and how to please;
3. But the folly of her sex
4. Makes her sole delight to vex.
5. Never woman more devised
6. Surer ways to be despised;
7. Paradoxes weakly wielding,
8. Always conquer'd, never yielding.
9. To dispute, her chief delight,
10. Without one opinion right:
11. Thick her arguments she lays on,
12. And with cavils combats reason;
13. Answers in decisive way,
14. Never hears what you can say;
15. Still her odd perverseness shows
16. Chiefly where she nothing knows;
17. And, where she is most familiar,
18. Always peevisher and sillier;
19. All her spirits in a flame
20. When she knows she's most to blame.
21. Send me hence ten thousand miles,
22. From a face that always smiles:
23. None could ever act that part,
24. But a fury in her heart.
25. Ye who hate such inconsistence,
26. To be easy, keep your distance:
27. Or in folly still befriend her,
28. But have no concern to mend her;
29. Lose not time to contradict her,
30. Nor endeavour to convict her.
31. Never take it in your thought,
32. That she'll own, or cure a fault.
33. Into contradiction warm her,
34. Then, perhaps, you may reform her:
35. Only take this rule along,
36. Always to advise her wrong;
37. And reprove her when she's right;
38. She may then grow wise for spight.
39. Noâ€”that scheme will ne'er succeed,
40. She has better learnt her creed;
41. She's too cunning and too skilful,
42. When to yield, and when be wilful.
43. Nature holds her forth two mirrors,
44. One for truth, and one for errors:
45. That looks hideous, fierce, and frightful;
46. This is flattering and delightful:
47. That she throws away as foul;
48. Sits by this to dress her soul.
49. Thus you have the case in view,
50. Daphne, 'twixt the Dean and you:
51. Heaven forbid he should despise thee,
52. But he'll never more advise thee.
