1. Never sleeping, still awake,
2. Pleasing most when most I speak;
3. The delight of old and young,
4. Though I speak without a tongue.
5. Nought but one thing can confound me,
6. Many voices joining round me;
7. Then I fret, and rave, and gabble,
8. Like the labourers of Babel.
9. Now I am a dog, or cow,
10. I can bark, or I can low;
11. I can bleat, or I can sing,
12. Like the warblers of the spring.
13. Let the lovesick bard complain,
14. And I mourn the cruel pain;
15. Let the happy swain rejoice,
16. And I join my helping voice:
17. Both are welcome, grief or joy,
18. I with either sport and toy.
19. Though a lady, I am stout,
20. Drums and trumpets bring me out:
21. Then I clash, and roar, and rattle,
22. Join in all the din of battle.
23. Jove, with all his loudest thunder,
24. When I'm vext, can't keep me under;
25. Yet so tender is my ear,
26. That the lowest voice I fear;
27. Much I dread the courtier's fate,
28. When his merit's out of date,
29. For I hate a silent breath,
30. And a whisper is my death.
