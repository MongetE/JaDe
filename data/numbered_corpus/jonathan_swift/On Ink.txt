1. I am jet black, as you may see,
2. The son of pitch and gloomy night:
3. Yet all that know me will agree,
4. I'm dead except I live in light.

5. Sometimes in panegyric high,
6. Like lofty Pindar, I can soar;
7. And raise a virgin to the sky,
8. Or sink her to a pocky whore.

9. My blood this day is very sweet,
10. To-morrow of a bitter juice;
11. Like milk, 'tis cried about the street,
12. And so applied to different use.

13. Most wondrous is my magic power:
14. For with one colour I can paint;
15. I'll make the devil a saint this hour,
16. Next make a devil of a saint.

17. Through distant regions I can fly,
18. Provide me but with paper wings;
19. And fairly show a reason why
20. There should be quarrels among kings:

21. And, after all, you'll think it odd,
22. When learned doctors will dispute,
23. That I should point the word of God,
24. And show where they can best confute.

25. Let lawyers bawl and strain their throats:
26. 'Tis I that must the lands convey,
27. And strip their clients to their coats;
28. Nay, give their very souls away.
