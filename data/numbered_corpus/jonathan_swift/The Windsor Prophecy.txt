1. When a holy black Swede, the son of Bob,
2. With a saint at his chin and a seal at his fob,
3. Shall not see one New-Years-day in that year,
4. Then let old England make good cheer:
5. Windsor and Bristol then shall be
6. Joined together in the Low-countree.
7. Then shall the tall black Daventry Bird
8. Speak against peace right many a word;
9. And some shall admire his coneying wit,
10. For many good groats his tongue shall slit.
11. But spight of the Harpy that crawls on all four,
12. There shall be peace, pardie, and war no more
13. But England must cry alack and well-a-day,
14. If the stick be taken from the dead sea.
15. And, dear Englond, if ought I understond,
16. Beware of Carrots from Northumberlond.
17. Carrots sown Thynne a deep root may get,
18. If so be they are in Somer set:
19. Their Conyngs mark thou; for I have been told,
20. They assassine when younge, and poison when old.
21. Root out these Carrots, O thou, whose name
22. is backwards and forwards always the same;
23. And keep thee close to thee always that name
24. Which backwards and forwards is almost the same.
25. And, England, wouldst thou be happy still,
26. Burn those Carrots under a Hill.
