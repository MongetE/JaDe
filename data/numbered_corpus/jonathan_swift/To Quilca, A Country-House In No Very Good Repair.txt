1. Let me thy Properties explain,
2. A rotten Cabin, dropping Rain;
3. Chimnies with Scorn rejecting Smoak;
4. Stools, Tables, Chairs, and Bed-steds broke:
5. Here Elements have lost their Vses,
6. Air ripens not, nor Earth produces:
7. In vain we make poor Sheelah toil,
8. Fire will not roast, nor Water boil.
9. Thro' all the Vallies, Hills, and Plains,
10. The Goddess Want in Triumph reigns;
11. And her chief Officers of State,
12. Sloth, Dirt, and Theft around her wait.
