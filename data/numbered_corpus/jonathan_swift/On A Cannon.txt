1. Begotten, and born, and dying with noise,
2. The terror of women, and pleasure of boys,
3. Like the fiction of poets concerning the wind,
4. I'm chiefly unruly when strongest confined.
5. For silver and gold I don't trouble my head,
6. But all I delight in is pieces of lead;
7. Except when I trade with a ship or a town,
8. Why then I make pieces of iron go down.
9. One property more I would have you remark,
10. No lady was ever more fond of a spark;
11. The moment I get one, my soul's all a-fire,
12. And I roar out my joy, and in transport expire.
