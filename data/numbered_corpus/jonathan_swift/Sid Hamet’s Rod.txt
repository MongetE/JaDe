1. Poor Hall, renown'd for comely hair,
2. Whose hands, perhaps, were not so fair,
3. Yet had a Jezebel as near;
4. Hall, of small scripture conversation,
5. Yet, howe'er Hungerford's quotation,
6. By some strange accident had got
7. The story of this garden-plot;â€”Wisely
8. foresaw he might have reason
9. To dread a modern bill of treason,
10. If Jezebel should please to want
11. His small addition to her grant:
12. Therefore resolved, in humble sort,
13. To begin first, and make his court;
14. And, seeing nothing else would do,
15. Gave a third part, to save the other two.
