1. Gently stir and blow the fire,
2. Lay the mutton down to roast,
3. Dress it quickly, I desire,
4. In the dripping put a toast,
5. That I hunger may remove --
6. Mutton is the meat I love.
7. On the dresser see it lie;
8. Oh, the charming white and red;
9. Finer meat ne'er met the eye,
10. On the sweetest grass it fed:
11. Let the jack go swiftly round,
12. Let me have it nice and brown'd.
13. On the table spread the cloth,
14. Let the knives be sharp and clean,
15. Pickles get and salad both,
16. Let them each be fresh and green.
17. With small beer, good ale and wine,
18. Oh ye gods! how I shall dine.
