1. ON RAINY days alone I dine
2. Upon a chick and pint of wine.
3. On rainy days I dine alone
4. And pick my chicken to the bone;
5. But this my servants much enrages,
6. No scraps remain to save board-wages.
7. In weather fine I nothing spend,
8. But often spunge upon a friend;
9. Yet, where heâ€™s not so rich as I,
10. I pay my club, and so good-bye.
