1. WITH a whirl of thoughts oppress’d,
2. I sunk from reverie to rest.
3. A horrid vision seized my head,
4. I saw the graves give up their dead!
5. Jove, arm’d with terrors, bursts the skies,
6. And thunder roars and lightning flies!
7. Amazed, confused, its fate unknown,
8. The world stands trembling at his throne!
9. While each pale sinner hung his head,
10. Jove, nodding, shook the heavens, and said:
11. “Offending race of human kind,
12. By nature, reason, learning, blind;
13. You who, through frailty, stepp’d aside;
14. And you, who never fell from pride:
15. You who in different sects were shamm’d,
16. And come to see each other damn’d;
17. (So some folk told you, but they knew
18. No more of Jove’s designs than you
19. —The world’s mad business now is o’er,
20. And I resent these pranks no more.
21. —I to such blockheads set my wit!
22. I damn such fools!—Go, go, you’re bit.”
