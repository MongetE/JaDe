1. The joy of man, the pride of brutes,
2. Domestic subject for disputes,
3. Of plenty thou the emblem fair,
4. Adorn'd by nymphs with all their care!
5. I saw thee raised to high renown,
6. Supporting half the British crown;
7. And often have I seen thee grace
8. The chaste Diana's infant face;
9. And whensoe'er you please to shine,
10. Less useful is her light than thine:
11. Thy numerous fingers know their way,
12. And oft in Celia's tresses play.
13. To place thee in another view,
14. I'll show the world strange things and true;
15. What lords and dames of high degree
16. May justly claim their birth from thee!
17. The soul of man with spleen you vex;
18. Of spleen you cure the female sex.
19. Thee for a gift the courtier sends
20. With pleasure to his special friends:
21. He gives, and with a generous pride,
22. Contrives all means the gift to hide:
23. Nor oft can the receiver know,
24. Whether he has the gift or no.
25. On airy wings you take your flight,
26. And fly unseen both day and night;
27. Conceal your form with various tricks;
28. And few know how or where you fix:
29. Yet some, who ne'er bestow'd thee, boast
30. That they to others give thee most.
31. Meantime, the wise a question start,
32. If thou a real being art;
33. Or but a creature of the brain,
34. That gives imaginary pain?
35. But the sly giver better knows thee;
36. Who feels true joys when he bestows thee.
