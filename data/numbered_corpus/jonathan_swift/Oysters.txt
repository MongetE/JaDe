1. Charming oysters I cry:
2. My masters, come buy,
3. So plump and so fresh,
4. So sweet is their flesh,
5. No Colchester oyster
6. Is sweeter and moister:
7. Your stomach they settle,
8. And rouse up your mettle:
9. They'll make you a dad
10. Of a lass or a lad;
11. And madam your wife
12. They'll please to the life;
13. Be she barren, be she old,
14. Be she slut, or be she scold,
15. Eat my oysters, and lie near her,
16. She'll be fruitful, never fear her.
