1. The nymph who wrote this in an amorous fit,
2. I cannot but envy the pride of her wit,
3. Which thus she will venture profusely to throw
4. On so mean a design, and a subject so low.
5. For mean's her design, and her subject as mean,
6. The first but a rebus, the last but a dean.
7. A dean's but a parson: and what is a rebus?
8. A thing never known to the Muses or Phoebus.
9. The corruption of verse; for, when all is done,
10. It is but a paraphrase made on a pun.
11. But a genius like hers no subject can stifle,
12. It shows and discovers itself through a trifle.
13. By reading this trifle, I quickly began
14. To find her a great wit, but the dean a small man.
15. Rich ladies will furnish their garrets with stuff,
16. Which others for mantuas would think fine enough:
17. So the wit that is lavishly thrown away here,
18. Might furnish a second-rate poet a year.
19. Thus much for the verse, we proceed to the next,
20. Where the nymph has entirely forsaken her text:
21. Her fine panegyrics are quite out of season:
22. And what she describes to be merit, is treason:
23. The changes which faction has made in the state,
24. Have put the dean's politics quite out of date:
25. Now no one regards what he utters with freedom,
26. And, should he write pamphlets, no great man would read 'em;
27. And, should want or desert stand in need of his aid,
28. This racer would prove but a dull founder'd jade.
