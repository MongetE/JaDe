1. FROM India's burning clime I'm brought,
2. With cooling gales like zephyrs fraught.
3. Not Iris, when she paints the sky,
4. Can show more different hues than I;
5. Nor can she change her form so fast,
6. I'm now a sail, and now a mast.
7. I here am red, and there am green,
8. A beggar there, and here a queen.
9. I sometimes live in house of hair,
10. And oft in hand of lady fair.
11. I please the young, I grace the old,
12. And am at once both hot and cold.
13. Say what I am then, if you can,
14. And find the rhyme, and you're the man.
