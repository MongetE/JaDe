1. Sure never did man see
2. A wretch like poor Nancy,
3. So teazed day and night
4. By a Dean and a Knight.
5. To punish my sins,
6. Sir Arthur begins,
7. And gives me a wipe,
8. With Skinny and Snipe:,
9. His malice is plain,
10. Hallooing the Dean.


11. The Dean never stops,
12. When he opens his chops;
13. I'm quite overrun
14. With rebus and pun.
15. Before he came here,
16. To spunge for good cheer,
17. I sat with delight,
18. From morning till night,
19. With two bony thumbs
20. Could rub my old gums,
21. Or scratching my nose
22. And jogging my toes;
23. But at present, forsooth,
24. I must not rub a tooth.
25. When my elbows he sees
26. Held up by my knees,
27. My arms, like two props,
28. Supporting my chops,
29. And just as I handle 'em
30. Moving all like a pendulum;
31. He trips up my props,
32. And down my chin drops
33. From my head to my heels,
34. Like a clock without wheels;
35. I sink in the spleen,
36. A useless machine.
37. If he had his will,
38. I should never sit still:
39. He comes with his whims
40. I must move my limbs;
41. I cannot be sweet
42. Without using my feet;
43. To lengthen my breath,
44. He tires me to death.
45. By the worst of all squires,
46. Thro' bogs and thro' briers,
47. Where a cow would be startled,
48. I'm in spite of my heart led;
49. And, say what I will,
50. Haul'd up every hill;
51. Till, daggled and tatter'd,
52. My spirits quite shatter'd,
53. I return home at night,
54. And fast, out of spite:
55. For I'd rather be dead,
56. Than it e'er should be said,
57. I was better for him,
58. In stomach or limb.
59. But now to my diet;
60. No eating in quiet,
61. He's still finding fault,
62. Too sour or too salt:
63. The wing of a chick
64. I hardly can pick:
65. But trash without measure
66. I swallow with pleasure.
67. Next, for his diversion,
68. He rails at my person.
69. What court breeding this is!
70. He takes me to pieces:
71. From shoulder to flank
72. I'm lean and am lank;
73. My nose, long and thin,
74. Grows down to my chin;
75. My chin will not stay,
76. But meets it halfway;
77. My fingers, prolix,
78. Are ten crooked sticks:
79. He swears my elâ€”bows
80. Are two iron crows,
81. Or sharp pointed rocks,
82. And wear out my smocks:
83. To 'scape them, Sir Arthur
84. Is forced to lie farther,
85. Or his sides they would gore
86. Like the tusks of a boar.
87. Now changing the scene
88. But still to the Dean;
89. He loves to be bitter at
90. A lady illiterate;
91. If he sees her but once,
92. He'll swear she's a dunce;
93. Can tell by her looks
94. A hater of books;
95. Thro' each line of her face
96. Her folly can trace;
97. Which spoils every feature
98. Bestow'd her by nature;
99. But sense gives a grace
100. To the homeliest face:
101. Wise books and reflection
102. Will mend the complexion:
103. (A civil divine!
104. I suppose, meaning mine!)
105. No lady who wants them,
106. Can ever be handsome.
107. I guess well enough
108. What he means by this stuff:
109. He haws and he hums,
110. At last out it comes:
111. What, madam? No walking,
112. No reading, nor talking?
113. You're now in your prime,
114. Make use of your time.
115. Consider, before
116. You come to threescore,
117. How the hussies will fleer
118. Where'er you appear;
119. 'That silly old puss
120. Would fain be like us:
121. What a figure she made
122. In her tarnish'd brocade!'
123. And then he grows mild:
124. Come, be a good child:
125. If you are inclined
126. To polish your mind,
127. Be adored by the men
128. Till threescore and ten,
129. And kill with the spleen
130. The jades of sixteen;
131. I'll show you the way;
132. Read six hours a-day.
133. The wits will frequent ye,
134. And think you but twenty.
135. [To make you learn faster,
136. I'll be your schoolmaster
137. And leave you to choose
138. The books you peruse.]
139. Thus was I drawn in;
140. Forgive me my sin.
141. At breakfast he'll ask
142. An account of my task.
143. Put a word out of joint,
144. Or miss but a point,
145. He rages and frets,
146. His manners forgets;
147. And as I am serious,
148. Is very imperious.
149. No book for delight
150. Must come in my sight;
151. But, instead of new plays,
152. Dull Bacon's Essays,
153. And pore every day on
154. That nasty Pantheon.
155. If I be not a drudge,
156. Let all the world judge.
157. 'Twere better be blind,
158. Than thus be confined.
159. But while in an ill tone,
160. I murder poor Milton,
161. The Dean you will swear,
162. Is at study or prayer.
163. He's all the day sauntering,
164. With labourers bantering,
165. Among his colleagues,
166. A parcel of Teagues,
167. Whom he brings in among us
168. And bribes with mundungus.
169. [He little believes
170. How they laugh in their sleeves.]
171. Hail, fellow, well met,
172. All dirty and wet:
173. Find out, if you can,
174. Who's master, who's man;
175. Who makes the best figure,
176. The Dean or the digger;
177. And which is the best
178. At cracking a jest.
179. [Now see how he sits
180. Perplexing his wits
181. In search of a motto
182. To fix on his grotto.]
183. How proudly he talks
184. Of zigzags and walks,
185. And all the day raves
186. Of cradles and caves;
187. And boasts of his feats,
188. His grottos and seats;
189. Shows all his gewgaws,
190. And gapes for applause;
191. A fine occupation
192. For one in his station!
193. A hole where a rabbit
194. Would scorn to inhabit,
195. Dug out in an hour;
196. He calls it a bower.
197. But, O! how we laugh,
198. To see a wild calf
199. Come, driven by heat,
200. And foul the green seat;
201. Or run helter-skelter,
202. To his arbour for shelter,
203. Where all goes to ruin
204. The Dean has been doing:
205. The girls of the village
206. Come flocking for pillage,
207. Pull down the fine briers
208. And thorns to make fires;
209. But yet are so kind
210. To leave something behind:
211. No more need be said on't,
212. I smell when I tread on't.
213. Dear friend, Doctor Jinny.
214. If I could but win ye,
215. Or Walmsley or Whaley,
216. To come hither daily,
217. Since fortune, my foe,
218. Will needs have it so,
219. That I'm, by her frowns,
220. Condemn'd to black gowns;
221. No squire to be found
222. The neighbourhood round;
223. (For, under the rose,
224. I would rather choose those)
225. If your wives will permit ye,
226. Come here out of pity,
227. To ease a poor lady,
228. And beg her a play-day.
229. So may you be seen
230. No more in the spleen;
231. May Walmsley give wine
232. Like a hearty divine!
233. May Whaley disgrace
234. Dull Daniel's whey-face!
235. And may your three spouses
236. Let you lie at friends' houses!
