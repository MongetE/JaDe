1. LET me thy properties explain:
2. A rotten cabin dropping rain:
3. Chimneys, with scorn rejecting smoke;
4. Stools, tables, chairs, and bedsteads broke.
5. Here elements have lost their uses,
6. Air ripens not, nor earth produces:
7. In vain we make poor Sheelah toil,
8. Fire will not roast, nor water boil.
9. Through all the valleys, hills, and plains,
10. The Goddess Want, in triumph reigns:
11. And her chief officers of state,
12. Sloth, Dirt, and Theft, around her wait.
