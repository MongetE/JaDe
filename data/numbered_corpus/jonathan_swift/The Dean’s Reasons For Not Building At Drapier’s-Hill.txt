1. I will not build on yonder mount;
2. And, should you call me to account,
3. Consulting with myself, I find
4. It was no levity of mind.
5. Whate'er I promised or intended,
6. No fault of mine, the scheme is ended;
7. Nor can you tax me as unsteady,
8. I have a hundred causes ready;
9. All risen since that flattering time,
10. When Drapier's-Hill appear'd in rhyme.
11. I am, as now too late I find,
12. The greatest cully of mankind;
13. The lowest boy in Martin's school
14. May turn and wind me like a fool.
15. How could I form so wild a vision,
16. To seek, in deserts, Fields Elysian?
17. To live in fear, suspicion, variance,
18. With thieves, fanatics, and barbarians?
19. But here my lady will object;
20. Your deanship ought to recollect,
21. That, near the knight of Gosford placed,
22. Whom you allow a man of taste,
23. Your intervals of time to spend
24. With so conversable a friend,
25. It would not signify a pin
26. Whatever climate you were in.
27. 'Tis true, but what advantage comes
28. To me from all a usurer's plums;
29. Though I should see him twice a-day,
30. And am his neighbour 'cross the way:
31. If all my rhetoric must fail
32. To strike him for a pot of ale?
33. Thus, when the learned and the wise
34. Conceal their talents from our eyes,
35. And from deserving friends withhold
36. Their gifts, as misers do their gold;
37. Their knowledge to themselves confined
38. Is the same avarice of mind;
39. Nor makes their conversation better,
40. Than if they never knew a letter.
41. Such is the fate of Gosford's knight,
42. Who keeps his wisdom out of sight;
43. Whose uncommunicative heart
44. Will scarce one precious word impart:
45. Still rapt in speculations deep,
46. His outward senses fast asleep;
47. Who, while I talk, a song will hum,
48. Or with his fingers beat the drum;
49. Beyond the skies transports his mind,
50. And leaves a lifeless corpse behind.
51. But, as for me, who ne'er could clamber high,
52. To understand Malebranche or Cambray;
53. Who send my mind (as I believe) less
54. Than others do, on errands sleeveless;
55. Can listen to a tale humdrum,
56. And with attention read Tom Thumb;
57. My spirits with my body progging,
58. Both hand in hand together jogging;
59. Sunk over head and ears in matter.
60. Nor can of metaphysics smatter;
61. Am more diverted with a quibble
62. Than dream of words intelligible;
63. And think all notions too abstracted
64. Are like the ravings of a crackt head;
65. What intercourse of minds can be
66. Betwixt the knight sublime and me,
67. If when I talk, as talk I must,
68. It is but prating to a bust?
69. Where friendship is by Fate design'd,
70. It forms a union in the mind:
71. But here I differ from the knight
72. In every point, like black and white:
73. For none can say that ever yet
74. We both in one opinion met:
75. Not in philosophy, or ale;
76. In state affairs, or planting kale;
77. In rhetoric, or picking straws;
78. In roasting larks, or making laws;
79. In public schemes, or catching flies;
80. In parliaments, or pudding pies.
81. The neighbours wonder why the knight
82. Should in a country life delight,
83. Who not one pleasure entertains
84. To cheer the solitary scenes:
85. His guests are few, his visits rare;
86. Nor uses time, nor time will spare;
87. Nor rides, nor walks, nor hunts, nor fowls,
88. Nor plays at cards, or dice, or bowls;
89. But seated in an easy-chair,
90. Despises exercise and air.
91. His rural walks he ne'er adorns;
92. Here poor Pomona sits on thorns:
93. And there neglected Flora settles
94. Her bum upon a bed of nettles.
95. Those thankless and officious cares
96. I used to take in friends' affairs,
97. From which I never could refrain,
98. And have been often chid in vain;
99. From these I am recover'd quite,
100. At least in what regards the knight.
101. Preserve his health, his store increase;
102. May nothing interrupt his peace!
103. But now let all his tenants round
104. First milk his cows, and after, pound;
105. Let every cottager conspire
106. To cut his hedges down for fire;
107. The naughty boys about the village
108. His crabs and sloes may freely pillage;
109. He still may keep a pack of knaves
110. To spoil his work, and work by halves;
111. His meadows may be dug by swine,
112. It shall be no concern of mine;
113. For why should I continue still
114. To serve a friend against his will?
