1. There is a gate, we know full well,
2. That stands 'twixt Heaven, and Earth, and Hell,
3. Where many for a passage venture,
4. Yet very few are fond to enter:
5. Although 'tis open night and day,
6. They for that reason shun this way:
7. Both dukes and lords abhor its wood,
8. They can't come near it for their blood.
9. What other way they take to go,
10. Another time I'll let you know.
11. Yet commoners with greatest ease
12. Can find an entrance when they please.
13. The poorest hither march in state
14. (Or they can never pass the gate)
15. Like Roman generals triumphant,
16. And then they take a turn and jump on't,
17. If gravest parsons here advance,
18. They cannot pass before they dance;
19. There's not a soul that does resort here,
20. But strips himself to pay the porter.
