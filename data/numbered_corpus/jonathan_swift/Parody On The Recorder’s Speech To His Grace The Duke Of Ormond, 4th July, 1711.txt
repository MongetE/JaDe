1. THE RECORDER'S SPEECH EXPLAINED BY THE TORIES

2. An ancient metropolis, famous of late
3. For opposing the Church, and for nosing the State,
4. For protecting sedition and rejecting order,
5. Made the following speech by their mouth, the Recorder:
6. First, to tell you the name of this place of renown,
7. Some still call it Dublin, but most Forster's town.

8. THE SPEECH

9. May it please your Grace,
10. We cannot omit this occasion to tell,
11. That we love the Queen's person and government well;
12. Then next, to your Grace we this compliment make,
13. That our worships regard you, but 'tis for her sake:
14. Though our mouth be a Whig, and our head a Dissenter,
15. Yet salute you we must, 'cause you represent her:
16. Nor can we forget, sir, that some of your line
17. Did with mildness and peace in this government shine.
18. But of all your exploits, we'll allow but one fact,
19. That your Grace has procured us a Popery Act.
20. By this you may see that the least of your actions
21. Does conduce still the most to our satisfactions.
22. And lastly, because in the year eighty-eight
23. You did early appear in defence of our right,
24. We give no other proof of your zeal to your Prince;
25. So we freely forget all your services since.
26. It's then only we hope, that whilst you rule o'er us,
27. You'll tread in the steps of King William the glorious,
28. Whom we're always adoring, tho' hand over head,
29. For we owe him allegiance, although he be dead;
30. Which shows that good zeal may be founded in spleen,
31. Since a dead Prince we worship, to lessen the Queen.
32. And as for her Majesty, we will defend her
33. Against our hobgoblin, the Popish Pretender.
34. Our valiant militia will stoutly stand by her,
35. Against the sly Jack, and the sturdy High-flier.
36. She is safe when thus guarded, if Providence bless her,
37. And Hanover's sure to be next her successor.
38. Thus ended the speech, but what heart would not pity
39. His Grace, almost choked with the breath of the City!
