1. As when a beauteous nymph decays,
2. We say she's past her dancing days;
3. So poets lose their feet by time,
4. And can no longer dance in rhyme.
5. Your annual bard had rather chose
6. To celebrate your birth in prose:
7. Yet merry folks, who want by chance
8. A pair to make a country dance,
9. Call the old housekeeper, and get her
10. To fill a place for want of better:
11. While Sheridan is off the hooks,
12. And friend Delany at his books,
13. That Stella may avoid disgrace,
14. Once more the Dean supplies their place.
15. Beauty and wit, too sad a truth!
16. Have always been confined to youth;
17. The god of wit and beauty's queen,
18. He twenty-one and she fifteen,
19. No poet ever sweetly sung,
20. Unless he were, like Phoebus, young;
21. Nor ever nymph inspired to rhyme,
22. Unless, like Venus, in her prime.
23. At fifty-six, if this be true,
24. Am I a poet fit for you?
25. Or, at the age of forty-three,
26. Are you a subject fit for me?
27. Adieu! bright wit, and radiant eyes!
28. You must be grave and I be wise.
29. Our fate in vain we would oppose:
30. But I'll be still your friend in prose:
31. Esteem and friendship to express,
32. Will not require poetic dress;
33. And if the Muse deny her aid
34. To have them sung, they may be said.
35. But, Stella, say, what evil tongue
36. Reports you are no longer young;
37. That Time sits with his scythe to mow
38. Where erst sat Cupid with his bow;
39. That half your locks are turn'd to gray?
40. I'll ne'er believe a word they say.
41. 'Tis true, but let it not be known,
42. My eyes are somewhat dimmish grown;
43. For nature, always in the right,
44. To your decays adapts my sight;
45. And wrinkles undistinguished pass,
46. For I'm ashamed to use a glass:
47. And till I see them with these eyes,
48. Whoever says you have them, lies.
49. No length of time can make you quit
50. Honour and virtue, sense and wit;
51. Thus you may still be young to me,
52. While I can better hear than see.
53. O ne'er may Fortune show her spite,
54. To make me deaf, and mend my sight!
