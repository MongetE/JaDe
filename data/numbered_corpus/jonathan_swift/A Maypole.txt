1. Deprived of root, and branch and rind,
2. Yet flowers I bear of every kind:
3. And such is my prolific power,
4. They bloom in less than half an hour;
5. Yet standers-by may plainly see
6. They get no nourishment from me.
7. My head with giddiness goes round,
8. And yet I firmly stand my ground:
9. All over naked I am seen,
10. And painted like an Indian queen.
11. No couple-beggar in the land
12. E'er joined such numbers hand in hand.
13. I joined them fairly with a ring;
14. Nor can our parson blame the thing.
15. And though no marriage words are spoke,
16. They part not till the ring is broke;
17. Yet hypocrite fanatics cry,
18. I'm but an idol raised on high;
19. And once a weaver in our town,
20. A damned Cromwellian, knocked me down.
21. I lay a prisoner twenty years,
22. And then the jovial cavaliers
23. To their old post restored all three -
24. I mean the church, the king, and me.
