1. From Heaven I fall, though from earth I begin,
2. No lady alive can show such a skin.
3. I'm bright as an angel, and light as a feather,
4. But heavy and dark, when you squeeze me together.
5. Though candour and truth in my aspect I bear,
6. Yet many poor creatures I help to ensnare.
7. Though so much of Heaven appears in my make,
8. The foulest impressions I easily take.
9. My parent and I produce one another,
10. The mother the daughter, the daughter the mother.
