1. This day, whate'er the Fates decree,
2. Shall still be kept with joy by me;
3. This day, then, let us not be told
4. That you are sick, and I grown old,
5. Nor think on our approaching ills,
6. And talk of spectacles and pills;
7. To-morrow will be time enough
8. To hear such mortifying stuff.
9. Yet, since from reason may be brought
10. A better and more pleasing thought,
11. Which can, in spite of all decays,
12. Support a few remaining days:
13. From not the gravest of divines
14. Accept for once some serious lines.
15. Although we now can form no more
16. Long schemes of life, as heretofore;
17. Yet you, while time is running fast,
18. Can look with joy on what is past.
19. Were future happiness and pain
20. A mere contrivance of the brain,
21. As Atheists argue, to entice,
22. And fit their proselytes for vice
23. (The only comfort they propose,
24. To have companions in their woes).
25. Grant this the case, yet sure 'tis hard
26. That virtue, styled its own reward,
27. And by all sages understood
28. To be the chief of human good,
29. Should acting, die, or leave behind
30. Some lasting pleasure in the mind.
31. Which by remembrance will assuage
32. Grief, sickness, poverty, and age;
33. And strongly shoot a radiant dart,
34. To shine through life's declining part.
35. Say, Stella, feel you no content,
36. Reflecting on a life well spent;
37. Your skilful hand employed to save
38. Despairing wretches from the grave;
39. And then supporting with your store,
40. Those whom you dragged from death before?
41. So Providence on mortals waits,
42. Preserving what it first creates,
43. You generous boldness to defend
44. An innocent and absent friend;
45. That courage which can make you just,
46. To merit humbled in the dust;
47. The detestation you express
48. For vice in all its glittering dress:
49. That patience under to torturing pain,
50. Where stubborn stoics would complain.
51. Must these like empty shadows pass,
52. Or forms reflected from a glass?
53. Or mere chimaeras in the mind,
54. That fly, and leave no marks behind?
55. Does not the body thrive and grow
56. By food of twenty years ago?
57. And, had it not been still supplied,
58. It must a thousand times have died.
59. Then, who with reason can maintain
60. That no effects of food remain?
61. And, is not virtue in mankind
62. The nutriment that feeds the mind?
63. Upheld by each good action past,
64. And still continued by the last:
65. Then, who with reason can pretend
66. That all effects of virtue end?
67. Believe me, Stella, when you show
68. That true contempt for things below,
69. Nor prize your life for other ends
70. Than merely to oblige your friends,
71. Your former actions claim their part,
72. And join to fortify your heart.
73. For virtue in her daily race,
74. Like Janus, bears a double face.
75. Look back with joy where she has gone,
76. And therefore goes with courage on.
77. She at your sickly couch will wait,
78. And guide you to a better state.
79. O then, whatever heav'n intends,
80. Take pity on your pitying friends;
81. Nor let your ills affect your mind,
82. To fancy they can be unkind;
83. Me, surely me, you ought to spare,
84. Who gladly would your sufferings share;
85. Or give my scrap of life to you,
86. And think it far beneath your due;
87. You to whose care so oft I owe
88. That I'm alive to tell you so.
