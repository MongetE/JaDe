1. Returning Janus now prepares,
2. For Bec, a new supply of cares,
3. Sent in a bag to Dr. Swift,
4. Who thus displays the new-year's gift.
5. First, this large parcel brings you tidings
6. Of our good Dean's eternal chidings;
7. Of Nelly's pertness, Robin's leasings,
8. And Sheridan's perpetual teazings.
9. This box is cramm'd on every side
10. With Stella's magisterial pride.
11. Behold a cage with sparrows fill'd,
12. First to be fondled, then be kill'd.
13. Now to this hamper I invite you,
14. With six imagined cares to fright you.
15. Here in this bundle Janus sends
16. Concerns by thousands for your friends.
17. And here's a pair of leathern pokes,
18. To hold your cares for other folks.
19. Here from this barrel you may broach
20. A peck of troubles for a coach.
21. This ball of wax your ears will darken,
22. Still to be curious, never hearken.
23. Lest you the town may have less trouble in
24. Bring all your Quilca's cares to Dublin,
25. For which he sends this empty sack;
26. And so take all upon your back.
