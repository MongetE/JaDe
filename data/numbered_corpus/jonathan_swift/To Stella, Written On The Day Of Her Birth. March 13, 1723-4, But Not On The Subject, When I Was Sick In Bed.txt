1. Tormented with incessant pains,
2. Can I devise poetic strains?
3. Time was, when I could yearly pay
4. My verse to Stella's native day:
5. But now unable grown to write,
6. I grieve she ever saw the light.
7. Ungrateful! since to her I owe
8. That I these pains can undergo.
9. She tends me like an humble slave;
10. And, when indecently I rave,
11. When out my brutish passions break,
12. With gall in every word I speak,
13. She with soft speech my anguish cheers,
14. Or melts my passions down with tears;
15. Although 'tis easy to descry
16. She wants assistance more than I;
17. Yet seems to feel my pains alone,
18. And is a stoic in her own.
19. When, among scholars, can we find
20. So soft and yet so firm a mind?
21. All accidents of life conspire
22. To raise up Stella's virtue higher;
23. Or else to introduce the rest
24. Which had been latent in her breast.
25. Her firmness who could e'er have known,
26. Had she not evils of her own?
27. Her kindness who could ever guess,
28. Had not her friends been in distress?
29. Whatever base returns you find
30. From me, dear Stella, still be kind.
31. In your own heart you'll reap the fruit,
32. Though I continue still a brute.
33. But, when I once am out of pain,
34. I promise to be good again;
35. Meantime, your other juster friends
36. Shall for my follies make amends;
37. So may we long continue thus,
38. Admiring you, you pitying us.
