1. I'm up and down, and round about,
2. Yet all the world can't find me out;
3. Though hundreds have employ'd their leisure,
4. They never yet could find my measure.
5. I'm found almost in every garden,
6. Nay, in the compass of a farthing.
7. There's neither chariot, coach, nor mill,
8. Can move an inch except I will.
