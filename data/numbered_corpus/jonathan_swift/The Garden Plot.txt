1. When Naboth's vineyard look'd so fine,
2. The king cried out, 'Would this were mine!'
3. And yet no reason could prevail
4. To bring the owner to a sale.
5. Jezebel saw, with haughty pride,
6. How Ahab grieved to be denied;
7. And thus accosted him with scorn:
8. 'Shall Naboth make a monarch mourn?
9. A king, and weep! The ground's your own;
10. I'll vest the garden in the crown.'
11. With that she hatch'd a plot, and made
12. Poor Naboth answer with his head;
13. And when his harmless blood was spilt,
14. The ground became his forfeit guilt.
