1. Spite of Dutch friends and English foes,
2. Poor Britain shall have peace at last:
3. Holland got towns, and we got blows;
4. But Dunkirk's ours, we'll hold it fast.
5. We have got it in a string,
6. And the Whigs may all go swing,
7. For among good friends I love to be plain;
8. All their false deluded hopes
9. Will, or ought to end in ropes;
10. 'But the Queen shall enjoy her own again.'


11. Sunderland's run out of his wits,
12. And Dismal double Dismal looks;
13. Wharton can only swear by fits,
14. And strutting Hal is off the hooks;
15. Old Godolphin, full of spleen,
16. Made false moves, and lost his Queen:
17. Harry look'd fierce, and shook his ragged mane:
18. But a Prince of high renown
19. Swore he'd rather lose a crown,
20. 'Than the Queen should enjoy her own again.'

21. Our merchant-ships may cut the line,
22. And not be snapt by privateers.
23. And commoners who love good wine
24. Will drink it now as well as peers:
25. Landed men shall have their rent,
26. Yet our stocks rise cent, per cent.
27. The Dutch from hence shall no more millions drain:
28. We'll bring on us no more debts,
29. Nor with bankrupts fill gazettes;
30. 'And the Queen shall enjoy her own again.'

31. The towns we took ne'er did us good:
32. What signified the French to beat?
33. We spent our money and our blood,
34. To make the Dutchmen proud and great:
35. But the Lord of Oxford swears,
36. Dunkirk never shall be theirs.
37. The Dutch-hearted Whigs may rail and complain;
38. But true Englishmen may fill
39. A good health to General Hill:
40. 'For the Queen now enjoys her own again.'
