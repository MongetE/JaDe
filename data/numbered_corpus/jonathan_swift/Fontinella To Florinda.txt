1. When on my bosom thy bright eyes,
2. Florinda, dart their heavenly beams,
3. I feel not the least love surprise,
4. Yet endless tears flow down in streams;
5. There's nought so beautiful in thee,
6. But you may find the same in me.


7. The lilies of thy skin compare;
8. In me you see them full as white:
9. The roses of your cheeks, I dare
10. Affirm, can't glow to more delight.
11. Then, since I show as fine a face,
12. Can you refuse a soft embrace?


13. Ah! lovely nymph, thou'rt in thy prime!
14. And so am I, while thou art here;
15. But soon will come the fatal time,
16. When all we see shall disappear.
17. 'Tis mine to make a just reflection,
18. And yours to follow my direction.


19. Then catch admirers while you may;
20. Treat not your lovers with disdain;
21. For time with beauty flies away,
22. And there is no return again.
23. To you the sad account I bring,
24. Life's autumn has no second spring.
