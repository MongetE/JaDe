1. While, Stella, to your lasting praise
2. The Muse her annual tribute pays,
3. While I assign myself a task
4. Which you expect, but scorn to ask;
5. If I perform this task with pain,
6. Let me of partial fate complain;
7. You every year the debt enlarge,
8. I grow less equal to the charge:
9. In you each virtue brighter shines,
10. But my poetic vein declines;
11. My harp will soon in vain be strung,
12. And all your virtues left unsung.
13. For none among the upstart race
14. Of poets dare assume my place;
15. Your worth will be to them unknown,
16. They must have Stellas of their own;
17. And thus, my stock of wit decay'd,
18. I dying leave the debt unpaid,
19. Unless Delany, as my heir,
20. Will answer for the whole arrear.
