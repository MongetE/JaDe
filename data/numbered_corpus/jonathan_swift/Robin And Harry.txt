1. Robin to beggars with a curse,
2. Throws the last shilling in his purse;
3. And when the coachman comes for pay,
4. The rogue must call another day.
5. Grave Harry, when the poor are pressing
6. Gives them a penny and God's blessing;
7. But always careful of the main,
8. With twopence left, walks home in rain.
9. Robin from noon to night will prate,
10. Run out in tongue, as in estate;
11. And, ere a twelvemonth and a day,
12. Will not have one new thing to say.
13. Much talking is not Harry's vice;
14. He need not tell a story twice:
15. And, if he always be so thrifty,
16. His fund may last to five-and-fifty.
17. It so fell out that cautious Harry,
18. As soldiers use, for love must marry,
19. And, with his dame, the ocean cross'd;
20. (All for Love, or the World well Lost!)
21. Repairs a cabin gone to ruin,
22. Just big enough to shelter two in;
23. And in his house, if anybody come,
24. Will make them welcome to his modicum
25. Where Goody Julia milks the cows,
26. And boils potatoes for her spouse;
27. Or darns his hose, or mends his breeches,
28. While Harry's fencing up his ditches.
29. Robin, who ne'er his mind could fix,
30. To live without a coach-and-six,
31. To patch his broken fortunes, found
32. A mistress worth five thousand pound;
33. Swears he could get her in an hour,
34. If gaffer Harry would endow her;
35. And sell, to pacify his wrath,
36. A birth-right for a mess of broth.
37. Young Harry, as all Europe knows,
38. Was long the quintessence of beaux;
39. But, when espoused, he ran the fate
40. That must attend the married state;
41. From gold brocade and shining armour,
42. Was metamorphosed to a farmer;
43. His grazier's coat with dirt besmear'd;
44. Nor twice a-week will shave his beard.
45. Old Robin, all his youth a sloven,
46. At fifty-two, when he grew loving,
47. Clad in a coat of paduasoy,
48. A flaxen wig, and waistcoat gay,
49. Powder'd from shoulder down to flank,
50. In courtly style addresses Frank;
51. Twice ten years older than his wife,
52. Is doom'd to be a beau for life;
53. Supplying those defects by dress,
54. Which I must leave the world to guess.
