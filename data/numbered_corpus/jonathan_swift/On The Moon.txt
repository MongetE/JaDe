1. I with borrow'd silver shine
2. What you see is none of mine.
3. First I show you but a quarter,
4. Like the bow that guards the Tartar:
5. Then the half, and then the whole,
6. Ever dancing round the pole.


7. What will raise your admiration,
8. I am not one of God's creation,
9. But sprung, (and I this truth maintain,)
10. Like Pallas, from my father's brain.
11. And after all, I chiefly owe
12. My beauty to the shades below.
13. Most wondrous forms you see me wear,
14. A man, a woman, lion, bear,
15. A fish, a fowl, a cloud, a field,
16. All figures Heaven or earth can yield;
17. Like Daphne sometimes in a tree;
18. Yet am not one of all you see.
