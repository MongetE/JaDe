1. Around the house the flakes fly faster,
2. And all the berries now are gone
3. From holly and cotoneaster
4. Around the house. The flakes fly!--faster
5. Shutting indoors that crumb-outcaster
6. We used to see upon the lawn
7. Around the house. The flakes fly faster,
8. And all the berries now are gone!
