2. Everybody else, then, going,

8. There is an air of blankness
9. In the street and the littered spaces;
10. Thoroughfare, steeple, bridge and highway

15. As I wait alone where the fair was?
16. Into the clammy and numbing night-fog
17. Whence they entered hither.
18. Soon one more goes thither!
