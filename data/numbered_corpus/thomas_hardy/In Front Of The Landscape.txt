1. Plunging and labouring on in a tide of visions,
2. Dolorous and dear,
3. Forward I pushed my way as amid waste waters
4. Stretching around,
5. Through whose eddies there glimmered the customed landscape
6. Yonder and near,
7. Blotted to feeble mist. And the coomb and the upland
8. Foliage-crowned,
9. Ancient chalk-pit, milestone, rills in the grass-flat
10. Stroked by the light,
11. Seemed but a ghost-like gauze, and no substantial
12. Meadow or mound.
13. What were the infinite spectacles bulking foremost
14. Under my sight,
15. Hindering me to discern my paced advancement
16. Lengthening to miles;
17. What were the re-creations killing the daytime
18. As by the night?
19. O they were speechful faces, gazing insistent,
20. Some as with smiles,
21. Some as with slow-born tears that brinily trundled
22. Over the wrecked
23. Cheeks that were fair in their flush-time, ash now with anguish,
24. Harrowed by wiles.
25. Yes, I could see them, feel them, hear them, address them -
26. Halo-bedecked -
27. And, alas, onwards, shaken by fierce unreason,
28. Rigid in hate,
29. Smitten by years-long wryness born of misprision,
30. Dreaded, suspect.
31. Then there would breast me shining sights, sweet seasons
32. Further in date;
33. Instruments of strings with the tenderest passion
34. Vibrant, beside
35. Lamps long extinguished, robes, cheeks, eyes with the earth's crust
36. Now corporate.
37. Also there rose a headland of hoary aspect
38. Gnawed by the tide,
39. Frilled by the nimb of the morning as two friends stood there
40. Guilelessly glad -
41. Wherefore they knew not - touched by the fringe of an ecstasy
42. Scantly descried.
43. Later images too did the day unfurl me,
44. Shadowed and sad,
45. Clay cadavers of those who had shared in the dramas,
46. Laid now at ease,
47. Passions all spent, chiefest the one of the broad brow
48. Sepulture-clad.
49. So did beset me scenes miscalled of the bygone,
50. Over the leaze,
51. Past the clump, and down to where lay the beheld ones;
52. - Yea, as the rhyme
53. Sung by the sea-swell, so in their pleading dumbness
54. Captured me these.
55. For, their lost revisiting manifestations
56. In their own time
57. Much had I slighted, caring not for their purport,
58. Seeing behind
59. Things more coveted, reckoned the better worth calling
60. Sweet, sad, sublime.
61. Thus do they now show hourly before the intenser
62. Stare of the mind
63. As they were ghosts avenging their slights by my bypast
64. Body-borne eyes,
65. Show, too, with fuller translation than rested upon them
66. As living kind.
67. Hence wag the tongues of the passing people, saying
68. In their surmise,
69. 'Ah - whose is this dull form that perambulates, seeing nought
70. Round him that looms
71. Whithersoever his footsteps turn in his farings,
72. Save a few tombs?'
