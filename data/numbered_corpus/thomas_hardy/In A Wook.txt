1. PALE beech and pine-tree blue,
2. Set in one clay,
3. Bough to bough cannot you
4. Bide out your day?
5. When the rains skim and skip,
6. Why mar sweet comradeship,
7. Blighting with poison-drip
8. Neighborly spray?

9. Heart-halt and spirit-lame,
10. City-opprest,
11. Unto this wood I came
12. As to a nest;
13. Dreaming that sylvan peace
14. Offered the harrowed ease--
15. Nature a soft release
16. From men's unrest.

17. But, having entered in,
18. Great growths and small
19. Show them to men akin--
20. Combatants all!
21. Sycamore shoulders oak,
22. Bines the slim sapling yoke,
23. Ivy-spun halters choke
24. Elms stout and tall.

25. Touches from ash, O wych,
26. Sting you like scorn!
27. You, too, brave hollies, twitch
28. Sidelong from thorn.
29. Even the rank poplars bear
30. Illy a rival's air,
31. Cankering in black despair
32. If overborne.

33. Since, then, no grace I find
34. Taught me of trees,
35. Turn I back to my kind,
36. Worthy as these.
37. There at least smiles abound,
38. There discourse trills around,
39. There, now and then, are found
40. Life-loyalties.
