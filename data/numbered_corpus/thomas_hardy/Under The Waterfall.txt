1. 'Whenever I plunge my arm, like this,
2. In a basin of water, I never miss
3. The sweet sharp sense of a fugitive day
4. Fetched back from its thickening shroud of gray.
5. Hence the only prime
6. And real love-rhyme
7. That I know by heart,
8. And that leaves no smart,
9. Is the purl of a little valley fall
10. About three spans wide and two spans tall
11. Over a table of solid rock,
12. And into a scoop of the self-same block;
13. The purl of a runlet that never ceases
14. In stir of kingdoms, in wars, in peaces;
15. With a hollow boiling voice it speaks
16. And has spoken since hills were turfless peaks.'

17. 'And why gives this the only prime
18. Idea to you of a real love-rhyme?
19. And why does plunging your arm in a bowl
20. Full of spring water, bring throbs to your soul?'

21. 'Well, under the fall, in a crease of the stone,
22. Though precisely where none ever has known,
23. Jammed darkly, nothing to show how prized,
24. And by now with its smoothness opalized,
25. Is a grinking glass:
26. For, down that pass
27. My lover and I
28. Walked under a sky
29. Of blue with a leaf-wove awning of green,
30. In the burn of August, to paint the scene,
31. And we placed our basket of fruit and wine
32. By the runlet's rim, where we sat to dine;
33. And when we had drunk from the glass together,
34. Arched by the oak-copse from the weather,
35. I held the vessel to rinse in the fall,
36. Where it slipped, and it sank, and was past recall,
37. Though we stooped and plumbed the little abyss
38. With long bared arms. There the glass still is.
39. And, as said, if I thrust my arm below
40. Cold water in a basin or bowl, a throe
41. From the past awakens a sense of that time,
42. And the glass we used, and the cascade's rhyme.
43. The basin seems the pool, and its edge
44. The hard smooth face of the brook-side ledge,
45. And the leafy pattern of china-ware
46. The hanging plants that were bathing there.

47. 'By night, by day, when it shines or lours,
48. There lies intact that chalice of ours,
49. And its presence adds to the rhyme of love
50. Persistently sung by the fall above.
51. No lip has touched it since his and mine
52. In turns therefrom sipped lovers' wine.'
