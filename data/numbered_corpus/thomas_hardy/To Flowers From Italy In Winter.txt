1. Sunned in the South, and here to-day;
2. --If all organic things
3. Be sentient, Flowers, as some men say,
4. What are your ponderings?

5. How can you stay, nor vanish quite
6. From this bleak spot of thorn,
7. And birch, and fir, and frozen white
8. Expanse of the forlorn?

9. Frail luckless exiles hither brought!
10. Your dust will not regain
11. Old sunny haunts of Classic thought
12. When you shall waste and wane;

13. But mix with alien earth, be lit
14. With frigid Boreal flame,
15. And not a sign remain in it
16. To tell men whence you came.
