1. Whence comes Solace?--Not from seeing
2. What is doing, suffering, being,
3. Not from noting Life's conditions,
4. Nor from heeding Time's monitions;
5. But in cleaving to the Dream,
6. And in gazing at the gleam
7. Whereby gray things golden seem.

9. Thus do I this heyday, holding
10. Shadows but as lights unfolding,
11. As no specious show this moment
12. With its irised embowment;
13. But as nothing other than
14. Part of a benignant plan;
15. Proof that earth was made for man.
