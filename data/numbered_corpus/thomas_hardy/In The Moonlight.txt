1. "O lonely workman, standing there
2. In a dream, why do you stare and stare
3. At her grave, as no other grave where there?"

4. "If your great gaunt eyes so importune
5. Her soul by the shine of this corpse-cold moon,
6. Maybe you'll raise her phantom soon!"

7. "Why, fool, it is what I would rather see
8. Than all the living folk there be;
9. But alas, there is no such joy for me!"

10. "Ah - she was one you loved, no doubt,
11. Through good and evil, through rain and drought,
12. And when she passed, all your sun went out?"

13. "Nay: she was the woman I did not love,
14. Whom all the other were ranked above,
15. Whom during her life I thought nothing of."
