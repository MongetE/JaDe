1. I

2. Its roots are bristling in the air
3. Like some mad Earth-god's spiny hair;
4. The loud south-wester's swell and yell
5. Smote it at midnight, and it fell.
6. Thus ends the tree
7. Where Some One sat with me.

8. II

9. Its boughs, which none but darers trod,
10. A child may step on from the sod,
11. And twigs that earliest met the dawn
12. Are lit the last upon the lawn.
13. Cart off the tree
14. Beneath whose trunk sat we!

15. III

16. Yes, there we sat: she cooed content,
17. And bats ringed round, and daylight went;
18. The gnarl, our seat, is wrenched and sunk,
19. Prone that queer pocket in the trunk
20. Where lay the key
21. To her pale mystery.

22. IV

23. "Years back, within this pocket-hole
24. I found, my Love, a hurried scrawl
25. Meant not for me," at length said I;
26. "I glanced thereat, and let it lie:
27. The words were three -
28. 'Beloved, I agree.'

29. V

30. "Who placed it here; to what request
31. It gave assent, I never guessed.
32. Some prayer of some hot heart, no doubt,
33. To some coy maiden hereabout,
34. Just as, maybe,
35. With you, Sweet Heart, and me."

36. VI

37. She waited, till with quickened breath
38. She spoke, as one who banisheth
39. Reserves that lovecraft heeds so well,
40. To ease some mighty wish to tell:
41. "'Twas I," said she,
42. "Who wrote thus clinchingly.

43. VII

44. "My lover's wife--aye, wife!--knew nought
45. Of what we felt, and bore, and thought . . .
46. He'd said: 'I wed with thee or die:
47. She stands between, 'tis true. But why?
48. Do thou agree,
49. And--she shalt cease to be.'

50. VIII

51. "How I held back, how love supreme
52. Involved me madly in his scheme
53. Why should I say? . . . I wrote assent
54. (You found it hid) to his intent . . .
55. She--DIED . . . But he
56. Came not to wed with me.

57. IX

58. "O shrink not, Love!--Had these eyes seen
59. But once thine own, such had not been!
60. But we were strangers . . . Thus the plot
61. Cleared passion's path.--Why came he not
62. To wed with me? . . .
63. He wived the gibbet-tree."

64. X

65. - Under that oak of heretofore
66. Sat Sweetheart mine with me no more:
67. By many a Fiord, and Strom, and Fleuve
68. Have I since wandered . . . Soon, for love,
69. Distraught went she -
70. 'Twas said for love of me.
