1. 'More than half my life long
2. Did they weigh me falsely, to my bitter wrong,
3. But they all have shrunk away into the silence
4. Like a lost song.


5. 'And the day has dawned and come
6. For forgiveness, when the past may hold it dumb
7. On the once reverberate words of hatred uttered
8. Half in delirium….


9. 'With folded lips and hands
10. They lie and wait what next the Will commands,
11. And doubtless think, if think they can: 'Let discord
12. Sink with Life's sands!'


13. 'By these late years their names,
14. Their virtues, their hereditary claims,
15. May be as near defacement at their grave-place
16. As are their fames.'


17. - Such thoughts bechanced to seize
18. A traveller's mind - a man of memories -
19. As he set foot within the western city
20. Where had died these


21. Who in their lifetime deemed
22. Him their chief enemy - one whose brain had schemed
23. To get their dingy greatness deeplier dingied
24. And disesteemed.


25. So, sojourning in their town,
26. He mused on them and on their once renown, said,
27. 'I'll seek their resting-place to-morrow
28. Ere I lie down,


29. 'And end, lest I forget,
30. Those ires of many years that I regret,
31. Renew their names, that men may see some liegeness
32. Is left them yet.'


33. Duly next day he went
34. And sought the church he had known them to frequent,
35. And wandered in the precincts, set on eyeing
36. Where they lay pent,


37. Till by remembrance led
38. He stood at length beside their slighted bed,
39. Above which, truly, scarce a line or letter
40. Could now be read.


41. 'Thus years obliterate
42. Their graven worth, their chronicle, their date!
43. At once I'll garnish and revive the record
44. Of their past state,


45. 'That still the sage may say
46. In pensive progress here where they decay,
47. 'This stone records a luminous line whose talents
48. Told in their day.''


49. While speaking thus he turned,
50. For a form shadowed where they lay inurned,
51. And he beheld a stranger in foreign vesture,
52. And tropic-burned.


53. 'Sir, I am right pleased to view
54. That ancestors of mine should interest you,
55. For I have come of purpose here to trace them….
56. They are time-worn, true,


57. 'But that's a fault, at most,
58. Sculptors can cure. On the Pacific coast
59. I have vowed for long that relics of my forbears
60. I'd trace ere lost,


61. 'And hitherward I come,
62. Before this same old Time shall strike me numb,
63. To carry it out.' - 'Strange, this is!' said the other;
64. 'What mind shall plumb


65. 'Coincident design!
66. Though these my father's enemies were and mine,
67. I nourished a like purpose - to restore them
68. Each letter and line.'


69. 'Such magnanimity
70. Is now not needed, sir; for you will see
71. That since I am here, a thing like this is, plainly,
72. Best done by me.'


73. The other bowed, and left,
74. Crestfallen in sentiment, as one bereft
75. Of some fair object he had been moved to cherish,
76. By hands more deft.


77. And as he slept that night
78. The phantoms of the ensepulchred stood upright
79. Before him, trembling that he had set him seeking
80. Their charnel-site.


81. And, as unknowing his ruth,
82. Asked as with terrors founded not on truth
83. Why he should want them. 'Ha,' they hollowly hackered,
84. 'You come, forsooth,


85. 'By stealth to obliterate
86. Our graven worth, our chronicle, our date,
87. That our descendant may not gild the record
88. Of our past state,


89. 'And that no sage may say
90. In pensive progress near where we decay:
91. 'This stone records a luminous line whose talents
92. Told in their day.''


93. Upon the morrow he went
94. And to that town and churchyard never bent
95. His ageing footsteps till, some twelvemonths onward,
96. An accident


97. Once more detained him there;
98. And, stirred by hauntings, he must needs repair
99. To where the tomb was. Lo, it stood still wasting
100. In no man's care.


101. 'The travelled man you met
102. The last time,' said the sexton, 'has not yet
103. Appeared again, though wealth he had in plenty.
104. - Can he forget?


105. 'The architect was hired
106. And came here on smart summons as desired,
107. But never the descendent came to tell him
108. What he required.'


109. And so the tomb remained
110. Untouched, untended, crumbling, weather-stained,
111. And though the one-time foe was fain to right it
112. He still refrained.


113. 'I'll set about it when
114. I am sure he'll come no more. Best wait till then.'
115. But so it was that never the stranger entered
116. That city again.


117. And the well-meaner died
118. While waiting tremulously unsatisfied
119. That no return of the family's foreign scion
120. Would still betide.


121. And many years slid by,
122. And active church-restorers cast their eye
123. Upon the ancient garth and hoary building
124. The tomb stood nigh.


125. And when they had scraped each wall,
126. Pulled out the stately pews, and smartened all,
127. 'It will be well,' declared the spruce church-warden,
128. 'To overhaul


129. 'And broaden this path where shown;
130. Nothing prevents it but an old tombstone
131. Pertaining to a family forgotten,
132. Of deeds unknown.


133. 'Their names can scarce be read,
134. Depend on't, all who care for them are dead.'
135. So went the tomb, whose shards were as path-paving
136. Distributed.


137. Over it and about
138. Men's footsteps beat, and wind and waterspout,
139. Until the names, aforetime gnawed by weathers,
140. Were quite worn out.


141. So that no sage can say
142. In pensive progress near where they decay,
143. 'This stone records a luminous line whose talents
144. Told in their day.'
