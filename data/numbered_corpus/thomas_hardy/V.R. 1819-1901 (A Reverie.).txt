1. Moments the mightiest pass calendared,
2. And when the Absolute
3. In backward Time outgave the deedful word
4. Whereby all life is stirred:
5. "Let one be born and throned whose mould shall constitute
6. The norm of every royal-reckoned attribute,"
7. No mortal knew or heard.
8. But in due days the purposed Life outshone -
9. Serene, sagacious, free;
10. --Her waxing seasons bloomed with deeds well done,
11. And the world's heart was won . . .
12. Yet may the deed of hers most bright in eyes to be
13. Lie hid from ours--as in the All-One's thought lay she -
14. Till ripening years have run.
