1. I was not he-the man
2. Who used to pilgrim to your gate,
3. At whose smart step you grew elate,
4. And rosed, as maidens can,
5. For a brief span.

6. It was not I who sang
7. Beside the keys you touched so true
8. With note-bent eyes, as if with you
9. It counted not whence sprang
10. The voice that rang . . .

11. Yet though my destiny
12. It was to miss your early sweet,
13. You still, when turned to you my feet,
14. Had sweet enough to be
15. A prize for me!
