1. I

2. Here's the mould of a musical bird long passed from light,
3. Which over the earth before man came was winging;
4. There's a contralto voice I heard last night,
5. That lodges with me still in its sweet singing.

6. II

7. Such a dream is Time that the coo of this ancient bird
8. Has perished not, but is blent, or will be blending
9. Mid visionless wilds of space with the voice that I heard,
10. In the full-fuged song of the universe unending.
