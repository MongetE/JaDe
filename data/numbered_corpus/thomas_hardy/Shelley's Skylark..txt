1. Somewhere afield here something lies
2. In Earth's oblivious eyeless trust
3. That moved a poet to prophecies -
4. A pinch of unseen, unguarded dust

5. The dust of the lark that Shelley heard,
6. And made immortal through times to be; -
7. Though it only lived like another bird,
8. And knew not its immortality.

9. Lived its meek life; then, one day, fell -
10. A little ball of feather and bone;
11. And how it perished, when piped farewell,
12. And where it wastes, are alike unknown.

13. Maybe it rests in the loam I view,
14. Maybe it throbs in a myrtle's green,
15. Maybe it sleeps in the coming hue
16. Of a grape on the slopes of yon inland scene.

17. Go find it, faeries, go and find
18. That tiny pinch of priceless dust,
19. And bring a casket silver-lined,
20. And framed of gold that gems encrust;

21. And we will lay it safe therein,
22. And consecrate it to endless time;
23. For it inspired a bard to win
24. Ecstatic heights in thought and rhyme.
