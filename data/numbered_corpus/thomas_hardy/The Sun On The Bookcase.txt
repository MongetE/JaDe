1. Once more the cauldron of the sun
2. Smears the bookcase with winy red,
3. And here my page is, and there my bed,
4. And the apple-tree shadows travel along.
5. Soon their intangible track will be run,
6. And dusk grow strong
7. And they have fled.

8. Yes: now the boiling ball is gone,
9. And I have wasted another day....
10. But wasted--wasted, do I say?
11. Is it a waste to have imagined one
12. Beyond the hills there, who, anon,
13. My great deeds done,
14. Will be mine alway?
