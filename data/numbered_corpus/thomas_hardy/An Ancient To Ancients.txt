1. Where once we danced, where once we sang,
2. Gentlemen,
3. The floors are sunken, cobwebs hang,
4. And cracks creep; worms have fed upon
5. The doors. Yea, sprightlier times were then
6. Than now, with harps and tabrets gone,
7. Gentlemen!

8. Where once we rowed, where once we sailed,
9. Gentlemen,
10. And damsels took the tiller, veiled
11. Against too strong a stare (God wot
12. Their fancy, then or anywhen!)
13. Upon that shore we are clean forgot,
14. Gentlemen!

15. We have lost somewhat of that, afar and near,
16. Gentlemen,
17. The thinning of our ranks each year
18. Affords a hint we are nigh undone,
19. That shall not be ever again
20. The marked of many, loved of one,
21. Gentlemen.
22. In dance the polka hit our wish,
23. Gentlemen,
24. The paced quadrille, the spry schottische,
25. "Sir Roger."--And in opera spheres
26. The "Girl" (the famed "Bohemian"),
27. And "Trovatore" held the ears,
28. Gentlemen.
29. This season's paintings do not please,
30. Gentlemen
31. Like Etty, Mulready, Maclise;
32. Throbbing romance had waned and wanned;
33. No wizard wields the witching pen
34. Of Bulwer, Scott, Dumas, and Sand,
35. Gentlemen.
36. The bower we shrined to Tennyson,
37. Gentlemen,
38. Is roof-wrecked; damps there drip upon
39. Sagged seats, the creeper-nails are rust,
40. The spider is sole denizen;
41. Even she who voiced those rhymes is dust,
42. Gentlemen!

43. We who met sunrise sanguine-souled,
44. Gentlemen,
45. Are wearing weary. We are old;
46. These younger press; we feel our rout
47. Is imminent to AÃ¯des' den,--
48. That evening shades are stretching out,
49. Gentlemen!

50. And yet, though ours be failing frames,
51. Gentlemen,
52. So were some others' history names,
53. Who trode their track light-limbed and fast
54. As these youth, and not alien
55. From enterprise, to their long last,
56. Gentlemen.
57. Sophocles, Plato, Socrates,
58. Gentlemen,
59. Pythagoras, Thucydides,
60. Herodotus, and Homer,--yea,
61. Clement, Augustin, Origen,
62. Burnt brightlier towards their setting-day,
63. Gentlemen.
64. And ye, red-lipped and smooth-browed; list,
65. Gentlemen;
66. Much is there waits you we have missed;
67. Much lore we leave you worth the knowing,
68. Much, much has lain outside our ken;
69. Nay, rush not: time serves: we are going,
70. Gentlemen.
