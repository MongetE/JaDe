1. I rose up as my custom is
2. On the eve of All-Souls' day,
3. And left my grave for an hour or so
4. To call on those I used to know
5. Before I passed away.

6. I visited my former Love
7. As she lay by her husband's side;
8. I asked her if life pleased her, now
9. She was rid of a poet wrung in brow,
10. And crazed with the ills he eyed;

11. Who used to drag her here and there
12. Wherever his fancies led,
13. And point out pale phantasmal things,
14. And talk of vain vague purposings
15. That she discredited.

16. She was quite civil, and replied,
17. 'Old comrade, is that you?
18. Well, on the whole, I like my life. -
19. I know I swore I'd be no wife,
20. But what was I to do?

21. 'You see, of all men for my sex
22. A poet is the worst;
23. Women are practical, and they
24. Crave the wherewith to pay their way,
25. And slake their social thirst.

26. 'You were a poet - quite the ideal
27. That we all love awhile:
28. But look at this man snoring here -
29. He's no romantic chanticleer,
30. Yet keeps me in good style.

31. 'He makes no quest into my thoughts,
32. But a poet wants to know
33. What one has felt from earliest days,
34. Why one thought not in other ways,
35. And one's Loves of long ago.'

36. Her words benumbed my fond frail ghost;
37. The nightmares neighed from their stalls,
38. The vampires screeched, the harpies flew,
39. And under the dim dawn I withdrew
40. To Death's inviolate halls.
