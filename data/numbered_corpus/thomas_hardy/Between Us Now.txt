1. Between us now and here--
2. Two thrown together
3. Who are not wont to wear
4. Life's flushest feather--

5. Who see the scenes slide past,
6. The daytimes dimming fast,
7. Let there be truth at last,
8. Even if despair.

9. So thoroughly and long
10. Have you now known me,
11. So real in faith and strong
12. Have I now shown me,
13. That nothing needs disguise
14. Further in any wise,
15. Or asks or justifies
16. A guarded tongue.

17. Face unto face, then, say,
18. Eyes my own meeting,
19. Is your heart far away,
20. Or with mine beating?
21. When false things are brought low,
22. And swift things have grown slow,
23. Feigning like froth shall go,
24. Faith be for aye.
