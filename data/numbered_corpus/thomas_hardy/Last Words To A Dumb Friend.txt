1. Pet was never mourned as you,
2. Purrer of the spotless hue,
3. Plumy tail, and wistful gaze
4. While you humoured our queer ways,
5. Or outshrilled your morning call
6. Up the stairs and through the hall -
7. Foot suspended in its fall -
8. While, expectant, you would stand
9. Arched, to meet the stroking hand;
10. Till your way you chose to wend
11. Yonder, to your tragic end.

12. Never another pet for me!
13. Let your place all vacant be;
14. Better blankness day by day
15. Than companion torn away.
16. Better bid his memory fade,
17. Better blot each mark he made,
18. Selfishly escape distress
19. By contrived forgetfulness,
20. Than preserve his prints to make
21. Every morn and eve an ache.

22. From the chair whereon he sat
23. Sweep his fur, nor wince thereat;
24. Rake his little pathways out
25. Mid the bushes roundabout;
26. Smooth away his talons’ mark
27. From the claw-worn pine-tree bark,
28. Where he climbed as dusk embrowned,
29. Waiting us who loitered round.

30. Strange it is this speechless thing,
31. Subject to our mastering,
32. Subject for his life and food
33. To our gift, and time, and mood;
34. Timid pensioner of us Powers,
35. His existence ruled by ours,
36. Should - by crossing at a breath
37. Into safe and shielded death,
38. By the merely taking hence
39. Of his insignificance -
40. Loom as largened to the sense,
41. Shape as part, above man’s will,
42. Of the Imperturbable.

43. As a prisoner, flight debarred,
44. Exercising in a yard,
45. Still retain I, troubled, shaken,
46. Mean estate, by him forsaken;
47. And this home, which scarcely took
48. Impress from his little look,
49. By his faring to the Dim
50. Grows all eloquent of him.

51. Housemate, I can think you still
52. Bounding to the window-sill,
53. Over which I vaguely see
54. Your small mound beneath the tree,
55. Showing in the autumn shade
56. That you moulder where you played.
