1. Clouds spout upon her
2. Their waters amain
3. In ruthless disdain, -
4. Her who but lately
5. Had shivered with pain
6. As at touch of dishonour
7. If there had lit on her
8. So coldly, so straightly
9. Such arrows of rain:

10. One who to shelter
11. Her delicate head
12. Would quicken and quicken
13. Each tentative tread
14. If drops chanced to pelt her
15. That summertime spills
16. In dust-paven rills
17. When thunder-clouds thicken
18. And birds close their bills.

19. Would that I lay there
20. And she were housed here!
21. Or better, together
22. Were folded away there
23. Exposed to one weather
24. We both, - who would stray there
25. When sunny the day there,
26. Or evening was clear
27. At the prime of the year.

28. Soon will be growing
29. Green blades from her mound,
30. And daisies be showing
31. Like stars on the ground,
32. Till she form part of them -
33. Ay - the sweet heart of them,
34. Loved beyond measure
35. With a child's pleasure
36. All her life's round.
