1. (Durlston Head)


2. Lend me an ear
3. While I read you here
4. A page from your history,
5. Old cliffâ€”not known
6. To your solid stone,
7. Yet yours inseparably.

8. Near to your crown
9. There once sat down
10. A silent listless pair;
11. And the sunset ended,
12. And dark descended,
13. And still the twain sat there.

14. Past your jutting head
15. Then a line-ship sped,
16. Lit brightly as a city;
17. And she sobbed: 'There goes
18. A man who knows
19. I am his, beyond God's pity! '

20. He slid apart
21. Who had thought her heart
22. His own, and not aboard
23. A bark, sea-bound....
24. That night they found
25. Between them lay a sword.
