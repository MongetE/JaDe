1. "Men know but little more than we,
2. Who count us least of things terrene,
3. How happy days are made to be!

4. "Of such strange tidings what think ye,
5. O birds in brown that peck and preen?
6. Men know but little more than we!

7. "When I was borne from yonder tree
8. In bonds to them, I hoped to glean
9. How happy days are made to be,

10. "And want and wailing turned to glee;
11. Alas, despite their mighty mien
12. Men know but little more than we!

13. "They cannot change the Frost's decree,
14. They cannot keep the skies serene;
15. How happy days are made to be

16. "Eludes great Man's sagacity
17. No less than ours, O tribes in treen!
18. Men know but little more than we
19. How happy days are made to be."
