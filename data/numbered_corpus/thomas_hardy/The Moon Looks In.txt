1. I

2. I have risen again,
3. And awhile survey
4. By my chilly ray
5. Through your window-pane
6. Your upturned face,
7. As you think, 'Ah - she
8. Now dreams of me
9. In her distant place!'

10. II

11. I pierce her blind
12. In her far-off home:
13. She fixes a comb,
14. And says in her mind,
15. 'I start in an hour;
16. Whom shall I meet?
17. Won't the men be sweet,
18. And the women sour!'
