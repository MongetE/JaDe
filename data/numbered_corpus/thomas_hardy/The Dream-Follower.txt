1. A dream of mine flew over the mead
2. To the halls where my old Love reigns;
3. And it drew me on to follow its lead:
4. And I stood at her window-panes;

5. And I saw but a thing of flesh and bone
6. Speeding on to its cleft in the clay;
7. And my dream was scared, and expired on a moan,
8. And I whitely hastened away.
