1. These numbered cliffs and gnarls of masonry
2. Outskeleton Time's central city, Rome;
3. Whereof each arch, entablature, and dome
4. Lies bare in all its gaunt anatomy.

5. And cracking frieze and rotten metope
6. Express, as though they were an open tome
7. Top-lined with caustic monitory gnome;
8. "Dunces, Learn here to spell Humanity!"

9. And yet within these ruins' very shade
10. The singing workmen shape and set and join
11. Their frail new mansion's stuccoed cove and quoin
12. With no apparent sense that years abrade,
13. Though each rent wall their feeble works invade
14. Once shamed all such in power of pier and groin.
