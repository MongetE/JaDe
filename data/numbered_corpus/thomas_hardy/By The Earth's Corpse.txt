1. I

2. "O Lord, why grievest Thou? -
3. Since Life has ceased to be
4. Upon this globe, now cold
5. As lunar land and sea,
6. And humankind, and fowl, and fur
7. Are gone eternally,
8. All is the same to Thee as ere
9. They knew mortality."

10. II

11. "O Time," replied the Lord,
12. "Thou read'st me ill, I ween;
13. Were all THE SAME, I should not grieve
14. At that late earthly scene,
15. Now blestly past--though planned by me
16. With interest close and keen! -
17. Nay, nay: things now are NOT the same
18. As they have earlier been.

19. III

20. "Written indelibly
21. On my eternal mind
22. Are all the wrongs endured
23. By Earth's poor patient kind,
24. Which my too oft unconscious hand
25. Let enter undesigned.
26. No god can cancel deeds foredone,
27. Or thy old coils unwind!

28. IV

29. "As when, in Noe's days,
30. I whelmed the plains with sea,
31. So at this last, when flesh
32. And herb but fossils be,
33. And, all extinct, their piteous dust
34. Revolves obliviously,
35. That I made Earth, and life, and man,
36. It still repenteth me!"
