1. Wintertime nighs;
2. But my bereavement-pain
3. It cannot bring again:
4. Twice no one dies.

5. Flower-petals flee;
6. But since it once hath been,
7. No more that severing scene
8. Can harrow me.

9. Birds faint in dread:
10. I shall not lose old strength
11. In the lone frost's black length:
12. Strength long since fled!

13. Leaves freeze to dun;
14. But friends cannot turn cold
15. This season as of old
16. For him with none.

17. Tempests may scath;
18. But love cannot make smart
19. Again this year his heart
20. Who no heart hath.

21. Black is night's cope;
22. But death will not appal
23. One, who past doubtings all,
24. Waits in unhope.
