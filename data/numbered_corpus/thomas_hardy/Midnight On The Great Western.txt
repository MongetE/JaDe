1. In the third-class seat sat the journeying boy,
2. And the roof-lamp's oily flame
3. Played down on his listless form and face,
4. Bewrapt past knowing to what he was going,
5. Or whence he came.

6. In the band of his hat the journeying boy
7. Had a ticket stuck; and a string
8. Around his neck bore the key of his box,
9. That twinkled gleams of the lamp's sad beams
10. Like a living thing.

11. What past can be yours, O journeying boy
12. Towards a world uknown,
13. Who calmly, as if incurious quite
14. On all at stake, can undertake
15. This plunge alone?

16. Knows your soul a sphere, O journeying boy,
17. Our rude realms far above,
18. Whence with spacious vision you mark and mete
19. This region of sin that you find you in,
20. But are not of?
