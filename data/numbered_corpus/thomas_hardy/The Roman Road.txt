1. The Roman Road runs straight and bare
2. As the pale parting-line in hair
3. Across the heath. And thoughtful men
4. Contrast its days of Now and Then,
5. And delve, and measure, and compare;

6. Visioning on the vacant air
7. Helmeted legionnaires, who proudly rear
8. The Eagle, as they pace again
9. The Roman Road.
10. But no tall brass-helmeted legionnaire
11. Haunts it for me. Uprises there
12. A mother's form upon my ken,
13. Guiding my infant steps, as when
14. We walked that ancient thoroughfare,
15. The Roman Road.
