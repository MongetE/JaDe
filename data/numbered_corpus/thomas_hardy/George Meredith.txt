1. Forty years back, when much had place
2. That since has perished out of mind,
3. I heard that voice and saw that face.

4. He spoke as one afoot will wind
5. A morning horn ere men awake;
6. His note was trenchant, turning kind.

7. He was one of those whose wit can shake
8. And riddle to the very core
9. The counterfiets that Time will break....

10. Of late, when we two met once more,
11. The luminous countenance and rare
12. Shone just as forty years before.

13. So that, when now all tongues declare
14. His shape unseen by his green hill,
15. I scarce believe he sits not there.

16. No matter. Further and further still
17. Through the world's vaprous vitiate air
18. His words wing on--as live words will.
