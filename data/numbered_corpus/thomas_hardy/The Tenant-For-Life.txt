1. The sun said, watching my watering-pot
2. "Some morn you'll pass away;
3. These flowers and plants I parch up hot -
4. Who'll water them that day?

5. "Those banks and beds whose shape your eye
6. Has planned in line so true,
7. New hands will change, unreasoning why
8. Such shape seemed best to you.

9. "Within your house will strangers sit,
10. And wonder how first it came;
11. They'll talk of their schemes for improving it,
12. And will not mention your name.

13. "They'll care not how, or when, or at what
14. You sighed, laughed, suffered here,
15. Though you feel more in an hour of the spot
16. Than they will feel in a year

17. "As I look on at you here, now,
18. Shall I look on at these;
19. But as to our old times, avow
20. No knowledge--hold my peace! . . .

21. "O friend, it matters not, I say;
22. Bethink ye, I have shined
23. On nobler ones than you, and they
24. Are dead men out of mind!"
