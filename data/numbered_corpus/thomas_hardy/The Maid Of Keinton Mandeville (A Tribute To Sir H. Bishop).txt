1. I hear that maiden still
2. Of Keinton Mandeville
3. Singing, in flights that played
4. As wind-wafts through us all,
5. Till they made our mood a thrall
6. To their aery rise and fall,
7. 'Should he upbraid.'

8. Rose-necked, in sky-gray gown,
9. From a stage in Stower Town
10. Did she sing, and singing smile
11. As she blent that dexterous voice
12. With the ditty of her choice,
13. And banished our annoys
14. Thereawhile.

15. One with such song had power
16. To wing the heaviest hour
17. Of him who housed with her.
18. Who did I never knew
19. When her spoused estate ondrew,
20. And her warble flung its woo
21. In his ear.

22. Ah, she's a beldame now,
23. Time-trenched on cheek and brow,
24. Whom I once heard as a maid
25. From Keinton Mandeville
26. Of matchless scope and skill
27. Sing, with smile and swell and trill,
28. 'Should he upbraid!'
