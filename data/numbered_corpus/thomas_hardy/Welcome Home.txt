1. To my native place
2. Bent upon returning,
3. Bosom all day burning
4. To be where my race
5. Well were known, 'twas much with me
6. There to dwell in amity.

7. Folk had sought their beds,
8. But I hailed: to view me
9. Under the moon, out to me
10. Several pushed their heads,
11. And to each I told my name,
12. Plans, and that therefrom I came.

13. 'Did you? . . . Ah, 'tis true
14. I once heard, back a long time,
15. Here had spent his young time,
16. Some such man as you . . .
17. Good-night.' The casement closed again,
18. And I was left in the frosty lane.
