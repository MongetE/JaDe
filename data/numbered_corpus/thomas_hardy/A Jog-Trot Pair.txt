1. Who were the twain that trod this track
2. So many times together
3. Hither and back,
4. In spells of certain and uncertain weather?

5. Commonplace in conduct they
6. Who wandered to and fro here
7. Day by day:
8. Two that few dwellers troubled themselves to know here.

9. The very gravel-path was prim
10. That daily they would follow:
11. Borders trim:
12. Never a wayward sprout, or hump, or hollow.

13. Trite usages in tamest style
14. Had tended to their plighting.
15. 'It's just worth while,
16. Perhaps,' they had said. 'And saves much sad good-nighting.'

17. And petty seemed the happenings
18. That ministered to their joyance:
19. Simple things,
20. Onerous to satiate souls, increased their buoyance.

21. Who could those common people be,
22. Of days the plainest, barest?
23. They were we;
24. Yes; happier than the cleverest, smartest, rarest.
