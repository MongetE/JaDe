1. Nobody says: Ah, that is the place
2. Where chanced, in the hollow of years ago,
3. What none of the Three Towns cared to know -
4. The birth of a little girl of grace -
5. The sweetest the house saw, first or last;
6. Yet it was so
7. On that day long past.


8. Nobody thinks: There, there she lay
9. In a room by the Hoe, like the bud of a flower,
10. And listened, just after the bedtime hour,
11. To the stammering chimes that used to play
12. The quaint Old Hundred-and-Thirteenth tune
13. In Saint Andrew's tower
14. Night, morn, and noon.


15. Nobody calls to mind that here
16. Upon Boterel Hill, where the carters skid,
17. With cheeks whose airy flush outbid
18. Fresh fruit in bloom, and free of fear,
19. She cantered down, as if she must fall
20. (Though she never did),
21. To the charm of all.


22. Nay: one there is to whom these things,
23. That nobody else's mind calls back,
24. Have a savour that scenes in being lack,
25. And a presence more than the actual brings;
26. To whom to-day is beneaped and stale,
27. And its urgent clack
28. But a vapid tale.
