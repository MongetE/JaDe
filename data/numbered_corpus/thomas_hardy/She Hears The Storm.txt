1. There was a time in former years--
2. While my roof-tree was his--
3. When I should have been distressed by fears
4. At such a night as this!

5. I should have murmured anxiously,
6. 'The prickling rain strikes cold;
7. His road is bare of hedge or tree,
8. And he is getting old.'

9. But now the fitful chimney-roar,
10. The drone of Thorncombe trees,
11. The Froom in flood upon the moor,
12. The mud of Mellstock Leaze,

13. The candle slanting sooty-wick'd,
14. The thuds upon the thatch,
15. The eaves drops on the window flicked,
16. The clanking garden-hatch,

17. And what they mean to wayfarers,
18. I scarcely heed or mind;
19. He has won that storm-tight roof of hers
20. Which Earth grants all her kind.
