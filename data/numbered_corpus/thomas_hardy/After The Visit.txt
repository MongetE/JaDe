1. Come again to the place
2. Where your presence was as a leaf that skims
3. Down a drouthy way whose ascent bedims
4. The bloom on the farer's face.
5. Come again, with the feet
6. That were light on the green as a thistledown ball,
7. And those mute ministrations to one and to all
8. Beyond a man's saying sweet.
9. Until then the faint scent
10. Of the bordering flowers swam unheeded away,
11. And I marked not the charm in the changes of day
12. As the cloud-colours came and went.
13. Through the dark corridors
14. Your walk was so soundless I did not know
15. Your form from a phantom's of long ago
16. Said to pass on the ancient floors,
17. Till you drew from the shad
18. And I saw the large luminous living eyes
19. Regard me in fixed inquiring-wise
20. As those of a soul that weighed,
21. Scarce consciously,
22. The eternal question of what Life was,
23. And why we were there, and by whose strange laws
24. That which mattered most could not be.
