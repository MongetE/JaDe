1. I towered far, and lo! I stood within
2. The presence of the Lord Most High,
3. Sent thither by the sons of earth, to win
4. Some answer to their cry.

5. --"The Earth, say'st thou? The Human race?
6. By Me created? Sad its lot?
7. Nay: I have no remembrance of such place:
8. Such world I fashioned not." -

9. --"O Lord, forgive me when I say
10. Thou spak'st the word, and mad'st it all." -
11. "The Earth of men--let me bethink me . . . Yea!
12. I dimly do recall

13. "Some tiny sphere I built long back
14. (Mid millions of such shapes of mine)
15. So named . . . It perished, surely--not a wrack
16. Remaining, or a sign?

17. "It lost my interest from the first,
18. My aims therefor succeeding ill;
19. Haply it died of doing as it durst?" -
20. "Lord, it existeth still." -

21. "Dark, then, its life! For not a cry
22. Of aught it bears do I now hear;
23. Of its own act the threads were snapt whereby
24. Its plaints had reached mine ear.

25. "It used to ask for gifts of good,
26. Till came its severance self-entailed,
27. When sudden silence on that side ensued,
28. And has till now prevailed.

29. "All other orbs have kept in touch;
30. Their voicings reach me speedily:
31. Thy people took upon them overmuch
32. In sundering them from me!

33. "And it is strange--though sad enough -
34. Earth's race should think that one whose call
35. Frames, daily, shining spheres of flawless stuff
36. Must heed their tainted ball! . . .

37. "But say'st thou 'tis by pangs distraught,
38. And strife, and silent suffering? -
39. Deep grieved am I that injury should be wrought
40. Even on so poor a thing!

41. "Thou should'st have learnt that Not to Mend
42. For Me could mean but Not to Know:
43. Hence, Messengers! and straightway put an end
44. To what men undergo." . . .

45. Homing at dawn, I thought to see
46. One of the Messengers standing by.
47. - Oh, childish thought! . . . Yet oft it comes to me
48. When trouble hovers nigh.
