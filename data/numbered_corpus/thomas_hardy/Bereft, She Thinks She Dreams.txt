1. I dream that the dearest I ever knew
2. Has died and been entombed.
3. I am sure it's a dream that cannot be true,
4. But I am so overgloomed
5. By its persistence, that I would gladly
6. Have quick death take me,
7. Rather than longer think thus sadly;
8. So wake me, wake me!


9. It has lasted days, but minute and hour
10. I expect to get aroused
11. And find him as usual in the bower
12. Where we so happily housed.
13. Yet stays this nightmare too appalling,
14. And like a web shakes me,
15. And piteously I keep on calling,
16. And no one wakes me!
