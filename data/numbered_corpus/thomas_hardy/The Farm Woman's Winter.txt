1. I

2. If seasons all were summers,
3. And leaves would never fall,
4. And hopping casement-comers
5. Were foodless not at all,
6. And fragile folk might be here
7. That white winds bid depart;
8. Then one I used to see here
9. Would warm my wasted heart!

10. II

11. One frail, who, bravely tilling
12. Long hours in gripping gusts,
13. Was mastered by their chilling,
14. And now his ploughshare rusts.
15. So savage winter catches
16. The breath of limber things,
17. And what I love he snatches,
18. And what I love not, brings.
