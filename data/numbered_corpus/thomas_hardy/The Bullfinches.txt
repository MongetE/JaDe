1. Bother Bulleys, let us sing
2. From the dawn till evening! -
3. For we know not that we go not
4. When the day's pale pinions fold
5. Unto those who sang of old.
6. When I flew to Blackmoor Vale,
7. Whence the green-gowned faeries hail,
8. Roosting near them I could hear them
9. Speak of queenly Nature's ways,
10. Means, and moods,--well known to fays.

11. All we creatures, nigh and far
12. (Said they there), the Mother's are:
13. Yet she never shows endeavour
14. To protect from warrings wild
15. Bird or beast she calls her child.

16. Busy in her handsome house
17. Known as Space, she falls a-drowse;
18. Yet, in seeming, works on dreaming,
19. While beneath her groping hands
20. Fiends make havoc in her bands.

21. How her hussif'ry succeeds
22. She unknows or she unheeds,
23. All things making for Death's taking!
24. --So the green-gowned faeries say
25. Living over Blackmoor way.

26. Come then, brethren, let us sing,
27. From the dawn till evening! -
28. For we know not that we go not
29. When the day's pale pinions fold
30. Unto those who sang of old.
