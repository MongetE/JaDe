1. He does not think that I haunt here nightly:
2. How shall I let him know
3. That whither his fancy sets him wandering
4. I, too, alertly go? -
5. Hover and hover a few feet from him
6. Just as I used to do,
7. But cannot answer his words addressed me -
8. Only listen thereto!


9. When I could answer he did not say them:
10. When I could let him know
11. How I would like to join in his journeys
12. Seldom he wished to go.
13. Now that he goes and wants me with him
14. More than he used to do,
15. Never he sees my faithful phantom
16. Though he speaks thereto.


17. Yes, I accompany him to places
18. Only dreamers know,
19. Where the shy hares show their faces,
20. Where the night rooks go;
21. Into old aisles where the past is all to him,
22. Close as his shade can do,
23. Always lacking the power to call to him,
24. Near as I reach thereto!


25. What a good haunter I am, O tell him,
26. Quickly make him know
27. If he but sigh since my loss befell him
28. Straight to his side I go.
29. And if it be that at night I am stronger,
30. Go, too, by day I do:
31. Please, then, keep him in gloom no longer,
32. Even ghosts tend thereto!
