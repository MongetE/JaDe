1. He paused on the sill of a door ajar
2. That screened a lively liquor-bar,
3. For the name had reached him through the door
4. Of her he had married the week before.


5. 'We called her the Hack of the Parade;
6. But she was discreet in the games she played;
7. If slightly worn, she's pretty yet,
8. And gossips, after all, forget.


9. 'And he knows nothing of her past;
10. I am glad the girls in luck at last;
11. Such ones, though stale to native eyes,
12. Newcomers snatch at as a prize.'


13. 'Yes, being a stranger he sees her blent
14. Of all that's fresh and innocent,
15. Nor dreams how many a love-campaign
16. She had enjoyed before his reign!'


17. That night there was the splash of a fall
18. Over the slimy harbour-wall:
19. They searched, and at the deepest place
20. Found him with crabs upon his face.
