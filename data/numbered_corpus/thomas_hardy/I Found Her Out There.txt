1. I found her out there
2. On a slope few see,
3. That falls westwardly
4. To the sharp-edged air,
5. Where the ocean breaks
6. On the purple strand,
7. And the hurricane shakes
8. The solid land.


9. I brought her here,
10. And have laid her to rest
11. In a noiseless nest
12. No sea beats near.
13. She will never be stirred
14. In her loamy cell
15. By the waves long heard
16. And loved so well.


17. So she does not sleep
18. By those haunted heights
19. The Atlantic smites
20. And the blind gales sweep,
21. Whence she often would gaze
22. At Dundagel's far head,
23. While the dipping blaze
24. Dyed her face fire-red;


25. And would sigh at the tale
26. Of sunk Lyonnesse,
27. While a wind-tugged tress
28. Flapped her cheek like a flail;
29. Or listen at whiles
30. With a thought-bound brow
31. To the murmuring miles
32. She is far from now.


33. Yet her shade, maybe,
34. Will glide underground
35. Till it catch the sound
36. Of that western sea
37. As it swells and sobs
38. Where she once domiciled,
39. And joy in its throbs
40. With the heart of a child.
