1. He enters, and mute on the edge of a chair
2. Sits a thin-faced lady, a stranger there,
3. A type of decayed gentility;
4. And by some small signs he well can guess
5. That she comes to him almost breakfastless.
6. "I have called -- I hope I do not err --
7. I am looking for a purchaser
8. Of some score volumes of the works
9. Of eminent divines I own, --
10. Left by my father -- though it irks
11. My patience to offer them." And she smiles
12. As if necessity were unknown;
13. "But the truth of it is that oftenwhiles
14. I have wished, as I am fond of art,
15. To make my rooms a little smart,
16. And these old books are so in the way."
17. And lightly still she laughs to him,
18. As if to sell were a mere gay whim,
19. And that, to be frank, Life were indeed
20. To her not vinegar and gall,
21. But fresh and honey-like; and Need
22. No household skeleton at all.
