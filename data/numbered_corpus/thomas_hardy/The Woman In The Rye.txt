1. 'Why do you stand in the dripping rye,
2. Cold-lipped, unconscious, wet to the knee,
3. When there are firesides near?' said I.
4. 'I told him I wished him dead,' said she.

5. 'Yea, cried it in my haste to one
6. Whom I had loved, whom I well loved still;
7. And die he did. And I hate the sun,
8. And stand here lonely, aching, chill;

9. 'Stand waiting, waiting under skies
10. That blow reproach, the while I see
11. The rooks sheer off to where he lies
12. Wrapt in a peace withheld from me.'
