1. (E. L. G.)

2. BENEATH a knap where flown
3. Nestlings play,
4. Within walls of weathered stone,
5. Far away
6. From the files of formal houses,
7. By the bough the firstling browses,
8. Lives a Sweet: no merchants meet,
9. No man barters, no man sells
10. Where she dwells.

11. Upon that fabric fair
12. "Here is she!"
13. Seems written everywhere
14. Unto me.
15. But to friends and nodding neighbors,
16. Fellow wights in lot and labors,
17. Who descry the times as I,
18. No such lucid legend tells
19. Where she dwells.

20. Should I lapse to what I was
21. In days by--
22. (Such cannot be, but because
23. Some loves die
24. Let me feign it)--none would notice
25. That where she I know by rote is
26. Spread a strange and withering change,
27. Like a drying of the wells
28. Where she dwells.

29. To feel I might have kissed--
30. Loved as true--
31. Otherwhere, nor Mine have missed
32. My life through,
33. Had I never wandered near her,
34. Is a smart severe--severer
35. In the thought that she is nought,
36. Even as I, beyond the dells
37. Where she dwells.

38. And Devotion droops her glance
39. To recall
40. What bond-servants of Chance
41. We are all.
42. I but found her in that, going
43. On my errant path unknowing,
44. I did not out-skirt the spot
45. That no spot on earth excels--
46. Where she dwells!
