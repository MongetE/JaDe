1. One without looks in tonight
2. Through the curtain-chink
3. From the sheet of glistening white;
4. One without looks in tonight
5. As we sit and think
6. By the fender-brink.

7. We do not discern those eyes
8. Watching in the snow;
9. Lit by lamps of rosy dyes
10. We do not discern those eyes
11. Wandering, aglow
12. Four-footed, tiptoe.
