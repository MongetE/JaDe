1. Why do you harbour that great cheval-glass
2. Filling up your narrow room?
3. You never preen or plume,
4. Or look in a week at your full-length figure -
5. Picture of bachelor gloom!

6. 'Well, when I dwelt in ancient England,
7. Renting the valley farm,
8. Thoughtless of all heart-harm,
9. I used to gaze at the parson's daughter,
10. A creature of nameless charm.

11. 'Thither there came a lover and won her,
12. Carried her off from my View.
13. O it was then I knew
14. Misery of a cast undreamt of -
15. More than, indeed, my due!

16. 'Then far rumours of her ill-usage
17. Came, like a chilling breath
18. When a man languisheth;
19. Followed by news that her mind lost balance,
20. And, in a space, of her death.

21. 'Soon sank her father; and next was the auction -
22. Everything to be sold:
23. Mid things new and old
24. Stood this glass in her former chamber,
25. Long in her use, I was told.


26. 'Well, I awaited the sale and bought it….
27. There by my bed it stands,
28. And as the dawn expands
29. Often I see her pale-faced form there
30. Brushing her hairs bright bands.


31. 'There, too, at pallid midnight moments
32. Quick she will come to my call,
33. Smile from the frame withal
34. Ponderingly, as she used to regard me
35. Passing her father's wall.


36. 'So that it was for it's revelations
37. I brought it oversea,
38. And drag it about with me….
39. Anon I shall break it and bury its, fragments
40. Where my grave is to be.
