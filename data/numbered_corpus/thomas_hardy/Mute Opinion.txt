1. I

2. I traversed a dominion
3. Whose spokesmen spake out strong
4. Their purpose and opinion
5. Through pulpit, press, and song.
6. I scarce had means to note there
7. A large-eyed few, and dumb,
8. Who thought not as those thought there
9. That stirred the heat and hum.

10. II

11. When, grown a Shade, beholding
12. That land in lifetime trode,
13. To learn if its unfolding
14. Fulfilled its clamoured code,
15. I saw, in web unbroken,
16. Its history outwrought
17. Not as the loud had spoken,
18. But as the mute had thought.
