1. I

2. The thick lids of Night closed upon me
3. Alone at the Bill
4. Of the Isle by the Race -
5. Many-caverned, bald, wrinkled of face -
6. And with darkness and silence the spirit was on me
7. To brood and be still.

8. II

9. No wind fanned the flats of the ocean,
10. Or promontory sides,
11. Or the ooze by the strand,
12. Or the bent-bearded slope of the land,
13. Whose base took its rest amid everlong motion
14. Of criss-crossing tides.

15. III

16. Soon from out of the Southward seemed nearing
17. A whirr, as of wings
18. Waved by mighty-vanned flies,
19. Or by night-moths of measureless size,
20. And in softness and smoothness well-nigh beyond hearing
21. Of corporal things.

22. IV

23. And they bore to the bluff, and alighted -
24. A dim-discerned train
25. Of sprites without mould,
26. Frameless souls none might touch or might hold -
27. On the ledge by the turreted lantern, farsighted
28. By men of the main.

29. V

30. And I heard them say "Home!" and I knew them
31. For souls of the felled
32. On the earth's nether bord
33. Under Capricorn, whither they'd warred,
34. And I neared in my awe, and gave heedfulness to them
35. With breathings inheld.

36. VI

37. Then, it seemed, there approached from the northward
38. A senior soul-flame
39. Of the like filmy hue:
40. And he met them and spake:  "Is it you,
41. O my men?"  Said they, "Aye!  We bear homeward and hearthward
42. To list to our fame!"

43. VII

44. "I've flown there before you," he said then:
45. "Your households are well;
46. But--your kin linger less
47. On your glory arid war-mightiness
48. Than on dearer things."--"Dearer?" cried these from the dead then,
49. "Of what do they tell?"

50. VIII

51. "Some mothers muse sadly, and murmur
52. Your doings as boys -
53. Recall the quaint ways
54. Of your babyhood's innocent days.
55. Some pray that, ere dying, your faith had grown firmer,
56. And higher your joys.

57. IX

58. "A father broods:  'Would I had set him
59. To some humble trade,
60. And so slacked his high fire,
61. And his passionate martial desire;
62. Had told him no stories to woo him and whet him
63. To this due crusade!"

64. X

65. "And, General, how hold out our sweethearts,
66. Sworn loyal as doves?"
67. --"Many mourn; many think
68. It is not unattractive to prink
69. Them in sables for heroes.   Some fickle and fleet hearts
70. Have found them new loves."

71. XI

72. "And our wives?" quoth another resignedly,
73. "Dwell they on our deeds?"
74. --"Deeds of home; that live yet
75. Fresh as new--deeds of fondness or fret;
76. Ancient words that were kindly expressed or unkindly,
77. These, these have their heeds."

78. XII

79. --"Alas! then it seems that our glory
80. Weighs less in their thought
81. Than our old homely acts,
82. And the long-ago commonplace facts
83. Of our lives--held by us as scarce part of our story,
84. And rated as nought!"

85. XIII

86. Then bitterly some:  "Was it wise now
87. To raise the tomb-door
88. For such knowledge?  Away!"
89. But the rest:  "Fame we prized till to-day;
90. Yet that hearts keep us green for old kindness we prize now
91. A thousand times more!"

92. XIV

93. Thus speaking, the trooped apparitions
94. Began to disband
95. And resolve them in two:
96. Those whose record was lovely and true
97. Bore to northward for home:  those of bitter traditions
98. Again left the land,

99. XV

100. And, towering to seaward in legions,
101. They paused at a spot
102. Overbending the Race -
103. That engulphing, ghast, sinister place -
104. Whither headlong they plunged, to the fathomless regions
105. Of myriads forgot.

106. XVI

107. And the spirits of those who were homing
108. Passed on, rushingly,
109. Like the Pentecost Wind;
110. And the whirr of their wayfaring thinned
111. And surceased on the sky, and but left in the gloaming
112. Sea-mutterings and me.
