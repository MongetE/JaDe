1. Portion of this yew
2. Is a man my grandsire knew,
3. Bosomed here at its foot:
4. This branch may be his wife,
5. A ruddy human life
6. Now turned to a green shoot.

7. These grasses must be made
8. Of her who often prayed,
9. Last century, for repose;
10. And the fair girl long ago
11. Whom I often tried to know
12. May be entering this rose.

13. So, they are not underground,
14. But as nerves and veins abound
15. In the growths of upper air,
16. And they feel the sun and rain,
17. And the energy again
18. That made them what they were!
