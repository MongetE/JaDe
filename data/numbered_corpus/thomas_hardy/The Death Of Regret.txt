1. I opened my shutter at sunrise,
2. And looked at the hill hard by,
3. And I heartily grieved for the comrade
4. Who wandered up there to die.


5. I let in the morn on the morrow,
6. And failed not to think of him then,
7. As he trod up that rise in the twilight,
8. And never came down again.


9. I undid the shutter a week thence,
10. But not until after I'd turned
11. Did I call back his last departure
12. By the upland there discerned.


13. Uncovering the casement long later,
14. I bent to my toil till the gray,
15. When I said to myself, 'Ah - what ails me,
16. To forget him all the day!'


17. As daily I flung back the shutter
18. In the same blank bald routine,
19. He scarcely once rose to remembrance
20. Through a month of my facing the scene.


21. And ah, seldom now do I ponder
22. At the window as heretofore
23. On the long valued one who died yonder,
24. And wastes by the sycamore.
