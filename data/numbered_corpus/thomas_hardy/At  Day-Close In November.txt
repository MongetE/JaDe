1. The ten hours' light is abating,
2. And a late bird flies across,
3. Where the pines, like waltzers waiting,
4. Give their black heads a toss.

5. Beech leaves, that yellow the noon-time,
6. Float past like specks in the eye;
7. I set every tree in my June time,
8. And now they obscure the sky.

9. And the children who ramble through here
10. Conceive that there never has been
11. A time when no tall trees grew here,
12. A time when none will be seen.
