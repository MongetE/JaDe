1. NOT a line of her writing have I,
2. Not a thread of her hair,
3. No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
4. I may picture her there;
5. And in vain do I urge my unsight
6. To conceive my lost prize
7. At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming with light,
8. And with laughter her eyes.

9. What scenes spread around her last days,
10. Sad, shining, or dim?
11. Did her gifts and compassions enray and enarch her sweet ways
12. With an aureate nimb?
13. Or did life-light decline from her years,
14. And mischances control
15. Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears
16. Disennoble her soul?

17. Thus I do but the phantom retain
18. Of the maiden of yore
19. As my relic; yet haply the best of her--fined in my brain
20. It may be the more
21. That no line of her writing have I,
22. Nor a thread of her hair,
23. No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
24. I may picture her there.
