1. I

2. A shaded lamp and a waving blind,
3. And the beat of a clock from a distant floor:
4. On this scene enter--winged, horned, and spined -
5. A longlegs, a moth, and a dumbledore;
6. While 'mid my page there idly stands
7. A sleepy fly, that rubs its hands . . .

8. II

9. Thus meet we five, in this still place,
10. At this point of time, at this point in space.
11. - My guests parade my new-penned ink,
12. Or bang at the lamp-glass, whirl, and sink.
13. "God's humblest, they!" I muse. Yet why?
14. They know Earth-secrets that know not I.
