2. Our sighs and piteous groans,
3. Half stifled in this jumbled patch
4. Of wrenched memorial stones!

5. "We late-lamented, resting here,
6. Are mixed to human jam,
7. And each to each exclaims in fear,
8. 'I know not which I am!'

10. The verses on the good;
11. A roaring drunkard sports the text
12. Teetotal Tommy should!

14. And if our names remain,
15. They pave some path or p-ing place
16. Where we have never lain!

17. "There's not a modest maiden elf
18. But dreads the final Trumpet,
19. Lest half of her should rise herself,
20. And half some local strumpet!

21. "From restorations of Thy fane,
22. From smoothings of Thy sward,
23. From zealous Churchmen's pick and plane
24. Deliver us O Lord! Amen!"
