1. On Monday night I closed my door,
2. And thought you were not as heretofore,
3. And little cared if we met no more.


4. I seemed on Tuesday night to trace
5. Something beyond mere commonplace
6. In your ideas, and heart, and face.


7. On Wednesday I did not opine
8. Your life would ever be one with mine,
9. Though if it were we should well combine.


10. On Thursday noon I liked you well,
11. And fondly felt that we must dwell
12. Not far apart, whatever befell.


13. On Friday it was with a thrill
14. In gazing towards your distant vill
15. I owned you were my dear one still.


16. I saw you wholly to my mind
17. On Saturday - even one who shrined
18. All that was best of womankind.


19. As wing-clipt sea-gull for the sea
20. On Sunday night I longed for thee,
21. Without whom life were waste to me!
