1. It faces west, and round the back and sides
2. High beeches, bending, hang a veil of boughs,
3. And sweep against the roof. Wild honeysucks
4. Climb on the walls, and seem to sprout a wish
5. (If we may fancy wish of trees and plants)
6. To overtop the apple trees hard-by.

7. Red roses, lilacs, variegated box
8. Are there in plenty, and such hardy flowers
9. As flourish best untrained. Adjoining these
10. Are herbs and esculents; and farther still
11. A field; then cottages with trees, and last
12. The distant hills and sky.

13. Behind, the scene is wilder. Heath and furze
14. Are everything that seems to grow and thrive
15. Upon the uneven ground. A stunted thorn
16. Stands here and there, indeed; and from a pit
17. An oak uprises, Springing from a seed
18. Dropped by some bird a hundred years ago.

19. In days bygone--
20. Long gone--my father's mother, who is now
21. Blest with the blest, would take me out to walk.
22. At such a time I once inquired of her
23. How looked the spot when first she settled here.
24. The answer I remember. 'Fifty years
25. Have passed since then, my child, and change has marked
26. The face of all things. Yonder garden-plots
27. And orchards were uncultivated slopes
28. O'ergrown with bramble bushes, furze and thorn:
29. That road a narrow path shut in by ferns,
30. Which, almost trees, obscured the passers-by.

31. Our house stood quite alone, and those tall firs
32. And beeches were not planted. Snakes and efts
33. Swarmed in the summer days, and nightly bats
34. Would fly about our bedrooms. Heathcroppers
35. Lived on the hills, and were our only friends;
36. So wild it was when we first settled here.'
