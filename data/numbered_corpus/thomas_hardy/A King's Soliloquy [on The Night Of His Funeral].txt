1. From the slow march and muffled drum,
2. And crowds distrest,
3. And book and bell, at length I have come
4. To my full rest.


5. A ten years' rule beneath the sun
6. Is wound up here,
7. And what I have done, what left undone,
8. Figures out clear.


9. Yet in the estimate of such
10. It grieves me more
11. That I by some was loved so much
12. Than that I bore,


13. From others, judgment of that hue
14. Which over-hope
15. Breeds from a theoretic view
16. Of regal scope.


17. For kingly opportunities
18. Right many have sighed;
19. How best to bear its devilries
20. Those learn who have tried!


21. I have eaten the fat and drunk the sweet,
22. Lived the life out
23. From the first greeting glad drum-beat
24. To the last shout.


25. What pleasure earth affords to kings
26. I have enjoyed
27. Through its long vivid pulse-stirrings
28. Even till it cloyed.


29. What days of strain, what nights of stress
30. Can cark a throne,
31. Even one maintained in peacefulness,
32. I too have known.


33. And so, I think, could I step back
34. To life again,
35. I should prefer the average track
36. Of average men,


37. Since, as with them, what kingship would
38. It cannot do,
39. Nor to first thoughts however good
40. Hold itself true.


41. Something binds hard the royal hand,
42. As all that be,
43. And it is That has shaped, has planned
44. My acts and me.
