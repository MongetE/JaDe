1. (As sung by Mr. Charles Charrington in the play of "The Three Wayfarers")

2. O MY trade it is the rarest one,
3. Simple shepherds all--
4. My trade is a sight to see;
5. For my customers I tie, and take 'em up on high,
6. And waft 'em to a far countree!

7. My tools are but common ones,
8. Simple shepherds all--
9. My tools are no sight to see:
10. A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing,
11. Are implements enough for me!

12. To-morrow is my working day,
13. Simple shepherds all--
14. To-morrow is a working day for me:
15. For the farmer's sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta'en,
16. And on his soul may God ha' mer-cy!
