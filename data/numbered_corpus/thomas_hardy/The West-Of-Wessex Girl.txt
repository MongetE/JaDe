1. A very West-of-Wessex girl,
2. As blithe as blithe could be,
3. Was once well-known to me,
4. And she would laud her native town,
5. And hope and hope that we
6. Might sometime study up and down
7. Its charms in company.

8. But never I squired my Wessex girl
9. In jaunts to Hoe or street
10. When hearts were high in beat,
11. Nor saw her in the marbled ways
12. Where market-people meet
13. That in her bounding early days
14. Were friendly with her feet.

15. Yet now my West-of-Wessex girl,
16. When midnight hammers slow
17. From Andrew's, blow by blow,
18. As phantom draws me by the hand
19. To the place-Plymouth Hoe-
20. Where side by side in life, as planned,
21. We never were to go!


22. Begun in Plymouth, March 1
