1. Beeny did not quiver,
2. Juliot grew not gray,
3. Thin Valency's river
4. Held its wonted way.
5. Bos seemed not to utter
6. Dimmest note of dirge,
7. Targan mouth a mutter
8. To its creamy surge.


9. Yet though these, unheeding,
10. Listless, passed the hour
11. Of her spirit's speeding,

13. Sought and loved the places -
14. Much and often pined
15. For their lonely faces
16. When in towns confined.


17. Why did not Valency
18. In his purl deplore
19. One whose haunts were whence he
20. Drew his limpid store?
21. Why did Bos not thunder
22. Targan apprehend
23. Body and breath were sunder
24. Of their former friend?
