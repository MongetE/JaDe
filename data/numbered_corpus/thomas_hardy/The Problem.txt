1. Shall we conceal the Case, or tell it -
2. We who believe the evidence?
3. Here and there the watch-towers knell it
4. With a sullen significance,
5. Heard of the few who hearken intently and carry an eagerly upstrained
6. sense.

7. Hearts that are happiest hold not by it;
8. Better we let, then, the old view reign;
9. Since there is peace in it, why decry it?
10. Since there is comfort, why disdain?
11. Note not the pigment the while that the painting determines
12. humanity's joy and pain!
