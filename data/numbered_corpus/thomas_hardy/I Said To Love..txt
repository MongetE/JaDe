1. I said to Love,
2. "It is not now as in old days
3. When men adored thee and thy ways
4. All else above;
5. Named thee the Boy, the Bright, the One
6. Who spread a heaven beneath the sun,"
7. I said to Love.
8. I said to him,
9. "We now know more of thee than then;
10. We were but weak in judgment when,
11. With hearts abrim,
12. We clamoured thee that thou would'st please
13. Inflict on us thine agonies,"
14. I said to him.

15. I said to Love,
16. "Thou art not young, thou art not fair,
17. No faery darts, no cherub air,
18. Nor swan, nor dove
19. Are thine; but features pitiless,
20. And iron daggers of distress,"
21. I said to Love.
22. "Depart then, Love! . . .
23. - Man's race shall end, dost threaten thou?
24. The age to come the man of now
25. Know nothing of? -
26. We fear not such a threat from thee;
27. We are too old in apathy!
28. Mankind shall cease.--So let it be,"
29. I said to Love.
