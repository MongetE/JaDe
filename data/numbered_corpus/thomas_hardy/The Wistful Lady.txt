1. 'Love, while you were away there came to me -
2. From whence I cannot tell -
3. A plaintive lady pale and passionless,
4. Who bent her eyes upon me critically,
5. And weighed me with a wearing wistfulness,
6. As if she knew me well.'


7. 'I saw no lady of that wistful sort
8. As I came riding home.
9. Perhaps she was some dame the Fates constrain
10. By memories sadder than she can support,
11. Or by unhappy vacancy of brain,
12. To leave her roof and roam?'


13. 'Ah, but she knew me. And before this time
14. I have seen her, lending ear
15. To my light outdoor words, and pondering each,
16. Her frail white finger swayed in pantomime,
17. As if she fain would close with me in speech,
18. And yet would not come near.


19. 'And once I saw her beckoning with her hand
20. As I came into sight
21. At an upper window. And I at last went out;
22. But when I reached where she had seemed to stand,
23. And wandered up and down and searched about,
24. I found she had vanished quite.'


25. Then thought I how my dead Love used to say,
26. With a small smile, when she
27. Was waning wan, that she would hover round
28. And show herself after her passing day
29. To any newer Love I might have found,
30. But show her not to me.
