1. O poet, come you haunting here
2. Where streets have stolen up all around,
3. And never a nightingale pours one
4. Full-throated sound?

5. Drawn from your drowse by the Seven famed Hills,
6. Thought you to find all just the same
7. Here shining, as in hours of old,
8. If you but came?

9. What will you do in your surprise
10. At seeing that changes wrought in Rome
11. Are wrought yet more on the misty slope
12. One time your home?

13. Will you wake wind-wafts on these stairs?
14. Swing the doors open noisily?
15. Show as an umbraged ghost beside
16. Your ancient tree?

17. Or will you, softening, the while
18. You further and yet further look,
19. Learn that a laggard few would fain
20. Preserve your nook? . . .

21. -Where the Piazza steps incline,
22. And catch late light at eventide,
23. I once stood, in that Rome, and thought,
24. ''Twas here he died.'

25. I drew to a violet-sprinkled spot,
26. Where day and night a pyramid keeps
27. Uplifted its white hand, and said,
28. ''Tis there he sleeps.'

29. Pleasanter now it is to hold
30. That here, where sang he, more of him
31. Remains than where he, tuneless, cold,
32. Passed to the dim.
