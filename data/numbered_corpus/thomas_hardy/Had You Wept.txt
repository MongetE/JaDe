1. Had you wept; had you but neared me with a frail uncertain ray,
2. Dewy as the face of the dawn, in your large and luminous eye,
3. Then would have come back all the joys the tidings had slain that day,
4. And a new beginning, a fresh fair heaven, have smoothed the things awry.
5. But you were less feebly human, and no passionate need for clinging
6. Possessed your soul to overthrow reserve when I came near;
7. Ay, though you suffer as much as I from storms the hours are bringing
8. Upon your heart and mine, I never see you shed a tear.


9. The deep strong woman is weakest, the weak one is the strong;
10. The weapon of all weapons best for winning, you have not used;
11. Have you never been able, or would you not, through the evil times and long?
12. Has not the gift been given you, or such gift have you refused?
13. When I bade me not absolve you on that evening or the morrow,
14. Why did you not make war on me with those who weep like rain?
15. You felt too much, so gained no balm for all your torrid sorrow,
16. And hence our deep division, and our dark undying pain.
