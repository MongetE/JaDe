1. At nine in the morning there passed a church,
2. At ten there passed me by the sea,
3. At twelve a town of smoke and smirch,
4. At two a forest of oak and birch,
5. And then, on a platform, she:

6. A radiant stranger, who saw not me.
7. I queried, 'Get out to her do I dare?'
8. But I kept my seat in my search for a plea,
9. And the wheels moved on. O could it but be
10. That I had alighted there!
