1. The church flings forth a battled shade
2. Over the moon-blanched sward:
3. The church; my gift; whereto I paid
4. My all in hand and hoard;
5. Lavished my gains
6. With stintless pains
7. To glorify the Lord.

8. I squared the broad foundations in
9. Of ashlared masonry;
10. I moulded mullions thick and thin,
11. Hewed fillet and ogee;
12. I circleted
13. Each sculptured head
14. With nimb and canopy.

15. I called in many a craftsmaster
16. To fix emblazoned glass,
17. To figure Cross and Sepulchure
18. On dossal, boss, and brass.
19. My gold all spent,
20. My jewels went
21. To gem the cups of Mass.

22. I borrowed deep to carve the screen
23. And raise the ivoried Rood;
24. I parted with my small demesne
25. To make my owings good.
26. Heir-looms unpriced
27. I sacrificed,
28. Until debt-free I stood.

29. So closed the task. "Deathless the Creed
30. Here substanced!" said my soul:
31. "I heard me bidden to this deed,
32. And straight obeyed the call.
33. Illume this fane,
34. That not in vain
35. I build it, Lord of all!"

36. But, as it chanced me, then and there
37. Did dire misfortunes burst;
38. My home went waste for lack of care,
39. My sons rebelled and curst;
40. Till I confessed
41. That aims the best
42. Were looking like the worst.

43. Enkindled by my votive work
44. No burnng faith I find;
45. The deeper thinkers sneer and smirk,
46. And give my toil no mind;
47. From nod and wink
48. I read they think
49. That I am fool and blind.

50. My gift to God seems futile, quite;
51. The world moves as erstwhile;
52. And powerful Wrong on feeble Right
53. Tramples in olden style.
54. My faith burns down,
55. I see no crown;
56. But Cares, and Griefs, and Guile.

57. So now, the remedy? Yea, this:
58. I gently swing the door
59. Here, of my fane--no soul to wis--
60. And cross the patterned floor
61. To the rood-screen
62. That stands between
63. The nave and inner chore.

64. The rich red windows dim the moon,
65. But little light need I;
66. I mount the prie-dieu, lately hewn
67. From woods of rarest dye;
68. Then from below
69. My garment, so,
70. I draw this cord, and tie

71. One end thereof around the beam
72. Midway 'twixt Cross and truss:
73. I noose the nethermost extreme,
74. And in ten seconds thus
75. I journey hence--
76. To that land whence
77. No rumour reaches us.

78. Well: Here at morn they'll light on one
79. Dangling in mockery
80. Of what he spent his substance on
81. Blindly and uselessly!...
82. "He might," they'll say,
83. "Have built, some way,
84. A cheaper gallows-tree!"
