1. I scanned her picture dreaming,
2. Till each dear line and hue
3. Was imaged, to my seeming,
4. As if it lived anew.

5. Her lips began to borrow
6. Their former wondrous smile;
7. Her fair eyes, faint with sorrow,
8. Grew sparkling as erstwhile.

9. Such tears as often ran not
10. Ran then, my love, for thee;
11. And O, believe I cannot
12. That thou are lost to me!
