2. "Soul! Shall I see thy face," she said,
3. "In one brief hour?
4. And away with thee from a loveless bed
5. To a far-off sun, to a vine-wrapt bower,
6. And be thine own unseparated,
7. And challenge the world's white glower?

9. She quickened her feet, and met him where
10. They had predesigned:
11. And they clasped, and mounted, and cleft the air
12. Upon whirling wheels; till the will to bind
13. Her life with his made the moments there
14. Efface the years behind.

15. III

16. Miles slid, and the sight of the port upgrew
17. As they sped on;
18. When slipping its bond the bracelet flew
19. From her fondled arm. Replaced anon,
20. Its cameo of the abjured one drew
21. Her musings thereupon.

22. IV

23. The gaud with his image once had been
24. A gift from him:
25. And so it was that its carving keen
26. Refurbished memories wearing dim,
27. Which set in her soul a throe of teen,
28. And a tear on her lashes' brim.

29. V

30. "I may not go!" she at length upspake,
31. "Thoughts call me back -
32. I would still lose all for your dear, dear sake;
33. My heart is thine, friend! But my track
34. I home to Athelhall must take
35. To hinder household wrack!"

36. VI

37. He appealed. But they parted, weak and wan:
38. And he left the shore;
39. His ship diminished, was low, was gone;
40. And she heard in the waves as the daytide wore,
41. And read in the leer of the sun that shone,
42. That they parted for evermore.

43. VII

44. She homed as she came, at the dip of eve
45. On Athel Coomb
46. Regaining the Hall she had sworn to leave . . .
47. The house was soundless as a tomb,
48. And she entered her chamber, there to grieve
49. Lone, kneeling, in the gloom.

50. VIII

51. From the lawn without rose her husband's voice
52. To one his friend:
53. "Another her Love, another my choice,
54. Her going is good. Our conditions mend;
55. In a change of mates we shall both rejoice;
56. I hoped that it thus might end!

57. IX

58. "A quick divorce; she will make him hers,
59. And I wed mine.
60. So Time rights all things in long, long years -
61. Or rather she, by her bold design!
62. I admire a woman no balk deters:
63. She has blessed my life, in fine.

64. X

65. "I shall build new rooms for my new true bride,
66. Let the bygone be:
67. By now, no doubt, she has crossed the tide
68. With the man to her mind. Far happier she
69. In some warm vineland by his side
70. Than ever she was with me."
