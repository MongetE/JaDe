1. A plain tilt-bonnet on her head
2. She took the path across the leaze.
3. - Her spouse the vicar, gardening, said,
4. 'Too dowdy that, for coquetries,
5. So I can hoe at ease.'


6. But when she had passed into the heath,
7. And gained the wood beyond the flat,
8. She raised her skirts, and from beneath
9. Unpinned and drew as from a sheath
10. An ostrich-feathered hat.


11. And where the hat had hung she now
12. Concealed and pinned the dowdy hood,
13. And set the hat upon her brow,
14. And thus emerging from the wood
15. Tripped on in jaunty mood.


16. The sun was low and crimson-faced
17. As two came that way from the town,
18. And plunged into the wood untracedâ€¦.
19. When separately therefrom they paced
20. The sun had quite gone down.


21. The hat and feather disappeared,
22. The dowdy hood again was donned,
23. And in the gloom the fair one neared
24. Her home and husband dour, who conned
25. Calmly his blue-eyed blonde.


26. 'To-day,' he said, 'you have shown good sense,
27. A dress so modest and so meek
28. Should always deck your goings hence
29. Alone.' And as a recompense
30. He kissed her on the cheek.
