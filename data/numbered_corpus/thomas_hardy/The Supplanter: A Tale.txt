1. I

2. He bends his travel-tarnished feet
3. To where she wastes in clay:
4. From day-dawn until eve he fares
5. Along the wintry way;
6. From day-dawn until eve repairs
7. Unto her mound to pray.

8. II

9. "Are these the gravestone shapes that meet
10. My forward-straining view?
11. Or forms that cross a window-blind
12. In circle, knot, and queue:
13. Gay forms, that cross and whirl and wind
14. To music throbbing through?" -

15. III

16. "The Keeper of the Field of Tombs
17. Dwells by its gateway-pier;
18. He celebrates with feast and dance
19. His daughter's twentieth year:
20. He celebrates with wine of France
21. The birthday of his dear." -

22. IV

23. "The gates are shut when evening glooms:
24. Lay down your wreath, sad wight;
25. To-morrow is a time more fit
26. For placing flowers aright:
27. The morning is the time for it;
28. Come, wake with us to-night!" -

29. V

30. He grounds his wreath, and enters in,
31. And sits, and shares their cheer. -
32. "I fain would foot with you, young man,
33. Before all others here;
34. I fain would foot it for a span
35. With such a cavalier!"

36. VI

37. She coaxes, clasps, nor fails to win
38. His first-unwilling hand:
39. The merry music strikes its staves,
40. The dancers quickly band;
41. And with the damsel of the graves
42. He duly takes his stand.

43. VII

44. "You dance divinely, stranger swain,
45. Such grace I've never known.
46. O longer stay! Breathe not adieu
47. And leave me here alone!
48. O longer stay: to her be true
49. Whose heart is all your own!" -

50. VIII

51. "I mark a phantom through the pane,
52. That beckons in despair,
53. Its mouth all drawn with heavy moan -
54. Her to whom once I sware!" -
55. "Nay; 'tis the lately carven stone
56. Of some strange girl laid there!" -

57. IX

58. "I see white flowers upon the floor
59. Betrodden to a clot;
60. My wreath were they?"--"Nay; love me much,
61. Swear you'll forget me not!
62. 'Twas but a wreath! Full many such
63. Are brought here and forgot."

64. * * *

65. X

66. The watches of the night grow hoar,
67. He rises ere the sun;
68. "Now could I kill thee here!" he says,
69. "For winning me from one
70. Who ever in her living days
71. Was pure as cloistered nun!"

72. XI

73. She cowers, and he takes his track
74. Afar for many a mile,
75. For evermore to be apart
76. From her who could beguile
77. His senses by her burning heart,
78. And win his love awhile.

79. XII

80. A year: and he is travelling back
81. To her who wastes in clay;
82. From day-dawn until eve he fares
83. Along the wintry way,
84. From day-dawn until eve repairs
85. Unto her mound to pray.

86. XIII

87. And there he sets him to fulfil
88. His frustrate first intent:
89. And lay upon her bed, at last,
90. The offering earlier meant:
91. When, on his stooping figure, ghast
92. And haggard eyes are bent.

93. XIV

94. "O surely for a little while
95. You can be kind to me!
96. For do you love her, do you hate,
97. She knows not--cares not she:
98. Only the living feel the weight
99. Of loveless misery!

100. XV

101. "I own my sin; I've paid its cost,
102. Being outcast, shamed, and bare:
103. I give you daily my whole heart,
104. Your babe my tender care,
105. I pour you prayers; and aye to part
106. Is more than I can bear!"

107. XVI

108. He turns--unpitying, passion-tossed;
109. "I know you not!" he cries,
110. "Nor know your child. I knew this maid,
111. But she's in Paradise!"
112. And swiftly in the winter shade
113. He breaks from her and flies.
