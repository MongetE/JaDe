1. A bird sings the selfsame song,
2. With never a fault in its flow,
3. That we listened to here those long
4. Long years ago.

5. A pleasing marvel is how
6. A strain of such rapturous rote
7. Should have gone on thus till now
8. unchanged in a note!

9. --But its not the selfsame bird.--
10. No: perished to dust is he....
11. As also are those who heard
12. That song with me.
