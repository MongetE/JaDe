1. Breathe not, hid Heart: cease silently,
2. And though thy birth-hour beckons thee,
3. Sleep the long sleep:
4. The Doomsters heap
5. Travails and teens around us here,
6. And Time-Wraiths turn our songsingings to fear.

7. Hark, how the peoples surge and sigh,
8. And laughters fail, and greetings die;
9. Hopes dwindle; yea,
10. Faiths waste away,
11. Affections and enthusiasms numb:
12. Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come.

13. Had I the ear of wombed souls
14. Ere their terrestrial chart unrolls,
15. And thou wert free
16. To cease, or be,
17. Then would I tell thee all I know,
18. And put it to thee: Wilt thou take Life so?

19. Vain vow! No hint of mine may hence
20. To theeward fly: to thy locked sense
21. Explain none can
22. Life's pending plan:
23. Thou wilt thy ignorant entry make
24. Though skies spout fire and blood and nations quake.

25. Fain would I, dear, find some shut plot
26. Of earth's wide wold for thee, where not
27. One tear, one qualm,
28. Should break the calm.
29. But I am weak as thou and bare;
30. No man can change the common lot to rare.

31. Must come and bide. And such are we --
32. Unreasoning, sanguine, visionary --
33. That I can hope
34. Health, love, friends, scope
35. In full for thee; can dream thou'lt find
36. Joys seldom yet attained by humankind!
