1. (at a Cathedral Service)

2. THAT from this bright believing band
3. An outcast I should be,
4. That faiths by which my comrades stand
5. Seem fantasies to me,
6. And mirage-mists their Shining Land,
7. Is a drear destiny.

8. Why thus my soul should be consigned
9. To infelicity,
10. Why always I must feel as blind
11. To sights my brethren see,
12. Why joys they've found I cannot find,
13. Abides a mystery.

14. Since heart of mine knows not that ease
15. Which they know; since it be
16. That He who breathes All's Well to these
17. Breathes no All's Well to me,
18. My lack might move their sympathies
19. And Christian charity!

20. I am like a gazer who should mark
21. An inland company
22. Standing upfingered, with, "Hark! hark!
23. The glorious distant sea!"
24. And feel, "Alas, 'tis but yon dark
25. And wind-swept pine to me!"

26. Yet I would bear my shortcomings
27. With meet tranquillity,
28. But for the charge that blessed things
29. I'd liefer have unbe.

30. O, doth a bird deprived of wings
31. Go earth-bound wilfully!
32. .     .     .     .
33. Enough. As yet disquiet clings
34. About us. Rest shall we.
