1. THE years have gathered grayly
2. Since I danced upon this leaze
3. With one who kindled gayly
4. Love's fitful ecstasies!
5. But despite the term as teacher,
6. I remain what I was then
7. In each essential feature
8. Of the fantasies of men.

9. Yet I note the little chisel
10. Of ever-napping Time,
11. Defacing ghast and grizzel
12. The blazon of my prime.
13. When at night he thinks me sleeping,
14. I feel him boring sly
15. Within my bones, and heaping
16. Quaintest pains for by-and-by.

17. Still, I'd go the world with Beauty,
18. I would laugh with her and sing,
19. I would shun divinest duty
20. To resume her worshipping.
21. But she'd scorn my brave endeavor,
22. She would not balm the breeze
23. By murmuring, "Thine for ever!"
24. As she did upon this leaze.
