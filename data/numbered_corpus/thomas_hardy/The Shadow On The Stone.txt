1. I went by the Druid stone
2. That broods in the garden white and lone,
3. And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows
4. That at some moments fall thereon
5. From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing,
6. And they shaped in my imagining
7. To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders
8. Threw there when she was gardening.

9. I thought her behind my back,
10. Yea, her I long had learned to lack,
11. And I said: ‘I am sure you are standing behind me,
12. Though how do you get into this old track?’
13. And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf
14. As a sad response; and to keep down grief
15. I would not turn my head to discover
16. That there was nothing in my belief.

17. Yet I wanted to look and see
18. That nobody stood at the back of me;
19. But I thought once more: ‘Nay, I’ll not unvision
20. A shape which, somehow, there may be.’
21. So I went on softly from the glade,
22. And left her behind me throwing her shade,
23. As she were indeed an apparition—
24. My head unturned lest my dream should fade.
