1. You did not walk with me
2. Of late to the hill-top tree
3. As in earlier days,
4. By the gated ways:
5. You were weak and lame,
6. So you never came,
7. And I went alone, and I did not mind,
8. Not thinking of you as left behind.


9. I walked up there to-day
10. Just in the former way:
11. Surveyed around
12. The familiar ground
13. By myself again:
14. What difference, then?
15. Only that underlying sense
16. Of the look of a room on returning thence.
