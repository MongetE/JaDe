1. THREE captains went to Indian wars,
2. And only one returned:
3. Their mate of yore, he singly wore
4. The laurels all had earned.

5. At home he sought the ancient aisle
6. Wherein, untrumped of fame,
7. The three had sat in pupilage,
8. And each had carved his name.

9. The names, rough-hewn, of equal size,
10. Stood on the panel still;
11. Unequal since.--"'Twas theirs to aim,
12. Mine was it to fulfil!"

13. --"Who saves his life shall lose it, friends!"
14. Outspake the preacher then,
15. Unweeting he his listener, who
16. Looked at the names again.

17. That he had come and they'd been stayed,
18. 'Twas but the chance of war:
19. Another chance, and they'd sat here,
20. And he had lain afar.

21. Yet saw he something in the lives
22. Of those who'd ceased to live
23. That rounded them with majesty
24. Which living failed to give.

25. Transcendent triumph in return
26. No longer lit his brain;
27. Transcendence rayed the distant urn
28. Where slept the fallen twain.
