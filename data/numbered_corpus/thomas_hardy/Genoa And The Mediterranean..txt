1. O epic-famed, god-haunted Central Sea,
2. Heave careless of the deep wrong done to thee
3. When from Torino's track I saw thy face first flash on me.

4. And multimarbled Genova the Proud,
5. Gleam all unconscious how, wide-lipped, up-browed,
6. I first beheld thee clad--not as the Beauty but the Dowd.

7. Out from a deep-delved way my vision lit
8. On housebacks pink, green, ochreous--where a slit
9. Shoreward 'twixt row and row revealed the classic blue through it.

10. And thereacross waved fishwives' high-hung smocks,
11. Chrome kerchiefs, scarlet hose, darned underfrocks;
12. Since when too oft my dreams of thee, O Queen, that frippery mocks:

13. Whereat I grieve, Superba! . . . Afterhours
14. Within Palazzo Doria's orange bowers
15. Went far to mend these marrings of thy soul-subliming powers.

16. But, Queen, such squalid undress none should see,
17. Those dream-endangering eyewounds no more be
18. Where lovers first behold thy form in pilgrimage to thee.
