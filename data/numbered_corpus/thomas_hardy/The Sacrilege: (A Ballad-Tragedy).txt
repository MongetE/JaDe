1. PART I

2. 'I have a Love I love too well
3. Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor;
4. I have a Love I love too well,
5. To whom, ere she was mine,
6. 'Such is my love for you,' I said,
7. 'That you shall have to hood your head
8. A silken kerchief crimson-red,
9. Wove finest of the fine.'

10. 'And since this Love, for one mad moon,
11. On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor,
12. Since this my Love for one mad moon
13. Did clasp me as her king,
14. I snatched a silk-piece red and rare
15. From off a stall at Priddy Fair,
16. For handkerchief to hood her hair
17. When we went gallanting.

18. 'Full soon the four weeks neared their end
19. Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor;
20. And when the four weeks neared their end,
21. And their swift sweets outwore,
22. I said, 'What shall I do to own
23. Those beauties bright as tulips blown,
24. And keep you here with me alone
25. As mine for evermore?'

26. 'And as she drowsed within my van
27. On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor -
28. And as she drowsed within my van,
29. And dawning turned to day,
30. She heavily raised her sloe-black eyes
31. And murmured back in softest wise,
32. 'One more thing. and the charms you prize
33. Are yours henceforth for aye.

34. ''And swear I will I'll never go
35. While Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor
36. To meet the Cornish Wrestler Joe
37. For dance and dallyings.
38. If you'll to yon cathedral shrine,
39. And finger from the chest divine
40. Treasure to buy me ear-drops fine,
41. And richly jewelled rings.'

42. 'I said: 'I am one who has gathered gear
43. From Marlbury Downs to Dunkery Tor,
44. Who has gathered gear for many a year
45. From mansion, mart and fair;
46. But at God's house I've stayed my hand,
47. Hearing within me some command -
48. Curbed by a law not of the land
49. From doing damage there.'

50. 'Whereat she pouts, this Love of mine,
51. As Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor,
52. And still she pouts, this Love of mine,
53. So cityward I go.
54. But ere I start to do the thing,
55. And speed my souls imperilling
56. One who is my ravishing
57. And all the joy I know,

58. 'I come to lay this charge on thee -
59. On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor -
60. I come to lay this charge on thee
61. With solemn speech and sign:
62. Should things go ill, and my life pay
63. For botchery in this rash assay,
64. You are to take hers likewise - yea,
65. The month the law takes mine.

66. 'For should my rival, Wrestler Joe,
67. Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor -
68. My reckless rival, Wrestler Joe,
69. My Love's possessor be,
70. My tortured spirit would not rest,
71. But wander weary and distrest
72. Throughout the world in wild protest:
73. The thought nigh maddens me!'

74. PART II

75. Thus did he speak - this brother of mine -
76. On Exon Wild by Dunkery Tor,
77. Born at my birth of mother of mine,
78. And forthwith went his way
79. To dare the deed some coming night….
80. I kept the watch with shaking sight,
81. The moon at moments breaking bright,
82. At others glooming gray.

83. Three full days I heard no sound
84. Where Dunkery frowns on Exon Moor,
85. I heard no sound at all around
86. Whether his fay prevailed,
87. Or one malign the master were,
88. Till some afoot did tidings bear
89. How that, for all his practised care,
90. He had been caught and jailed.

91. They had heard a crash when twelve had chimed
92. By Mendip east of Dunkery Tor,
93. When twelve had chimed and moonlight climbed;
94. They watched, and he was tracked
95. By arch and aisle and saint and knight
96. Of sculptured stonework sheeted white
97. In the cathedral's ghostly light,
98. And captured in the act.

99. Yes; for this Love he loved too well
100. Where Dunkery sights the Severn shore,
101. All for this Love he loved too well
102. He burst the holy bars,
103. Seized golden vessels from the chest
104. To buy her ornaments of the best,
105. At her ill-witchery's request
106. And lure of eyes like stars….

107. When blustering March confused the sky
108. In Toneborough Town by Exon Moor,
109. When blustering March confused the sky
110. They stretched him; and he died.
111. Down in the crowd where I, to see
112. The end of him, stood silently,
113. With a set face he lipped to me -
114. 'Remember.' 'Ay!' I cried.

115. By night and day I shadowed her
116. From Toneborough Deane to Dunkery Tor,
117. I shadowed her asleep, astir,
118. And yet I could not bear -
119. Till Wrestler Joe anon began
120. To figure as her chosen man,
121. And took her to his shining van -
122. To doom a form so fair!

123. He made it handsome for her sake -
124. And Dunkery smiled to Exon Moor -
125. He made it handsome for her sake,
126. Painting it out and in;
127. And on the door of apple-green
128. A bright brass knocker soon was seen,
129. And window-curtains white and clean
130. For her to sit within.

131. And all could see she clave to him
132. As cleaves a cloud to Dunkery Tor,
133. Yea, all could see she clave to him,
134. And every day I said,
135. 'A pity it seems to part those two
136. That hourly grow to love more true:
137. Yet she's the wanton woman who
138. Sent one to swing till dead!'

139. That blew to blazing all my hate,
140. While Dunkery frowned on Exon Moor,
141. And when the river swelled, her fate
142. Came to her pitilessly….
143. I dogged her, crying: 'Across that plank
144. They use as bridge to reach yon bank
145. A coat and hat lie limp and dank;
146. Your goodman's, can they be?'

147. She paled, and went, I close behind -
148. And Exon frowned to Dunkery Tor,
149. She went, and I came up behind
150. And tipped the plank that bore
151. Her, fleetly flitting across to eye
152. What such might bode. She slid awry;
153. And from the current came a cry,
154. A gurgle; and no more.

155. How that befell no mortal knew
156. From Marlbury Downs to Exon Moor;
157. No mortal knew that deed undue
158. But he who schemed the crime,
159. Which night still covers…. But in dream
160. Those ropes of hair upon the stream
161. He sees, and he will hear that scream
162. Until his judgment-time.
