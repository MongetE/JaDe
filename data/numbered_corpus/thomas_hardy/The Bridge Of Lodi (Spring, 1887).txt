1. I

2. When of tender mind and body
3. I was moved by minstrelsy,
4. And that strain "The Bridge of Lodi"
5. Brought a strange delight to me.

6. II

7. In the battle-breathing jingle
8. Of its forward-footing tune
9. I could see the armies mingle,
10. And the columns cleft and hewn

11. III

12. On that far-famed spot by Lodi
13. Where Napoleon clove his way
14. To his fame, when like a god he
15. Bent the nations to his sway.

16. IV

17. Hence the tune came capering to me
18. While I traced the Rhone and Po;
19. Nor could Milan's Marvel woo me
20. From the spot englamoured so.

21. V

22. And to-day, sunlit and smiling,
23. Here I stand upon the scene,
24. With its saffron walls, dun tiling,
25. And its meads of maiden green,

26. VI

27. Even as when the trackway thundered
28. With the charge of grenadiers,
29. And the blood of forty hundred
30. Splashed its parapets and piers . . .

31. VII

32. Any ancient crone I'd toady
33. Like a lass in young-eyed prime,
34. Could she tell some tale of Lodi
35. At that moving mighty time.

36. VIII

37. So, I ask the wives of Lodi
38. For traditions of that day;
39. But alas! not anybody
40. Seems to know of such a fray.

41. IX

42. And they heed but transitory
43. Marketings in cheese and meat,
44. Till I judge that Lodi's story
45. Is extinct in Lodi's street.

46. X

47. Yet while here and there they thrid them
48. In their zest to sell and buy,
49. Let me sit me down amid them
50. And behold those thousands die . . .

51. XI

52. - Not a creature cares in Lodi
53. How Napoleon swept each arch,
54. Or where up and downward trod he,
55. Or for his memorial March!

56. XII

57. So that wherefore should I be here,
58. Watching Adda lip the lea,
59. When the whole romance to see here
60. Is the dream I bring with me?

61. XIII

62. And why sing "The Bridge of Lodi"
63. As I sit thereon and swing,
64. When none shows by smile or nod he
65. Guesses why or what I sing? . . .

66. XIV

67. Since all Lodi, low and head ones,
68. Seem to pass that story by,
69. It may be the Lodi-bred ones
70. Rate it truly, and not I.

71. XV

72. Once engrossing Bridge of Lodi,
73. Is thy claim to glory gone?
74. Must I pipe a palinody,
75. Or be silent thereupon?

76. XVI

77. And if here, from strand to steeple,
78. Be no stone to fame the fight,
79. Must I say the Lodi people
80. Are but viewing crime aright?

81. Nay; I'll sing "The Bridge of Lodi" -
82. That long-loved, romantic thing,
83. Though none show by smile or nod he
84. Guesses why and what I sing!
