1. 'It is a foolish thing,' said I,
2. 'To bear with such, and pass it by;
3. Yet so I do, I know not why!'


4. And at each clash I would surmise
5. That if I had acted otherwise
6. I might have saved me many sighs.


7. But now the only happiness
8. In looking back that I possess -
9. Whose lack would leave me comfortless -


10. Is to remember I refrained
11. From masteries I might have gained,
12. And for my tolerance was disdained;


13. For see, a tomb. And if it were
14. I had bent and broke, I should not dare
15. To linger in the shadows there.
