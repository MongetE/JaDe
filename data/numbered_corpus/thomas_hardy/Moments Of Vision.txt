1. That mirror
2. Which makes of men a transparency,
3. Who holds that mirror
4. And bids us such a breast-bare spectacle see
5. Of you and me?

6. That mirror
7. Whose magic penetrates like a dart,
8. Who lifts that mirror
9. And throws our mind back on us, and our heart,
10. until we start?

11. That mirror
12. Works well in these night hours of ache;
13. Why in that mirror
14. Are tincts we never see ourselves once take
15. When the world is awake?

16. That mirror
17. Can test each mortal when unaware;
18. Yea, that strange mirror
19. May catch his last thoughts, whole life foul or fair,
20. Glassing it -- where?
