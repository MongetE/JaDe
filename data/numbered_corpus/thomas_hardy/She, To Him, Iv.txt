1. This love puts all humanity from me;
2. I can but maledict her, pray her dead,
3. For giving love and getting love of thee—
4. Feeding a heart that else mine own had fed!

5. How much I love I know not, life not known,
6. Save as some unit I would add love by;
7. But this I know, my being is but thine own—
8. Fused from its separateness by ecstasy.

9. And thus I grasp thy amplitudes, of her
10. Ungrasped, though helped by nigh-regarding eyes;
11. Canst thou then hate me as an envier
12. Who see unrecked what I so dearly prize?
13. Believe me, Lost One, Love is lovelier
14. The more it shapes its moans in selfish-wise.
