1. When wilt thou wake, O Mother, wake and see -
2. As one who, held in trance, has laboured long
3. By vacant rote and prepossession strong -
4. The coils that thou hast wrought unwittingly;

5. Wherein have place, unrealized by thee,
6. Fair growths, foul cankers, right enmeshed with wrong,
7. Strange orchestras of victim-shriek and song,
8. And curious blends of ache and ecstasy? -

9. Should that morn come, and show thy opened eyes
10. All that Life's palpitating tissues feel,
11. How wilt thou bear thyself in thy surprise? -

12. Wilt thou destroy, in one wild shock of shame,
13. Thy whole high heaving firmamental frame,
14. Or patiently adjust, amend, and heal?
