1. THEY bear him to his resting-place--
2. In slow procession sweeping by;
3. I follow at a stranger's space;
4. His kindred they, his sweetheart I.
5. Unchanged my gown of garish dye,
6. Though sable-sad is their attire;
7. But they stand round with griefless eye,
8. Whilst my regret consumes like fire!
