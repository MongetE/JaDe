1. When mid-autumn's moan shook the night-time,
2. And sedges were horny,
3. And summer's green wonderwork faltered
4. On leaze and in lane,

5. I fared Yell'ham-Firs way, where dimly
6. Came wheeling around me
7. Those phantoms obscure and insistent
8. That shadows unchain.

9. Till airs from the needle-thicks brought me
10. A low lamentation,
11. As 'twere of a tree-god disheartened,
12. Perplexed, or in pain.

13. And, heeding, it awed me to gather
14. That Nature herself there
15. Was breathing in aerie accents,
16. With dirgeful refrain,

17. Weary plaint that Mankind, in these late days,
18. Had grieved her by holding
19. Her ancient high fame of perfection
20. In doubt and disdain...

21. - 'I had not proposed me a Creature
22. (She soughed)  so excelling
23. All else of my kingdom in compass
24. And brightness of brain

25. 'As to read my defects with a god-glance,
26. Uncover each vestige
27. Of old inadvertence, annunciate
28. Each flaw and each stain!

29. 'My purpose went not to develop
30. Such insight in Earthland;
31. Such potent appraisements affront me,
32. And sadden my reign!

33. 'Why loosened I olden control here
34. To mechanize skywards,
35. Undeeming great scope could outshape in
36. A globe of such grain?

37. 'Man's mountings of mind-sight I checked not,
38. Till range of his vision
39. Has topped my intent, and found blemish
40. Throughout my domain.

41. 'He holds as inept his own soul-shell -
42. My deftest achievement -
43. Contemns me for fitful inventions
44. Ill-timed and inane:

45. 'No more sees my sun as a Sanct-shape,
46. My moon as the Night-queen,
47. My stars as august and sublime ones
48. That influences rain:

49. 'Reckons gross and ignoble my teaching,
50. Immoral my story,
51. My love-lights a lure, that my species
52. May gather and gain.

53. ''Give me,' he has said, 'but the matter
54. And means the gods lot her,
55. My brain could evolve a creation
56. More seemly, more sane.'

57. - 'If ever a naughtiness seized me
58. To woo adulation
59. From creatures more keen than those crude ones
60. That first formed my train -

61. 'If inly a moment I murmured,
62. 'The simple praise sweetly,
63. But sweetlier the sage'- and did rashly
64. Man's vision unrein,

65. 'I rue it! ... His guileless forerunners,
66. Whose brains I could blandish,
67. To measure the deeps of my mysteries
68. Applied them in vain.

69. 'From them my waste aimings and futile
70. I subtly could cover;
71. 'Every best thing,' said they, 'to best purpose
72. Her powers preordain.' -

73. 'No more such! ... My species are dwindling,
74. My forests grow barren,
75. My popinjays fail from their tappings,
76. My larks from their strain.

77. 'My leopardine beauties are rarer,
78. My tusky ones vanish,
79. My children have aped mine own slaughters
80. To quicken my wane.

81. 'Let me grow, then, but mildews and mandrakes,
82. And slimy distortions,
83. Let nevermore things good and lovely
84. To me appertain;

85. 'For Reason is rank in my temples,
86. And Vision unruly,
87. And chivalrous laud of my cunning
88. Is heard not again! '
