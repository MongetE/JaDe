1. I

2. Past the hills that peep
3. Where the leaze is smiling,
4. On and on beguiling
5. Crisply-cropping sheep;
6. Under boughs of brushwood
7. Linking tree and tree
8. In a shade of lushwood,
9. There caressed we!

10. II

11. Hemmed by city walls
12. That outshut the sunlight,
13. In a foggy dun light,
14. Where the footstep falls
15. With a pit-pat wearisome
16. In its cadency
17. On the flagstones drearisome
18. There pressed we!

19. III

20. Where in wild-winged crowds
21. Blown birds show their whiteness
22. Up against the lightness
23. Of the clammy clouds;
24. By the random river
25. Pushing to the sea,
26. Under bents that quiver
27. There rest we.
