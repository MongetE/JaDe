1. "O 'Melia, my dear, this does everything crown!
2. Who could have supposed I should meet you in Town?
3. And whence such fair garments, such prosperi-ty?"-
4. "O didn't you know I'd been ruined?" said she.

5. -"You left us in tatters, without shoes or socks,
6. Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up docks;
7. And now you've gay bracelets and bright feathers three!"-
8. "Yes: that's how we dress when we're ruined," said she.

9. -"At home in the barton you said 'thee' and 'thou,'
10. And 'thik oon' and 'the√§s oon' and 't'other'; but now
11. Your talking quite fits 'ee for high compan-ny!"-
12. "Some polish is gained with one's ruin," said she.

13. -"Your hands were like paws then, you face blue and bleak
14. But now I'm bewitched by your delicate cheek,
15. And your little gloves fit as on any la-dy!"-
16. "We never do work when we're ruined," said she.

17. -"You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream,
18. And you'd sigh, and you'd sock; but at present you seem
19. To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!"-
20. "True. One's pretty lively when ruined," said she.

21. -"I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown,
22. And a delicate face, and could strut about Town"-
23. "My dear - raw country girl, such as you be,

24. Cannot quite expect that. You ain't ruined," said she.
