1. I thought you a fire
2. On Heron-Plantation Hill,
3. Dealing out mischief the most dire
4. To the chattels of men of hire
5. There in their vill.

6. But by and by
7. You turned a yellow-green,
8. Like a large glow-worm in the sky;
9. And then I could descry
10. Your mood and mien.

11. How well I know
12. Your furtive feminine shape!
13. As if reluctantly you show
14. You nude of cloud, and but by favour throw
15. Aside its drape . . .

16. -How many a year
17. Have you kept pace with me,
18. Wan Woman of the waste up there,
19. Behind a hedge, or the bare
20. Bough of a tree!

21. No novelty are you,
22. O Lady of all my time,
23. Veering unbid into my view
24. Whether I near Death's mew,
25. Or Life's top cyme!
