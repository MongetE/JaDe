1. By Mellstock Lodge and Avenue
2. Towards her door I went,
3. And sunset on her window-panes
4. Reflected our intent.

5. The creeper on the gable nigh
6. Was fired to more than red
7. And when I came to halt thereby
8. "Bright as my joy!" I said.

9. Of late days it had been her aim
10. To meet me in the hall;
11. Now at my footsteps no one came;
12. And no one to my call.

13. Again I knocked; and tardily
14. An inner step was heard,
15. And I was shown her presence then
16. With scarce an answering word.

17. She met me, and but barely took
18. My proffered warm embrace;
19. Preoccupation weighed her look,
20. And hardened her sweet face.

21. "To-morrow--could you--would you call?
22. Make brief your present stay?
23. My child is ill--my one, my all! -
24. And can't be left to-day."

25. And then she turns, and gives commands
26. As I were out of sound,
27. Or were no more to her and hers
28. Than any neighbour round . . .

29. - As maid I wooed her; but one came
30. And coaxed her heart away,
31. And when in time he wedded her
32. I deemed her gone for aye.

33. He won, I lost her; and my loss
34. I bore I know not how;
35. But I do think I suffered then
36. Less wretchedness than now.

37. For Time, in taking him, had oped
38. An unexpected door
39. Of bliss for me, which grew to seem
40. Far surer than before . . .

41. Her word is steadfast, and I know
42. That plighted firm are we:
43. But she has caught new love-calls since
44. She smiled as maid on me!
