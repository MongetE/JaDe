1. With Thoughts of Sergeant M---- (Pensioner), who died 185-

2. "WHY, Sergeant, stray on the Ivel Way,
3. As though at home there were spectres rife?
4. From first to last 'twas a proud career!
5. And your sunny years with a gracious wife
6. Have brought you a daughter dear.

7. "I watched her to-day; a more comely maid,
8. As she danced in her muslin bowed with blue,
9. Round a Hintock maypole never gayed."
10. --"Aye, aye; I watched her this day, too,
11. As it happens," the Sergeant said.

12. "My daughter is now," he again began,
13. "Of just such an age as one I knew
14. When we of the Line, in the Foot-Guard van,
15. On an August morning--a chosen few--
16. Stormed San Sebastian.

17. "She's a score less three; so about was she--
18. The maiden I wronged in Peninsular days....
19. You may prate of your prowess in lusty times,
20. But as years gnaw inward you blink your bays,
21. And see too well your crimes!

22. "We'd stormed it at night, by the vlanker-light
23. Of burning towers, and the mortar's boom:
24. We'd topped the breach but had failed to stay,
25. For our files were misled by the baffling gloom;
26. And we said we'd storm by day.

27. "So, out of the trenches, with features set,
28. On that hot, still morning, in measured pace,
29. Our column climbed; climbed higher yet,
30. Past the fauss'bray, scarp, up the curtain-face,
31. And along the parapet.

32. "From the batteried hornwork the cannoneers
33. Hove crashing balls of iron fire;
34. On the shaking gap mount the volunteers
35. In files, and as they mount expire
36. Amid curses, groans, and cheers.

37. "Five hours did we storm, five hours re-form,
38. As Death cooled those hot blood pricked on;
39. Till our cause was helped by a woe within;
40. They swayed from the summit we'd leapt upon,
41. And madly we entered in.

42. "On end for plunder, 'mid rain and thunder
43. That burst with the lull of our cannonade,
44. We vamped the streets in the stifling air--
45. Our hunger unsoothed, our thirst unstayed--
46. And ransacked the buildings there.

47. "Down the stony steps of the house-fronts white
48. We rolled rich puncheons of Spanish grape,
49. Till at length, with the fire of the wine alight,
50. I saw at a doorway a fair fresh shape--
51. A woman, a sylph, or sprite.

52. "Afeard she fled, and with heated head
53. I pursued to the chamber she called her own;
54. --When might is right no qualms deter,
55. And having her helpless and alone
56. I wreaked my lust on her.

57. "She raised her beseeching eyes to me,
58. And I heard the words of prayer she sent
59. In her own soft language.... Seemingly
60. I copied those eyes for my punishment
61. In begetting the girl you see!

62. "So, to-day I stand with a God-set brand
63. Like Cain's, when he wandered from kindred's ken....
64. I served through the war that made Europe free;
65. I wived me in peace-year. But, hid from men,
66. I bear that mark on me.

67. "And I nightly stray on the Ivel Way
68. As though at home there were spectres rife;
69. I delight me not in my proud career;
70. And 'tis coals of fire that a gracious wife
71. Should have brought me a daughter dear!"
