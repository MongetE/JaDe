1. While the far farewell music thins and fails,
2. And the broad bottoms rip the bearing brine -
3. All smalling slowly to the gray sea line -
4. And each significant red smoke-shaft pales,

5. Keen sense of severance everywhere prevails,
6. Which shapes the late long tramp of mounting men
7. To seeming words that ask and ask again:
8. "How long, O striving Teutons, Slavs, and Gaels

9. Must your wroth reasonings trade on lives like these,
10. That are as puppets in a playing hand? -
11. When shall the saner softer polities
12. Whereof we dream, have play in each proud land,
13. And patriotism, grown Godlike, scorn to stand
14. Bondslave to realms, but circle earth and seas?"
