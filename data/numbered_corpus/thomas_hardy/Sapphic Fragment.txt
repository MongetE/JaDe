1. "Thou shalt be--Nothing."--Omar Khayyam.
2. "Tombless, with no remembrance."--W. Shakespeare.

3. Dead shalt thou lie; and nought
4. Be told of thee or thought,
5. For thou hast plucked not of the Muses' tree:
6. And even in Hades' halls
7. Amidst thy fellow-thralls
8. No friendly shade thy shade shall company!
