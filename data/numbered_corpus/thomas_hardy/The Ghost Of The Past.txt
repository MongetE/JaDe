1. We two kept house, the Past and I,
2. The Past and I;
3. I tended while it hovered nigh,
4. Leaving me never alone.
5. It was a spectral housekeeping
6. Where fell no jarring tone,
7. As strange, as still a housekeeping
8. As ever has been known.

9. As daily I went up the stair,
10. And down the stair,
11. I did not mind the Bygone there --
12. The Present once to me;
13. Its moving meek companionship
14. I wished might ever be,
15. There was in that companionship
16. Something of ecstasy.

17. It dwelt with me just as it was,
18. Just as it was
19. When first its prospects gave me pause
20. In wayward wanderings,
21. Before the years had torn old troths
22. As they tear all sweet things,
23. Before gaunt griefs had torn old troths
24. And dulled old rapturings.

25. And then its form began to fade,
26. Began to fade,
27. Its gentle echoes faintlier played
28. At eves upon my ear
29. Than when the autumn's look embrowned
30. The lonely chambers here,
31. The autumn's settling shades embrowned
32. Nooks that it haunted near.

33. And so with time my vision less,
34. Yea, less and less
35. Makes of that Past my housemistress,
36. It dwindles in my eye;
37. It looms a far-off skeleton
38. And not a comrade nigh,
39. A fitful far-off skeleton
40. Dimming as days draw by.
