1. How I was caught
2. Hieing home, after days of allure,
3. And driven to an inn—small, obscure—
4. At the junction, fret-fraught!

5. How civil my face
6. To get them to chamber me there—
7. A roof I had passed scarce aware
8. That it stood at the place.

9. And how all the night
10. I had dreams of the unwitting cause
11. Of my lodgment. How lonely I was;
12. How consoled by her sprite!

13. Thus onetime to me
14. Dim wastes of dead years bar away
15. Then from now! But the like haps to-day
16. To young lovers, may be.

17. Years, years as gray seas,
18. Truly, stretch now between! Less and less
19. Shrink the visions then great in me.—Yes,
20. Then in me. Now in these.
