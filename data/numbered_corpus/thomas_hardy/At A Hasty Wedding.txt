1. If hours be years the twain are blest,
2. For now they solace swift desire
3. By bonds of every bond the best,
4. If hours be years. The twain are blest
5. Do eastern stars slope never west,
6. Nor pallid ashes follow fire:
7. If hours be years the twain are blest,
8. For now they solace swift desire.
