1. I come to interview a Voiceless ghost;
2. Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me?
3. Up the cliff, down, till I'm lonely, lost,
4. And the unseen waters' soliloquies awe me.
5. Where you will next be there's no knowing,
6. Facing round about me everywhere,
7. With your nut-coloured hair,
8. And gray eyes, and rose-flush coming and going.


9. Yes: I have re-entered your olden haunts at last;
10. Through the years, through the dead scenes I have tracked you;
11. What have you now found to say of our past -
12. Viewed across the dark space wherein I have lacked you?
13. Summer gave us sweets, but autumn wrought division?
14. Things were not lastly as firstly well
15. With us twain, you tell?
16. But all's closed now, despite Time's derision.


17. I see what you are doing: you are leading me on
18. To the spots we knew when we haunted here together,
19. The waterfall, above which the mist-bow shone
20. At the then fair hour in the then fair weather,
21. And the cave just under, with a voice still so hollow
22. That it seems to call out to me from forty years ago,
23. When you were all aglow,
24. And not the thin ghost that I now frailly follow!


25. Ignorant of what there is flitting here to see,
26. The waked birds preen and the seals flop lazily,
27. Soon you will have, Dear, to vanish from me,
28. For the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily.
29. Trust me, I mind not, though Life lours,
30. The bringing of me here; nay, bring me here again!
31. I am just the same as when
32. Our days were a joy, and our paths through flowers.
