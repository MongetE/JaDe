1. He often would ask us
2. That, when he died,
3. After playing so many
4. To their last rest,
5. If out of us any
6. Should here abide,
7. And it would not task us,
8. We would with our lutes
9. Play over him
10. By his grave-brim
11. The psalm he liked best—
12. The one whose sense suits
13. 'Mount Ephraim'—
14. And perhaps we should seem
15. To him, in Death's dream,
16. Like the seraphim.

17. As soon as I knew
18. That his spirit was gone
19. I thought this his due,
20. And spoke thereupon.
21. 'I think', said the vicar,
22. 'A read service quicker
23. Than viols out-of-doors
24. In these frosts and hoars.
25. That old-fashioned way
26. Requires a fine day,
27. And it seems to me
28. It had better not be.'
29. Hence, that afternoon,
30. Though never knew he
31. That his wish could not be,
32. To get through it faster
33. They buried the master
34. Without any tune.

35. But 'twas said that, when
36. At the dead of next night
37. The vicar looked out,
38. There struck on his ken
39. Thronged roundabout,
40. Where the frost was graying
41. The headstoned grass,
42. A band all in white
43. Like the saints in church-glass,
44. Singing and playing
45. The ancient stave
46. By the choirmaster's grave.

47. Such the tenor man told
48. When he had grown old.
