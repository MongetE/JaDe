1. I found me in a great surging space,
2. At either end a door,
3. And I said: "What is this giddying place,
4. With no firm-fix√©d floor,
5. That I knew not of before?"
6. "It is Life," said a mask-clad face.

7. I asked: "But how do I come here,
8. Who never wished to come;
9. Can the light and air be made more clear,
10. The floor more quietsome,
11. And the doors set wide? They numb
12. Fast-locked, and fill with fear."

13. The mask put on a bleak smile then,
14. And said, "O vassal-wight,
15. There once complained a goosequill pen
16. To the scribe of the Infinite
17. Of the words it had to write
18. Because they were past its ken."
