1. Just at the corner of the wall
2. We met - yes, he and I -
3. Who had not faced in camp or hall
4. Since we bade home good-bye,
5. And what once happened came back - all -
6. Out of those years gone by.


7. And that strange woman whom we knew
8. And loved - long dead and gone,
9. Whose poor half-perished residue,
10. Tombless and trod, lay yon!
11. But at this moment to our view
12. Rose like a phantom wan.


13. And in his fixed face I could see,
14. Lit by a lurid shine,
15. The drama re-enact which she
16. Had dyed incarnadine
17. For us, and more. And doubtless he
18. Beheld it too in mine.


19. A start, as at one slightly known,
20. And with an indifferent air
21. We passed, without a sign being shown
22. That, as it real were,
23. A memory-acted scene had thrown
24. Its tragic shadow there.
