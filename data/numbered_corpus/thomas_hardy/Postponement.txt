1. SNOW-BOUND in woodland, a mournful word,
2. Dropt now and then from the bill of a bird,
3. Reached me on wind-wafts; and thus I heard,
4. Wearily waiting:--

5. "I planned her a nest in a leafless tree,
6. But the passers eyed and twitted me,
7. And said: 'How reckless a bird is he,
8. Cheerily mating!'

9. "Fear-filled, I stayed me till summer-tide,
10. In lewth of leaves to throne her bride;
11. But alas! her love for me waned and died,
12. Wearily waiting.

13. "Ah, had I been like some I see,
14. Born to an evergreen nesting-tree,
15. None had eyed and twitted me,
16. Cheerily mating!"
