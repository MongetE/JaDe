1. Between the folding sea-downs,
2. In the gloom
3. Of a wailful wintry nightfall,
4. When the boom
5. Of the ocean, like a hammering in a hollow tomb,

6. Throbbed up the copse-clothed valley
7. From the shore
8. To the chamber where I darkled,
9. Sunk and sore
10. With gray ponderings why my Loved one had not come before

11. To salute me in the dwelling
12. That of late
13. I had hired to waste a while in -
14. Vague of date,
15. Quaint, and remote - wherein I now expectant sate;

16. On the solitude, unsignalled,
17. Broke a man
18. Who, in air as if at home there,
19. Seemed to scan
20. Every fire-flecked nook of the apartment span by span.

21. A stranger's and no lover's
22. Eyes were these,
23. Eyes of a man who measures
24. What he sees
25. But vaguely, as if wrapt in filmy phantasies.

26. Yea, his bearing was so absent
27. As he stood, It bespoke a chord so plaintive
28. In his mood, That soon I judged he would not wrong my quietude.

29. 'Ah - the supper is just ready,'
30. Then he said,
31. 'And the years' - long binned Madeira
32. Flashes red!'
33. (There was no wine, no food, no supper-table spread.)

34. 'You will forgive my coming,
35. Lady fair?
36. I see you as at that time
37. Rising there,
38. The self-same curious querying in your eyes and hair.


39. 'Yet no. How so? You wear not
40. The same gown,
41. Your locks show woful difference,
42. Are not brown:
43. What, is it not as when I hither came from town?


44. 'And the place…. But you seem other -
45. Can it be?
46. What's this that Time is doing
47. Unto me?
48. You dwell here, unknown woman?… Whereabouts, then, is she?


49. 'And the house-things are much shifted. -
50. Put them where
51. They stood on this nights fellow;
52. Shift her chair:
53. Here was the couch: and the piano should be there.'


54. I indulged him, verily nerve-strained
55. Being alone,
56. And I moved the things as bidden.
57. One by one,
58. And feigned to push the old piano where he had shown.


59. 'Aha - now I can see her!
60. Stand aside:
61. Don't thrust her from the table
62. Where, meek-eyed,
63. She makes attempt with matron-manners to preside.


64. 'She serves me: now she rises,
65. Goes to play….
66. But you obstruct her, fill her
67. With dismay,
68. And embarrassed, scared, she vanishes away!'


69. And, as 'twere useless longer
70. To persist,
71. He sighed, and sought the entry
72. Ere I wist,
73. And retreated, disappearing soundless in the mist.


74. That here some mighty passion
75. Once had burned,
76. Which still the walls enghosted,
77. I discerned,
78. And that by its strong spell mine might be overturned.


79. I sat depressed; till, later,
80. My Love came;
81. But something in the chamber
82. Dimmed our flame, -
83. An emanation, making our due words fall tame,


84. As if the intenser drama
85. Shown me there
86. Of what the walls had witnessed
87. Filled the air,
88. And left no room for later passion anywhere.


89. So came it that our fervours
90. Did quite fail
91. Of future consummation -
92. Being made quail
93. By the weird witchery of the parlour's hidden tale,


94. Which I, as years passed, faintly
95. Learnt to trace, -
96. One of sad love, born full-winged
97. In that place
98. Where the predestined sorrowers first stood face to face.


99. And as that month of winter
100. Circles round,
101. And the evening of the date-day
102. Grows embrowned,
103. I am conscious of those presences, and sit spellbound.


104. There, often - lone, forsaken -
105. Queries breed
106. Within me; whether a phantom
107. Had my heed
108. On that strange night, or was it some wrecked heart indeed?
