1. How she would have loved
2. A party to-day! -
3. Bright-hatted and gloved,
4. With table and tray
5. And chairs on the lawn
6. Her smiles would have shone
7. With welcomings…. But
8. She is shut, she is shut
9. From friendship's spell
10. In the jailing shell
11. Of her tiny cell.


12. Or she would have reigned
13. At a dinner tonight
14. With ardours unfeigned,
15. And a generous delight;
16. All in her abode
17. She'd have freely bestowed
18. On her guests…. But alas,
19. She is shut under grass
20. Where no cups flow,
21. Powerless to know
22. That it might be so.


23. And she would have sought
24. With a child's eager glance
25. The shy snowdrops brought
26. By the new year's advance,
27. And peered in the rime
28. Of Candlemas-time
29. For crocuses… chanced
30. It that she were not tranced
31. From sights she loved best;
32. Wholly possessed
33. By an infinite rest!


34. And we are here staying
35. Amid these stale things
36. Who care not for gaying,
37. And those junketings
38. That wed so to joy her,
39. And never to cloy her
40. As us they cloy!… But
41. She is shut, she is shut
42. From the cheer of them, dead
43. To all done and said
44. In a yew-arched bed.
