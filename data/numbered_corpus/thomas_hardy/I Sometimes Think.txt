1. For F. E. H.

2. I sometimes think as here I sit
3. Of things I have done,
4. Which seemed in doing not unfit
5. To face the sun:
6. Yet never a soul has paused a whit
7. On such-not one.

8. There was that eager strenuous press
9. To sow good seed;
10. There was that saving from distress
11. In the nick of need;
12. There were those words in the wilderness:
13. Who cared to heed?

14. Yet can this be full true, or no?
15. For one did care,
16. And, spiriting into my house, to, fro,
17. Like wind on the stair,
18. Cares still, heeds all, and will, even though
19. I may despair.
