1. I sang that song on Sunday,
2. To witch an idle while,
3. I sang that song on Monday,
4. As fittest to beguile;
5. I sang it as the year outwore,
6. And the new slid in;
7. I thought not what might shape before
8. Another would begin.

9. I sang that song in summer,
10. All unforeknowingly,
11. To him as a new-comer
12. From regions strange to me:
13. I sang it when in afteryears
14. The shades stretched out,
15. And paths were faint; and flocking fears
16. Brought cup-eyed care and doubt.

17. Sings he that song on Sundays
18. In some dim land afar,
19. On Saturdays, or Mondays,
20. As when the evening star
21. Glimpsed in upon his bending face
22. And my hanging hair,
23. And time untouched me with a trace
24. Of soul-smart or despair?
