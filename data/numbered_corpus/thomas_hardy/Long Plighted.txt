1. Is it worth while, dear, now,
2. To call for bells, and sally forth arrayed
3. For marriage-rites -- discussed, decried, delayed
4. So many years?

5. Is it worth while, dear, now,
6. To stir desire for old fond purposings,
7. By feints that Time still serves for dallyings,
8. Though quittance nears?

9. Is it worth while, dear, when
10. The day being so far spent, so low the sun,
11. The undone thing will soon be as the done,
12. And smiles as tears?

13. Is it worth while, dear, when
14. Our cheeks are worn, our early brown is gray;
15. When, meet or part we, none says yea or nay,
16. Or heeds, or cares?

17. Is it worth while, dear, since
18. We still can climb old Yell'ham's wooded mounds
19. Together, as each season steals its rounds
20. And disappears?

21. Is it worth while, dear, since
22. As mates in Mellstock churchyard we can lie,
23. Till the last crash of all things low and high
24. Shall end the spheres?
