1. I

2. In a solitude of the sea
3. Deep from human vanity,
4. And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.

6. Steel chambers, late the pyres
7. Of her salamandrine fires,
8. Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.

9. III

10. Over the mirrors meant
11. To glass the opulent
12. The sea-worm crawls -- grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.

13. IV

14. Jewels in joy designed
15. To ravish the sensuous mind
16. Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.

19. Gaze at the gilded gear
20. And query: 'What does this vaingloriousness down here?'. . .

31. In stature, grace, and hue
32. In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.

35. No mortal eye could see
36. The intimate welding of their later history.

37. X

38. Or sign that they were bent
39. By paths coincident
40. On being anon twin halves of one August event,

41. XI

42. Till the Spinner of the Years
43. Said 'Now!' And each one hears,
44. And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.
