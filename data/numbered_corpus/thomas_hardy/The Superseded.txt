2. As newer comers crowd the fore,
3. We drop behind.
4. - We who have laboured long and sore
5. Times out of mind,
6. And keen are yet, must not regret
7. To drop behind.

9. Yet there are of us some who grieve
10. To go behind;
11. Staunch, strenuous souls who scarce believe
12. Their fires declined,
13. And know none cares, remembers, spares
14. Who go behind.

17. The drop behind;
18. We feel the new must oust the old
19. In every kind;
20. But yet we think, must we, must WE,
21. Too, drop behind?
