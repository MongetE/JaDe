1. I

2. Dear Lizbie Browne,
3. Where are you now?
4. In sun, in rain? -
5. Or is your brow
6. Past joy, past pain,
7. Dear Lizbie Browne?

8. II

9. Sweet Lizbie Browne
10. How you could smile,
11. How you could sing! -
12. How archly wile
13. In glance-giving,
14. Sweet Lizbie Browne!

15. III

16. And, Lizbie Browne,
17. Who else had hair
18. Bay-red as yours,
19. Or flesh so fair
20. Bred out of doors,
21. Sweet Lizbie Browne?

22. IV

23. When, Lizbie Browne,
24. You had just begun
25. To be endeared
26. By stealth to one,
27. You disappeared
28. My Lizbie Browne!

29. V

30. Ay, Lizbie Browne,
31. So swift your life,
32. And mine so slow,
33. You were a wife
34. Ere I could show
35. Love, Lizbie Browne.

36. VI

37. Still, Lizbie Browne,
38. You won, they said,
39. The best of men
40. When you were wed . . .
41. Where went you then,
42. O Lizbie Browne?

43. VII

44. Dear Lizbie Browne,
45. I should have thought,
46. "Girls ripen fast,"
47. And coaxed and caught
48. You ere you passed,
49. Dear Lizbie Browne!

50. VIII

51. But, Lizbie Browne,
52. I let you slip;
53. Shaped not a sign;
54. Touched never your lip
55. With lip of mine,
56. Lost Lizbie Browne!

57. IX

58. So, Lizbie Browne,
59. When on a day
60. Men speak of me
61. As not, you'll say,
62. "And who was he?" -
63. Yes, Lizbie Browne!
