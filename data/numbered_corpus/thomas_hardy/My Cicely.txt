1. "ALIVE?"--And I leapt in my wonder,
2. Was faint of my joyance,
3. And grasses and grove shone in garments
4. Of glory to me.

5. "She lives, in a plenteous well-being,
6. To-day as aforehand;
7. The dead bore the name--though a rare one--
8. The name that bore she."

9. She lived ... I, afar in the city
10. Of frenzy-led factions,
11. Had squandered green years and maturer
12. In bowing the knee

13. To Baals illusive and specious,
14. Till chance had there voiced me
15. That one I loved vainly in nonage
16. Had ceased her to be.

17. The passion the planets had scowled on,
18. And change had let dwindle,
19. Her death-rumor smartly relifted
20. To full apogee.

21. I mounted a steed in the dawning
22. With acheful remembrance,
23. And made for the ancient West Highway
24. To far Exonb'ry.

25. Passing heaths, and the House of Long Sieging,
26. I neared the thin steeple
27. That tops the fair fane of Poore's olden
28. Episcopal see;

29. And, changing anew my onbearer,
30. I traversed the downland
31. Whereon the bleak hill-graves of Chieftains
32. Bulge barren of tree;

33. And still sadly onward I followed
34. That Highway the Icen,
35. Which trails its pale ribbon down Wessex
36. O'er lynchet and lea.

37. Along through the Stour-bordered Forum,
38. Where Legions had wayfared,
39. And where the slow river upglasses
40. Its green canopy,

41. And by Weatherbury Castle, and therence
42. Through Casterbridge, bore I,
43. To tomb her whose light, in my deeming,
44. Extinguished had He.

45. No highwayman's trot blew the night-wind
46. To me so life-weary,
47. But only the creak of the gibbets
48. Or wagoners' jee.

49. Triple-ramparted Maidon gloomed grayly
50. Above me from southward,
51. And north the hill-fortress of Eggar,
52. And square Pummerie.

53. The Nine-Pillared Cromlech, the Bride-streams,
54. The Axe, and the Otter
55. I passed, to the gate of the city
56. Where Exe scents the sea;

57. Till, spent, in the graveacre pausing,
58. I learnt 'twas not my Love
59. To whom Mother Church had just murmured
60. A last lullaby.

61. --"Then, where dwells the Canon's kinswoman,
62. My friend of aforetime?"--
63. ('Twas hard to repress my heart-heavings
64. And new ecstasy.)

65. "She wedded."--"Ah!"--"Wedded beneath her--
66. She keeps the stage-hostel
67. Ten miles hence, beside the great Highway--
68. The famed Lions-Three.

69. "Her spouse was her lackey--no option
70. 'Twixt wedlock and worse things;
71. A lapse over-sad for a lady
72. Of her pedigree!"

73. I shuddered, said nothing, and wandered
74. To shades of green laurel:
75. Too ghastly had grown those first tidings
76. So brightsome of blee!

77. For, on my ride hither, I'd halted
78. Awhile at the Lions,
79. And her--her whose name had once opened
80. My heart as a key--

81. I'd looked on, unknowing, and witnessed
82. Her jests with the tapsters,
83. Her liquor-fired face, her thick accents
84. In naming her fee.

85. "O God, why this hocus satiric!"
86. I cried in my anguish:
87. "O once Loved, of fair Unforgotten--
88. That Thing--meant it thee!

89. "Inurned and at peace, lost but sainted,
90. Where grief I could compass;
91. Depraved--'tis for Christ's poor dependent
92. A cruel decree!"

93. I backed on the Highway; but passed not
94. The hostel. Within there
95. Too mocking to Love's re-expression
96. Was Time's repartee!

97. Uptracking where Legions had wayfared,
98. By cromlechs unstoried,
99. And lynchets, and sepultured Chieftains,
100. In self-colloquy,

101. A feeling stirred in me and strengthened
102. That she was not my Love,
103. But she of the garth, who lay rapt in
104. Her long reverie.

105. And thence till to-day I persuade me
106. That this was the true one;
107. That Death stole intact her young dearness
108. And innocency.

109. Frail-witted, illuded they call me;
110. I may be. 'Tis better
111. To dream than to own the debasement
112. Of sweet Cicely.

113. Moreover I rate it unseemly
114. To hold that kind Heaven
115. Could work such device--to her ruin
116. And my misery.

117. So, lest I disturb my choice vision,
118. I shun the West Highway,
119. Even now, when the knaps ring with rhythms
120. From blackbird and bee;

121. And feel that with slumber half-conscious
122. She rests in the church-hay,
123. Her spirit unsoiled as in youth-time
124. When lovers were we.
