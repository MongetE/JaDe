1. In a solitude of the sea
2. Deep from human vanity,
3. And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.

4. Steel chambers, late the pyres
5. Of her salamandrine fires,
6. Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.

7. Over the mirrors meant
8. To glass the opulent
9. The sea-worm crawls -- grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.

10. Jewels in joy designed
11. To ravish the sensuous mind
12. Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.

13. Dim moon-eyed fishes near
14. Gaze at the gilded gear
15. And query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?" ...

16. Well: while was fashioning
17. This creature of cleaving wing,
18. The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything

19. Prepared a sinister mate
20. For her -- so gaily great --
21. A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.

22. And as the smart ship grew
23. In stature, grace, and hue,
24. In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.

25. Alien they seemed to be;
26. No mortal eye could see
27. The intimate welding of their later history,

28. Or sign that they were bent
29. By paths coincident
30. On being anon twin halves of one august event,

31. Till the Spinner of the Years
32. Said "Now!" And each one hears,
33. And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.
