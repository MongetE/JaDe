1. Let us off and search, and find a place
2. Where yours and mine can be natural lives,
3. Where no one comes who dissects and dives
4. And proclaims that ours is a curious case,
5. That its touch of romance can scarcely grace.


6. You would think it strange at first, but then
7. Everything has been strange in its time.
8. When some one said on a day of the prime
9. He would bow to no brazen god again
10. He doubtless dazed the mass of men.


11. None will recognize us as a pair whose claims
12. Righteous judgment we care not making;
13. Who have doubted if breath be worth the taking,
14. And have no respect for the current fames
15. Whence the savour has flown while abide the names.


16. We have found us already shunned, disdained,
17. And for re-acceptance have not once striven;
18. Whatever offence our course has given
19. The brunt thereof we have long sustained.
20. Well, let us away, scorned, unexplained.
