1. I

2. When moiling seems at cease
3. In the vague void of night-time,
4. And heaven's wide roomage stormless
5. Between the dusk and light-time,
6. And fear at last is formless,
7. We call the allurement Peace.

8. II

9. Peace, this hid riot, Change,
10. This revel of quick-cued mumming,
11. This never truly being,
12. This evermore becoming,
13. This spinner's wheel onfleeing
14. Outside perception's range.
