1. Queer are the ways of a man I know:
2. He comes and stands
3. In a careworn craze,
4. And looks at the sands
5. And in the seaward haze
6. With moveless hands
7. And face and gaze,
8. Then turns to go...
9. And what does he see when he gazes so?

10. They say he sees as an instant thing
11. More clear than today,
12. A sweet soft scene
13. That once was in play
14. By that briny green;
15. Yes, notes alway
16. Warm, real, and keen,
17. What his back years bring-
18. A phantom of his own figuring.

19. Of this vision of his they might say more:
20. Not only there
21. Does he see this sight,
22. But everywhere
23. In his brain-day, night,
24. As if on the air
25. It were drawn rose bright-
26. Yea, far from that shore
27. Does he carry this vision of heretofore:

28. A ghost-girl-rider. And though, toil-tried,
29. He withers daily,
30. Time touches her not,
31. But she still rides gaily
32. In his rapt thought
33. On that shagged and shaly
34. Atlantic spot,
35. And as when first eyed
36. Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide.
