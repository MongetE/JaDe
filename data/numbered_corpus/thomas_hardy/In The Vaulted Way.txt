1. In the vaulted way, where the passage turned
2. To the shadowy corner that none could see,
3. You paused for our parting, - plaintively:
4. Though overnight had come words that burned
5. My fond frail happiness out of me.

6. And then I kissed you, - despite my thought
7. That our spell must end when reflection came
8. On what you had deemed me, whose one long aim
9. Had been to serve you; that what I sought
10. Lay not in a heart that could breathe such blame.

11. But yet I kissed you: whereon you again
12. As of old kissed me. Why, why was it so?
13. Do you cleave to me after that light-tongued blow?
14. If you scorned me at eventide, how love then?
15. The thing is dark, Dear. I do not know.
