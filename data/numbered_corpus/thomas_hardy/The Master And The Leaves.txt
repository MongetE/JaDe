1. I
2. We are budding, master, budding,
3. We of your favourite tree;
4. March drought and April flooding
5. Arouse us merrily.
6. The stemlets brightly studding;
7. And yet you do not see.

8. II
9. We are fully woven for summer
10. In modes of limpest green,
11. The twitterer and the hummer
12. Here rest their rounds between,
13. While like a 'long-roll' drummer
14. The night-hawk thrills the treen.

15. III
16. We are turning yellow, master,
17. And next we are turning red,
18. And faster then and faster
19. Shall seek our rooty bedâ€”
20. All wasted in disaster
21. The magic show we spread!

22. IV
23. 'I mark your early going,
24. And that you'll soon be clay,
25. I have seen your summer showing
26. As in my youthful day;
27. But why I seem unknowing
28. Is too deep down to say.'
