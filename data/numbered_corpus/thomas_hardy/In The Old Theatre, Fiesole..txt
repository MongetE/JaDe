1. I traced the Circus whose gray stones incline
2. Where Rome and dim Etruria interjoin,
3. Till came a child who showed an ancient coin
4. That bore the image of a Constantine.

5. She lightly passed; nor did she once opine
6. How, better than all books, she had raised for me
7. In swift perspective Europe's history
8. Through the vast years of Caesar's sceptred line.

9. For in my distant plot of English loam
10. 'Twas but to delve, and straightway there to find
11. Coins of like impress.  As with one half blind
12. Whom common simples cure, her act flashed home
13. In that mute moment to my opened mind
14. The power, the pride, the reach of perished Rome.
