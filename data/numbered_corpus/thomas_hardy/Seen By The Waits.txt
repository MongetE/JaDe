1. Through snowy woods and shady
2. We went to play a tune
3. To the lonely manor-lady
4. By the light of the Christmas moon.


5. We violed till, upward glancing
6. To where a mirror leaned,
7. We saw her airily dancing,
8. Deeming her movements screened;


9. Dancing alone in the room there,
10. Thin-draped in her robe of night;
11. Her postures, glassed in the gloom there,
12. Were a strange phantasmal sight.


13. She had learnt (we heard when homing)
14. That her roving spouse was dead;
15. Why she had danced in the gloaming
16. We thought, but never said.
