1. I rose at night and visited
2. The Cave of the Unborn,
3. And crowding shapes surrounded me
4. For tidings of the life to be,
5. Who long had prayed the silent Head
6. To speed their advent morn.

7. Their eyes were lit with artless trust;
8. Hope thrilled their every tone:
9. "A place the loveliest, is it not?
10. A pure delight, a beauty-spot
11. Where all is gentle, pure and just
12. And ??violence?? is unknown?"

13. My heart was anguished for their sake;
14. I could not frame a word;
15. But they descried my sunken face
16. And seemed to read therein, and trace
17. The news which Pity would not break
18. Nor Truth leave unaverred.

19. And as I silently retired
20. I turned and watched them still:
21. And they came helter-skelter out,
22. Driven forward like a rabble rout
23. Into the world they had so desired,
24. By the all-immanent Will.
