1. Whether to sally and see thee, girl of my dreams,
2. Or whether to stay
3. And see thee not! How vast the difference seems
4. Of Yea from Nay
5. Just now. Yet this same sun will slant its beams
6. At no far day
7. On our two mounds, and then what will the difference weigh!
8. Yet I will see thee, maiden dear, and make
9. The most I can
10. Of what remains to us amid this brake
11. Cimmerian
12. Through which we grope, and from whose thorns we ache,
13. While still we scan
14. Round our frail faltering progress for some path or plan.
15. By briefest meeting something sure is won;
16. It will have been:
17. Nor God nor Daemon can undo the done,
18. Unsight the seen,
19. Make muted music be as unbegun,
20. Though things terrene
21. Groan in their bondage till oblivion supervene.
22. So, to the one long-sweeping symphony
23. From times remote
24. Till now, of human tenderness, shall we
25. Supply one note,
26. Small and untraced, yet that will ever be
27. Somewhere afloat
28. Amid the spheres, as part of sick Life's antidote.
