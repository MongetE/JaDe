1. WHEN, soul in soul reflected,
2. We breathed an Ã¦thered air,
3. When we neglected
4. All things elsewhere,
5. And left the friendly friendless
6. To keep our love aglow,
7. We deemed it endless...
8. --We did not know!

9. When, by mad passion goaded,
10. We planned to hie away,
11. But, unforeboded,
12. The storm-shafts gray
13. So heavily down-pattered
14. That none could forthward go,
15. Our lives seemed shattered...
16. --We did not know!

17. When I found you, helpless lying,
18. And you waived my deep misprise,
19. And swore me, dying,
20. In phantom-guise
21. To wing to me when grieving,
22. And touch away my woe,
23. We kissed, believing...
24. --We did not know!

25. But though, your powers outreckoning,
26. You hold you dead and dumb,
27. Or scorn my beckoning,
28. And will not come;
29. And I say, "'Twere mood ungainly
30. To store her memory so:"
31. I say it vainly--
32. I feel and know!
