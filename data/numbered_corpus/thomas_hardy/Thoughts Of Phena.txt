1. at news of her death

2. Not a line of her writing have I
3. Not a thread of her hair,
4. No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
5. I may picture her there;
6. And in vain do I urge my unsight
7. To conceive my lost prize
8. At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming with light
9. And with laughter her eyes.

10. What scenes spread around her last days,
11. Sad, shining, or dim?
12. Did her gifts and compassions enray and enarch her sweet ways
13. With an aureate nimb?
14. Or did life-light decline from her years,
15. And mischances control
16. Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears
17. Disennoble her soul?

18. Thus I do but the phantom retain
19. Of the maiden of yore
20. As my relic; yet haply the best of her--fined in my brain
21. It may be the more
22. That no line of her writing have I,
23. Nor a thread of her hair,
24. No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby
25. I may picture her there.
