1. Francois Hippolite Barthelemon, first-fiddler at Vauxhall Gardens,
2. composed what was probably the most popular morning hymn-tune ever
3. written. It was formerly sung, full-voiced, every Sunday in most
4. churches, to Bishop Ken's words, but is now seldom heard.


5. He said: 'Awake my soul, and with the sun,' . . .
6. And paused upon the bridge, his eyes due east,
7. Where was emerging like a full-robed priest
8. The irradiate globe that vouched the dark as done.

9. It lit his face-the weary face of one
10. Who in the adjacent gardens charged his string,
11. Nightly, with many a tuneful tender thing,
12. Till stars were weak, and dancing hours outrun.

13. And then were threads of matin music spun
14. In trial tones as he pursued his way:
15. 'This is a morn,' he murmured, 'well begun:
16. This strain to Ken will count when I am clay!'

17. And count it did; till, caught by echoing lyres,
18. It spread to galleried naves and mighty quires.
