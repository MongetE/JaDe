1. I wandered to a crude coast
2. Like a ghost;
3. Upon the hills I saw fires -
4. Funeral pyres
5. Seemingly - and heard breaking
6. Waves like distant cannonades that set the land shaking.


7. And so I never once guessed
8. A Love-nest,
9. Bowered and candle-lit, lay
10. In my way,
11. Till I found a hid hollow,
12. Where I burst on her my heart could not but follow.
