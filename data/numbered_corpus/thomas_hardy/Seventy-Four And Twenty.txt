1. Here goes a man of seventy-four,
2. Who sees not what life means for him,
3. And here another in years a score
4. Who reads its very figure and trim.

5. The one who shall walk to-day with me
6. Is not the youth who gazes far,
7. But the breezy wight who cannot see
8. What Earth's ingrained conditions are.
