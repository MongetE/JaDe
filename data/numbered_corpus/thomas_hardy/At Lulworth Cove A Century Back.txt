1. Had I but lived a hundred years ago
2. I might have gone, as I have gone this year,
3. By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know,
4. And Time have placed his finger on me there:

5. "You see that man?" -- I might have looked, and said,
6. "O yes: I see him. One that boat has brought
7. Which dropped down Channel round Saint Alban's Head.
8. So commonplace a youth calls not my thought."

9. "You see that man?" -- "Why yes; I told you; yes:
10. Of an idling town-sort; thin; hair brown in hue;
11. And as the evening light scants less and less
12. He looks up at a star, as many do."

13. "You see that man?" -- "Nay, leave me!" then I plead,
14. "I have fifteen miles to vamp across the lea,
15. And it grows dark, and I am weary-kneed:
16. I have said the third time; yes, that man I see!"

17. "Good. That man goes to Rome -- to death, despair;
18. And no one notes him now but you and I:
19. A hundred years, and the world will follow him there,
20. And bend with reverence where his ashes lie."
