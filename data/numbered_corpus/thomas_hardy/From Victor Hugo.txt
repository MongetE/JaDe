1. Child, were I king, I'd yield my royal rule,
2. My chariot, sceptre, vassal-service due,
3. My crown, my porphyry-basined waters cool,
4. My fleets, whereto the sea is but a pool,
5. For a glance from you!

6. Love, were I God, the earth and its heaving airs,
7. Angels, the demons abject under me,
8. Vast chaos with its teeming womby lairs,
9. Time, space, all would I give--aye, upper spheres,
10. For a kiss from thee!
