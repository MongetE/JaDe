1. They hail me as one living,
2. But don't they know
3. That I have died of late years,
4. Untombed although?

5. I am but a shape that stands here,
6. A pulseless mould,
7. A pale past picture, screening
8. Ashes gone cold.

9. Not at a minute's warning,
10. Not in a loud hour,
11. For me ceased Time's enchantments
12. In hall and bower.

13. There was no tragic transit,
14. No catch of breath,
15. When silent seasons inched me
16. On to this death ...

17. -- A Troubadour-youth I rambled
18. With Life for lyre,
19. The beats of being raging
20. In me like fire.

21. But when I practised eyeing
22. The goal of men,
23. It iced me, and I perished
24. A little then.

25. When passed my friend, my kinsfolk,
26. Through the Last Door,
27. And left me standing bleakly,
28. I died yet more;

29. And when my Love's heart kindled
30. In hate of me,
31. Wherefore I knew not, died I
32. One more degree.

33. And if when I died fully
34. I cannot say,
35. And changed into the corpse-thing
36. I am to-day,

37. Yet is it that, though whiling
38. The time somehow
39. In walking, talking, smiling,
40. I live not now.
