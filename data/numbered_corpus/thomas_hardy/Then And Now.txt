1. When battles were fought
2. With a chivalrous sense of should and ought,
3. In spirit men said,
4. "End we quick or dead,
5. Honour is some reward!
6. Let us fight fair -- for our own best or worst;
7. So, Gentlemen of the Guard,
8. Fire first!"

9. In the open they stood,
10. Man to man in his knightlihood:
11. They would not deign
12. To profit by a stain
13. On the honourable rules,
14. Knowing that practise perfidy no man durst
15. Who in the heroic schools
16. Was nurst.

17. But now, behold, what
18. Is war with those where honour is not!
19. Rama laments
20. Its dead innocents;
21. Herod howls: "Sly slaughter
22. Rules now! Let us, by modes once called accurst,
23. Overhead, under water,
24. Stab first."
