1. Thirty-two years since, up against the sun,
2. Seven shapes, thin atomies to lower sight,
3. Labouringly leapt and gained thy gabled height,
4. And four lives paid for what the seven had won.

5. They were the first by whom the deed was done,
6. And when I look at thee, my mind takes flight
7. To that day's tragic feat of manly might,
8. As though, till then, of history thou hadst none.

9. Yet ages ere men topped thee, late and soon
10. Thou watch'dst each night the planets lift and lower;
11. Thou gleam'dst to Joshua's pausing sun and moon,
12. And brav'dst the tokening sky when Caesar's power
13. Approached its bloody end: yea, saw'st that Noon
14. When darkness filled the earth till the ninth hour.
