1. WHEN you paced forth, to wait maternity,
2. A dream of other offspring held my mind,
3. Compounded of us twain as Love designed;
4. Rare forms, that corporate now will never be!

5. Should I, too, wed as slave to Mode's decree,
6. And each thus found apart, of false desire,
7. A stolid line, whom no high aims will fire
8. As had fired ours could ever have mingled we;

9. And, grieved that lives so matched should miscompose,
10. Each mourn the double waste; and question dare
11. To the Great Dame whence incarnation flows,
12. Why those high-purposed children never were:
13. What will she answer? That she does not care
14. If the race all such sovereign types unknows.
