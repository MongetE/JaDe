1. I

2. Last year I called this world of gain-givings
3. The darkest thinkable, and questioned sadly
4. If my own land could heave its pulse less gladly,
5. So charged it seemed with circumstance whence springs
6. The tragedy of things.

7. II

8. Yet at that censured time no heart was rent
9. Or feature blanched of parent, wife, or daughter
10. By hourly blazoned sheets of listed slaughter;
11. Death waited Nature's wont; Peace smiled unshent
12. From Ind to Occident.
