1. In the wild October night-time, when the wind raved round the
2. land,
3. And the Back-sea met the front-sea, and our doors were blocked
4. with sand,
5. And we heard the drub of dead-man's bay, where the bones of
6. thousands are,
7. We knew not what the day had done for us at Trafalgar.
8. Had done,
9. Had done,
10. For us at Trafalgar!

11. 'Pull hard, and make the nothe, or down we go!' One says,
12. says he.
13. We pulled; and bedtime brought the storm; but snug at home
14. slept we.
15. Yet all the while our gallants after fighting through the day,
16. Were beating up and down the dark, sou'west of Cadiz Bay.
17. The dark,
18. The dark,
19. Sou'west of Cadiz Bay!

20. The victors and the vanquished then the storm it tossed and tore,
21. As hard they strove, those worn-out men, upon that surly shore;
22. Dead Nelson and his half dead crew, his foes from near and far,
23. Were rolled together on the deep that night at Trafalgar!
24. The deep,
25. The deep,
26. That night at Trafalgar!
