1. I say, "She was as good as fair,"
2. When standing by her mound;
3. "Such passing sweetness," I declare,
4. "No longer treads the ground."
5. I say, "What living Love can catch
6. Her bloom and bonhomie,
7. And what in newer maidens match
8. Her olden warmth to me!"

9. - There stands within yon vestry-nook
10. Where bonded lovers sign,
11. Her name upon a faded book
12. With one that is not mine.
13. To him she breathed the tender vow
14. She once had breathed to me,
15. But yet I say, "O love, even now
16. Would I had died for thee!"
