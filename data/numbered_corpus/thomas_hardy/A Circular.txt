1. As 'legal representative'
2. I read a missive not my own,
3. On new designs the senders give
4. For clothes, in tints as shown.

5. Here figure blouses, gowns for tea,
6. And presentation-trains of state,
7. Charming ball-dresses, millinery,
8. Warranted up to date.

9. And this gay-pictured, spring-time shout
10. Of Fashion, hails what lady proud?
11. Her who before last year was out
12. Was costumed in a shroud.
