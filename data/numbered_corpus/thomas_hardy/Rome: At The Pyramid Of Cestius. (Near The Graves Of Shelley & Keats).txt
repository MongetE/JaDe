1. Who, then, was Cestius,
2. And what is he to me? -
3. Amid thick thoughts and memories multitudinous
4. One thought alone brings he.

5. I can recall no word
6. Of anything he did;
7. For me he is a man who died and was interred
8. To leave a pyramid

9. Whose purpose was exprest
10. Not with its first design,
11. Nor till, far down in Time, beside it found their rest
12. Two countrymen of mine.

13. Cestius in life, maybe,
14. Slew, breathed out threatening;
15. I know not.  This I know:  in death all silently
16. He does a kindlier thing,

17. In beckoning pilgrim feet
18. With marble finger high
19. To where, by shadowy wall and history-haunted street,
20. Those matchless singers lie . . .

21. --Say, then, he lived and died
22. That stones which bear his name
23. Should mark, through Time, where two immortal Shades abide;
24. It is an ample fame.
