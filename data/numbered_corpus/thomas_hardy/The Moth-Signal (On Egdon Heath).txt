3. 'That you stare at the wick unblinking
4. With those great lost luminous eyes?'

5. 'O, I see a poor moth burning
6. In the candle-flame,' said she,
7. 'Its wings and legs are turning
8. To a cinder rapidly.'

9. 'Moths fly in from the heather,'
10. He said, 'now the days decline.'
11. 'I know,' said she. 'The weather,
12. I hope, will at last be fine.


13. 'I think,' she added lightly,
14. 'I'll look out at the door.
15. The ring the moon wears nightly,
16. May be visible now no more.


17. She rose, and, little heeding,
18. Her husband then went on
19. With his attentive reading
20. In the annals of ages gone.


21. Outside the house a figure
22. Came from the tumulus near,
23. And speedily waxed bigger,
24. And clasped and called her Dear.


25. 'I saw the pale-winged token
26. You sent through the crack,' sighed she.
27. 'That moth is burnt and broken
28. With which you lured out me.


29. 'And were I as the moth is
30. It might be better far
31. For one whose marriage troth is
32. Shattered as potsherds are!'


33. Then grinned the Ancient Briton
34. From the tumulus treed with pine:
35. 'So, hearts are thwartly smitten
36. In these days as in mine!'
