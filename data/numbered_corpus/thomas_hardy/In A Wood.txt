1. In a Wood


2. Pale beech and pine-tree blue,
3. Set in one clay,
4. Bough to bough cannot you
5. Bide out your day?
6. When the rains skim and skip,
7. Why mar sweet comradeship,
8. Blighting with poison-drip
9. Neighborly spray?

10. Heart-halt and spirit-lame,
11. City-opprest,
12. Unto this wood I came
13. As to a nest;
14. Dreaming that sylvan peace
15. Offered the harrowed ease—
16. Nature a soft release
17. From men’s unrest.

18. But, having entered in,
19. Great growths and small
20. Show them to men akin—
21. Combatants all!
22. Sycamore shoulders oak,
23. Bines the slim sapling yoke,
24. Ivy-spun halters choke
25. Elms stout and tall.

26. Touches from ash, O wych,
27. Sting you like scorn!
28. You, too, brave hollies, twitch
29. Sidelong from thorn.
30. Even the rank poplars bear
31. Illy a rival’s air,
32. Cankering in black despair
33. If overborne.

34. Since, then, no grace I find
35. Taught me of trees,
36. Turn I back to my kind,
37. Worthy as these.
38. There at least smiles abound,
39. There discourse trills around,
40. There, now and then, are found
41. Life-loyalties.
