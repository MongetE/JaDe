1. Why should this flower delay so long
2. To show its tremulous plumes?
3. Now is the time of plaintive robin-song,
4. When flowers are in their tombs.

5. Through the slow summer, when the sun
6. Called to each frond and whorl
7. That all he could for flowers was being done,
8. Why did it not uncurl?

9. It must have felt that fervid call
10. Although it took no heed,
11. Waking but now, when leaves like corpses fall,
12. And saps all retrocede.

13. Too late its beauty, lonely thing,
14. The season's shine is spent,
15. Nothing remains for it but shivering
16. In tempests turbulent.

17. Had it a reason for delay,
18. Dreaming in witlessness
19. That for a bloom so delicately gay
20. Winter would stay its stress?

21. - I talk as if the thing were born
22. With sense to work its mind;
23. Yet it is but one mask of many worn
24. By the Great Face behind.
