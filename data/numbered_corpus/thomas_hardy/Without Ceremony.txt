1. It was your way, my dear,
2. To be gone without a word
3. When callers, friends, or kin
4. Had left, and I hastened in
5. To rejoin you, as I inferred.

6. And when you'd a mind to career
7. Off anywhere - say to town -
8. You were all on a sudden gone
9. Before I had thought thereon,
10. Or noticed your trunks were down.

11. So, now that you disappear
12. For ever in that swift style,
13. Your meaning seems to me
14. Just as it used to be:
15. 'Good-bye is not worth while!'
