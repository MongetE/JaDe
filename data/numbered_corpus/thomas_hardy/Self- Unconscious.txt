1. Along the way
2. He walked that day,
3. Watching shapes that reveries limn,
4. And seldom he
5. Had eyes to see
6. The moment that encompassed him.


7. Bright yellowhammers
8. Made mirthful clamours,
9. And billed long straws with a bustling air,
10. And bearing their load
11. Flew up the road
12. That he followed, alone, without interest there.


13. From bank to ground
14. And over and round
15. They sidled along the adjoining hedge;
16. Sometimes to the gutter
17. Their yellow flutter
18. Would dip from the nearest slatestone ledge.


19. The smooth sea-line
20. With a metal shine,
21. And flashes of white, and a sail thereon,
22. He would also descry
23. With a half-wrapt eye
24. Between the projects he mused upon.


25. Yes, round him were these
26. Earth's artistries,
27. But specious plans that came to his call
28. Did most engage
29. His pilgrimage,
30. While himself he did not see at all.


31. Dead now as sherds
32. Are the yellow birds,
33. And all that mattered has passed away;
34. Yet God, the Elf,
35. Now shows him that self
36. As he was, and should have been shown, that day.


37. O it would have been good
38. Could he then have stood
39. At a focussed distance, and conned the whole,
40. But now such vision
41. Is mere derision,
42. Nor soothes his body nor saves his soul.


43. Not much, some may
44. Incline to say,
45. To see in him, had it all been seen.
46. Nay! he is aware
47. A thing was there
48. That loomed with an immortal mien.
