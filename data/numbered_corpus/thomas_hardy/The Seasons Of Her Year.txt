1. I

2. Winter is white on turf and tree,
3. And birds are fled;
4. But summer songsters pipe to me,
5. And petals spread,
6. For what I dreamt of secretly
7. His lips have said!

8. II

9. O 'tis a fine May morn, they say,
10. And blooms have blown;
11. But wild and wintry is my day,
12. My birds make moan;
13. For he who vowed leaves me to pay
14. Alone--alone!
