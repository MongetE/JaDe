1. SHOW thee as I thought thee
2. When I early sought thee,
3. Omen-scouting,
4. All undoubting
5. Love alone had wrought thee--

6. Wrought thee for my pleasure,
7. Planned thee as a measure
8. For expounding
9. And resounding
10. Glad things that men treasure.

11. O for but a moment
12. Of that old endowment--
13. Light to gaily
14. See thy daily
15. Iris√®d embowment!

16. But such readorning
17. Time forbids with scorning--
18. Makes me see things
19. Cease to be things
20. They were in my morning.

21. Fad'st thou, glow-forsaken,
22. Darkness-overtaken!
23. Thy first sweetness,
24. Radiance, meetness,
25. None shall reawaken.

26. Why not sempiternal
27. Thou and I? Our vernal
28. Brightness keeping,
29. Time outleaping;
30. Passed the hodiernal!
