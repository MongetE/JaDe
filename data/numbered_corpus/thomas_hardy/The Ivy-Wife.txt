1. I LONGED to love a full-boughed beech
2. And be as high as he:
3. I stretched an arm within his reach,
4. And signalled unity.
5. But with his drip he forced a breach,
6. And tried to poison me.

7. I gave the grasp of partnership
8. To one of other race--
9. A plane: he barked him strip by strip
10. From upper bough to base;
11. And me therewith; for gone my grip,
12. My arms could not enlace.

13. In new affection next I strove
14. To coll an ash I saw,
15. And he in trust received my love;
16. Till with my soft green claw
17. I cramped and bound him as I wove...
18. Such was my love: ha-ha!

19. By this I gained his strength and height
20. Without his rivalry.
21. But in my triumph I lost sight
22. Of afterhaps. Soon he,
23. Being bark-bound, flagged, snapped, fell outright,
24. And in his fall felled me!
