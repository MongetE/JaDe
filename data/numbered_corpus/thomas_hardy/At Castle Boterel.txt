1. As I drive to the junction of lane and highway,
2. And the drizzle bedrenches the waggonette,
3. I look behind at the fading byway,
4. And see on its slope, now glistening wet,
5. Distinctly yet

6. Myself and a girlish form benighted
7. In dry March weather.  We climb the road
8. Beside a chaise.  We had just alighted
9. To ease the sturdy pony's load
10. When he sighed and slowed.

11. What we did as we climbed, and what we talked of
12. Matters not much, nor to what it led, -
13. Something that life will not be balked of
14. Without rude reason till hope is dead,
15. And feeling fled.

16. It filled but a minute.  But was there ever
17. A time of such quality, since or before,
18. In that hill's story?  To one mind never,
19. Though it has been climbed, foot-swift, foot-sore,
20. By thousands more.

21. Primaeval rocks form the road's steep border,
22. And much have they faced there, first and last,
23. Of the transitory in Earth's long order;
24. But what they record in colour and cast
25. Is - that we two passed.

26. And to me, though Time's unflinching rigour,
27. In mindless rote, has ruled from sight
28. The substance now, one phantom figure
29. Remains on the slope, as when that night
30. Saw us alight.

31. I look and see it there, shrinking, shrinking,
32. I look back at it amid the rain
33. For the very last time; for my sand is sinking,
34. And I shall traverse old love's domain
35. Never again.
