1. 'There is not much that I can do,
2. For I've no money that's quite my own!'
3. Spoke up the pitying child--
4. A little boy with a violin
5. At the station before the train came in,--
6. 'But I can play my fiddle to you,
7. And a nice one 'tis, and good in tone!'

8. The man in the handcuffs smiled;
9. The constable looked, and he smiled too,
10. As the fiddle began to twang;
11. And the man in the handcuffs suddenly sang
12. With grimful glee:
13. 'This life so free
14. Is the thing for me!'
15. And the constable smiled, and said no word,
16. As if unconscious of what he heard;
17. And so they went on till the train came in--
18. The convict, and boy with the violin.
