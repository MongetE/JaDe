1. That love's dull smart distressed my heart
2. He shrewdly learnt to see,
3. But that I was in love with a dead man
4. Never suspected he.


5. He searched for the trace of a pictured face,
6. He watched each missive come,
7. And a note that seemed like a love-line
8. Made him look frozen and glum.


9. He dogged my feet to the city street,
10. He followed me to the sea,
11. But not to the neighbouring churchyard
12. Did he dream of following me.
