1. THOUGH I waste watches framing words to fetter
2. Some spirit to mine own in clasp and kiss,
3. Out of the night there looms a sense 'twere better
4. To fail obtaining whom one fails to miss.

5. For winning love we win the risk of losing,
6. And losing love is as one's life were riven;
7. It cuts like contumely and keen ill-using
8. To cede what was superfluously given.

9. Let me then feel no more the fateful thrilling
10. That devastates the love-worn wooer's frame,
11. The hot ado of fevered hopes, the chilling
12. That agonizes disappointed aim!
13. So may I live no junctive law fulfilling,
14. And my heart's table bear no woman's name.
