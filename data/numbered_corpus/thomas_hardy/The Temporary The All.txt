1. CHANGE and chancefulness in my flowering youthtime,
2. Set me sun by sun near to one unchosen;
3. Wrought us fellowly, and despite divergence,
4. Friends interblent us.

5. "Cherish him can I while the true one forthcome--
6. Come the rich fulfiller of my prevision;
7. Life is roomy yet, and the odds unbounded."
8. So self-communed I.

9. Thwart my wistful way did a damsel saunter,
10. Fair not fairest, good not best of her feather;
11. "Maiden meet," held I, "till arise my forefelt
12. Wonder of women."

13. Long a visioned hermitage deep desiring,
14. Tenements uncouth I was fain to house in;
15. "Let such lodging be for a breath-while," thought I,
16. "Soon a more seemly.

17. "Then, high handiwork will I make my life-deed,
18. Truth and Light outshow; but the ripe time pending,
19. Intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth."
20. Thus I ... But lo, me!

21. Mistress, friend, place, aims to be bettered straightway,
22. Bettered not has Fate or my hand's achieving;
23. Sole the showance those of my onward earth-track--
24. Never transcended!
