1. I MARKED her ruined hues,
2. Her custom-straitened views,
3. And asked, "Can there indwell
4. My Amabel?"

5. I looked upon her gown,
6. Once rose, now earthen brown;
7. The change was like the knell
8. Of Amabel.

9. Her step's mechanic ways
10. Had lost the life of May's;
11. Her laugh, once sweet in swell,
12. Spoilt Amabel.

13. I mused: "Who sings the strain
14. I sang ere warmth did wane?
15. Who thinks its numbers spell
16. His Amabel?"--

17. Knowing that, though Love cease,
18. Love's race shows undecrease;
19. All find in dorp or dell
20. An Amabel.

21. --I felt that I could creep
22. To some housetop, and weep,
23. That Time the tyrant fell
24. Ruled Amabel!

25. I said (the while I sighed
26. That love like ours had died),
27. "Fond things I'll no more tell
28. To Amabel,

29. "But leave her to her fate,
30. And fling across the gate,
31. 'Till the Last Trump, farewell,
32. O Amabel!'"
