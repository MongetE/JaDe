1. 'I mean to build a hall anon,
2. And shape two turrets there,
3. And a broad newelled stair,
4. And a cool well for crystal water;
5. Yes; I will build a hall anon,
6. Plant roses love shall feed upon,
7. And apple trees and pear.'


8. He set to build the manor-hall,
9. And shaped the turrets there,
10. And the broad newelled stair,
11. And the cool well for crystal water;
12. He built for me that manor-hall,
13. And planted many trees withal,
14. But no rose anywhere.


15. And as he planted never a rose
16. That bears the flower of love,
17. Though other flower's throve
18. A frost-wind moved our souls to sever
19. Since he had planted never a rose;
20. And misconceits raised horrid shows,
21. And agonies came thereof.


22. 'I'll mend these miseries,' then said I,
23. And so, at dead of night,
24. I went and, screened from sight,
25. That nought should keep our souls in severance,
26. I set a rose-bush. 'This,' said I,
27. 'May end divisions dire and wry,
28. And long-drawn days of blight.'


29. But I was called from earth - yea, called
30. Before my rose-bush grew;
31. And would that now I knew
32. What feels he of the tree I planted,
33. And whether, after I was called
34. To be a ghost, he, as of old,
35. Gave me his heart anew!


36. Perhaps now blooms that queen of trees
37. I set but saw not grow,
38. And he, beside its glow -
39. Eyes couched of the mis-vision that blurred me -
40. Ay, there beside that queen of trees
41. He sees me as I was, though sees
42. Too late to tell me so!
