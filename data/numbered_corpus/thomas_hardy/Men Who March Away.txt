1. Song of the Soldiers

2. What of the faith and fire within us
3. Men who march away
4. Ere the barn-cocks say
5. Night is growing gray,
6. To hazards whence no tears can win us;
7. What of the faith and fire within us
8. Men who march away!

9. Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
10. Friend with the musing eye
11. Who watch us stepping by,
12. With doubt and dolorous sigh?
13. Can much pondering so hoodwink you?
14. Is it a purblind prank, O think you,
15. Friend with the musing eye?

16. Nay. We see well what we are doing,
17. Though some may not see --
18. Dalliers as they be --
19. England's need are we;
20. Her distress would leave us rueing:
21. Nay. We well see what we are doing,
22. Though some may not see!

23. In our heart of hearts believing
24. Victory crowns the just,
25. And that braggarts must
26. Surely bite the dust,
27. Press we to the field ungrieving,
28. In our heart of hearts believing
29. Victory crowns the just.

30. Hence the faith and fire within us
31. Men who march away
32. Ere the barn-cocks say
33. Night is growing gray,
34. To hazards whence no tears can win us;
35. Hence the faith and fire within us
36. Men who march away.
