1. 'TWAS a death-bed summons, and forth I went
2. By the way of the Western Wall, so drear
3. On that winter night, and sought a gate--
4. The home, by Fate,
5. Of one I had long held dear.

6. And there, as I paused by her tenement,
7. And the trees shed on me their rime and hoar,
8. I thought of the man who had left her lone--
9. Him who made her his own
10. When I loved her, long before.

11. The rooms within had the piteous shine
12. The home-things wear which the housewife miss;
13. From the stairway floated the rise and fall
14. Of an infant's call,
15. Whose birth had brought her to this.

16. Her life was the price she would pay for that whine--
17. For a child by the man she did not love.
18. "But let that rest forever," I said,
19. And bent my tread
20. To the chamber up above.

21. She took my hand in her thin white own,
22. And smiled her thanks--though nigh too weak--
23. And made them a sign to leave us there;
24. Then faltered, ere
25. She could bring herself to speak.

26. "'Twas to see you before I go--he'll condone
27. Such a natural thing now my time's not much--
28. When Death is so near it hustles hence
29. All passioned sense
30. Between woman and man as such!

31. "My husband is absent. As heretofore
32. The City detains him. But, in truth,
33. He has not been kind.... I will speak no blame,
34. But--the child is lame;
35. O, I pray she may reach his ruth!

36. "Forgive past days--I can say no more--
37. Maybe if we'd wedded you'd now repine!...
38. But I treated you ill. I was punished. Farewell!
39. --Truth shall I tell?
40. Would the child were yours and mine!

41. "As a wife I was true. But, such my unease
42. That, could I insert a deed back in Time,
43. I'd make her yours, to secure your care;
44. And the scandal bear,
45. And the penalty for the crime!"

46. --When I had left, and the swinging trees
47. Rang above me, as lauding her candid say,
48. Another was I. Her words were enough:
49. Came smooth, came rough,
50. I felt I could live my day.

51. Next night she died; and her obsequies
52. In the Field of Tombs, by the Via renowned,
53. Had her husband's heed. His tendance spent,
54. I often went
55. And pondered by her mound.

56. All that year and the next year whiled,
57. And I still went thitherward in the gloam;
58. But the Town forgot her and her nook,
59. And her husband took
60. Another Love to his home.

61. And the rumor flew that the lame lone child
62. Whom she wished for its safety child of mine,
63. Was treated ill when offspring came
64. Of the new-made dame,
65. And marked a more vigorous line.

66. A smarter grief within me wrought
67. Than even at loss of her so dear;
68. Dead the being whose soul my soul suffused,
69. Her child ill-used,
70. I helpless to interfere!

71. One eve as I stood at my spot of thought
72. In the white-stoned Garth, brooding thus her wrong,
73. Her husband neared; and to shun his view
74. By her hallowed mew
75. I went from the tombs among

76. To the Cirque of the Gladiators which faced--
77. That haggard mark of Imperial Rome,
78. Whose Pagan echoes mock the chime
79. Of our Christian time:
80. It was void, and I inward clomb.

81. Scarce had night the sun's gold touch displaced
82. From the vast Rotund and the neighboring dead
83. When her husband followed; bowed; half-passed,
84. With lip upcast;
85. Then, halting, sullenly said:

86. "It is noised that you visit my first wife's tomb.
87. Now, I gave her an honored name to bear
88. While living, when dead. So I've claim to ask
89. By what right you task
90. My patience by vigiling there?

91. "There's decency even in death, I assume;
92. Preserve it, sir, and keep away;
93. For the mother of my first-born you
94. Show mind undue!
95. --Sir, I've nothing more to say."

96. A desperate stroke discerned I then--
97. God pardon--or pardon not--the lie;
98. She had sighed that she wished (lest the child should pine
99. Of slights) 'twere mine,
100. So I said: "But the father I.

101. "That you thought it yours is the way of men;
102. But I won her troth long ere your day:
103. You learnt how, in dying, she summoned me?
104. 'Twas in fealty.
105. --Sir, I've nothing more to say,

106. "Save that, if you'll hand me my little maid,
107. I'll take her, and rear her, and spare you toil.
108. Think it more than a friendly act none can;
109. I'm a lonely man,
110. While you've a large pot to boil.

111. "If not, and you'll put it to ball or blade--
112. To-night, to-morrow night, anywhen--
113. I'll meet you here.... But think of it,
114. And in season fit
115. Let me hear from you again."

116. --Well, I went away, hoping; but nought I heard
117. Of my stroke for the child, till there greeted me
118. A little voice that one day came
119. To my window-frame
120. And babbled innocently:

121. "My father who's not my own, sends word
122. I'm to stay here, sir, where I belong!"
123. Next a writing came: "Since the child was the fruit
124. Of your passions brute,
125. Pray take her, to right a wrong."

126. And I did. And I gave the child my love,
127. And the child loved me, and estranged us none.
128. But compunctions loomed; for I'd harmed the dead
129. By what I'd said
130. For the good of the living one.

131. --Yet though, God wot, I am sinner enough,
132. And unworthy the woman who drew me so,
133. Perhaps this wrong for her darling's good
134. She forgives, or would,
135. If only she could know!
