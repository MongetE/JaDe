1. She charged me with having said this and that
2. To another woman long years before,
3. In the very parlour where we sat, -


4. Sat on a night when the endless pour
5. Of rain on the roof and the road below
6. Bent the spring of the spirit more and moreâ€¦.


7. - So charged she me; and the Cupids bow
8. Of her mouth was hard, and her eyes, and her face,
9. And her white forefinger lifted slow.


10. Had she done it gently, or shown a trace
11. That not too curiously would she view
12. A folly passed ere her reign had place,


13. A kiss might have ended it. But I knew
14. From the fall of each word, and the pause between,
15. That the curtain would drop upon us two
16. Ere long, in our play of slave and queen.
