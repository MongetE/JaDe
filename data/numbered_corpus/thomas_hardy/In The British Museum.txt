1. 'What do you see in that time-touched stone,
2. When nothing is there
3. But ashen blankness, although you give it
4. A rigid stare?

5. 'You look not quite as if you saw,
6. But as if you heard,
7. Parting your lips, and treading softly
8. As mouse or bird.

9. 'It is only the base of a pillar, they'll tell you,
10. That came to us
11. From a far old hill men used to name
12. Areopagus.'


13. - 'I know no art, and I only view
14. A stone from a wall,
15. But I am thinking that stone has echoed
16. The voice of Paul,

17. 'Paul as he stood and preached beside it
18. Facing the crowd,
19. A small gaunt figure with wasted features,
20. Calling out loud

21. 'Words that in all their intimate accents
22. Pattered upon
23. That marble front, and were far reflected,
24. And then were gone.

25. 'I'm a labouring man, and know but little,
26. Or nothing at all;
27. But I can't help thinking that stone once echoed
28. The voice of Paul.'
