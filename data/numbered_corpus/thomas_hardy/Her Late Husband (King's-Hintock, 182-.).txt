2. But dig his grave just by
3. The woman's with the initialed stone -
4. As near as he can lie -
5. After whose death he seemed to ail,
6. Though none considered why.

7. "And when I also claim a nook,
8. And your feet tread me in,
9. Bestow me, under my old name,
10. Among my kith and kin,
11. That strangers gazing may not dream
12. I did a husband win."

13. "Widow, your wish shall be obeyed;
14. Though, thought I, certainly
15. You'd lay him where your folk are laid,

18. And on the left hand he."

19. "Aye, sexton; such the Hintock rule,
20. And none has said it nay;
21. But now it haps a native here
22. Eschews that ancient way . . .
23. And it may be, some Christmas night,
24. When angels walk, they'll say:

25. "'O strange interment! Civilized lands
26. Afford few types thereof;
27. Here is a man who takes his rest
28. Beside his very Love,
29. Beside the one who was his wife
30. In our sight up above!'"
