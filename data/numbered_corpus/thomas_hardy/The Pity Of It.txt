1. I walked in loamy Wessex lanes, afar
2. From rail-track and from highway, and I heard
3. In field and farmstead many an ancient word
4. Of local lineage like "Thu bist," "Er war,"
5. "Ich woll," "Er sholl," and by-talk similar,
6. Nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird
7. At England's very loins, thereunto spurred
8. By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are.

9. Then seemed a Heart crying: "Whosoever they be
10. At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame
11. Between kin folk kin tongued even as are we,
12. Sinister, ugly, lurid, be their fame;
13. May their familiars grow to shun their name,
14. And their brood perish everlastingly."
