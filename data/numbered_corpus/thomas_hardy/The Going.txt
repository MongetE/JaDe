1. Why did you give no hint that night
2. That quickly after the morrow's dawn,
3. And calmly, as if indifferent quite,
4. You would close your term here, up and be gone
5. Where I could not follow
6. With wing of swallow
7. To gain one glimpse of you ever anon!

8. Never to bid good-bye
9. Or lip me the softest call,
10. Or utter a wish for a word, while I
11. Saw morning harden upon the wall,
12. Unmoved, unknowing
13. That your great going
14. Had place that moment, and altered all.

15. Why do you make me leave the house
16. And think for a breath it is you I see
17. At the end of the alley of bending boughs
18. Where so often at dusk you used to be;
19. Till in darkening dankness
20. The yawning blankness
21. Of the perspective sickens me!

22. You were she who abode
23. By those red-veined rocks far West,
24. You were the swan-necked one who rode
25. Along the beetling Beeny Crest,
26. And, reining nigh me,
27. Would muse and eye me,
28. While Life unrolled us its very best.

29. Why, then, latterly did we not speak,
30. Did we not think of those days long dead,
31. And ere your vanishing strive to seek
32. That time's renewal? We might have said,
33. "In this bright spring weather
34. We'll visit together
35. Those places that once we visited."

36. Well, well! All's past amend,
37. Unchangeable. It must go.
38. I seem but a dead man held on end
39. To sink down soon. . . . O you could not know
40. That such swift fleeing
41. No soul foreseeing--
42. Not even I--would undo me so!
