1. When the hamlet hailed a birth
2. Judy used to cry:
3. When she heard our christening mirth
4. She would kneel and sigh.
5. She was crazed, we knew, and we
6. Humoured her infirmity.

7. When the daughters and the sons
8. Gathered them to wed,
9. And we like-intending ones
10. Danced till dawn was red,
11. She would rock and mutter, "More
12. Comers to this stony shore!"

13. When old Headsman Death laid hands
14. On a babe or twain,
15. She would feast, and by her brands
16. Sing her songs again.
17. What she liked we let her do,
18. Judy was insane, we knew.
