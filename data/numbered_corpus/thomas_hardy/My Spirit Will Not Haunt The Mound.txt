1. My spirit will not haunt the mound
2. Above my breast,
3. But travel, memory-possessed,
4. To where my tremulous being found
5. Life largest, best.

6. My phantom-footed shape will go
7. When nightfall grays
8. Hither and thither along the ways
9. I and another used to know
10. In backward days.

11. And there you'll find me, if a jot
12. You still should care
13. For me, and for my curious air;
14. If otherwise, then I shall not,
15. For you, be there.
