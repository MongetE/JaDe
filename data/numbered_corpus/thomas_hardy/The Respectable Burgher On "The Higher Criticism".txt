1. Since Reverend Doctors now declare
2. That clerks and people must prepare
3. To doubt if Adam ever were;
4. To hold the flood a local scare;
5. To argue, though the stolid stare,
6. That everything had happened ere
7. The prophets to its happening sware;
8. That David was no giant-slayer,
9. Nor one to call a God-obeyer
10. In certain details we could spare,
11. But rather was a debonair
12. Shrewd bandit, skilled as banjo-player:
13. That Solomon sang the fleshly Fair,
14. And gave the Church no thought whate'er;
15. That Esther with her royal wear,
16. And Mordecai, the son of Jair,
17. And Joshua's triumphs, Job's despair,
18. And Balaam's ass's bitter blare;
19. Nebuchadnezzar's furnace-flare,
20. And Daniel and the den affair,
21. And other stories rich and rare,
22. Were writ to make old doctrine wear
23. Something of a romantic air:
24. That the Nain widow's only heir,
25. And Lazarus with cadaverous glare
26. (As done in oils by Piombo's care)
27. Did not return from Sheol's lair:
28. That Jael set a fiendish snare,
29. That Pontius Pilate acted square,
30. That never a sword cut Malchus' ear
31. And (but for shame I must forbear)
32. That -- -- did not reappear! . . .
33. - Since thus they hint, nor turn a hair,
34. All churchgoing will I forswear,
35. And sit on Sundays in my chair,
36. And read that moderate man Voltaire.
