1. Know this, my brethren, Heaven is clear
2. And all the clouds are gone--
3. The Proper Sort shall flourish now,
4. Good times are coming on"--
5. The evil that was threatened late
6. To all of our degree
7. Hath passed in discord and debate,
8. And,Hey then up go we!

9. A common people strove in vain
10. To shame us unto toil,
11. But they are spent and we remain,
12. And we shall share the spoil
13. According to our several needs
14. As Beauty shall decree,
15. As Age ordains or Birth concedes,
16. And, Hey then up go we!

17. And they that with accursed zeal
18. Our Service would amend,
19. Shall own the odds and come to heel
20. Ere worse befall their end:
21. For though no naked word be wrote
22. Yet plainly shall they see
23. What pinneth Orders on their coat,
24. And, Hey then up go we!

25. Our doorways that, in time of fear,
26. We opened overwide
27. Shall softly close from year to year
28. Till all be purified;
29. For though no fluttering fan be heard      .
30. Nor chaff be seen to flee--
31. The Lord shall winnow the Lord's Preferred--
32. And, Hey then up go we!

33. Our altars which the heathen brake
34. Shall rankly smoke anew,
35. And anise, mint and cummin take
36. Their dread and sovereign due,
37. Whereby the buttons of our trade
38. Shall soon restored be
39. With curious work in gilt and braid,
40. And, Hey then up go we!

41. Then come, my brethren, and prepare
42. The candlesticks and bells,
43. The scarlet, brass, and badger's hair
44. Wherein our Honour dwells,
45. And straitly fence  and strictly keep
46. The Ark's integrity
47. Till Armageddon break our sleep . . .
48. And, Hey then go we!
