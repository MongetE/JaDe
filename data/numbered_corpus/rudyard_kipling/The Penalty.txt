1. Once in life I watched a Star;
2. But I whistled, "Let her go!
3. There are others, fairer far,
4. Which my favouring skies shall show
5. Here I lied, and herein I
6. Stood to pay the penalty.

7. Marvellous the Planets shone
8. As I ranged from coast to coast--
9. But beyond comparison
10. Rode the Star that I had lost.
11. I had lied, and only I
12. Did not guess the penalty! . . .

13. When my Heavens were turned to blood,
14. When the dark had filled my day,
15. Furthest, but most faithful, stood
16. That lone Star I cast away.
17. I had loved myself, and I
18. Have not lived and dare not die!
