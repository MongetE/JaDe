1. She is not Folly -- that I know.
2. Her steadfast eyelids tell me so
3. When, at the hour the lights divide,
4. She steals as summonsed to my side.

5. When, finger on the pursed lip
6. In secret, mirthful fellowship,
7. She, heralding new -- framed delights,
8. Breathes, "This shall be a Night of Nights!"

9. Then, out of Time and out of Space,
10. Is built an Hour and a Place
11. Where all an earnest, baffled Earth
12. Blunders and trips to make us mirth;

13. Whence from the trivial flux of Things,
14. Rise inconceived miscarryings,
15. Outrageous but immortal, shown,
16. Of Her great love, to me alone...

17. She is not Wisdom, but, maybe,
18. Wiser than all the Norns is She:
19. And more than Wisdom I prefer
20. To wait on Her, -- to wait on Her!
