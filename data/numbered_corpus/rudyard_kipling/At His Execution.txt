1. I am made all things to all men--
2. Hebrew, Roman, and Greek--
3. In each one's tongue I speak,
4. Suiting to each my word,
5. That some may be drawn to the Lord!

6. I am made all things to all men--
7. In City or Wilderness
8. Praising the crafts they profess
9. That some may be drawn to the Lord--
10. By any means to my Lord!

11. Since I was overcome
12. By that great Light and Word,
13. I have forgot or forgone
14. The self men call their own
15. (Being made all things to all men)
16. So that I might save some
17. At such small price to the Lord,
18. As being all things to all men.

19. I was made all things to all men,
20. But now my course is done--
21. And now is my reward...
22. Ah, Christ, when I stand at Thy Throne
23. With those I have drawn to the Lord,
24. Restore me my self again!
