1. Ere the mother's milk had dried
2. On my lips the Brethren came--
3. Tore me from my nurse's side,
4. And bestowed on me a name

5. Infamously overtrue--
6. Such as "Bunny," "Stinker," "Podge";--
7. But, whatever I should do,
8. Mine for ever in the Lodge.

9. Then they taught with palm and toe--
10. Then I learned with yelps and tears--
11. All the Armoured Man should know
12. Through his Seven Secret Years...

13. Last, oppressing as oppressed,
14. I was loosed to go my ways
15. With a Totem on my breast
16. Governing my nights and days--

17. Ancient and unbribeable,
18. By the virtue of its Name--
19. Which, however oft I fell,
20. Lashed me back into The Game.

21. And the World, that never knew,
22. Saw no more beneath my chin
23. Than a patch of rainbow-hue,
24. Mixed as Life and crude as Sin.
