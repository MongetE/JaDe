1. Men make them fires on the hearth
2. Each under his roof-tree,
3. And the Four Winds that rule the earth
4. They blow the smoke to me.

5. Across the high hills and the sea
6. And all the changeful skies,
7. The Four Winds blow the smoke to me
8. Till the tears are in my eyes.

9. Until the tears are in my eyes.
10. And my heart is wellnigh broke
11. For thinking on old memories
12. That gather in the smoke.

13. With every shift of every wind
14. The homesick memories come,
15. From every quarter of mankind
16. Where I have made me a home.

17. Four times a fire against the cold
18. And a roof against the rain --
19. Sorrow fourfold and joy fourfold
20. The Four Winds bring again!

21. How can I answer which is best
22. Of all the fires that burn?
23. I have been too often host or guest
24. At every fire in turn.

25. How can I turn from any fire,
26. On any man's hearthstone?
27. I know the wonder and desire
28. That went to build my own!

29. How can I doubt man's joy or woe
30. Where'er his house-fires shine.
31. Since all that man must undergo
32. Will visit me at mine?

33. Oh, you Four Winds that blow so strong
34. And know that his is true,
35. Stoop for a little and carry my song
36. To all the men I knew!

37. Where there are fires against the cold,
38. Or roofs against the rain --
39. With love fourfold and joy fourfold,
40. Take them my songs again!
