1. R. W. Emerson


2. Time and Space decreed his lot,
3. But little Man was quick to note:
4. When Time and Space said Man might not,
5. Bravely he answered, "Nay! I mote."

6. I looked on old New England.
7. Time and Space stood fast.
8. Men built altars to Distance
9. At every mile they passed.

10. Yet sleek with oil, a Force was hid
11. Making mock of all they did,
12. Ready at the appointed hour
13. To yield up to Prometheus
14. The secular and well-drilled Power
15. The Gods secreted thus.

16. And over high Wantastiquer
17. Emulous my lightnings ran,
18. Unregarded but after,
19. To fall in with my plan.

20. I beheld two ministries,
21. One of air and one of earth--
22. At a thought I married these,
23. And my New Age came to birth!

24. For rarely my purpose errs
25. Though oft it seems to pause,
26. And rods and cylinders
27. Obey my planets' laws.

28. Oil I drew from the well,
29. And Franklin's spark from its blue;
30. Time and Distance fell,
31. And Man went forth anew.

32. On the prairie and in the street
33. So long as my chariots roll
34. I bind wings to Adam's feet,
35. And, presently, to his soul!
