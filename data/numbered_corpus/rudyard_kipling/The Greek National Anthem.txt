1. We knew thee of old,
2. Oh divinely restored,
3. By the light of thine eyes
4. And the light of thy Sword.

5. From the graves of our slain
6. Shall thy valour prevail
7. As we greet thee again --
8. Hail, Liberty! Hail!
9. Long time didst thou dwell
10. Mid the peoples that mourn,
11. Awaiting some voice
12. That should bid thee return.

13. Ah, slow broke that day
14. And no man dared call,
15. For the shadow of tyranny
16. Lay over all:

17. And we saw thee sad-eyed,
18. The tears on thy cheeks
19. While thy raiment was dyed
20. In the blood of the Greeks.

21. Yet, behold now thy sons
22. With impetuous breath
23. Go forth to the fight
24. Seeking Freedom or Death.

25. From the graves of our slain
26. Shall thy valour prevail
27. As we greet thee again
28. Hail, Liberty! Hail!
