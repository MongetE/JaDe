1. Reservist of the Line


2. The bachelor 'e fights for one
3. As joyful as can be;
4. But the married man don't call it fun,
5. Because 'e fights for three --
6. For 'Im an' 'Er an' It
7. (An' Two an' One make Three)
8. 'E wants to finish 'is little bit,
9. An' e' wants to go 'ome to is tea!

10. The bachelor pokes up 'is 'ead
11. To see if you are gone;
12. But the married man lies down instead,
13. An' waits till the sights come on,
14. For 'im an' 'Er an' a hit
15. (Direct or recochee)
16. 'E wants to finish 'is little bit,
17. An' 'e wants to go 'ome to 'is tea.

18. The bachelor will miss you clear
19. To fight another day;
20. But the married man, 'e says "No fear!"
21. 'E wants you out of the way
22. Of 'Im an' 'Er an' It
23. (An' 'is road to 'is farm or the sea),
24. 'E wants to finish 'is little bit,
25. An' 'e wants to go 'ome to 'is tea.

26. The bachelor 'e fights 'is fight
27. An' streches out an' snores;
28. But the married man sits up all night --
29. For 'e don't like out-o'-doors.
30. 'E'll strain an' listen an' peer
31. An' give the first alarm--
32. For the sake o' the breathin' 'e's used to 'ear,
33. An' the 'ead on the thick of 'is arm.

34. The bachelor may risk 'is 'ide
35. To 'elp you when you're downed;
36. But the married man will wait beside
37. Till the ambulance comes round.
38. 'E'll take your 'ome address
39. An' all you've time to say,
40. Or if 'e sees there's 'ope, 'e'll press
41. Your art'ry 'alf the day --

42. For 'Im an' 'Er an' It
43. (An' One from Three leaves Two),
44. For 'e knows you wanted to finish your bit,
45. An' 'e knows 'oo's wantin' you.

47. (Our 'only One in Three),
48. We're all of us anxious to finish our bit,
49. An' we want to get 'ome to our tea!

50. Yes, It an' 'Er an' 'Im,
51. Which often makes me think
52. The married man must sink or swim
53. An' -- 'e can't afford to sink!
54. Oh, 'Im an' It an' 'Er
55. Since Adam an' Eve began!
56. So I'd rather fight with the bacheler
57. An' be nursed by the married man!
