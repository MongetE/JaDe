2. It got to shammin' wounded an' retirin' from the 'alt.
3. 'Ole companies was lookin' for the nearest road to slope;
4. It were just a bloomin' knock-out -- an' our fault!

5. Now there ain't no chorus 'ere to give,
6. Nor there ain't no band to play;
7. An' I wish I was dead 'fore I done what I did,
8. Or seen what I seed that day!
9. We was sick o' bein' punished, an' we let 'em know it, too;
10. An' a company-commander up an' 'it us with a sword,
11. An' some one shouted "'Ook it!" an' it come to ~sove-ki-poo~,
12. An' we chucked our rifles from us -- O my Gawd!

13. There was thirty dead an' wounded on the ground we wouldn't keep --
14. No, there wasn't more than twenty when the front begun to go;
15. But, Christ! along the line o' flight they cut us up like sheep,
16. An' that was all we gained by doin' so.

17. I 'eard the knives be'ind me, but I dursn't face my man,
18. Nor I don't know where I went to, 'cause I didn't 'alt to see,
19. Till I 'eard a beggar squealin' out for quarter as 'e ran,
20. An' I thought I knew the voice an' -- it was me!

27. Yes, every little drummer 'ad 'is rights an' wrongs to mind,
28. So we had to pay for teachin' -- an' we paid!

31. An' they gave us each a medal for subduin' England's foes,
32. An' I 'ope you like my song -- because it's true!

33. An' there ain't no chorus 'ere to give,
34. Nor there ain't no band to play;
35. But I wish I was dead 'fore I done what I did,
36. Or seen what I seed that day!
