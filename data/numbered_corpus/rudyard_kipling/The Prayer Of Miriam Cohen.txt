1. From the wheel and the drift of Things
2. Deliver us, Good Lord,
3. And we will face the wrath of Kings,
4. The faggot and the sword!

5. Lay not thy Works before our eyes
6. Nor vex us with thy Wars,
7. Lest we should feel the straining skies
8. O'ertrod by trampling stars.

9. Hold us secure behind the gates
10. Of saving flesh and bone,
11. Lest we should dream what Dream awaits
12. The Soul escaped alone.

13. Thy Path, thy Purposes conceal
14. From our beleaguered realm
15. Lest any shattering whisper steal
16. Upon us and o'erwhelm.

17. A veil 'twixt us and Thee, Good Lord,
18. A veil 'twixt us and Thee--
19. Lest we should hear too clear, too clear,
20. And unto madness see!
