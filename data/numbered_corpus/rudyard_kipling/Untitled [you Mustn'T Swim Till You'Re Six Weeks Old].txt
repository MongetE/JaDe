1. You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old,
2. Or your head will be sunk by your heels;
3. And summer gales and Killer Whales
4. Are bad for baby seals.
5. Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,
6. As bad as bad can be.
7. But splash and grow strong,
8. And you can't be wrong,
9. Child of the Open Sea!
