1. Oh, glorious are the guarded heights
2. Where guardian souls abide--
3. Self-exiled from our gross delights--
4. Above, beyond, outside:
5. An ampler arc their spirit swings--
6. Commands a juster view--
7. We have their word for all these things,
8. No doubt their words are true.

9. Yet we, the bond slaves of our day,
10. Whom dirt and danger press--
11. Co-heirs of insolence,  delay,
12. And leagued unfaithfulness--
13. Such is our need must seek indeed
14. And, having found, engage
15. The men who merely do the work
16. For which they draw the wage.

17. From forge and farm and mine and bench,
18. Deck, altar, outpost lone--
19. Mill, school, battalion, counter, trench,
20. Rail, senate, sheepfold, throne--
21. Creation's cry goes up on high
22. From age to cheated age:
23. "Send us the men who do the work
24. "For which they draw the wage!"

25. Words cannot help nor wit achieve,
26. Nor e'en the all-gifted fool,
27. Too weak to enter, bide, or leave
28. The lists he cannot rule.
29. Beneath the sun we count on none
30. Our evil to assuage,
31. Except the men that do the work
32. For which they draw the wage.

33. When through the Gates of Stress and Strain
34. Comes forth the vast Event--
35. The simple, sheer, sufficing, sane
36. Result of labour spent--
37. They that have wrought the end unthought
38. Be neither saint nor sage,
39. But only men who did the work
40. For which they drew the wage.

41. Wherefore to these the Fates shall bend
42. (And all old idle things )
43. Werefore on these shall Power attend
44. Beyond the grip of kings:
45. Each in his place, by right, not grace,
46. Shall rule his heritage--
47. The men who simply do the work
48. For which they draw the wage.

49. Not such as scorn the loitering street,
50. Or waste, to earth its praise,
51. Their noontide's unreturning heat
52. About their morning ways;
53. But such as dower each mortgaged hour
54. Alike with clean courage--
55. Even the men who do the work
56. For which they draw the wage--
57. Men, like to Gods, that do the work
58. For which they draw the wage--
59. Begin-continue-close that work
60. For which they draw the wage!
