1. There are three degrees of bliss
2. At the foot of Allah's Throne
3. And the highest place is his
4. Who saves a brother's soul
5. At peril of his own.
6. There is the Power made known!

7. There are three degrees of bliss
8. In Garden of Paradise,
9. And the second place is his
10. Who saves his brother's soul
11. By excellent advice.
12. For there the Glory lies!

13. There the are three degrees of bliss
14. And three abodes of the Blest,
15. And the lowest place is his
16. Who had saved a soul by jest
17. And a brother's soul in sport...
18. But there do the Angels resort!
