1. Your trail runs to the westward,
2. And mine to my own place;
3. There is water between our lodges,
4. And I have not seen your face.

5. But since I have read your verses
6. 'Tis easy to  guess the rest,--
7. Because in the hearts of the children
8. There is neither East nor West.

9. Born to a thousand fortunes
10. Of good or evil hap,
11. Once they were kings together,
12. Throned in a mother's lap.

13. Surely they know that secret--
14. Yellow and black and white--
15. When they meet as kings together
16. In innocent dreams at night.

17. By a moon they all can play with--
18. Grubby and grimed and unshod,
19. Very happy together,
20. And very near to God.

21. Your trail runs to the westward,
22. And mine to my own place:
23. There is water between our lodges,
24. And you cannot see my face.--

25. And that is well--for crying
26. Should neither be written nor seen,
27. But if I call you Smoke-in-the-Eyes,
28. I know you will know what I mean.
