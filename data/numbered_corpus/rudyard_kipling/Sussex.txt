1. GOD gave all men all earth to love,
2. But since our hearts are small,
3. Ordained for each one spot should prove
4. Belovèd over all;
5. That, as He watched Creation’s birth,
6. So we, in godlike mood,
7. May of our love create our earth
8. And see that it is good.
9. So one shall Baltic pines content,
10. As one some Surrey glade,
11. Or one the palm-grove’s droned lament
12. Before Levuka’s Trade.
13. Each to his choice, and I rejoice
14. The lot has fallen to me
15. In a fair ground—in a fair ground—
16. Yea, Sussex by the sea!
17. No tender-hearted garden crowns,
18. No bosomed woods adorn
19. Our blunt, bow-headed, whale-backed Downs,
20. But gnarled and writhen thorn—
21. Bare slopes where chasing shadows skim,
22. And, through the gaps revealed,
23. Belt upon belt, the wooded, dim,
24. Blue goodness of the Weald.

25. Clean of officious fence or hedge,
26. Half-wild and wholly tame,
27. The wise turf cloaks the white cliff edge
28. As when the Romans came.
29. What sign of those that fought and died
30. At shift of sword and sword?
31. The barrow and the camp abide,
32. The sunlight and the sward.

33. Here leaps ashore the full Sou’west
34. All heavy-winged with brine,
35. Here lies above the folded crest
36. The Channel’s leaden line;
37. And here the sea-fogs lap and cling,
38. And here, each warning each,
39. The sheep-bells and the ship-bells ring
40. Along the hidden beach.

41. We have no waters to delight
42. Our broad and brookless vales—
43. Only the dewpond on the height
44. Unfed, that never fails—
45. Whereby no tattered herbage tells
46. Which way the season flies—
47. Only our close-bit thyme that smells
48. Like dawn in Paradise.

49. Here through the strong and shadeless days
50. The tinkling silence thrills;
51. Or little, lost, Down churches praise
52. The Lord who made the hills:
53. But here the Old Gods guard their round,
54. And, in her secret heart,
55. The heathen kingdom Wilfrid found
56. Dreams, as she dwells, apart.

57. Though all the rest were all my share,
58. With equal soul I’d see
59. Her nine-and-thirty sisters fair,
60. Yet none more fair than she.
61. Choose ye your need from Thames to Tweed,
62. And I will choose instead
63. Such lands as lie ’twixt Rake and Rye,
64. Black Down and Beachy Head.

65. I will go out against the sun
66. Where the rolled scarp retires,
67. And the Long Man of Wilmington
68. Looks naked toward the shires;
69. And east till doubling Rother crawls
70. To find the fickle tide,
71. By dry and sea-forgotten walls,
72. Our ports of stranded pride.

73. I will go north about the shaws
74. And the deep ghylls that breed
75. Huge oaks and old, the which we hold
76. No more than Sussex weed;
77. Or south where windy Piddinghoe’s
78. Begilded dolphin veers
79. And red beside wide-bankèd Ouse
80. Lie down our Sussex steers.

81. So to the land our hearts we give
82. Till the sure magic strike,
83. And Memory, Use, and Love make live
84. Us and our fields alike—
85. That deeper than our speech and thought,
86. Beyond our reason’s sway,
87. Clay of the pit whence we were wrought
88. Yearns to its fellow-clay.

89. God gives all men all earth to love,
90. But since man’s heart is small,
91. Ordains for each one spot shall prove
92. Beloved over all.
93. Each to his choice, and I rejoice
94. The lot has fallen to me
95. In a fair ground—in a fair ground—
96. Yea, Sussex by the sea!
