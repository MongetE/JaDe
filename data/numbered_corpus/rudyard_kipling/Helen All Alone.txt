1. There was darkness under Heaven
2. For an hour's space--
3. Darkness that we knew was given
4. Us for special grace.
5. Sun and noon and stars were hid,
6. God had left His Throne,
7. When Helen came to me, she did,
8. Helen all alone!
9. Side by side (because our fate
10. Damned us ere our birth)
11. We stole out of Limbo Gate
12. Looking for the Earth.
13. Hand in pulling hand amid
14. Fear no dreams have known,
15. Helen ran with me, she did,
16. Helen all alone!
17. When the Horror passing speech
18. Hunted us along,
19. Each laid hold on each, and each
20. Found the other strong.
21. In the teeth of Things forbid
22. And Reason overthrown,
23. Helen stood by me, she did,
24. Helen all alone!
25. When, at last, we heard those Fires
26. Dull and die away,
27. When, at last, our linked desires
28. Dragged us up to day;
29. When, at last, our souls were rid
30. Of what that Night had shown,
31. Helen passed from me, she did,
32. Helen all alone!
33. Let her go and find a mate,
34. As I will find a bride,
35. Knowing naught of Limbo Gate
36. Or Who are penned inside.
37. There is knowledge God forbid
38. More than one should own.
39. So Helen went from me, she did,
40. Oh, my soul, be glad she did!
41. Helen all alone!
