1. With us there rade a Maister-Cook that came
2. From the Rochelle which is neere Angouleme.
3. Littel hee was, but rounder than a topp,
4. And his small berd hadde dipped in manie a soppe,
5. His honde was smoother than beseemeth mann's,
6. And his discoorse was all of marzipans,
7. Of tripes of Caen, or Burdeux snailes swote,
8. And Seinte Menhoulde wher cooken pigges-foote.
9. To Thoulouse and to Bress and Carcasson
10. For pyes and fowles and chesnottes hadde hee wonne,
11. Of hammes of Thuringie colde hee prate,
12. And well hee knew what Princes hadde on plate
13. At Christmas-tide, from Artois to Gascogne.

14. Lordinges, quod hee, manne liveth nat alone
15. By bred, but meates rost and seethed, and broth,
16. And purchasable deinties, on mine othe.

28. But, as hee eateth so his thought shall bee.
29. And Holie Fader's self (with reveraunce)
30. Oweth to Cooke his port and his presaunce.
31. Wherebye it cometh past disputison
32. Cookes over alle men have dominion,
33. Which follow them as schippe her gouvernail.
34. Enoff of wordes-beginneth heere my tale:--
