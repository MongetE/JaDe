1. I was very well pleased with what I knowed,
2. I reckoned myself no fool --
3. Till I met with a maid on the Brookland Road,
4. That turned me back to school.

5. Low down-low down!
6. Where the liddle green lanterns shine --
7. O maids, I've done with 'ee all but one,
8. And she can never be mine!
9. 'Twas right in the middest of a hot June night,
10. With thunder duntin' round,
11. And I see her face by the fairy-light
12. That beats from off the ground.

13. She only smiled and she never spoke,
14. She smiled and went away;
15. But when she'd gone my heart was broke
16. And my wits was clean astray.

17. O, stop your ringing and let me be --
18. Let be, O Brookland bells!
19. You'll ring Old Goodman out of the sea,
20. Before I wed one else!

21. Old Goodman's Farm is rank sea-sand,
22. And was this thousand year;
23. But it shall turn to rich plough-land
24. Before I change my dear.

25. O, Fairfield Church is water-bound
26. From autumn to the spring;
27. But it shall turn to high hill-ground
28. Before my bells do ring.

29. O, leave me walk on Brookland Road,
30. In the thunder and warm rain --
31. O, leave me look where my love goed,
32. And p'raps I'll see her again!

33. Low down -- low down!
34. Where the liddle green lanterns shine --
35. O maids, I've done with 'ee all but one,
36. And she can never be mine!
