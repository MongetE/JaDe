1. At the eleventh hour he came,
2. But his wages were the same
3. As ours who all day long had trod
4. The wine-press of the Wrath of God.

5. When he shouldered through the lines
6. Of our cropped and mangled vines,
7. His unjaded eye could scan
8. How each hour had marked its man.

9. (Children of the morning-tide
10. With the hosts of noon died,
11. And our noon contingents lay
12. Dead with twilight's spent array.)

13. Since his back had felt no load ,
14. Virtue still in him abode;
15. So he swiftly made his own
16. Those last spoils we had not won.

17. We went home delivered thence,
18. Grudging him no recompense
19. Till he portioned praise of blame
20. To our works before he came.

21. Till he showed us for our good--
22. Deaf to mirth, and blind to scorn--
23. How we might have best withstood
24. Burdens that he had not born!
