1. Sooner or late--in earnest or in jest--
2. (But the stakes are no jest) Ithuriel's Hour
3. Will spring on us, for the first time, the test
4. Of our sole unbacked competence and power
5. Up to the limit of our years and dower
6. Of judgment--or beyond. But here we have
7. Prepared long since our garland or our grave.

8. For, at that hour, the sum of all our past,
9. Act, habit, thought, and passion, shall be cast
10. In one addition, be it more or less,
11. And as that reading runs so shall we do;
12. Meeting, astounded, victory at the last,
13. Or, first and last, our own unworthiness.
14. And none can change us though they die to save!
