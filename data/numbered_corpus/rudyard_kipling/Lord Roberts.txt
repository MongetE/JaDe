1. 1


2. He passed in the very battle-smoke
3. Of the war that he had descried.
4. Three hundred mile of cannon spoke
5. When the Master-Gunner died.

6. He passed to the very sound of the guns;
7. But, before his eye grew dim,
8. He had seen the faces of the sons
9. Whose sires had served with him,

10. He had touched their sword-hilts and greeted
11. With the old sure word of praise;
12. And there was virtue in touch and speech
13. As it had been in old days.

14. So he dismissed them and took his rest,
15. And the steadfast spirit went forth
16. Between the adoring East and West
17. And the tireless guns of the North.

18. Clean, simple, valiant, well-beloved,
19. Flawless in faith and fame,
20. Whom neither ease nor honours moved
21. An hair's-breadth from his aim.

22. Never again the war-wise face,
23. The weighed and urgent word
24. That pleaded in the market-place-
25. Pleaded and was not heard!

26. Yet from his life a new life springs
27. Through all the hosts to come,
28. And Glory is the least of things
29. That follow this man home.
