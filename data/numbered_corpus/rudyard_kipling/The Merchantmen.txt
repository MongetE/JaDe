1. King Solomon drew merchantmen,
2. Because of his desire
3. For peacocks, apes, and ivory,
4. From Tarshish unto Tyre:
5. With cedars out of Lebanon
6. Which Hiram rafted down,
7. But we be only sailormen
8. That use in London Town.

9. Coastwise -- cross-seas -- round the world and back again --
10. Where the flaw shall head us or the full Trade suits --
11. Plain-sail -- storm-sail -- lay your board and tack again --
12. And that's the way we'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots!

13. We bring no store of ingots,
14. Of spice or precious stones,
15. But that we have we gathered
16. With sweat and aching bones:
17. In flame beneath the tropics,
18. In frost upon the floe,
19. And jeopardy of every wind
20. That does between them go.

21. And some we got by purchase,
22. And some we had by trade,
23. And some we found by courtesy
24. Of pike and carronade --
25. At midnight, 'mid-sea meetings,
26. For charity to keep,
27. And light the rolling homeward-bound
28. That rode a foot too deep.

29. By sport of bitter weather
30. We're walty, strained, and scarred
31. From the kentledge on the kelson
32. To the slings upon the yard.
33. Six oceans had their will of us
34. To carry all away --
35. Our galley's in the Baltic,
36. And our boom's in Mossel Bay!

37. We've floundered off the Texel,
38. Awash with sodden deals,
39. We've slipped from Valparaiso
40. With the Norther at our heels:
41. We've ratched beyond the Crossets
42. That tusk the Southern Pole,
43. And dipped our gunnels under
44. To the dread Agulhas roll.

45. Beyond all outer charting
46. We sailed where none have sailed,
47. And saw the land-lights burning
48. On islands none have hailed;
49. Our hair stood up for wonder,
50. But, when the night was done,
51. There danced the deep to windward
52. Blue-empty 'neath the sun!

53. Strange consorts rode beside us
54. And brought us evil luck;
55. The witch-fire climbed our channels,
56. And flared on vane and truck:
57. Till, through the red tornado,
58. That lashed us nigh to blind,
59. We saw The Dutchman plunging,
60. Full canvas, head to wind!

61. We've heard the Midnight Leadsman
62. That calls the black deep down --
63. Ay, thrice we've heard The Swimmer,
64. The Thing that may not drown.
65. On frozen bunt and gasket
66. The sleet-cloud drave her hosts,
67. When, manned by more than signed with us,
68. We passed the Isle o' Ghosts!

69. And north, amid the hummocks,
70. A biscuit-toss below,
71. We met the silent shallop
72. That frighted whalers know;
73. For, down a cruel ice-lane,
74. That opened as he sped,
75. We saw dead Henry Hudson
76. Steer, North by West, his dead.

77. So dealt God's waters with us
78. Beneath the roaring skies,
79. So walked His signs and marvels
80. All naked to our eyes:
81. But we were heading homeward
82. With trade to lose or make --
83. Good Lord, they slipped behind us
84. In the tailing of our wake!

85. Let go, let go the anchors;
86. Now shamed at heart are we
87. To bring so poor a cargo home
88. That had for gift the sea!
89. Let go the great bow-anchors --
90. Ah, fools were we and blind --
91. The worst we stored with utter toil,
92. The best we left behind!

93. Coastwise -- cross-seas -- round the world and back again,
94. Whither flaw shall fail us or the Trades drive down:
95. Plain-sail -- storm-sail -- lay your board and tack again --
96. And all to bring a cargo up to London Town!
