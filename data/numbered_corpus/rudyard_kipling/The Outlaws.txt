1. 1

2. Through learned and laborious years
3. They set themselves to find
4. Fresh terrors and undreamed-of fears
5. To heap upon mankind.

6. ALl that they drew from Heaven above
7. Or digged from earth beneath,
8. They laid into their treasure-trove
9. And arsenals of death:

10. While, for well-weighed advantage sake,
11. Ruler and ruled alike
12. Built up the faith they meant to break
13. When the fit hour should strike.

14. They traded with the careless earth,
15. And good return it gave:
16. They plotted by their neighbour's hearth
17. The means to make him slave.

18. When all was ready to their hand
19. They loosed their hidden sword,
20. And utterly laid waste a land
21. Their oath was pledged to guard.

22. Coldly they went about to raise
23. To life and make more dread
24. Abominations of old days,
25. That men believed were dead.

26. They paid the price to reach their goal
27. Across a world in flame;
28. But their own hate slew their own soul
29. Before that victory came.
