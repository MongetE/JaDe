1. After He Has Been Extemporising On an Instrument Not Of His Own Invention -- Browning


2. Lo! What is this that I make -- sudden, supreme, unrehearsed --
3. This that my clutch in the crowd pressed at a venture has raised?
4. Forward and onward I sprang when I thought (as I ought) I reversed,
5. And a cab like martagon opes and I sit in the wreckage dazed.

6. And someone is taking my name, and the driver is rending the air
7. With cries for my blood and my gold, and a snickering news-boy brings
8. My cap, wheel-pashed from the kerb. I must run her home for repair,
9. Where she leers with her bonnet awry--flat on the nether springs!
