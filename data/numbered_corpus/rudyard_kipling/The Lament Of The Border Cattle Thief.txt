1. O woe is me for the merry life
2. I led beyond the Bar,
3. And a treble woe for my winsome wife
4. That weeps at Shalimar.

5. They have taken away my long jezail,
6. My shield and sabre fine,
7. And heaved me into the Central jail
8. For lifting of the kine.

9. The steer may low within the byre,
10. The Jat may tend his grain,
11. But there'll be neither loot nor fire
12. Till I come back again.

13. And God have mercy on the Jat
14. When once my fetters fall,
15. And Heaven defend the farmer's hut
16. When I am loosed from thrall.

17. It's woe to bend the stubborn back
18. Above the grinching quern,
19. It's woe to hear the leg-bar clack
20. And jingle when I turn!

21. But for the sorrow and the shame,
22. The brand on me and mine,
23. I'll pay you back in leaping flame
24. And loss of the butchered kine.

25. For every cow I spared before
26. In charity set free,
27. If I may reach my hold once more
28. I'll reive an honest three.

29. For every time I raised the low
30. That scared the dusty plain,
31. By sword and cord, by torch and tow
32. I'll light the land with twain!

33. Ride hard, ride hard to Abazai,
34. Young ~Sahib~ with the yellow hair --
35. Lie close, lie close as khuttucks lie,
36. Fat herds below Bonair!

37. The one I'll shoot at twilight-tide,
38. At dawn I'll drive the other;
39. The black shall mourn for hoof and hide,
40. The white man for his brother.

41. 'Tis war, red war, I'll give you then,
42. War till my sinews fail;
43. For the wrong you have done to a chief of men,
44. And a thief of the Zukka Kheyl.

45. And if I fall to your hand afresh
46. I give you leave for the sin,
47. That you cram my throat with the foul pig's flesh,
48. And swing me in the skin!
