1. Nov. 27, 8 B.C. Horace, BK. V. Ode


2. As watchers couched beneath a Bantine oak,
3. Hearing the dawn-wind stir,
4. Know that the present strength of night is broke
5. Though no dawn threaten her
6. Till dawn's appointed hour--so Virgil died,
7. Aware of change at hand, and prophesied

8. Change upon all the Eternal Gods had made
9. And on the Gods alike--
10. Fated as dawn but, as the dawn, delayed
11. Till the just hour should strike--

12. A Star new-risen above the living and dead;
13. And the lost shades that were our loves restored
14. As lovers, and for ever. So he said;
15. Having received the word...

16. Maecenas waits me on the Esquiline:
17. Thither to-night go I....
18. And shall this dawn restore us, Virgil mine
19. To dawn? Beneath what sky?
