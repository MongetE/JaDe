1. Theodore Roosevelt

2. The interpreter then called for a man-servant of his, one Great-Heart. -- Bunyan's' Pilgrim's Process


3. Concerning brave Captains
4. Our age hath made known
5. For all men to honour,
6. One standeth alone,
7. Of whom, o'er both oceans,
8. Both peoples may say:
9. "Our realm is diminished
10. With Great-Heart away."

11. In purpose unsparing,
12. In action no less,
13. The labours he praised
14. He would seek and profess
15. Through travail and battle,
16. At hazard and pain. . . .
17. And our world is none the braver
18. Since Great-Heart was ta'en!

19. Plain speech with plain folk,
20. And plain words for false things,
21. Plain faith in plain dealing
22. 'Twixt neighbours or kings,
23. He used and he followed,
24. However it sped. . . .
25. Oh, our world is none more honest
26. Now Great-Heart is dead!

27. The heat of his spirit
28. Struck warm through all lands;
29. For he loved such as showed
30. 'Emselves men of their hands;
31. In love, as in hate,
32. Paying home to the last. . . .
33. But our world is none the kinder
34. Now Great-Heart hath passed!

35. Hard-schooled by long power,
36. Yet most humble of mind
37. Where aught that he was
38. Might advantage mankind.
39. Leal servant, loved master,
40. Rare comrade, sure guide. . . .
41. Oh, our world is none the safer
42. Now Great-Heart hath died!

43. Let those who would handle
44. Make sure they can wield
45. His far-reaching sword
46. And his close-guarding shield:
47. For those who must journey
48. Henceforward alone
49. Have need of stout convoy
50. Now Great-Heart is gone.
