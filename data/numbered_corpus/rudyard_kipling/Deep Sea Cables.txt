1. The wrecks dissolve above us; their dust drops down from afar -
2. Down to the dark, to the utter dark, where the blind white sea-snakes are.
3. There is no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of the deep,
4. Or the great grey level plains of ooze where the shell-burred cables creep.
5. Here in the womb of the world - here on the tie-ribs of earth
6. Words, and the words of men, flicker and flutter and beat -
7. Warning, sorrow and gain, salutation and mirth -
8. For a Power troubles the Still that has neither voice nor feet.

9. They have wakened the timeless Things; they have killed their father Time
10. Joining hands in the gloom, a league from the last of the sun.
11. Hush! Men talk to-day o'er the waste of the ultimate slime,
12. And a new Word runs between: whispering, 'Let us be one!'
