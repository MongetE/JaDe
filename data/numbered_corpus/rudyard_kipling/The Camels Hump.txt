1. The Camel's hump is an ugly lump
2. Which well you may see at the Zoo;
3. But uglier yet is the hump we get
4. From having too little to do.

5. Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,
6. If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,
7. We get the hump-
8. Cameelious hump-
9. The hump that is black and blue!

10. We climb out of bed with a frouzly head,
11. And a snarly-yarly voice.
12. We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl
13. At our bath and our boots and our toys;

14. And there ought to be a corner for me
15. (And I know' there is one for you)
16. When we get the hump-
17. Cameelious hump-
18. The hump that is black and blue!

19. The cure for this ill is not to sit still,
20. Or frowst with a book by the fire;
21. But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,
22. And dig till you gently perspire;

23. And then you will find that the sun and the wind,
24. And the Djinn of the Garden too,
25. Have lifted the hump-
26. The horrible hump-
27. The hump that is black and blue!

28. I get it as well as you-oo-oo-
29. If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo!
30. We all get hump-
31. Cameelious hump-
32. Kiddies and grown-ups too!
