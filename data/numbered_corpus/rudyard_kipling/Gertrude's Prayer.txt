1. That which is marred at birth Time shall not mend,
2. Nor water out of bitter well make clean;
3. All evil thing returneth at the end,
4. Or elseway walketh in our blood unseen.
5. Whereby the more is sorrow in certaine--
6. Dayspring mishandled cometh not againe.

7. To-bruized be that slender, sterting spray
8. Out of the oake's rind that should betide
9. A branch of girt and goodliness, straightway
10. Her spring is turned on herself, and wried
11. And knotted like some gall or veiney wen.--
12. Dayspring mishandled cometh not againe.

13. Noontide repayeth never morning-bliss--
14. Sith noon to morn is incomparable;
15. And, so it be our dawning goth amiss,
16. None other after--hour serveth well.
17. Ah! Jesu-Moder, pitie my oe paine--
18. Dayspring mishandled cometh not againe!
