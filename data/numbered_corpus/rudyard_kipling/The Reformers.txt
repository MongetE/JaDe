1. 1


2. Not in the camp his victory lies
3. Or triumph in the market-place,
4. Who is his Nation's sacrifice
5. To turn the judgement from his race.

6. Happy is he who, bred and taught
7. By sleek, sufficing Circumstance --
8. Whose Gospel was the apparelled thought,
9. Whose Gods were Luxury and Chance --

10. Seese, on the threshold of his days,
11. The old life shrivel like a scroll,
12. And to unheralded dismays
13. Submits his body and his soul;

14. The fatted shows wherein he stood
15. Foregoing, and the idiot pride,
16. That he may prove with his own blood
17. All that his easy sires denied --

18. Ultimate issues, primal springs,
19. Demands, abasements, penalties --
20. The imperishable plinth of things
21. Seen and unseen, that touch our peace.

22. For, though ensnaring ritual dim
23. His vision through the after-years,
24. Yet virtue shall go out of him --
25. Example profiting his peers.

26. With great things charged he shall not hold
27. Aloof till great occasion rise,
28. But serve, full-harnessed, as of old,
29. The Days that are the Destinies.

30. He shall forswear and put away
31. The idols of his sheltered house;
32. And to Necessity shall pay
33. Unflinching tribute of his vows.

34. He shall not plead another's act,
35. Nor bind him in another's oath
36. To weigh the Word above the Fact,
37. Or make or take excuse for sloth.

38. The yoke he bore shall press him still,
39. And, long-ingrained effort goad
40. To find, to fasion, and fulfil
41. The cleaner life, the sterner code.

42. Not in the camp his victory lies --
43. The world (unheeding his return)
44. Shall see it in his children's eyes
45. And from his grandson's lips shall learn!
