1. THE careful text-books measure
2. (Let all who build beware!)
3. The load, the shock, the pressure
4. Material can bear.
5. So, when the buckled girder
6. Lets down the grinding span,
7. 'The blame of loss, or murder,
8. Is laid upon the man.
9. Not on  the Stuff - the Man!

10. But in our daily dealing
11. With stone and steel, we find

12. The Gods have no such feeling
13. Of justice toward mankind.
14. To no set gauge they make us-
15. For no laid course prepare-
16. And presently o'ertake us
17. With loads we cannot bear:
18. Too merciless to bear.

19. The prudent text-books give it
20. In tables at the end
21. 'The stress that shears a rivet
22. Or makes a tie-bar bend-
23. 'What traffic wrecks macadam-
24. What concrete should endure-
25. but we, poor Sons of Adam
26. Have no such literature,
27. To warn us or make sure!

28. We hold all Earth to plunder -
29. All Time and Space as well-
30. Too wonder-stale to wonder
31. At each new miracle;
32. Till, in the mid-illusion
33. Of Godhead 'neath our hand,
34. Falls multiple confusion
35. On all we did or planned-
36. The mighty works we planned.

37. We only of Creation
38. (0h, luckier bridge and rail)
39. Abide the twin damnation-
40. To fail and know we fail.
41. Yet we - by which sole token
42. We know we once were Gods-
43. Take shame in being broken
44. However great the odds-
45. The burden of the Odds.

46. Oh, veiled and secret Power
47. Whose paths we seek in vain,
48. Be with us in our hour
49. Of overthrow and pain;
50. That we - by which sure token
51. We know Thy ways are true -
52. In spite of being broken,
53. Because of being broken
54. May rise and build anew
55. Stand up and build anew.
