1. As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
2. The Angel of the Earth came down, and offered Earth in fee;
3. But Adam did not need it,
4. Nor the plough he would not speed it,
5. Singing: --"Earth and Water, Air and Fire,
6. What more can mortal man desire?"
7. (The Apple Tree's in bud)

8. As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
9. The Angel of the Waters offered all the Seas in fee;
10. But Adam would not take 'em,
11. Nor the ships he wouldn't make 'em,
12. Singing:--"Water, Earth and Air and Fire,
13. What more can mortal man desire? "
14. (The Apple Tree's in leaf.)

15. As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
16. The Angel of the Air he offered all the Air in fee;
17. But Adam did not crave it,
18. Nor the flight he wouldn't brave it,
19. Singing: --"Air and Water, Earth and Fire,
20. What more can mortal man desire:"
21. (The Apple Tree's in bloom.)

22. As Adam lay a-dreaming beneath the Apple Tree
23. The Angel of the Fire rose up and not a word said he;
24. But he wished a flame and made it,
25. And in Adam's heart he laid it,
26. Singing: --"Fire, Fire, burning Fire!
27. Stand up, and reach your heart's desire!"
28. (The Apple Blossom's set.)

29. As Adam was a-working outside of Eden-Wall,
30. He used the Earth, he used the Seas, he used the Air and all;
31. Till out of black disaster
32. He arose to be a master
33. Of Earth and Water, Air and Fire,
34. But never reached his heart's desire!
35. (The Apple Tree's cut down!)
