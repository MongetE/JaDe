1. (Died, South African War, March 27, 1900)


2. With those that bred, with those that loosed the strife,
3. He had no part whose hands were clear of gain;
4. But subtle, strong, and stubborn, gave his life
5. To a lost cause, and knew the gift was vain.

6. Later shall rise a people, sane and great,
7. Forged in strong fires, by equal war made one;
8. Telling old battles over without hate --
9. Not least his name shall pass from sire to son.

10. He may not meet the onsweep of our van
11. In the doomed city when we close the score;
12. Yet o'er his grave -- his grave that holds a man --
13. Our deep-tongued guns shall answer his once more!
