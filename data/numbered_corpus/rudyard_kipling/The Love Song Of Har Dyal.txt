1. Alone upon the housetops to the North
2. I turn and watch the lightnings in the sky--
3. The glamour of thy footsteps in the North.
4. Come back to me, Beloved, or I die.

5. Below my feet the still bazar is laid--
6. Far, far below the weary camels lie--
7. The camels and the captives of thy raid.
8. Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!
9. My father's wife is old and harsh with years,
10. And drudge of all my father's house am I--
11. My bread is sorrow and my drink is tears.
12. Come back to me, Beloved, or I die!
