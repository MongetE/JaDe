1. Longfellow


2. The drowsy carrier sways
3. To the drowsy horses' tramp.
4. His axles winnow the sprays
5. Of the hedge where the rabbit plays
6. In the light of his single lamp.

7. He hears a roar behind,
8. A howl, a hoot, and a yell
9. A headlight strikes him blind
10. And a stench o'erpowers the wind
11. Like a blast from the mouth of Hell.

12. He mends his swingle-bar
13. And loud his curses ring;
14. But a mother watching afar
15. Hears the hum of the doctor's car
16. Like the beat of an angel's wings!

17. So, to the poet's mood,
18. Motor or carrier's wan,
19. Properly understood,
20. Are neither evil nor good--
21. Ormuzd not Ahriman!
