1. She dropped the bar, she shot the bolt, she fed the fire anew
2. For she heard a whimper under the sill and a great grey paw came through.
3. The fresh flame comforted the hut and shone on the roof-beam,
4. And the Only Son lay down again and dreamed that he dreamed a dream.
5. The last ash fell from the withered log with the click of a falling spark,
6. And the Only Son woke up again, and called across the dark:--
7. "Now was I born of womankind and laid in a mother's breast?
8. For I have dreamed of a shaggy hide whereon I went to rest.
9. And was I born of womankind and laid on a father's arm?
10. For I have dreamed of clashing teeth that guarded me from harm.

11. And was I born an Only Son and did I play alone?
12. For I have dreamed of comrades twain that bit me to the bone.
13. And did I break the barley-cake and steep it in the tyre?
14. For I have dreamed of a youngling kid new-riven from the byre:
15. For I have dreamed of a midnight sky and a midnight call to blood
16. And red-mouthed shadows racing by, that thrust me from my food.
17. 'Tis an hour yet and an hour yet to the rising of the moon,
18. But I can see the black roof-tree as plain as it were noon.
19. 'Tis a league and a league to the Lena Falls where the trooping blackbuck go;
20. But I can hear the little fawn that bleats behind the doe.


21. 'Tis a league and a league to the Lena Falls where the crop and the upland meet,
22. But I Can smell the wet dawn-wind that wakes the sprouting wheat.
23. Unbar the door. I may not bide, but I must out and see
24. If those are wolves that wait outside or my own kin to me!"
25. . . . . .
26. She loosed the bar, she slid the bolt, she opened the door anon,
27. And a grey bitch-wolf came out of the dark and fawned on the Only Son!
