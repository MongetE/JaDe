2. We were all one heart and one race

4. For a moment's breathing-space
5. We had forgotten you.

7. Panting to shame us anew.

9. With our Past alive and ablaze.

13. Or last week's wreath decays?

14. The light is still in our eyes
15. Of Faith and Gentlehood,
16. Of Service and Sacrifice;
17. And it does not match our mood,
18. To turn so soon to your treacheries
19. That starve our land of her food.

22. Exultant after our King was crowned,
23. Beneath the sun and the breeze.

25. Or sold at your decrees.

26. Wait till the memory goes,
27. Wait till the visions fade,
28. We may betray in time, God knows,
29. But we would not have it said,
30. When you make report to our scornful foes,
31. That we kissed as we betrayed!
