1. For a season there must be pain--
2. For a little, little space
3. I shall lose the sight of her face,
4. Take back the old life again
5. While She is at rest in her place.

6. For a season this pain must endure,
7. For a little, little while
8. I shall sigh more often than smile
9. Till time shall work me a cure,
10. And the pitiful days beguile.

11. For that season we must be apart,
12. For a little length of years,
13. Till my life's last hour nears,
14. And, above the beat of my heart,
15. I hear Her voice in my ears.

16. But I shall not understand--
17. Being set on some later love,
18. Shall not know her for whom I strove,
19. Till she reach me forth her hand,
20. Saying, "Who but I have the right?"
21. And out of a troubled night
22. Shall draw me safe to the land.
