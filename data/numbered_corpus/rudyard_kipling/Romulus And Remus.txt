2. Oh, little did the Wolf-Child care--
3. When first he planned his home,
4. What City should arise and bear
5. The weight and state of Rome.

6. A shiftless, westward-wandering tramp,
7. Checked by the Tiber flood,
8. He reared a wall around his camp
9. Of uninspired mud.

10. But when his brother leaped the Wall
11. And mocked its height and make,
12. He guessed the future of it all
13. And slew him for its sake.

14. Swift was the blow--swift as the thought
15. Which showed him in that hour
16. How unbelief may bring to naught
17. The early steps of Power.

18. Foreseeing Time's imperilled hopes
19. Of Glory, Grace, and Love--
20. All singers, Caesars, artists, Popes--
21. Would fail if Remus throve,

22. He sent his brother to the Gods,
23. And, when the fit was o'er,
24. Went on collecting turves and clods
25. To build the Wall once more!
