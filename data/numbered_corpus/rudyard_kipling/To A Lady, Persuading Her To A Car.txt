1. Love's fiery chariot, Delia, take
2. Which Vulcan wrought for Venus' sake.
3. Wings shall not waft thee, but a flame
4. Hot as my heart--as nobly tame:
5. Lit by a spark, less bright, more wise
6. Than linked lightnings of thine eyes!
7. Seated and ready to be drawn
8. Come not in muslins, lace or lawn,
9. But, for thy thrice imperial worth,
10. Take all the sables of the North,
11. With frozen diamonds belted on,
12. To face extreme Euroclydon!
13. Thus in our thund'ring toy we'll prove
14. Which is more blind, the Law or Love;
15. And may the jealous Gods prevent
16. Our fierce and uncontrouled descent!
