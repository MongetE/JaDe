1. The toad beneath the harrow knows
2. Exactly where eath tooth-point goes.
3. The butterfly upon the road
4. Preaches contentment to that toad.


5. Pagett, M.P., was a liar, and a fluent liar therewith --
6. He spoke of the heat of India as the "Asian Solar Myth";
7. Came on a four months' visit, to "study the East," in November,
8. And I got him to sign an agreement vowing to stay till September.

9. March came in with the koil. Pagett was cool and gay,
10. Called me a "bloated Brahmin," talked of my "princely pay."
11. March went out with the roses. "Where is your heat?" said he.
12. "Coming," said I to Pagett, "Skittles!" said Pagett, M.P.

13. April began with the punkah, coolies, and prickly-heat, --
14. Pagett was dear to mosquitoes, sandflies found him a treat.
15. He grew speckled and mumpy-hammered, I grieve to say,
16. Aryan brothers who fanned him, in an illiberal way.

17. May set in with a dust-storm, -- Pagett went down with the sun.
18. All the delights of the season tickled him one by one.
19. Imprimis -- ten day's "liver" -- due to his drinking beer;
20. Later, a dose of fever --slight, but he called it severe.

21. Dysent'ry touched him in June, after the Chota Bursat --
22. Lowered his portly person -- made him yearn to depart.
23. He didn't call me a "Brahmin," or "bloated," or "overpaid,"
24. But seemed to think it a wonder that any one stayed.

25. July was a trifle unhealthy, -- Pagett was ill with fear.
26. 'Called it the "Cholera Morbus," hinted that life was dear.
27. He babbled of "Eastern Exile," and mentioned his home with tears;
28. But I haven't seen my children for close upon seven years.

29. We reached a hundred and twenty once in the Court at noon,
30. (I've mentioned Pagett was portly) Pagett, went off in a swoon.
31. That was an end to the business; Pagett, the perjured, fled
32. With a practical, working knowledge of "Solar Myths" in his head.

33. And I laughed as I drove from the station, but the mirth died out on my lips
34. As I thought of the fools like Pagett who write of their "Eastern trips,"
35. And the sneers of the traveled idiots who duly misgovern the land,
36. And I prayed to the Lord to deliver another one into my hand.
