1. PRELUDE TO "BARRACK-ROOM BALLADS"

2. I have made for you a song
3. And it may be right or wrong,
4. But only you can tell me if it's true.
5. I have tried for to explain
6. Both your pleasure and your pain,
7. And, Thomas, here's my best respects to you!
8. O there'll surely come a day
9. When they'll give you all your pay,
10. And treat you as a Christian ought to do;
11. So, until that day comes round,
12. Heaven keep you safe and sound,
13. And, Thomas, here's my best respects to you!
