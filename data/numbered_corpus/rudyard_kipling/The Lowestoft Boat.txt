2. In Lowestoft a boat was laid,
3. Mark well what I do say!
4. And she was built for the herring-trade,
5. But she has gone a-rovin', a-rovin', a-rovin',
6. The Lord knows where!
7. They gave her Government coal to burn,
8. And a Q.F. gun at bow and stern,
9. And sent her out a-rovin', etc.

10. Her skipper was mate of a bucko ship
11. Which always killed one man per trip,
12. So he is used to rovin', etc.

13. Her mate was skipper of a chapel in Wales,
14. And so he fights in topper and tails--
15. Religi-ous tho' rovin', etc.

16. Her engineer is fifty-eight,'
17. So he's prepared to meet his fate,
18. Which ain't unlikely rovin', etc.

19. Her leading-stoker's seventeen,
20. So he don't know what the Judgments mean,
21. Unless he cops 'em rovin', etc.

23. Mark well what I do say!
24. And I'm sorry for Fritz when they all come
25. A-rovin', a-rovin', a-roarin' and a-rovin',
26. Round the North Sea rovin',
27. The Lord knows where!
