13. Jack Barrett went to Quetta
14. And there gave up the ghost,

18. Five lively months at most.

19. Jack Barrett's bones at Quetta
20. Enjoy profound repose;

24. From the Himalayan snows.

25. And, when the Last Great Bugle Call
26. Adown the Hurnai throbs,
27. And the last grim joke is entered
28. In the big black Book of Jobs.

30. Their victims to the air,
31. I shouldn't like to be the man
32. Who sent Jack Barrett there.
