2. Blessed was our first age and morning-time. Then were no
3. waies tarren, ne no cars numberen, but each followed his owne
4. playing-busyness to go about singly or by large interspaces,
5. for to leden his viage after his luste and layen under clene hedge.
6. Jungling there was not, nor the overtaking wheele, and all those
7. now cruel clarions were full-hushed and full-still. Then nobile
8. horses, lest they should make the chariots moveable to run by
9. cause of this new feare, we did not press, and were apayed by
10. sweete thankes of him that drave. There was not cursings ne
11. adventure of death blinded bankes betweene, but good-fellowship
12. of yoke-mates at ignorance equal, and a one pillar of dust cov-
13. ered all exodus.... But, see now how the blacke road hath
14. strippen herself of hearte and beauty where the dumbe lampe of
15. Tartarus winketh red, etc.
