1. WHEN you come to London Town,
2. (Grieving-grieving!)
3. Bring your flowers and lay them down
4. At the place of grieving.

5. When you come to London Town,
6. (Grieving-grieving!)
7. Bow your head and mourn your own,
8. With the others grieving.

9. For those minutes, let it wake
10. (Grieving-grieving!)
11. All the empty-heart and ache
12. That is not cured by grieving.

13. For those minutes, tell no lie:
14. (Grieving-grieving!)
15. 'Grave, this is thy victory;
16. And the sting of death is grieving.'

17. Where's our help, from earth or heaven,
18. (Grieving-grieving!)
19. To comfort us for what we've given,
20. And only gained the grieving.

21. Heaven's too far and earth too near,
22. (Grieving-grieving!)
23. But our neighbour's standing here,
24. Grieving as we're grieving.

25. What's his burden every day?
26. (Grieving-grieving!)
27. Nothing man can count or weigh,
28. But loss and love's own grieving.

29. What is the tie betwixt us two
30. (Grieving-grieving!)
31. That must last our whole lives through?
32. 'As I suffer, so do you.'
33. That may ease the grieving.
