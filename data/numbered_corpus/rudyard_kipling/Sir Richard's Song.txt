1. (A. D. 1066)


2. I followed my Duke ere I was a lover,
3. To take from England fief and fee;
4. But now this game is the other way over--
5. But now England hath taken me!

6. I had my horse, my shield and banner,
7. And a boy's heart, so whole and free;
8. But now I sing in another manner--
9. But now England hath taken me!

10. As for my Father in his tower,
11. Asking news of my ship at sea,
12. He will remember his own hour--
13. Tell him England hath taken me!

14. As for my Mother in her bower,
15. That rules my Father so cunningly,
16. She will remember a maiden's power--
17. Tell her England hath taken me!

18. As for my Brother in Rouen City,
19. A nimble and naughty' page is he,
20. But he will come to suffer and pity--
21. Tell him England hath taken me!

22. As for my little Sister waiting
23. In the pleasant orchards of Normandie,
24. Tell her youth is the time for mating--
25. Tell her England hath taken me!

26. As for my comrades in camp and highway
27. That lift their eyebrows scornfully,
28. Tell them their way is not my way--
29. Tell them England hath taken me!

30. Kings and Princes and Barons famed,
31. Knights and Captains in your degree;
32. Hear me a little before I am blamed--
33. Seeing England hath taken me!

34. Howso great man's strength be reckoned,
35. There are two things he cannot flee.
36. Love is the first, and Death is the second-
37. And Love in England hath taken me!
