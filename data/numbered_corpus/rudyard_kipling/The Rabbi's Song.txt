1. 2 Samuel XIV. 14.


2. If Thought can reach to Heaven,
3. On Heaven let it dwell,
4. For fear the Thought be given
5. Like power to reach to Hell.
6. For fear the desolation
7. And darkness of thy mind
8. Perplex an habitation
9. Which thou hast left behind.

10. Let nothing linger after--
11. No whimpering gost remain,
12. In wall, or beam, or rafter,
13. Of any hate or pain.
14. Cleans and call home thy spirit,
15. Deny her leave to cast,
16. On aught thy heirs inherit,
17. The shadow of her past.

18. For think, in all thy sadness,
19. What road our griefs may take;
20. Whose brain reflect our madness,
21. Or whom our terrors shake:
22. For think, lest any languish
23. By cause of thy distress--
24. The arrows of our anguish
25. Fly farther than we guess.

26. Our lives, our tears, as water,
27. Are spilled upon the ground;
28. God giveth no man quarter,
29. Yet God a means hath found,
30. Though Faith and Hope have vanished,
31. And even Love grows dim--
32. A means whereby His banished
33. Be not expelled from Him!
