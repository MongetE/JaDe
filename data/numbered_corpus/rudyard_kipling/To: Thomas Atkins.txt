1. I have made for you a song,
2. And it may be right or wrong,
3. But only you can tell me if it’s true;
4. I have tried for to explain
5. Both your pleasure and your pain,
6. And, Thomas, here’s my best respects to you!O there’ll surely come a day
7. When they’ll give you all your pay,
8. And treat you as a Christian ought to do;
9. So, until that day comes round,
10. Heaven keep you safe and sound,
11. And, Thomas, here’s my best respects to you!
