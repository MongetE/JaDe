1. 1


2. Brethren, how shall it fare with me
3. When the war is laid aside,
4. If it be proven that I am he
5. For whom a world has died?

6. If it be proven that all my good,
7. And the greater good I will make,
8. Were purchased me by a multitude
9. Who suffered for my sake?

10. That I was delivered by mere mankind
11. Vowed to one sacrifice,
12. And not, as I hold them, battle-blind,
13. But dying with open eyes?

14. That they did not ask me to draw the sword
15. When they stood to endure their lot --
16. That they only looked to me for a word,
17. And I answered I knew them not?

18. If it be found, when the battle clears,
19. Their death has set me free,
20. Then how shall I live with myself through the years
21. Which they have bought for me?

22. Brethren, how must it fare with me,
23. Or how am I justified,
24. If it be proven that I am he
25. For whom mankind has died --
26. If it be proven that I am he
27. Who, being questioned, denied?
