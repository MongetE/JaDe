1. About the time that taverns shut
2. And men can buy no beer,
3. Two lads went up to the keepers' hut
4. To steal Lord Pelham's deer.

5. Night and the liquor was in their heads--
6. They laughed and talked no bounds,
7. Till they waked the keepers on their beds
8. And the keepers loosed the hounds.

9. They had killed a hart, they had killed a hind,
10. Ready to carry away,
11. When they heard a whimper down the wind
12. And they heard a bloodhound bay.

13. They took and ran across the fern,
14. Their crossbows in their hand,
15. Till they met a man with a green lantern
16. That called and bade 'em stand.

17. "What are ye doing, O Flesh and Blood,
18. And what's your foolish will,
19. That you must break into Minepit Wood
20. And wake the Folk of the Hill?"

21. "Oh, we've broke into Lord Pelham's park,
22. And killed Lord Pelham's deer,
23. And if ever you heard a little dog bark
24. You'll know why we come here.

25. "We ask you let us go our way,
26. As fast as we can flee,
27. For if ever you heard a bloodhound bay
28. You'll know how pressed we be."

29. "Oh, lay your crossbows on the bank
30. And drop the knives from your hand,
31. And though the hounds be at your flank
32. I'll save you where you stand!"

33. They laid their crossbows on the bank,
34. They threw their knives in the wood,
35. And the ground before them opened and sank
36. And saved 'em where they stood.

37. "Oh, what's the roaring in our ears
38. That strikes us well-nigh dumb?"
39. "Oh, that is just how things appears
40. According as they come."

41. "What are the stars before our eyes
42. That strike us well-nigh blind?"
43. "Oh, that is just how things arise
44. According as you find."

45. "And why's our bed so hard to the bones
46. Excepting where it's cold?"
47. "Oh, that's because it is precious stones
48. Excepting where 'tis gold.

49. "Think it over as you stand,
50. For I tell you without fail,
51. If you haven't got into Fairyland
52. You're not in Lewes Gaol."

53. All night long they thought of it,
54. And, come the dawn, they saw
55. They'd tumbled into a great old pit,
56. At the bottom of Minepit Shaw.

57. And the keeper's hound had followed 'em close,
58. And broke her neck in the fall;
59. So they picked up their knives and their crossbows
60. And buried the dog. That's all.

61. But whether the man was a poacher too
62. Or a Pharisee' so bold--
63. I reckon there's more things told than are true.
64. And more things true than are told!
