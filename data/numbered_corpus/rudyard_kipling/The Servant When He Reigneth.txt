1. For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear. For a servant when he reigneth, and a fool when he is filled with meat; for an odious woman when she is married, and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. -- Prov. XXX. 21-22-23.


2. Three things make earth unquiet
3. And four she cannot brook
4. The godly Agur counted them
5. And put them in a book --
6. Those Four Tremendous Curses
7. With which mankind is cursed;
8. But a Servant when He Reigneth
9. Old Agur entered first.
10. An Handmaid that is Mistress
11. We need not call upon.
12. A Fool when he is full of Meat
13. Will fall asleep anon.
14. An Odious Woman Married
15. May bear a babe and mend;
16. But a Servant when He Reigneth
17. Is Confusion to the end.

18. His feet are swift to tumult,
19. His hands are slow to toil,
20. His ears are deaf to reason,
21. His lips are loud in broil.
22. He knows no use for power
23. Except to show his might.
24. He gives no heed to judgment
25. Unless it prove him right.

26. Because he served a master
27. Before his Kingship came,
28. And hid in all disaster
29. Behind his master's name,
30. So, when his Folly opens
31. The unnecessary hells,
32. A Servant when He Reigneth
33. Throws the blame on some one else.

34. His vows are lightly spoken,
35. His faith is hard to bind,
36. His trust is easy boken,
37. He fears his fellow-kind.
38. The nearest mob will move him
39. To break the pledge he gave --
40. Oh, a Servant when he Reigneth
41. Is more than ever slave!
