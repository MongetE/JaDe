1. Securely, after days
2. Unnumbered, I behold
3. Kings mourn that promised praise
4. Their cheating bars foretold.

5. Of earth-constructing Wars,
6. Of Princes passed in chains,
7. Of deeds out-shining stars,
8. No word or voice remains.

9. Yet furthest times receive,
10. And to fresh praise restore,
11. Mere breath of flutes at eve,
12. Mere seaweed on the shore.

13. A smoke of sacrifice;
14. A chosen myrtle-wreath;
15. An harlot's altered eyes;
16. A rage 'gainst love or death;

17. Glazed snow beneath the moon --
18. The surge of storm-bowed trees--
19. The Caesars perished soon,
20. And Rome Herself: But these

21. Endure while Empires fall
22. And Gods for Gods make room....
23. Which greater God than all
24. Imposed the amazing doom?
