1. That night, when through the mooring-chains
2. The wide-eyed corpse rolled free,
3. To blunder down by Garden Reach
4. And rot at Kedgeree,
5. The tale the Hughli told the shoal
6. The lean shoal told to me.

7. 'T was Fultah Fisher's boarding-house,
8. Where sailor-men reside,
9. And there were men of all the ports
10. From Mississip to Clyde,
11. And regally they spat and smoked,
12. And fearsomely they lied.

13. They lied about the purple Sea
14. That gave them scanty bread,
15. They lied about the Earth beneath,
16. The Heavens overhead,
17. For they had looked too often on
18. Black rum when that was red.

19. They told their tales of wreck and wrong,
20. Of shame and lust and fraud,
21. They backed their toughest statements with
22. The Brimstone of the Lord,
23. And crackling oaths went to and fro
24. Across the fist-banged board.

25. And there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
26. Bull-throated, bare of arm,
27. Who carried on his hairy chest
28. The maid Ultruda's charm --
29. The little silver crucifix
30. That keeps a man from harm.
31. And there was Jake Withouth-the-Ears,
32. And Pamba the Malay,
33. And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,
34. And Luz from Vigo Bay,
35. And Honest Jack who sold them slops
36. And harvested their pay.

37. And there was Salem Hardieker,
38. A lean Bostonian he --
39. Russ, German, English, Halfbreed, Finn,
40. Yank, Dane, and Portuguee,
41. At Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
42. The rested from the sea.

43. Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks,
44. Collinga knew her fame,
45. From Tarnau in Galicia
46. To Juan Bazaar she came,
47. To eat the bread of infamy
48. And take the wage of shame.

49. She held a dozen men to heel --
50. Rich spoil of war was hers,
51. In hose and gown and ring and chain,
52. From twenty mariners,
53. And, by Port Law, that week, men called
54. her Salem Hardieker's.

55. But seamen learnt -- what landsmen know --
56. That neither gifts nor gain
57. Can hold a winking Light o' Love
58. Or Fancy's flight restrain,
59. When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes
60. On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.

61. Since Life is strife, and strife means knife,
62. From Howrah to the Bay,
63. And he may die before the dawn
64. Who liquored out the day,
65. In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
66. We woo while yet we may.

67. But cold was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
68. Bull-throated, bare of arm,
69. And laughter shook the chest beneath
70. The maid Ultruda's charm --
71. The little silver crucifix
72. That keeps a man from harm.
73. "You speak to Salem Hardieker;
74. "You was his girl, I know.
75. "I ship mineselfs to-morrow, see,
76. "Und round the Skaw we go,
77. "South, down the Cattegat, by Hjelm,
78. "To Besser in Saro."

79. When love rejected turns to hate,
80. All ill betide the man.
81. "You speak to Salem Hardieker" --
82. She spoke as woman can.
83. A scream -- a sob -- "He called me -- names!"
84. And then the fray began.

85. An oath from Salem Hardieker,
86. A shriek upon the stairs,
87. A dance of shadows on the wall,
88. A knife-thrust unawares --
89. And Hans came down, as cattle drop,
90. Across the broken chairs.

91. .       .       .       .       .       .

92. In Anne of Austria's trembling hands
93. The weary head fell low: --
94. "I ship mineselfs to-morrow, straight
95. "For Besser in Saro;
96. "Und there Ultruda comes to me
97. "At Easter, und I go

98. "South, down the Cattegat -- What's here?
99. "There -- are -- no -- lights -- to guide!"
100. The mutter ceased, the spirit passed,
101. And Anne of Austria cried
102. In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
103. When Hans the mighty died.

104. Thus slew they Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
105. Bull-throated, bare of arm,
106. But Anne of Austria looted first
107. The maid Ultruda's charm --
108. The little silver crucifix
109. That keeps a man from harm.
