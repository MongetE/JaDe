1. Dread Mother of Forgetfulness
2. Who, when Thy reign begins,
3. Wipest away the Soul's distress,
4. And memory of her sins.

5. The trusty Worm that dieth not--
6. The steadfast Fire also,
7. By Thy contrivance are forgot
8. In a completer woe.

9. Thine are the lidless eyes of night
10. That stare upon our tears,
11. Through certain hours which in our sight
12. Exceed a thousand years:

13. Thine is the thickness of the Dark
14. That presses in our pain,
15. As Thine the Dawn that bids us mark
16. Life's grinning face again.

17. Thine is the weariness outworn
18. No promise shall relieve,
19. That says at eve, "Would God 'twere morn"
20. At morn, "Would God 'twere eve!"

21. And when Thy tender mercies cease
22. And life unvexed is due,
23. Instant upon the false release
24. The Worm and Fire renew.

25. Wherefore we praise Thee in the deep,
26. And on our beds we pray
27. For Thy return that Thou may'st keep
28. The Pains of Hell at bay!
