1. Ere Mor the Peacock flutters, ere the Monkey People cry,
2. Ere Chil the Kite swoops down a furlong sheer,
3. Through the Jungle very softly flits a shadow and a sigh--
4. He is Fear, O Little Hunter, he is Fear!
5. Very softly down the glade runs a waiting, watching shade,
6. And the whisper spreads and widens far and near.
7. And the sweat is on thy brow, for he passes even now--
8. He is Fear, O Little Hunter, he is Fear!

9. Ere the moon has climbed the mountain, ere the rocks are ribbed with light,
10. When the downward-dipping trails are dank and drear,
11. Comes a breathing hard behind thee--snuffle-snuffle through the night--
12. It is Fear, O Little Hunter  it is Fear,
13. On thy knees and draw the bow; bid the shrilling arrow go;
14. In the empty, mocking thicket plunge the spear!
15. But thy hands are loosed and weak, and the blood has left thy cheek--
16. It is Fear, O Little Hunter, it is Fear!

17. When the heat-cloud sucks the tempest, when the slivered pine-trees fall,
18. When the blinding, blaring rain-squalls lash and veer,
19. Through the war-gongs of the thunder rings a voice more loud than all--
20. It is Fear, O Little Hunter, it is Fear!
21. Now the spates are banked and deep; now the footless boulders leap--
22. Now the lightning shows each littlest leaf--rib clear--
23. But thy throat is shut and dried, and thy heart against thy side
24. Hammers: Fear, O Little Hunter--this is Fear!
