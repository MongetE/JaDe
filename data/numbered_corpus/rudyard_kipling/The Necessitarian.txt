1. I know not in Whose hands are laid
2. To empty upon earth
3. From unsuspected ambuscade
4. The very Urns of Mirth;

5. Who bids the Heavenly Lark arise
6. And cheer our solemn round--
7. The Jest beheld with streaming eyes
8. And grovellings on the ground;

9. Who joins the flats of Time and Chance
10. Behind the prey preferred,
11. And thrones on Shrieking Circumstance
12. The Sacredly Absurd,

13. Till Laughter, voiceless through excess,
14. Waves mute appeal and sore,
15. Above the midriff's deep distress,
16. For breath to laugh once more.

17. No creed hath dared to hail Him Lord,
18. No raptured choirs proclaim,
19. And Nature's strenuous Overword
20. Hath nowhere breathed His Name.

21. Yet, it must be, on wayside jape,
22. The selfsame Power bestows
23. The selfsame power as went to shape
24. His Planet or His Rose.
