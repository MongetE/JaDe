1. Horace, BK. V. Ode 20.


2. Oh, late withdrawn from human-kind
3. And following dreams we never knew!
4. Varus, what dream has Fate assigned
5. To trouble you?

6. Such virtue as commends of law
7. Of Virtue to the vulgar horde
8. Suffices not. You needs must draw
9. A righteous sword;

10. And, flagrant in well-doing, smite
11. The priests of Bacchus at their fane,
12. Lest any worshipper invite
13. The God again.

14. Whence public strife and naked crime
15. And-deadlier than the cup you shun--
16. A people schooled to mock, in time,
17. All law--not one.

18. Cease, then, to fashion State-made sin,
19. Nor give thy children cause to doubt
20. That Virtue springs from Iron within--
21. Not lead without.
