1. Canadian


2. Jubal sang of the Wrath of God
3. And the curse of thistle and thorn--
4. But Tubal got him a pointed rod,
5. And scrabbled the earth for corn.
6. Old--old as that early mould,
7. Young as the sprouting grain--
8. Yearly green is the strife between
9. Jubal and Tubal Cain!
10. Jubal sang of the new-found sea,
11. And the love that its waves divide--
12. But Tubal hollowed a fallen tree
13. And passed to the further side.
14. Black-black as the hurricane-wrack,
15. Salt as the under-main-
16. Bitter and cold is the hate they hold--
17. Jubal and Tubal Cain!
18. Jubal sang of the golden years
19. Uhen wars and wounds shall cease--
20. But Tubal fashioned the hand-flung spears
21. And showed his neighbours peace
22. New--new as Nine-point-Two
23. Older than Lamech's slain--
24. Roaring and loud is the feud avowed
25. Twix'' Jubal and Tubal Cain!

26. Jubal sang of the cliffs that bar
27. And the peaks that none may crown--
28. But Tubal clambered by jut and scar
29. And there he builded a town.
30. High-high as the snowsheds lie,
31. Low as the culverts drain--
32. Wherever they be they can never agree--
33. Jubal and Tubal Cain!
