1. Marching Song of a Roman Legion of the Later Empire


2. When I left Rome for Lalage's sake,
3. By the Legions' Road to Rimini,
4. She vowed her heart was mine to take
5. With me and my shield to Rimini--
6. (Till the Eagles flew from Rimini--)
7. And I've tramped Britain, and I've tramped Gaul
8. And the Pontic shore where the snow-flakes fall
9. As white as the neck of Lalage--
10. (As cold as the heart of Lalage!)
11. And I've lost Britain, and I've lost Gaul,
12. And I've lost Rome and, worst of all,
13. I've lost Lalage!

14. When you go by the Via Aurelia
15. As thousands have traveled before
16. Remember the Luck of the Soldier
17. Who never saw Rome any more!
18. Oh, dear was the sweetheart that kissed him,
19. And dear was the mother that bore;
20. But his shield was picked up in the heather,
21. And he never saw Rome any more!

22. And he left Rome, etc.

23. When you go by the Via Aurelia
24. That runs from the City to Gaul,
25. Remember the Luck of the Soldier
26. Who rose to be master of all!
27. He carried the sword and the buckler,
28. He mounted his guard on the Wall,
29. Till the Legions elected him Caesar,
30. And he rose to be master of all!

31. And he left Rome, etc.

32. It's twenty-five marches to Narbo,
33. It's forty-five more up the Rhone,
34. And the end may be death in the heather
35. Or life on an Emperor's throne.
36. But whether the Eagles obey us,
37. Or we go to the Ravens--alone,
38. I'd sooner be Lalage's lover
39. Than sit on an Emperor's throne!

40. We've all left Rome for Lalage's sake, etc.
