1. He that hath a Gospel
2. To loose upon Mankind,
3. Though he serve it utterly--
4. Body, soul and mind--
5. Though he go to Calvary
6. Daily for its gain--
7. It is His Disciple
8. Shall make his labour vain.

9. He that hath a Gospel
10. For all earth to own--
11. Though he etch it on the steel,
12. Or carve it on the stone--
13. Not to be misdoubted
14. Through the after-days--
15. It is His Disciple
16. Shall read it many ways.

17. It is His Disciple
18. (Ere Those Bones are dust )
19. Who shall change the Charter,
20. Who shall split the Trust--
21. Amplify distinctions,
22. Rationalize the Claim;
23. Preaching that the Master
24. Would have done the same.

25. It is His Disciple
26. Who shall tell us how
27. Much the Master would have scrapped
28. Had he lived till now--
29. What he would have modified
30. Of what he said before.
31. It is His Disciple
32. Shall do this and more....

33. He that hath a Gospel
34. Whereby Heaven is won
35. ( Carpenter, or cameleer,
36. Or Maya's dreaming son ),
37. Many swords shall pierce Him,
38. Mingling blood with gall;
39. But His Own Disciple
40. Shall wound Him worst of all!
