1. If any God should say,
2. 'I will restore
3. The world her yesterday
4. Whole as before
5. My Judgment blasted it'- who would not lift
6. Heart, eye, and hand in passion o'er the gift?

7. If any God should will
8. To wipe from mind
9. The memory of this ill
10. Which is Mankind
11. In soul and substance now- who would not bless
12. Even to tears His loving-tenderness?

13. If any God should give
14. Us leave to fly
15. These present deaths we live,
16. And safely die
17. In those lost lives we lived ere we were born-
18. What man but would not laugh the excuse to scorn?

19. For we are what we are-
20. So broke to blood
21. And the strict works of war-
22. So long subdued
23. To sacrifice, that threadbare Death commands
24. Hardly observance at our busier hands.

25. Yet we were what we were,
26. And, fashioned so,
27. It pleases us to stare
28. At the far show
29. Of unbelievable years and shapes that flit,
30. In our own likeness, on the edge of it.
