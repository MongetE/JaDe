1. 1


2. When I was a King and a Mason - a Master proven and skilled -
3. I cleared me ground for a Palace such as a King should build.
4. I decreed and dug down to my levels. Presently, under the silt,
5. I came on the wreck of a Palace such as a King had built.

6. There was no worth in the fashion - there was no wit in the plan -
7. Hither and thither, aimless, the ruined footings ran -
8. Masonry, brute, mishandled, but carven on every stone:
9. 'After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known.'

10. Swift to my use in my trenches, where my well-planned ground-works grew,
11. I tumbled his quoins and his ashlars, and cut and reset them anew.
12. Lime I milled of his marbles; burned it, slacked it, and spread;
13. Taking and leaving at pleasure the gifts of the humble dead.

14. Yet I despised not nor gloried; yet, as we wrenched them apart,
15. I read in the razed foundations the heart of that builder's heart.
16. As he had risen and pleaded, so did I understand
17. The form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing he had planned.

19. When I was a King and a Mason - in the open noon of my pride,
20. They sent me a Word from the Darkness. They whispered and called me aside.
21. They said - 'The end is forbidden.' They said - 'Thy use is fulfilled.
22. 'Thy Palace shall stand as that other's - the spoil of a King who shall build.'

23. I called my men from my trenches, my quarries, my wharves, and my sheers.
24. All I had wrought I abandoned to the faith of the faithless years.
25. Only I cut on the timber - only I carved on the stone:
26. 'After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known! '
