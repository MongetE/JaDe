1. The overfaithful sword returns the user
2. His heart's desire at price of his heart's blood.
3. The clamour of the arrogant accuser
4. Wastes that one hour we needed to make good.
5. This was foretold of old at our outgoing;
6. This we accepted who have squandered, knowing,
7. The strength and glory of our reputations,
8. At the day's need, as it were dross, to guard
9. The tender and new-dedicate foundations
10. Against the sea we fear -- not man's award.

11. They that dig foundations deep,
12. Fit for realms to rise upon,
13. Little honour do they reap
14. Of their generation,
15. Any more than mountains gain
16. Stature till we reach the plain.

17. With noveil before their face
18. Such as shroud or sceptre lend --
19. Daily in the market-place,
20. Of one height to foe and friend --
21. They must cheapen self to find
22. Ends uncheapened for mankind.

23. Through the night when hirelings rest,
24. Sleepless they arise, alone,
25. The unsleeping arch to test
26. And the o'er-trusted corner-stone,
27. 'Gainst the need, they know, that lies
28. Hid behind the centuries.

29. Not by lust of praise or show
30. Not by Peace herself betrayed --
31. Peace herself must they forego
32. Till that peace be fitly made;
33. And in single strength uphold
34. Wearier hands and hearts acold.

35. On the stage their act hath framed
36. For thy sports, O Liberty!
37. Doubted are they, and defamed
38. By the tongues their act set free,
39. While they quicken, tend and raise
40. Power that must their power displace.

41. Lesser men feign greater goals,
42. Failing whereof they may sit
43. Scholarly to judge the souls
44. That go down into the pit,
45. And, despite its certain clay,
46. Heave a new world towards the day.

47. These at labour make no sign,
48. More than planets, tides or years
49. Which discover God's design,
50. Not our hopes and not our fears;
51. Nor in aught they gain or lose
52. Seek a triumph or excuse.

53. For, so the Ark be borne to Zion, who
54. Heeds how they perished or were paid that bore it?
55. For, so the Shrine abide, what shame -- what pride --
56. If we, the priests, were bound or crowned before it?
