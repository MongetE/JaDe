1. The miracle of our land's speech--so known
2. And long received, none marvel when 'tis shown!

3. We have such wealth as Rome at her most pride
4. Had not or (having) scattered not so wide;
5. Nor with such arrant prodigality,
6. Beneath her any pagan's foot let lie...
7. Lo! Diamond that cost some half their days
8. To find and t'other half to bring to blaze:
9. Rubies of every heat, wherethrough we scan
10. The fiercer and more fiery heart of man:
11. Emerald that with the uplifted billow vies,
12. And Sapphires evening remembered skies:
13. Pearl perfect, as immortal tears must show,
14. Bred, in deep waters, of a piercing woe;
15. And tender Turkis, so with charms y-writ,
16. Of woven gold, Time dares not bite on it.
17. Thereafter, in all manners worked and set,
18. Jade, coral, amber, crystal ivories, jet,--
19. Showing no more than various fancies, yet
20. Each a Life's token or Love's amulet
21. Which things, through timeless arrogance of use,
22. We neither guard nor garner, but abuse;
23. So that our scholars--nay, our children-fling
24. In sport or jest treasure to arm a King;
25. And the gross crowd, at feast or market, hold
26. Traffic perforce with dust of gems and gold!
