1. A Farmer of the Augustan Age
2. Perused in Virgil's golden page
3. The story of the secret won
4. From Proteus by Cyrene's son--
5. How the dank sea-god showed the swain
6. Means to restore his hives again.
7. More briefly, how a slaughtered bull
8. Breeds honey by the bellyful.

9. The egregious rustic put to death
10. A bull by stopping of its breath,
11. Disposed the carcass in a shed
12. With fragrant herbs and branches spread,
13. And, having well performed the charm,
14. Sat down to wait the promised swarm.

15. Nor waited long. The God of Day
16. Impartial, quickening with his ray
17. Evil and good alike, beheld
18. The carcass--and the carcass swelled.
19. Big with new birth the belly heaves
20. Beneath its screen of scented leaves.
21. Past any doubt, the bull conceives!

22. The farmer bids men bring more hives
23. To house the profit that arrives;
24. Prepares on pan and key and kettle,
25. Sweet music that shall make 'em settle;
26. But when to crown the work he goes,
27. Gods! What a stink salutes his nose!

28. Where are the honest toilers? Where
29. The gravid mistress of their care?
30. A busy scene, indeed, he sees,
31. But not a sign or sound of bees.
32. Worms of the riper grave unhid
33. By any kindly coffin-lid,
34. Obscene and shameless to the light,
35. Seethe in insatiate appetite,
36. Through putrid offal, while above
37. The hissing blow-fly seeks his love,
38. Whose offspring, supping where they supt,
39. Consume corruption twice corrupt.
