3. And the balmy night-breezes blow straight from the Pole,
4. I heard a Destroyer sing: "What an enjoya-
5. ble life does one lead on the North Sea Patrol!

6. "To blow things to bits is our business (and Fritz's),
7. Which means there are mine-fields wherever you stroll.

10. "We warn from disaster the mercantile master
11. Who takes in high Dudgeon our life-saving role,

13. The marks and the lights on the North Sea Patrol."

15. So swept but surviving, half drowned but still driving
16. I watched her head out through the swell off the shoal,
17. And I heard her propellers roar- "Write to poor fellers
18. Who run such a Hell as the North Sea Patrol!"
