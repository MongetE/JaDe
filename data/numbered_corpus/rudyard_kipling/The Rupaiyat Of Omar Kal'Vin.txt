6. Imports indeed are gone with all their Dues --
7. Lo! Salt a Lever that I dare not use,
8. Nor may I ask the Tillers in Bengal --
9. Surely my Kith and Kin will not refuse!

11. Retrenchment. If my promises can bring
12. Comfort, Ye have Them now a thousandfold --
13. By Allah! I will promise Anything!

34. "Who hath not Prudence" -- what was it I said,
35. Of Her who paints her Eyes and tires Her Head,
36. And gibes and mocks and People in the Street,
37. And fawns upon them for Her thriftless Bread?

38. Accursed is She of Eve's daughters -- She

41. Some portion of your daily Bread to Me.
