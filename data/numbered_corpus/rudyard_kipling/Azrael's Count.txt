1. Lo! The Wild Cow of the Desert, her yeanling estrayed from her --
2. Lost in the wind-plaited sand-dunes -- athirst in the maze of them.
3. Hot-foot she  follows those  foot-prints -- the  thrice-tangled ways of them.
4. Her soul is shut save to one thing -- the love-quest consuming her
5. Fearless she lows past the camp, our fires affright her not.
6. Ranges she close to the to the tethered  ones -- the  mares by  the lances held.
7. Noses she softly apart the veil in the women's tent.
8. Next -- withdrawn under moonlight, a shadow afar off --
9. Fades. Ere men cry, "Hold her fast! darkness recovers her.
10. She the all-crazed and forlorn, when the dogs threaten her,
11. Only a side-tossed horn, as though a fly troubled her,
12. Shows she hath heard, till a lance in the heart of her quivereth.
13. -- Lo, from that carcass aheap -- where speeds the soul of it?
14. Where is the tryst it must keep? Who is her pandar? Death!

15. Men I dismiss to the Mercy greet me not willingly;
16. Crying, "When seekest Thou me first?  Are not my kin unslain?
17. Shrinking aside from the Sword-edge, blinking the glare of it,
18. Shrinking the chin in the neck-bone. How shall that profit them?
19. Yet, among women a thousand, few meet me otherwise.

20. Yet, among women a thousand, one comes to me mistress-wise.
21. Arms open, breasts open, mouth open -- hot is her need on her.
22. Crying, "Ho, Servant, aquit me, the bound by Love's promises!
23. Haste Thou! He Waits! I would go! Handle me lustily!
24. Lo! her eyes stare past my wings, as things unbeheld by her.
25. Lo! her lips summoning part. I am not whom she calls!

26. Lo! My sword sinks and returns. At no time she heedeth it,
27. More than the dust of a journey, her garments brushed clear of it.
28. Lo! Ere the blood-gush has ceased, forward her soul rushes.
29. She is away to her tryst. Who is her pandar? Death!
