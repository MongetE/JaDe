1. Our Fathers in a wondrous age,
2. Ere yet the Earth was small,
3. Ensured to us a heritage,
4. And doubted not at all
5. That we the children of their heart,
6. Which then did beat so high,
7. In later rime should play like part
8. For our posterity.

9. A thousand years they steadfast built,
10. To 'vantage us and ours,
11. The Walls that were a world's despair,
12. The sea-constraining Towers:
13. Yet in their midmost pride they knew,
14. And unto Kings made known,
15. Not all from these their strength they drew,
16. Their faith from brass or stone.

17. Youth's passion, manhood's fierce intent,
18. With age's judgment wise,
19. They spent, and counted not they spent,
20. At daily sacrifice.
21. Not lambs alone nor purchased doves .
22. Or tithe of trader's gold--
23. Their lives most dear, their dearer loves,
24. They offered up of old.

25. Refraining e'en from lawful things,
26. They bowed the neck to bear
27. The unadorned yoke that brings
28. Stark toil and sternest care.
29. Wherefore through them is Freedom sure;
30. Wherefore through them we stand,
31. From all but sloth and pride secure,
32. In a delightsome land.

33. Then, fretful, murmur not they gave
34. So great a charge to keep,
35. Nor dream that awestruck Time shall save
36. Their labour while we sleep.
37. Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year,
38. Our fathers' title runs.
39. Make we likewise their sacrifice,
40. Defrauding not our sons.
