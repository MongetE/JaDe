1. Naked and grey the Cotswolds stand
2. Beneath the summer sun,
3. And the stubble fields on either hand
4. Where Sour and Avon run.
5. There is no change in the patient land
6. That has bred us every one.

7. She should have passed in cloud and fire
8. And saved us from this sin
9. Of war--red war--'twixt child and sire,
10. Household and kith and kin,
11. In the heart of a sleepy Midland shire,
12. With the harvest scarcely in.

13. But there is no change as we meet at last
14. On the brow-head or the plain,
15. And the raw astonished ranks stand fast
16. To slay or to be slain
17. By the men they knew in the kindly past
18. That shall never come again--

19. By the men they met at dance or chase,
20. In the tavern or the hall,
21. At the justice bench and the market place,
22. At the cudgel play or brawl--
23. Of their own blood and speech and race,
24. Comrades or neighbors all!

25. More bitter than death this day must prove
26. Whichever way it go,
27. For the brothers of the maids we love
28. Make ready to lay low
29. Their sisters' sweethearts, as we move
30. Against our dearest foe.

31. Thank Heaven! At last the trumpets peal
32. Before our strength gives way.
33. For King or for the Commonweal--
34. No matter which they say,
35. The first dry rattle of new-drawn steel
36. Changes the world today!
