1. This is the ballad of Ahmed Shah
2. Dealer in tats in the Sudder Bazar,
3. By the gate that leads to the Gold Minar
4. How he was done by a youth from Morar.

5. Ahmed Shah was a man of peace -
6. His beard and turban were thick with grease:
7. His paunch was huge and his speech was slow
8. And he swindled the subalterns high and low,
9. Scores of subalterns came to try
10. The tats that he sold - and remained to buy,
11. Scores of subalterns later on
12. Found that their flashiest mounts were 'gone' -
13. Some in the front and some behind
14. Some were roarers and some went blind -
15. Scores of subalterns over their 'weeds'
16. Cursed old Ahmed and all his deeds.
17. But Ahmed Shah in his gully sat still -
18. And ever he fashioned a Little Black Pill!

19. Yet a judgement was brewing for Ahmed Shah,
20. Like a witches cauldron, in far Morar
21. And the youth that brewed it has eyes of blue
22. And his cheek was beardless and boundless too.
23. Softly he mused o'er a trichi thick:-
24. 'By the Beard of the Prophet I've got the trick!'
25. Then he rose from his chair with an artless grin
26. And called the Battery Sergeant in:-
27. 'Sergeant' he said 'Hasst aught for me
28. In the way of a 'caster' with lots of gee ?'
29. The sergeant pondered and answered slow
30. 'There's a red-roan gelding that's bound to go
31. At the next Committee. 'E ain't no use
32. Excep' for kickin' recruits to the deuce,
33. 'E's chained in the sick lines.'
34. The subaltern's brow
35. Was puckered with thought for a moment. Then
36. The sergeant was richer by rupees ten.
37. 'When the next Committee sits' quoth he
38. 'O Sergeant buy up that brute for me.'

39. So the plot was laid and the long weeks passed
40. And the red-road gelding was duly cast.
41. They led him in chains to the subaltern's stall
42. And gave him his gram' through a hole in the wall.
43. The subaltern mixed it. When morning came
44. The red-road gelding was strangely tame.
45. He bit not nor kicked nor essayed to slay
46. And he and the sub went north that day
47. Till they came to the gully of Ahmed Shah
48. The man and the horse from far Morar.
49. The subaltern stated his funds were low
50. And he came - mehrbani - to 'sell karo'.
51. Then Ahmed Shah with his eyes agog
52. Broke the Tenth Command in the decalogue,
53. For the roan was a monster in size and thews
54. And stood over sixteen hand in his shoes.
55. 'Sahib kitna mangta?' With brow serene
56. The subaltern softly answered 'Teen'.
57. He haggled an hour, that dealer thrifty
58. Till the price was lowered to do sow fifty
59. And the money was paid in greasy rupees
60. While the red-roan gelding drowsed at his ease.
61. The subaltern left him - and Ahmed smiled -
62. 'By Allah, how mad is this pink-faced child
63. I will stuff that ghorah with attah and goor
64. And sell him again to some English soor
65. For a clear eight-fifty!'… and e'en as he spoke
66. The devil they'd drugged in the red-roan woke !
67. Then the head-ropes snapped and the heel-ropes drew
68. And the stallions squealed as the roan went through
69. And the syces ran as men run for life
70. And the yard was troubled with equine strife
71. Till the berserk-rage of the beat was o'er
72. And he dropped to slumber at Ahmed's door!

73. Then a veil was lifted from Ahmed's eyes
74. And he raised the eyelids and punched the thighs
75. Felt the tense pulse slacken - the muscles still -
76. And fathomed the Trcik of the Opium Pill!
77. His own old dodge that had brought him pelf
78. Had the subaltern turned against himself!

79. Did he swear, though his three best tats were lame
80. And half of the city would hear of his shame ?
81. Did he seek the law courts? With downcast eye
82. He hailed an ekka that jingled by,
83. And drove to the station, where filled with peace
84. The subaltern counted the greasy rupees.

85. What passed between them? I cannot say,
86. The subaltern turns the question away
87. With an innocent laugh: but the men of Morar
88. Say he still gets ponies from Ahmed Shah.
89. Ponies to bet on - but not to buy -
90. Weeds to look at but devils to fly
91. And once in a while comes a tiny pill-box.
92. The Doctor abets him…Whenever I'm able
93. I plunge to my last clean shirt on their stable!
