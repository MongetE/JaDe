1. XVIth Circuit -- Donne


2. This spark now set, retarded, yet forbears
3. To hold her light however so he swears
4. That turns a metalled crank, and leather cloked,
5. With some small hammers tappeth hither an yon;

6. Peering as when she showeth and when is gone;
7. For wait he must till the vext Power's evoked
8. That's one with the lightnings. Wait in the showers soaked;
9. Or by the road-side sunned. She'll not progress.
10. Poor soul, here taught how great things may by less
11. Be stayed, to file contacts doth himself address!
