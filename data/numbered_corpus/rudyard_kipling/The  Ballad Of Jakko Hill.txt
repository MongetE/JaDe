1. One moment bid the horses wait,
2. Since tiffin is not laid till three,
3. Below the upward path and straight
4. You climbed a year ago with me.
5. Love came upon us suddenly
6. And loosed - an idle hour to kill -
7. A headless, armless armory
8. That smote us both on Jakko Hill.

9. Ah Heaven! we would wait and wait
10. Through Time and to Eternity!
11. Ah Heaven! we could conquer Fate
12. With more than Godlike constancy
13. I cut the date upon a tree -
14. Here stand the clumsy figures still:
15. '10-7-85, A.D.'
16. Damp with the mist of Jakko Hill.

17. What came of high resolve and great,
18. And until Death fidelity!
19. Whose horse is waiting at your gate?
20. Whose 'rickshaw-wheels ride over me?
21. No Saint's, I swear; and - let me see
22. To-night what names your programme fill -
23. We drift asunder merrily,
24. As drifts the mist on Jakko Hill.

25. L'ENVOI.
26. Princess, behold our ancient state
27. Has clean departed; and we see
28. 'Twas Idleness we took for Fate
29. That bound light bonds on you and me.
30. Amen! Here ends the comedy
31. Where it began in all good will;
32. Since Love and Leave together flee
33. As driven mist on Jakko Hill!
