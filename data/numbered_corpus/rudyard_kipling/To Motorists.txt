1. Since ye distemper and defile
2. Sweet Here by the measured mile,
3. Nor aught on jocund highways heed
4. Except the evidence of speed;
5. And bear about your dreadful task
6. Faces beshrouded 'neath a mask;
7. Great goblin eyes and glue hands
8. And souls enslaved to gears and bands;
9. Here shall no graver curse be said
10. Than, though y'are quick, that ye are dead!
