1. Shove off from the wharf-edge! Steady!
2. Watch for a smooth! Give way!
3. If she feels the lop already
4. She'll stand on her head in the bay.
5. It's ebb-it's dusk-it's blowing
6. The shoals are a mile of white,
7. But (snatch her along!) we're going
8. To find our master to-night.

9. For we hold that in all disaster
10. Of shipwreck, storm, or sword,
11. A Man must stand by his Master
12. When once he has pledged his word.

13. Raging seas have we rowed in
14. But we seldom saw them thus,
15. Our master is angry with
16. Odin-Odin is angry with us!
17. Heavy odds have we taken,
18. But never before such odds.
19. The Gods know they are forsaken
20. We must risk the wrath of the Gods!

21. Over the crest she flies from,
22. Into its hollow she drops,
23. Cringes and clears her eyes from
24. The wind-torn breaker-tops,
25. Ere out on the shrieking shoulder
26. Of a hill-high surge she drives.
27. Meet her! Meet her and hold her!
28. Pull for your scoundrel lives!

29. The thunders bellow and clamour
30. The harm that they meant to do!
31. There goes Thor's own Hammer
32. Cracking the dark in two!
33. Close! But the blow has missed her,
34. Here comes the wind of the blow!
35. Row or the squall'll twist her
36. Broadside on to it!-Row!

37. Heark'ee, Thor of the Thunder!
38. We are not here for a jest
39. For wager, warfare, or p]under,
40. Or to put your power to test.
41. This work is none of our wishing-
42. We would house at home if we might
43. But our master is wrecked out fishing.
44. We go to find him to-night.

45. For we hold that in all disaster
46. As the Gods Themselves have said
47. A Man must stand by his Master
48. Till one of the two is dead.

49. That is our way of thinking,
50. Now you can do as you will,
51. While we try to save her from sinking
52. And hold her head to it still,
53. Bale her and keep her moving,
54. Or she'll break her back in the trough
55. Who said the weather's improving,
56. Or the swells are taking off ?

57. Sodden, and chafed and aching,
58. Gone in the loins and knees
59. No matter-the day is breaking,
60. And there's far less weight to the seas!
61. Up mast, and finish baling
62. In oars, and out with the mead
63. The rest will he two-reef sailing.
64. That was a night indeed!

65. But we hold that in all disaster
66. (And faith. we have found it true.
67. If only you stand by your Master,
68. The Gods will stand by you!
