1. I've never sailed the Amazon,
2. I've never reached Brazil;
3. But the Don and Magdalena,
4. They can go there when they will!

5. Yes, weekly from Southampton
6. Great steamers, white and gold,
7. Go rolling down to Rio
8. (Roll down--roll down to Rio!).
9. And I'd like to roll to Rio
10. Some day before I'm old!
11. I've never seen a Jaguar,
12. Nor yet an Armadill--
13. He's dilloing in his armour,
14. And I s'pose I never will,

15. Unless I go to Rio
16. These wonders to behold--
17. Roll down--roll down to Rio--
18. Roll really down to Rio!
19. Oh, I'd love to roll to Rio
20. Some day before I'm old!
