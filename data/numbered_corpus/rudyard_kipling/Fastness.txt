1. Tennison


2. This is the end whereto men toiled
3. Before thy coachman guessed his fate,--
4. How thou shouldst leave thy, 'scutcheoned gate
5. On that new wheel which is the oiled--

6. To see the England Shakespeare saw
7. (Oh, Earth, 'tis long since Shallow died!
8. Yet by yon farrowed sow may hide
9. Some blue deep minion of the Law)--

10. To range from Ashby-de-la-Zouch
11. By Lyonnesse to Locksley Hall,
12. Or haply, nearer home, appal
13. Thy father's sister's staid barouche.
