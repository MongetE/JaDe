1. 'The eradication of memories of the Great War. -SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT ORGAN

2. The Socialist Government speaks:

3. THOUGH all the Dead were all forgot
4. And razed were every tomb,
5. The Worm-the Worm that dieth not
6. Compels Us to our doom.
7. Though all which once was England stands
8. Subservient to Our will,
9. The Dead of whom we washed Our hands,
10. They have observance still.

11. We laid no finger to Their load.
12. We multiplied Their woes.
13. We used Their dearly-opened road
14. To traffic with Their foes:
15. And yet to Them men turn their eyes,
16. To Them are vows renewed
17. Of Faith, Obedience, Sacrifice,
18. Honour and Fortitude!

19. Which things must perish. But Our hour
20. Comes not by staves or swords
21. So much as, subtly, through the power
22. Of small corroding words.
23. No need to make the plot more plain
24. By any open thrust;
25. But-see Their memory is slain
26. Long ere Their bones are dust!

27. Wisely, but yearly, filch some wreath-
28. Lay some proud rite aside-
29. And daily tarnish with Our breath
30. The ends for which They died.
31. Distract, deride, decry, confuse-
32. (Or-if it serves Us-pray!)
33. So presently We break the use
34. And meaning of Their day!
