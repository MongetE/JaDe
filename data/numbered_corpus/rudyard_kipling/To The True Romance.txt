1. Thy face is far from this our war,
2. Our call and counter-cry,
3. I shall not find Thee quick and kind,
4. Nor know Thee till I die,
5. Enough for me in dreams to see
6. And touch Thy garments' hem:
7. Thy feet have trod so near to God
8. I may not follow them.

9. Through wantonness if men profess
10. They weary of Thy parts,
11. E'en let them die at blasphemy
12. And perish with their arts;
13. But we that love, but we that prove
14. Thine excellence august,
15. While we adore discover more
16. Thee perfect, wise, and just.

17. Since spoken word Man's Spirit stirred
18. Beyond his belly-need,
19. What is is Thine of fair design
20. In thought and craft and deed;
21. Each stroke aright of toil and fight,
22. That was and that shall be,
23. And hope too high, wherefore we die,
24. Has birth and worth in Thee.

25. Who holds by Thee hath Heaven in fee
26. To gild his dross thereby,
27. And knowledge sure that he endure
28. A child until he die --
29. For to make plain that man's disdain
30. Is but new Beauty's birth --
31. For to possess in loneliness
32. The joy of all the earth.

33. As Thou didst teach all lovers speech
34. And Life all mystery,
35. So shalt Thou rule by every school
36. Till love and longing die,
37. Who wast or yet the Lights were set,
38. A whisper in the Void,
39. Who shalt be sung through planets young
40. When this is clean destroyed.

41. Beyond the bounds our staring rounds,
42. Across the pressing dark,
43. The children wise of outer skies
44. Look hitherward and mark
45. A light that shifts, a glare that drifts,
46. Rekindling thus and thus,
47. Not all forlorn, for Thou hast borne
48. Strange tales to them of us.

49. Time hath no tide but must abide
50. The servant of Thy will;
51. Tide hath no time, for to Thy rhyme
52. The ranging stars stand still --
53. Regent of spheres that lock our fears,
54. Our hopes invisible,
55. Oh 'twas certes at Thy decrees
56. We fashioned Heaven and Hell!

57. Pure Wisdom hath no certain path
58. That lacks thy morning-eyne,
59. And captains bold by Thee controlled
60. Most like to Gods design;
61. Thou art the Voice to kingly boys
62. To lift them through the fight,
63. And Comfortress of Unsuccess,
64. To give the dead good-night --

65. A veil to draw 'twixt God His Law
66. And Man's infirmity,
67. A shadow kind to dumb and blind
68. The shambles where we die;
69. A rule to trick th' arithmetic
70. Too base of leaguing odds --
71. The spur of trust, the curb of lust,
72. Thou handmaid of the Gods!

73. O Charity, all patiently
74. Abiding wrack and scaith!
75. O Faith, that meets ten thousand cheats
76. Yet drops no jot of faith!
77. Devil and brute Thou dost transmute
78. To higher, lordlier show,
79. Who art in sooth that lovely Truth
80. The careless angels know!

81. Thy face is far from this our war,
82. Our call and counter-cry,
83. I may not find Thee quick and kind,
84. Nor know Thee till I die.

85. Yet may I look with heart unshook
86. On blow brought home or missed --
87. Yet may I hear with equal ear
88. The clarions down the List;
89. Yet set my lance above mischance
90. And ride the barriere --
91. Oh, hit or miss, how little 'tis,
92. My Lady is not there!
