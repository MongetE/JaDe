1. The People of the Eastern Ice, they are melting like the snow--
2. They beg for coffee and sugar; they go where the white men go.
3. The People of the Western Ice, they learn to steal and fight;
4. They sell their furs to the trading-post; they sell their souls to
5. the white.
6. The People of the Southern Ice, they trade with the whaler's
7. crew;
8. Their women have many ribbons, but their tents are torn and few.
9. But the People of the Elder Ice, beyond the white man's ken--
10. Their spears are made of the narwhal-horn, and they are the last
11. of the Men!
