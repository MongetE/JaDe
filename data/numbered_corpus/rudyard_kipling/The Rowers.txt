2. The banked oars fell an hundred strong,
3. And backed and threshed and ground,
4. But bitter was the rowers' song

6. They had no heart for the rally and roar
7. That makes the whale-bath smoke --
8. When the great blades cleave and hold and leave
9. As one on the racing stroke.

10. They sang:--What reckoning do you keep,

36. Was there no other fleet to find
37. That you strike bands with these?

38. "Of evil times that men can choose
39. On evil fate to fall,
40. What brooding Judgment let you loose
41. To pick the worst of all?

42. "In sight of peace--from the Narrow Seas
43. O'er half the world to run--
44. With a cheated crew, to league anew
45. With the Goth and the shameless Hun!"
