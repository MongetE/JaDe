1. One grief on me is laid
2. Each day of every year,
3. Wherein no soul can aid,
4. Whereof no soul can hear:
5. Whereto no end is seen
6. Except to grieve again--
7. Ah, Mary Magdalene,
8. Where is there greater pain?

9. To dream on dear disgrace
10. Each hour of every day--
11. To bring no honest face
12. To aught I do or say:
13. To lie from morn till e'en--
14. To know my lies are vain--
15. Ah, Mary Magdalene,
16. Where can be greater pain?

17. To watch my steadfast fear
18. Attend mine every way
19. Each day of every year--
20. Each hour of every day:
21. To burn, and chill between--
22. To quake and rage again--
23. Ah, Mary Magdalene,
24. Where shall be greater pain:

25. One grave to me was given--
26. To guard till Judgment Day--
27. But God looked down from Heaven
28. And rolled the Stone away!One day of all my years--
29. One hour of that one day--
30. His Angel saw my tears
31. And rolled the Stone away!
