1. Ah! What avails the classic bent
2. And what the cultured word,
3. Against the undoctored incident
4. That actually occurred?

5. And what is Art whereto we press
6. Through paint and prose and rhyme—
7. When Nature in her nakedness
8. Defeats us every time?

9. It is not learning, grace nor gear,
10. Nor easy meat and drink,
11. But bitter pinch of pain and fear
12. That makes creation think.

13. When in this world’s unpleasing youth
14. Our godlike race began,
15. The longest arm, the sharpest tooth,
16. Gave man control of man;

17. Till, bruised and bitten to the bone
18. And taught by pain and fear,
19. He learned to deal the far-off stone,
20. And poke the long, safe spear.

21. So tooth and nail were obsolete
22. As means against a foe,
23. Till, bored by uniform defeat,
24. Some genius built the bow.

25. Then stone and javelin proved as vain
26. As old-time tooth and nail;
27. Till, spurred anew by fear and pain,
28. Man fashioned coats of mail.

29. Then was there safety for the rich
30. And danger for the poor,
31. Till someone mixed a powder which
32. Redressed the scale once more.

33. Helmet and armour disappeared
34. With sword and bow and pike,
35. And, when the smoke of battle cleared,
36. All men were armed alike....

37. And when ten million such were slain
38. To please one crazy king,
39. Man, schooled in bulk by fear and pain,
40. Grew weary of the thing;

41. And, at the very hour designed
42. To enslave him past recall,
43. His tooth-stone-arrow-gun-shy mind
44. Turned and abolished all.

45. All Power, each Tyrant, every Mob
46. Whose head has grown too large,
47. Ends by destroying its own job
48. And works its own discharge;

49. And Man, whose mere necessities
50. Move all things from his path,
51. Trembles meanwhile at their decrees,
52. And deprecates their wrath!
