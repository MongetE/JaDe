1. When the waters' countenance
2. Blurs 'twixt glance and second glance;
3. When our tattered smokes forerun
4. Ashen 'neath a silvered sun;
5. When the curtain of the haze
6. Shuts upon our helpless ways--
7. Hear the Channel Fleet at sea:
8. Libera nos Domine!
9. When the engines' bated pulse
10. Scarcely thrills the nosing hulls;
11. When the wash along the side
12. Sounds, a-sudden, magnified;
13. When the intolerable blast
14. Marks each blindfold minute passed;

15. When the fog-buoy's squattering flight
16. Guides us 'through the haggard night;
17. When the warning bugle blows;
18. When the lettered doorway's close;
19. When our brittle townships press,
20. Impotent, on emptiness;

21. When the unseen leadsmen lean
22. Questioning a deep unseen;
23. When their lessened count they tell
24. To a bridge invisible;
25. When the hid and perilous
26. Cliffs return our cry to us;

27. When the treble thickness spread
28. Swallows up our next-ahead;
29. When her sirens frightened whine
30. Shows her sheering out of line;
31. When--her passage undiscerned--
32. We must turn where she has turned,
33. Hear the Channel Fleet at sea:
34. Libera nos Domine!
