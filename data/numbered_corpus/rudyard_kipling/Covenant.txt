1. 1


2. We thought we ranked above the chance of ill.
3. Others might fall, not we, for we were wise--
4. Merchants in freedom. So, of our free-will
5. We let our servants drug our strength with lies.
6. The pleasure and the poison had its way
7. On us as on the meanest, till we learned
8. That he who lies will steal, who steals will slay.
9. Neither God's judgment nor man's heart was turned.

10. Yet there remains His Mercy--to be sought
11. Through wrath and peril till we cleanse the wrong
12. By that last right which our forefathers claimed
13. When their Law failed them and its stewards were bought.
14. This is our cause. God help us, and make strong
15. Our will to meet Him later, unashamed!
