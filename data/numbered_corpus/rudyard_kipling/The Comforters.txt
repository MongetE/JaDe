1. Until thy feet have trod the Road
2. Advise not wayside folk,
3. Nor till thy back has borne the Load
4. Break in upon the broke.

5. Chase not with undesired largesse
6. Of sympathy the heart
7. Which, knowing her own bitterness,
8. Presumes to dwell apart.

9. Employ not that glad hand to raise
10. The God-forgotten head
11. To Heaven and all the neighbours' gaze--
12. Cover thy mouth instead.

13. The quivering chin, the bitten lip,
14. The cold and sweating brow,
15. Later may yearn for fellowship--
16. Not now, you ass, not now!

17. Time, not thy ne'er so timely speech,
18. Life, not thy views thereon,
19. Shall furnish or deny to each
20. His consolation.

21. Or, if impelled to interfere
22. Exhort, uplift, advise,
23. Lend not a base, betraying ear
24. To all the victim's cries.

25. Only the Lord can understand
26. When those first pangs begin,
27. How much is reflex action and
28. How much is really sin.

29. E'en from good words thyself refrain,
30. And tremblingly admit
31. There is no anodyne for pain
32. Except the shock of it.

33. So, when thine own dark hour shall fall,
34. Unchallenged canst thou say:
35. "I never worried you at all,
36. For God's sake go away!"
