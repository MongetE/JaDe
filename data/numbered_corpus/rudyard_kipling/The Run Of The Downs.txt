1. The Weald is good, the Downs are best---
2. I'll give you the run of 'em, East to West.
3. Beachy Head and Winddoor Hill,
4. They were once and they are still.
5. Firle Mount Caburn and Mount Harry
6. Go back as far as sums '1l carry.
7. Ditchling Beacon and Chanctonbury Ring
8. They have looked on many a thing,
9. And what those two have missed between 'em
10. I reckon Truleigh Hill has seen 'em.
11. Highden, Bignor and Duncton Down
12. Knew Old England before the Crown.
13. Linch Down, Treyford and Sunwood
14. Knew Old England before the Flood;
15. And when you end on the Hampshire side--
16. Butser's old as Time and Tide.
17. The Downs are sheep, the Weald is corn,
18. You be glad you are Sussex born!
