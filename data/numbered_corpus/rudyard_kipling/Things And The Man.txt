1. (In Memoriam, Joseph Chamberlain)

2. 1

3. "And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more." -- Genesis xxxvii. 5.

4. Oh ye who hold the written clue
5. To all save all unwritten things,
6. And, half a league behind, pursue
7. The accomplished Fact with flouts and flings,
8. Look! To your knee your baby brings
9. The oldest tale since Earth began --
10. The answer to your worryings:
11. "Once on a time there was a Man."

12. He, single-handed, met and slew
13. Magicians, Armies, Ogres, Kings.
14. He lonely 'mid his doubting crew --
15. "In all the loneliness of wings " --
16. He fed the flame, he filled the springs,
17. He locked the ranks, he launched the van
18. Straight at the grinning Teeth of Things.
19. "Once on a time there was a Man."

20. The peace of shocked Foundations flew
21. Before his ribald questionings.
22. He broke the Oracles in two,
23. And bared the paltry wires and strings.
24. He headed desert wanderings;
25. He led his soul, his cause, his clan
26. A little from the ruck of Things.
27. "Once on a time there was a Man."

28. Thrones, Powers, Dominions block the view
29. With episodes and underlings --
30. The meek historian deems them true
31. Nor heeds the song that Clio sings --
32. The simple central truth that stings
33. The mob to boo, the priest to ban;
34. Things never yet created things --
35. "Once on a time there was a Man."

36. A bolt is fallen from the blue.
37. A wakened realm full circle swings
38. Where Dothan's dreamer dreams anew
39. Of vast and farborne harvestings;
40. And unto him an Empire clings
41. That grips the purpose of his plan.
42. My Lords, how think you of these things?
43. Once -- in our time -- is there a Man?
