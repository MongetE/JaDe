1. One moment past our bodies cast
2. No shadow on the plain;
3. Now clear and black they stride our track,
4. And we run home again.
5. In morning-hush, each rock and bush
6. Stands hard, and high, and raw:
7. Then give the Call:  "Good rest to all
8. That keep the Jungle Law!"
9. Now horn and pelt our peoples melt
10. In covert to abide;
11. Now, crouched and still, to cave and hill
12. Our Jungle Barons glide.
13. Now, stark and plain, Man's oxen strain,
14. That draw the new-yoked plough;
15. Now, stripped and dread, the dawn is red
16. Above the lit talao.

17. Ho! Get to lair! The sun's aflare
18. Behind the breathing grass:
19. And creaking through the young bamboo
20. The warning whispers pass.
21. By day made strange, the woods we range
22. With blinking eyes we scan;
23. While down the skies the wild duck cries:
24. "The Day--the Day to Man!"

25. The dew is dried that drenched our hide,
26. Or washed about our way;
27. And where we drank, the puddled bank
28. Is crisping into clay.
29. The traitor Dark gives up each mark
30. Of stretched or hooded claw:
31. Then hear the Call: "Good rest to all
32. That keep the Jungle Law!"
