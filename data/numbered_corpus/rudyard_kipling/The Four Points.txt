1. Thomas Tusser


2. Ere stopping or turning, to put forth a hande
3. Is a charm that thy daies may be long in the land.

4. Though seventy-times-seven thee Fortune befriend,
5. O'ertaking at corners is Death in the end.

6. Sith main-roads for side-roads care nothing, have care
7. Both to slow and to blow when thou interest there.

8. Drink as thou canst hold it, but after is best;
9. For Drink with men's Driving makes Crowners to Quest.
