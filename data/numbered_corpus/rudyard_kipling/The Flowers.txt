1. To our private taste, there is always something a little exotic,
2. almost artificial, in songs which, under an English aspect and dress,
3. are yet so manifestly the product of other skies.  They affect us
4. like translations; the very fauna and flora are alien, remote;
5. the dog's-tooth violet is but an ill substitute for the rathe primrose,
6. nor can we ever believe that the wood-robin sings as sweetly in April
7. as the English thrush. -- THE ATHEN]AEUM.
