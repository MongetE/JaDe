1. Now we are come to our Kingdom,
2. And the State is thus and thus;
3. Our legions wait at the Palace gate—
4. Little it profits us.
5. Now we are come to our Kingdom!

6. Now we are come to our Kingdom,
7. And the Crown is ours to take—
8. With a naked sword at the Council board,
9. And under the throne the snake.
10. Now we are come to our Kingdom !
11. Now we are come to our Kingdom,
12. And the Realm is ours by right,
13. With shame and fear for our daily cheer,
14. And heaviness at night.
15. Now we are come to our Kingdom !
16. Now we are come to our Kingdom,
17. But my love's eyelids fall.
18. All that I wrought for, all that I fought for,
19. Delight her nothing at all.
20. My crown is of withered leaves,
21. For she sits in the dust and grieves.
22. Now we are come to our Kingdom !
