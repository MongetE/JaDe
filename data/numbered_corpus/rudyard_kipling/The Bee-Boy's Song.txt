2. "Hide from your neigbours as much as you please,
3. But all that has happened, to us you must tell,
4. Or else we will give you no honey to sell!"


5. A maiden in her glory,
6. Upon her wedding - day,

11. But if you don't deceive your Bees,
12. Your Bees will not deceive you.

14. News across the seas,
15. All you're sad or merry in,
16. You must tell the Bees.

18. Where the Fanners fan,
19. 'Cause the Bees are just about
20. As curious as a man!

21. Don't you wait where the trees are,
22. When the lightnings play,
23. Nor don't you hate where Bees are,
24. Or else they'll pine away.
25. Pine away -- dwine away --
26. Anything to leave you!
27. But if you never grieve your Bees,
28. Your Bees'll never grieve you.
