1. England's on the anvil--hear the hammers ring--
2. Clanging from the Severn to the Tyne!
3. Never was a blacksmith like our Norman King--
4. England's being hammered, hammered, hammered into line!

5. England's on the anvil!  Heavy are the blows!
6. (But the work will be a marvel when it's done.)
7. Little bits of Kingdoms cannot stand against their foes.
8. England's being   hammered  hammered, hammered into one!

9. There shall be one people--it shall serve one Lord--
10. (Neither Prist nor Baron shall escape!)
11. It shall have one  speech  and  law,  soul  and  strength  and  sword.
12. England's  being  hammered,  hammered,  hammered  into
13. shape!
