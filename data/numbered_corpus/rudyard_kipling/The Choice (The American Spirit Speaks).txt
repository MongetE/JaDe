1. To the Judge of Right and Wrong
2. With Whom fulfillment lies
3. Our purpose and our power belong,
4. Our faith and sacrifice.

5. Let Freedom's land rejoice!
6. Our ancient bonds are riven;
7. Once more to us the eternal choice
8. Of good or ill is given.

9. Not at a little cost,
10. Hardly by prayer or tears,
11. Shall we recover the road we lost
12. In the drugged and doubting years,

13. But after the fires and the wrath,
14. But after searching and pain,
15. His Mercy opens us a path
16. To live with ourselves again.

17. In the Gates of Death rejoice!
18. We see and hold the good-
19. Bear witness, Earth, we have made our choice
20. For Freedom's brotherhood.

21. Then praise the Lord Most High
22. Whose Strength hath saved us whole,
23. Who bade us choose that the Flesh should die
24. And not the living Soul!
