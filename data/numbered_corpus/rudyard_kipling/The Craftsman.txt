1. Once, after long-drawn revel at The Mermaid,
2. He to the overbearing Boanerges
3. Jonson, uttered (if half of it were liquor,
4. Blessed be the vintage!)

5. Saying how, at an alehouse under Cotswold,
6. He had made sure of his very Cleopatra,
7. Drunk with enormous, salvation-con temning
8. Love for a tinker.

9. How, while he hid from Sir Thomas's keepers,
10. Crouched in a ditch and drenched by the midnight
11. Dews, he had listened to gipsy Juliet
12. Rail at the dawning.

13. How at Bankside, a boy drowning kittens
14. Winced at the business; whereupon his sister--
15. Lady Macbeth aged seven--thrust 'em under,
16. Sombrely scornful.

17. How on a Sabbath, hushed and compassionate--
18. She being known since her birth to the townsfolk--
19. Stratford dredged and delivered from Avon
20. Dripping Ophelia

21. So, with a thin third finger marrying
22. Drop to wine-drop domed on the table,
23. Shakespeare opened his heart till the sunrise--
24. Entered to hear him.

25. London wakened and he, imperturbable,
26. Passed from waking to hurry after shadows . . .
27. Busied upon shows of no earthly importance?
28. Yes, but he knew it!
