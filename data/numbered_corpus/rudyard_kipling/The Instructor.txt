1. (Non-commissioned Officers of the Line)


2. At times when under cover I 'ave said,
3. To keep my spirits up an' raise a laugh,
4. 'Earin 'im pass so busy over-'ead--
5. Old Nickel-Neck, 'oo is n't on the Staff --
6. "There's one above is greater than us all"

7. Before 'im I 'ave seen my Colonel fall,
8. An 'watched 'im write my Captain's epitaph,
9. So that a long way off it could be read--
10. He 'as the knack o' makin' men feel small--
11. Old Whistle Tip, 'oo is n't on the Staff.

12. There is no sense in fleein'' (I 'ave fled),
13. Better go on an' do the belly-crawl,
14. An' 'ope' 'e '1l it some other man instead
15. Of you 'e seems to 'unt so speshual--
16. Fitzy van Spitz, 'oo is n't on the Staff.

17. An' thus in mem'ry's cinematograph,
18. Now that the show is over, I recall
19. The peevish voice an' 'oary mushroom 'ead
20. Of 'im we owned was greater than us all,
21. 'Oo give instruction to the quick an' the dead--
22. The Shudderin'' Beggar--not upon the Staff!
