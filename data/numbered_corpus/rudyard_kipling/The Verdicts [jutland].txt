1. Not in the thick of the fight,
2. Not in the press of the odds,
3. Do the heroes come to their height,
4. Or we know the demi-gods.

5. That stands over till peace.
6. We can only perceive
7. Men returned from the seas,
8. Very grateful for leave.

9. They grant us sudden days
10. Snatched from their business of war;
11. But we are too close to appraise
12. What manner of men they are.

13. And, whether their names go down
14. With age-kept victories,
15. Or whether they battle and drown
16. Unreckoned, is hid from our eyes.

17. They are too near to be great,
18. But our children shall understand
19. When and how our fate
20. Was changed, and by whose hand.

21. Our children shall measure their worth.
22. We are content to be blind . . .
23. But we know that we walk on a new-born earth
24. With the saviours of mankind.
