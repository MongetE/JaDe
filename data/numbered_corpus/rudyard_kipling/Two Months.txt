1. June

2. No hope, no change! The clouds have shut us in,
3. And through the cloud the sullen Sun strikes down
4. Full on the bosom of the tortured Town,
5. Till Night falls heavy as remembered sin
6. That will not suffer sleep or thought of ease,
7. And, hour on hour, the dry-eyed Moon in spite
8. Glares through the haze and mocks with watery light
9. The torment of the uncomplaining trees.
10. Far off, the Thunder bellows her despair
11. To echoing Earth, thrice parched. The lightnings fly
12. In vain. No help the heaped-up clouds afford,
13. But wearier weight of burdened, burning air.
14. What truce with Dawn? Look, from the aching sky,
15. Day stalks, a tyrant with a flaming sword!


16. September

17. At dawn there was a murmur in the trees,
18. A ripple on the tank, and in the air
19. Presage of coming coolness -- everywhere
20. A voice of prophecy upon the breeze.
21. Up leapt the Sun and smote the dust to gold,
22. And strove to parch anew the heedless land,
23. All impotently, as a King grown old
24. Wars for the Empire crumbling 'neath his hand.
25. One after one the lotos-petals fell,
26. Beneath the onslaught of the rebel year,
27. In mutiny against a furious sky;
28. And far-off Winter whispered: -- "It is well!
29. "Hot Summer dies. Behold your help is near,
30. "For when men's need is sorest, then come I."
