1. Before
2. Twas not while England's sword unsheathed
3. Put half a world to flight,
4. Nor while their new-built cities breathed
5. Secure behind her might;
6. Not while she poured from Pole to Line
7. Treasure and ships and men--
8. These worshippers at Freedoms shrine
9. They did not quit her then!

10. Not till their toes were driven forth
11. By England o'er the main--
12. Not till the Frenchman from the North
13. Had gone with shattered Spain;
14. Not till the clean-swept oceans showed
15. No hostile flag unrolled,
16. Did they remember that they owed
17. To Freedom--and were bold!


18. After

19. The  snow lies thick on Valley Forge,
20. The ice on the Delaware,
21. But the poor dead soldiers of King George
22. They neither know nor care.

23. Not though the earliest primrose break
24. On the sunny side of the lane,
25. And scuffling rookeries awake
26. Their England' s spring again.

27. They will not stir when the drifts are gone,
28. Or the ice melts out of the bay:
29. And the men that served with Washington
30. Lie all as still as they.

31. They will  not  stir  though  the mayflower blows
32. In the moist dark woods of pine,
33. And every rock-strewn pasture shows
34. Mullein and columbine.

35. Each for his land, in a fair fight,
36. Encountered strove, and died,
37. And the kindly earth that knows no spite
38. Covers them side by side.

39. She is too busy to think of war;
40. She has all the world to make gay;
41. And,  behold, the yearly flowers are
42. Where they were in our fathers' day!

43. Golden-rod by the pasture-wall
44. When the columbine is dead,
45. And sumach leaves that turn, in fall,
46. Bright as the blood they shed.
