1. A ruddy drop of manly blood
2. The surging sea outweighs,
3. The world uncertain comes and goes;
4. The lover rooted stays.
5. I fancied he was fled,-
6. And, after many a year,
7. Glowed unexhausted kindliness,
8. Like daily sunrise there.
9. My careful heart was free again,
10. O friend, my bosom said,
11. Through thee alone the sky is arched,
12. Through thee the rose is red;
13. All things through thee take nobler form,
14. And look beyond the earth,
15. The mill-round of our fate appears
16. A sun-path in thy worth.
17. Me too thy nobleness had taught
18. To master my despair;
19. The fountains of my hidden life
20. Are through thy friendship fair.
