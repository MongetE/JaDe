1. I am the Muse who sung alway
2. By Jove, at dawn of the first day.
3. Star-crowned, sole-sitting, long I wrought
4. To fire the stagnant earth with thought:
5. On spawning slime my song prevails,
6. Wolves shed their fangs, and dragons scales;
7. Flushed in the sky the sweet May-morn,
8. Earth smiled with flowers, and man was born.
9. Then Asia yeaned her shepherd race,
10. And Nile substructs her granite base,--
11. Tented Tartary, columned Nile,--
12. And, under vines, on rocky isle,
13. Or on wind-blown sea-marge bleak,
14. Forward stepped the perfect Greek:
15. That wit and joy might find a tongue,
16. And earth grow civil, HOMER Sung.

17. Flown to Italy from Greece,
18. I brooded long, and held my peace,
19. For I am wont to sing uncalled,
20. And in days of evil plight
21. Unlock doors of new delight;
22. And sometimes mankind I appalled
23. With a bitter horoscope,
24. With spasms of terror for balm of hope.
25. Then by better thought I lead
26. Bards to speak what nations need;
27. So I folded me in fears,
28. And DANTE searched the triple spheres,
29. Moulding nature at his will,
30. So shaped, so coloured, swift or still,
31. And, sculptor-like, his large design
32. Etched on Alp and Apennine.

33. Seethed in mists of Penmanmaur,
34. Taught by Plinlimmon's Druid power,
35. England's genius filled all measure
36. Of heart and soul, of strength and pleasure,
37. Gave to the mind its emperor,
38. And life was larger than before:
39. Nor sequent centuries could hit
40. Orbit and sum of SHAKSPEARE's wit.
41. The men who lived with him became
42. Poets, for the air was fame.

43. Far in the North, where polar night
44. Holds in check the frolic light,
45. In trance upborne past mortal goal
46. The Swede EMANUEL leads the soul.
47. Through snows above, mines underground,
48. The inks of Erebus he found;
49. Rehearsed to men the damned wails
50. On which the seraph music sails,
51. In spirit-worlds he trod alone,
52. But walked the earth unmarked, unknown.
53. The near by-stander caught no sound,--
54. Yet they who listened far aloof
55. Heard rendings of the skyey roof,
56. And felt, beneath, the quaking ground;
57. And his air-sown, unheeded words,
58. In the next age, are flaming swords.

59. In newer days of war and trade,
60. Romance forgot, and faith decayed,
61. When Science armed and guided war,
62. And clerks the Janus-gates unbar,
63. When France, where poet never grew,
64. Halved and dealt the globe anew,
65. GOETHE, raised o'er joy and strife,
66. Drew the firm lines of Fate and Life,
67. And brought Olympian wisdom down
68. To court and mart, to gown and town,
69. Stooping, his finger wrote in clay
70. The open secret of to-day.

71. So bloom the unfading petals five,
72. And verses that all verse outlive.
