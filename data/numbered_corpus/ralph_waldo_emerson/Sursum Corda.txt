1. Seek not the Spirit, if it hide,
2. Inexorable to thy zeal:
3. Baby, do not whine and chide;
4. Art thou not also real?
5. Why should'st thou stoop to poor excuse?
6. Turn on the Accuser roundly; say,
7. "Here am I, here will I remain
8. Forever to myself soothfast,
9. Go thou, sweet Heaven, or, at thy pleasure stay."â€”
10. Already Heaven with thee its lot has cast,
11. For it only can absolutely deal.
