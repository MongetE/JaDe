1. Can rules or tutors educate
2. The semigod whom we await?
3. He must be musical,
4. Tremulous, impressional,
5. Alive to gentle influence
6. Of landscape and of sky,
7. And tender to the spirit-touch
8. Of man's or maiden's eye:
9. But, to his native centre fast,
10. Shall into Future fuse the Past,
11. And the world's flowing fates in his own mould recast.
