1. Who gave thee, O Beauty!
2. The keys of this breast,
3. Too credulous lover
4. Of blest and unblest?
5. Say when in lapsed ages
6. Thee knew I of old;
7. Or what was the service
8. For which I was sold?
9. When first my eyes saw thee,
10. I found me thy thrall,
11. By magical drawings,
12. Sweet tyrant of all!
13. I drank at thy fountain
14. False waters of thirst;
15. Thou intimate stranger,
16. Thou latest and first!
17. Thy dangerous glances
18. Make women of men;
19. New-born we are melting
20. Into nature again.
21. Lavish, lavish promiser,
22. Nigh persuading gods to err,
23. Guest of million painted forms
24. Which in turn thy glory warms,
25. The frailest leaf, the mossy bark,
26. The acorn's cup, the raindrop's arc,
27. The swinging spider's silver line,
28. The ruby of the drop of wine,
29. The shining pebble of the pond,
30. Thou inscribest with a bond
31. In thy momentary play
32. Would bankrupt Nature to repay.

33. Ah! what avails it
34. To hide or to shun
35. Whom the Infinite One
36. Hath granted his throne?
37. The heaven high over
38. Is the deep's lover,
39. The sun and sea
40. Informed by thee,
41. Before me run,
42. And draw me on,
43. Yet fly me still,
44. As Fate refuses
45. To me the heart Fate for me chooses,
46. Is it that my opulent soul
47. Was mingled from the generous whole,
48. Sea valleys and the deep of skies
49. Furnished several supplies,
50. And the sands whereof I'm made
51. Draw me to them self-betrayed?
52. I turn the proud portfolios
53. Which hold the grand designs
54. Of Salvator, of Guercino,
55. And Piranesi's lines.
56. I hear the lofty PÃ¦ans
57. Of the masters of the shell,
58. Who heard the starry music,
59. And recount the numbers well:
60. Olympian bards who sung
61. Divine Ideas below,
62. Which always find us young,
63. And always keep us so.
64. Oft in streets or humblest places
65. I detect far wandered graces,
66. Which from Eden wide astray
67. In lowly homes have lost their way.

68. Thee gliding through the sea of form,
69. Like the lightning through the storm,
70. Somewhat not to be possessed,
71. Somewhat not to be caressed,
72. No feet so fleet could ever find,
73. No perfect form could ever bind.
74. Thou eternal fugitive
75. Hovering over all that live,
76. Quick and skilful to inspire
77. Sweet extravagant desire,
78. Starry space and lily bell
79. Filling with thy roseate smell,
80. Wilt not give the lips to taste
81. Of the nectar which thou hast.

82. All that's good and great with thee
83. Stands in deep conspiracy.
84. Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely
85. To report thy features only,
86. And the cold and purple morning
87. Itself with thoughts of thee adorning,
88. The leafy dell, the city mart,
89. Equal trophies of thine art,
90. E'en the flowing azure air
91. Thou hast touched for my despair,
92. And if I languish into dreams,
93. Again I meet the ardent beams.
94. Queen of things! I dare not die
95. In Being's deeps past ear and eye,
96. Lest there I find the same deceiver,
97. And be the sport of Fate forever.
98. Dread power, but dear! if God thou be,
99. Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me.
