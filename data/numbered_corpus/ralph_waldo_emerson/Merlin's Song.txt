1. Of Merlin wise I learned a song,--
2. Sing it low or sing it loud,
3. It is mightier than the strong,
4. And punishes the proud.
5. I sing it to the surging crowd,--
6. Good men it will calm and cheer,
7. Bad men it will chain and cage.
8. In the heart of the music peals a strain
9. Which only angels hear;
10. Whether it waken joy or rage,
11. Hushed myriads hark in vain,
12. Yet they who hear it shed their age,
13. And take their youth again.
