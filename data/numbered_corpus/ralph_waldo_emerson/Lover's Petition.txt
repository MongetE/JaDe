1. Good Heart, that ownest all!
2. I ask a modest boon and small:
3. Not of lands and towns the gift,--
4. Too large a load for me to lift,--
5. But for one proper creature,
6. Which geographic eye,
7. Sweeping the map of Western earth,
8. Or the Atlantic coast, from Maine
9. To Powhatan's domain,
10. Could not descry.
11. Is't much to ask in all thy huge creation,
12. So trivial a part,--
13. A solitary heart?

14. Yet count me not of spirit mean,
15. Or mine a mean demand,
16. For 't is the concentration
17. And worth of all the land,
18. The sister of the sea,
19. The daughter of the strand,
20. Composed of air and light,
21. And of the swart earth-might.
22. So little to thy poet's prayer
23. Thy large bounty well can spare.
24. And yet I think, if she were gone,
25. The world were better left alone.
