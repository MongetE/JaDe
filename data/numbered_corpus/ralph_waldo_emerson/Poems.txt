1. AND when I am entomb√®d in my place,
2. Be it remembered of a single man,
3. He never, though he dearly loved his race,
4. For fear of human eyes swerved from his plan.
5. OH what is Heaven but the fellowship
6. Of minds that each can stand against the world
7. By its own meek and incorruptible will?
8. THE days pass over me
9. And I am still the same;
10. The aroma of my life is gone
11. With the flower with which it came.
