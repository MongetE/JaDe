1. Who shall tell what did befall,
2. Far away in time, when once,
3. Over the lifeless ball,
4. Hung idle stars and suns?
5. What god the element obeyed?
6. Wings of what wind the lichen bore,
7. Wafting the puny seeds of power,
8. Which, lodged in rock, the rock abrade?
9. And well the primal pioneer
10. Knew the strong task to it assigned,
11. Patient through Heaven's enormous year
12. To build in matter home for mind.
13. From air the creeping centuries drew
14. The matted thicked low and wide,
15. This must the leaves of ages strew
16. The granite slab to clothe and hide,
17. Ere wheat can wave its golden pride.
18. What smiths, and in what furnace, rolled
19. (In dizzy aeons dim and mute
20. The reeling brain can ill compute)
21. Copper and iron, lead and gold?
22. What oldest star the fame can save
23. Of races perishing to pave
24. The planet with a floor of lime?
25. Dust is their pyramid and mole:
26. Who saw that ferns and palms were pressed
27. Under the trembling mountain's breast,
28. In the safe herbal of the coal?
29. But when the quarried means were piled,
30. All is waste and worthless, till
31. Arrives the wise selecting will,
32. And,out of slime and chaos, Wit
33. Draws the threads of fair and fit.
34. Then temples rose, and towns, and marts,
35. The shop of toil, the hall of arts;
36. Then flew the sail across the seas
37. To feed the North from tropic trees;
38. The storm-wind wove, the torrent span,
39. Where they were bid the rivers ran;
40. New slaves fulfilled the poet's dream,
41. Galvanic wire, strong-shouldered steam.
42. Then docks were built, and crops were stored,
43. And ingots added to the hoard.
44. But, though light-hearted man forget,
45. Remembering Matter pays her debt:
46. Still, though her motes and masses, draw
47. Electric thrills and ties of Law,
48. Which bind the strength of Nature wild
49. To the conscience of a child.
