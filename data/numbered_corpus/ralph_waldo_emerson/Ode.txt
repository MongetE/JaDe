1. Inscribed to W.H. Channing


2. Though loath to grieve
3. The evil time's sole patriot,
4. I cannot leave
5. My honeyed thought
6. For the priest's cant,
7. Or statesman's rant.

8. If I refuse
9. My study for their politic,
10. Which at the best is trick,
11. The angry Muse
12. Puts confusion in my brain.

13. But who is he that prates
14. Of the culture of mankind,
15. Of better arts and life?
16. Go, blindworm, go,
17. Behold the famous States
18. Harrying Mexico
19. With rifle and with knife!

20. Or who, with accent bolder
21. Dare praise the freedom-loving mountaineer?
22. I found by thee, O rushing Contoocook!
23. And in thy valleys, Agiochook!
24. The jackals of the Negro-holder.

25. The God who made New Hampshire
26. Taunted the lofty land
27. With little men;--
28. Small bat and wren
29. House in the oak:--
30. If earth-fire cleave
31. The upheaved land, and bury the folk,
32. The southern crocodile would grieve.
33. Virtue palters; Right is hence;
34. Freedom praised, but hid;
35. Funeral eloquence
36. Rattles the coffin lid.

37. What boots thy zeal,
38. O glowing friend,
39. That would indignant rend
40. The northland from the south?
41. Wherefore? to what good end?
42. Boston Bay and Bunker Hill
43. Would serve things still;--
44. Things are of the snake.

45. The horseman serves the horse
46. The neatherd serves the neat,
47. The merchant serves the purse,
48. The eater serves his meat;
49. 'Tis the day of the chattel,
50. Web to weave, and corn to grind;
51. Things are in the saddle,
52. And ride mankind.

53. There are two laws discrete,
54. Not reconciled,--
55. Law for man, and law for thing;
56. The last builds town and fleet,
57. But it runs wild,
58. And doth the man unking.

59. 'Tis fit the forest fall,
60. The steep be graded,
61. The mountain tunneled,
62. The sand shaded,
63. The orchard planted,
64. The glebe tilled,
65. The prairie granted
66. The steamer built.

67. Let man serve law for man;
68. Live for friendship, live for love,
69. For truth's and harmony's behoof;
70. The state may follow how it can,
71. As Olympus follows Jove.

72. Yet do not I implore
73. The wrinkled shopman to my sounding woods,
74. Nor did the unwilling senator
75. Ask votes of thrushes in the solitudes.
76. Everyone to his chosen work--
77. Foolish hands may mix and mar;
78. Wise and sure the issues are.
79. Round they roll till dark is light,
80. Sex to sex, and even to odd;--
81. The overgod
82. Who marries Right to Might,
83. Who peoples, unpeoples,--
84. He who exterminates
85. Races by stronger races,
86. Black by white faces,--
87. Knows to bring honey
88. Out of the lion;
89. Grafts gentlest scion
90. On pirate and Turk.

91. The Cossack eats Poland,
92. Like stolen fruit;
93. Her last noble is ruined,
94. Her last poet mute;
95. Straight, into double band
96. The victors divide;
97. Half for freedom strike and stand;--
98. The astonished Muse finds thousands at her side.
