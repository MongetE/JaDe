1. I love thy music, mellow bell,
2. I love thine iron chime,
3. To life or death, to heaven or hell,
4. Which calls the sons of Time.

5. Thy voice upon the deep
6. The home-bound sea-boy hails,
7. It charms his cares to sleep,
8. It cheers him as he sails.

9. To house of God and heavenly joys
10. Thy summons called our sires,
11. And good men thought thy sacred voice
12. Disarmed the thunder's fires.

13. And soon thy music, sad death-bell,
14. Shall lift its notes once more,
15. And mix my requiem with the wind
16. That sweeps my native shore.
