1. Ruby wine is drunk by knaves,
2. Sugar spends to fatten slaves,
3. Rose and vine-leaf deck buffoons;
4. Thunder-clouds are Jove's festoons,
5. Drooping oft in wreaths of dread,
6. Lightning-knotted round his head;
7. The hero is not fed on sweets,
8. Daily his own heart he eats;
9. Chambers of the great are jails,
10. And head-winds right for royal sails.
