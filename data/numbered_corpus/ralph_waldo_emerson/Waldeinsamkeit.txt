1. I do not count the hours I spend
2. In wandering by the sea;
3. The forest is my loyal friend,
4. Like God it useth me.

5. In plains that room for shadows make
6. Of skirting hills to lie,
7. Bound in by streams which give and take
8. Their colours from the sky;

9. Or on the mountain-crest sublime,
10. Or down the oaken glade,
11. O what have I to do with time?
12. For this the day was made.

13. Cities of mortals woe begone
14. Fantastic care derides,
15. But in the serious landscape lone
16. Stern benefit abides.

17. Sheen will tarnish, honey cloy,
18. And merry is only a mask of sad,
19. But, sober on a fund of joy,
20. The woods at heart are glad.

21. There the great Planter plants
22. Of fruitful worlds the grain,
23. And with a million spells enchants
24. The souls that walk in pain.

25. Still on the seeds of all he made
26. The rose of beauty burns;
27. Through times that wear, and forms that fade,
28. Immortal youth returns.

29. The black ducks mounting from the lake,
30. The pigeon in the pines,
31. The bittern's boom, a desert make
32. Which no false art refines.

33. Down in yon watery nook,
34. Where bearded mists divide,
35. The gray old gods whom Chaos knew,
36. The sires of Nature, hide.

37. Aloft, in secret veins of air,
38. Blows the sweet breath of song,
39. O, few to scale those uplands dare,
40. Though they to all belong!

41. See thou bring not to field or stone
42. The fancies found in books;
43. Leave authors' eyes, and fetch your own,
44. To brave the landscape's looks.

45. And if, amid this dear delight,
46. My thoughts did home rebound,
47. I well might reckon it a slight
48. To the high cheer I found.

49. Oblivion here thy wisdom is,
50. Thy thrift, the sleep of cares;
51. For a proud idleness like this
52. Crowns all thy mean affairs.
