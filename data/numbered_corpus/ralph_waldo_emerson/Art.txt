1. Give to barrows, trays, and pans
2. Grace and glimmer of romance;
3. Bring the moonlight into noon
4. Hid in gleaming piles of stone;
5. On the city's paved street
6. Plant gardens lined with lilacs sweet;
7. Let spouting fountains cool the air,
8. Singing in the sun-baked square;
9. Let statue, picture, park, and hall,
10. Ballad, flag, and festival,
11. The past restore, the day adorn,
12. And make to-morrow a new morn.
13. So shall the drudge in dusty frock
14. Spy behind the city clock
15. Retinues of airy kings,
16. Skirts of angels, starry wings,
17. His fathers shining in bright fables,
18. His children fed at heavenly tables.
19. 'T is the privilege of Art
20. Thus to play its cheerful part,
21. Man on earth to acclimate,
22. And bend the exile to his fate,
23. And, moulded of one element
24. With the days and firmament,
25. Teach him on these as stairs to climb,
26. And live on even terms with Time;
27. Whilst upper life the slender rill
28. Of human sense doth overfill.
