1. Thy summer voice, Musketaquit,
2. Repeats the music of the rain;
3. But sweeter rivers pulsing flit
4. Through thee, as thou through the Concord Plain.

5. Thou in thy narrow banks art pent:
6. The stream I love unbounded goes
7. Through flood and sea and firmament;
8. Through light, through life, it forward flows.

9. I see the inundation sweet,
10. I hear the spending of the steam
11. Through years, through men, through Nature fleet,
12. Through love and thought, through power and dream.

13. Musketaquit, a goblin strong,
14. Of shard and flint makes jewels gay;
15. They lose their grief who hear his song,
16. And where he winds is the day of day.

17. So forth and brighter fares my stream,â€”
18. Who drink it shall not thirst again;
19. No darkness taints its equal gleam,
20. And ages drop in it like rain.
