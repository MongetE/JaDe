1. Daughter of Heaven and Earth, coy Spring,
2. With sudden passion languishing,
3. Maketh all things softly smile,
4. Painteth pictures mile on mile,
5. Holds a cup with cowslip-wreaths,
6. Whence a smokeless incense breathes.
7. Girls are peeling the sweet willow,
8. Poplar white, and Gilead-tree,
9. And troops of boys
10. Shouting with whoop and hilloa,
11. And hip, hip three times three.
12. The air is full of whistlings bland;
13. What was that I heard
14. Out of the hazy land?
15. Harp of the wind, or song of bird,
16. Or clapping of shepherd's hands,
17. Or vagrant booming of the air,
18. Voice of a meteor lost in day?
19. Such tidings of the starry sphere
20. Can this elastic air convey.
21. Or haply 't was the cannonade
22. Of the pent and darkened lake,
23. Cooled by the pendent mountain's shade,
24. Whose deeps, till beams of noonday break,
25. Afflicted moan, and latest hold
26. Even unto May the iceberg cold.
27. Was it a squirrel's pettish bark,
28. Or clarionet of jay? or hark,
29. Where yon wedged line the Nestor leads,
30. Steering north with raucous cry
31. Through tracts and provinces of sky,
32. Every night alighting down
33. In new landscapes of romance,
34. Where darkling feed the clamorous clans
35. By lonely lakes to men unknown.
36. Come the tumult whence it will,
37. Voice of sport, or rush of wings,
38. It is a sound, it is a token
39. That the marble sleep is broken,
40. And a change has passed on things.

41. Beneath the calm, within the light,
42. A hid unruly appetite
43. Of swifter life, a surer hope,
44. Strains every sense to larger scope,
45. Impatient to anticipate
46. The halting steps of aged Fate.
47. Slow grows the palm, too slow the pearl:
48. When Nature falters, fain would zeal
49. Grasp the felloes of her wheel,
50. And grasping give the orbs another whirl.
51. Turn swiftlier round, O tardy ball!
52. And sun this frozen side,
53. Bring hither back the robin's call,
54. Bring back the tulip's pride.

55. Why chidest thou the tardy Spring?
56. The hardy bunting does not chide;
57. The blackbirds make the maples ring
58. With social cheer and jubilee;
59. The redwing flutes his o-ka-lee,
60. The robins know the melting snow;
61. The sparrow meek, prophetic-eyed,
62. Her nest beside the snow-drift weaves,
63. Secure the osier yet will hide
64. Her callow brood in mantling leaves;
65. And thou, by science all undone,
66. Why only must thy reason fail
67. To see the southing of the sun?

68. As we thaw frozen flesh with snow,
69. So Spring will not, foolish fond,
70. Mix polar night with tropic glow,
71. Nor cloy us with unshaded sun,
72. Nor wanton skip with bacchic dance,
73. But she has the temperance
74. Of the gods, whereof she is one,--
75. Masks her treasury of heat
76. Under east-winds crossed with sleet.
77. Plants and birds and humble creatures
78. Well accept her rule austere;
79. Titan-born, to hardy natures
80. Cold is genial and dear.
81. As Southern wrath to Northern right
82. Is but straw to anthracite;
83. As in the day of sacrifice,
84. When heroes piled the pyre,
85. The dismal Massachusetts ice
86. Burned more than others' fire,
87. So Spring guards with surface cold
88. The garnered heat of ages old:
89. Hers to sow the seed of bread,
90. That man and all the kinds be fed;
91. And, when the sunlight fills the hours,
92. Dissolves the crust, displays the flowers.

93. The world rolls round,--mistrust it not,--
94. Befalls again what once befell;
95. All things return, both sphere and mote,
96. And I shall hear my bluebird's note,
97. And dream the dream of Auburn dell.

98. When late I walked, in earlier days,
99. All was stiff and stark;
100. Knee-deep snows choked all the ways,
101. In the sky no spark;
102. Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods,
103. Struggling through the drifted roads;
104. The whited desert knew me not,
105. Snow-ridges masked each darling spot;
106. The summer dells, by genius haunted,
107. One arctic moon had disenchanted.
108. All the sweet secrets therein hid
109. By Fancy, ghastly spells undid.
110. Eldest mason, Frost, had piled,
111. With wicked ingenuity,
112. Swift cathedrals in the wild;
113. The piny hosts were sheeted ghosts
114. In the star-lit minster aisled.
115. I found no joy: the icy wind
116. Might rule the forest to his mind.
117. Who would freeze in frozen brakes?
118. Back to books and sheltered home,
119. And wood-fire flickering on the walls,
120. To hear, when, 'mid our talk and games,
121. Without the baffled north-wind calls.
122. But soft! a sultry morning breaks;
123. The cowslips make the brown brook gay;
124. A happier hour, a longer day.
125. Now the sun leads in the May,
126. Now desire of action wakes,
127. And the wish to roam.

128. The caged linnet in the Spring
129. Hearkens for the choral glee,
130. When his fellows on the wing
131. Migrate from the Southern Sea;
132. When trellised grapes their flowers unmask,
133. And the new-born tendrils twine,
134. The old wine darkling in the cask
135. Feels the bloom on the living vine,
136. And bursts the hoops at hint of Spring:
137. And so, perchance, in Adam's race,
138. Of Eden's bower some dream-like trace
139. Survived the Flight, and swam the Flood,
140. And wakes the wish in youngest blood
141. To tread the forfeit Paradise,
142. And feed once more the exile's eyes;
143. And ever when the happy child
144. In May beholds the blooming wild,
145. And hears in heaven the bluebird sing,
146. 'Onward,' he cries, 'your baskets bring,--
147. In the next field is air more mild,
148. And o'er yon hazy crest is Eden's balmier Spring.'

149. Not for a regiment's parade,
150. Nor evil laws or rulers made,
151. Blue Walden rolls its cannonade,
152. But for a lofty sign
153. Which the Zodiac threw,
154. That the bondage-days are told,
155. And waters free as winds shall flow.
156. Lo! how all the tribes combine
157. To rout the flying foe.
158. See, every patriot oak-leaf throws
159. His elfin length upon the snows,
160. Not idle, since the leaf all day
161. Draws to the spot the solar ray,
162. Ere sunset quarrying inches down,
163. And half-way to the mosses brown;
164. While the grass beneath the rime
165. Has hints of the propitious time,
166. And upward pries and perforates
167. Through the cold slab a thousand gates,
168. Till green lances peering through
169. Bend happy in the welkin blue.

170. April cold with dropping rain
171. Willows and lilacs brings again,
172. The whistle of returning birds,
173. And trumpet-lowing of the herds.
174. The scarlet maple-keys betray
175. What potent blood hath modest May;
176. What fiery force the earth renews,
177. The wealth of forms, the flush of hues;
178. Joy shed in rosy waves abroad
179. Flows from the heart of Love, the Lord.

180. Hither rolls the storm of heat;
181. I feel its finer billows beat
182. Like a sea which me infolds;
183. Heat with viewless fingers moulds,
184. Swells, and mellows, and matures,
185. Paints, and flavours, and allures,
186. Bird and brier inly warms,
187. Still enriches and transforms,
188. Gives the reed and lily length,
189. Adds to oak and oxen strength,
190. Boils the world in tepid lakes,
191. Burns the world, yet burnt remakes;
192. Enveloping heat, enchanted robe,
193. Wraps the daisy and the globe,
194. Transforming what it doth infold,
195. Life out of death, new out of old,
196. Painting fawns' and leopards' fells,
197. Seethes the gulf-encrimsoning shells,
198. Fires garden with a joyful blaze
199. Of tulips in the morning's rays.
200. The dead log touched bursts into leaf,
201. The wheat-blade whispers of the sheaf.
202. What god is this imperial Heat,
203. Earth's prime secret, sculpture's seat?
204. Doth it bear hidden in its heart
205. Water-line patterns of all art,
206. All figures, organs, hues, and graces?
207. Is it Daedalus? is it Love?
208. Or walks in mask almighty Jove,
209. And drops from Power's redundant horn
210. All seeds of beauty to be born?

211. Where shall we keep the holiday,
212. And duly greet the entering May?
213. Too strait and low our cottage doors,
214. And all unmeet our carpet floors;
215. Nor spacious court, nor monarch's hall,
216. Suffice to hold the festival.
217. Up and away! where haughty woods
218. Front the liberated floods:
219. We will climb the broad-backed hills,
220. Hear the uproar of their joy;
221. We will mark the leaps and gleams
222. Of the new-delivered streams,
223. And the murmuring rivers of sap
224. Mount in the pipes of the trees,
225. Giddy with day, to the topmost spire,
226. Which for a spike of tender green
227. Bartered its powdery cap;
228. And the colours of joy in the bird,
229. And the love in its carol heard,
230. Frog and lizard in holiday coats,
231. And turtle brave in his golden spots;
232. We will hear the tiny roar
233. Of the insects evermore,
234. While cheerful cries of crag and plain
235. Reply to the thunder of river and main.

236. As poured the flood of the ancient sea
237. Spilling over mountain chains,
238. Bending forests as bends the sedge,
239. Faster flowing o'er the plains,--
240. A world-wide wave with a foaming edge
241. That rims the running silver sheet,--
242. So pours the deluge of the heat
243. Broad northward o'er the land,
244. Painting artless paradises,
245. Drugging herbs with Syrian spices,
246. Fanning secret fires which glow
247. In columbine and clover-blow,
248. Climbing the northern zones,
249. Where a thousand pallid towns
250. Lie like cockles by the main,
251. Or tented armies on a plain.
252. The million-handed sculptor moulds
253. Quaintest bud and blossom folds,
254. The million-handed painter pours
255. Opal hues and purple dye;
256. Azaleas flush the island floors,
257. And the tints of heaven reply.

258. Wreaths for the May! for happy Spring
259. To-day shall all her dowry bring,
260. The love of kind, the joy, the grace,
261. Hymen of element and race,
262. Knowing well to celebrate
263. With song and hue and star and state,
264. With tender light and youthful cheer,
265. The spousals of the new-born year.
266. Lo Love's inundation poured
267. Over space and race abroad!

268. Spring is strong and virtuous,
269. Broad-sowing, cheerful, plenteous,
270. Quickening underneath the mould
271. Grains beyond the price of gold.
272. So deep and large her bounties are,
273. That one broad, long midsummer day
274. Shall to the planet overpay
275. The ravage of a year of war.

276. Drug the cup, thou butler sweet,
277. And send the nectar round;
278. The feet that slid so long on sleet
279. Are glad to feel the ground.
280. Fill and saturate each kind
281. With good according to its mind,
282. Fill each kind and saturate
283. With good agreeing with its fate,
284. Willow and violet, maiden and man.

285. The bitter-sweet, the haunting air,
286. Creepeth, bloweth everywhere;
287. It preys on all, all prey on it,
288. Blooms in beauty, thinks in wit,
289. Stings the strong with enterprise,
290. Makes travellers long for Indian skies,
291. And where it comes this courier fleet
292. Fans in all hearts expectance sweet,
293. As if to-morrow should redeem
294. The vanished rose of evening's dream.
295. By houses lies a fresher green,
296. On men and maids a ruddier mien,
297. As if time brought a new relay
298. Of shining virgins every May,
299. And Summer came to ripen maids
300. To a beauty that not fades.

301. The ground-pines wash their rusty green,
302. The maple-tops their crimson tint,
303. On the soft path each track is seen,
304. The girl's foot leaves its neater print.
305. The pebble loosened from the frost
306. Asks of the urchin to be tost.
307. In flint and marble beats a heart,
308. The kind Earth takes her children's part,
309. The green lane is the school-boy's friend,
310. Low leaves his quarrel apprehend,
311. The fresh ground loves his top and ball,
312. The air rings jocund to his call,
313. The brimming brook invites a leap,
314. He dives the hollow, climbs the steep.
315. The youth reads omens where he goes,
316. And speaks all languages the rose.
317. The wood-fly mocks with tiny noise
318. The far halloo of human voice;
319. The perfumed berry on the spray
320. Smacks of faint memories far away.
321. A subtle chain of countless rings
322. The next unto the farthest brings,
323. And, striving to be man, the worm
324. Mounts through all the spires of form.

325. I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth,
326. Stepping daily onward north
327. To greet staid ancient cavaliers
328. Filing single in stately train.
329. And who, and who are the travellers?
330. They were Night and Day, and Day and Night,
331. Pilgrims wight with step forthright.
332. I saw the Days deformed and low,
333. Short and bent by cold and snow;
334. The merry Spring threw wreaths on them,
335. Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell;
336. Many a flower and many a gem,
337. They were refreshed by the smell,
338. They shook the snow from hats and shoon,
339. They put their April raiment on;
340. And those eternal forms,
341. Unhurt by a thousand storms,
342. Shot up to the height of the sky again,
343. And danced as merrily as young men.
344. I saw them mask their awful glance
345. Sidewise meek in gossamer lids;
346. And to speak my thought if none forbids.
347. It was as if the eternal gods,
348. Tired of their starry periods,
349. Hid their majesty in cloth
350. Woven of tulips and painted moth.
351. On carpets green the maskers march
352. Below May's well-appointed arch,
353. Each star, each god, each grace amain,
354. Every joy and virtue speed,
355. Marching duly in her train,
356. And fainting Nature at her need
357. Is made whole again.

358. 'T was the vintage-day of field and wood,
359. When magic wine for bards is brewed;
360. Every tree and stem and chink
361. Gushed with syrup to the brink.
362. The air stole into the streets of towns,
363. And betrayed the fund of joy
364. To the high-school and medalled boy:
365. On from hall to chamber ran,
366. From youth to maid, from boy to man,
367. To babes, and to old eyes as well.
368. 'Once more,' the old man cried, 'ye clouds,
369. Airy turrets purple-piled,
370. Which once my infancy beguiled,
371. Beguile me with the wonted spell.
372. I know ye skilful to convoy
373. The total freight of hope and joy
374. Into rude and homely nooks,
375. Shed mocking lustres on shelf of books,
376. On farmer's byre, on meadow-pipes,
377. Or on a pool of dancing chips.
378. I care not if the pomps you show
379. Be what they soothfast appear,
380. Or if yon realms in sunset glow
381. Be bubbles of the atmosphere.
382. And if it be to you allowed
383. To fool me with a shining cloud,
384. So only new griefs are consoled
385. By new delights, as old by old,
386. Frankly I will be your guest,
387. Count your change and cheer the best.
388. The world hath overmuch of pain,--
389. If Nature give me joy again,
390. Of such deceit I'll not complain.'

391. Ah! well I mind the calendar,
392. Faithful through a thousand years,
393. Of the painted race of flowers,
394. Exact to days, exact to hours,
395. Counted on the spacious dial
396. Yon broidered zodiac girds.
397. I know the pretty almanac
398. Of the punctual coming-back,
399. On their due days, of the birds.
400. I marked them yestermorn,
401. A flock of finches darting
402. Beneath the crystal arch,
403. Piping, as they flew, a march,--
404. Belike the one they used in parting
405. Last year from yon oak or larch;
406. Dusky sparrows in a crowd,
407. Diving, darting northward free,
408. Suddenly betook them all,
409. Every one to his hole in the wall,
410. Or to his niche in the apple-tree.
411. I greet with joy the choral trains
412. Fresh from palms and Cuba's canes.
413. Best gems of Nature's cabinet,
414. With dews of tropic morning wet,
415. Beloved of children, bards, and Spring,
416. O birds, your perfect virtues bring,
417. Your song, your forms, your rhythmic flight,
418. Your manners for the heart's delight,
419. Nestle in hedge, or barn, or roof,
420. Here weave your chamber weather-proof,
421. Forgive our harms, and condescend
422. To man, as to a lubber friend,
423. And, generous, teach his awkward race
424. Courage, and probity, and grace!

425. Poets praise that hidden wine
426. Hid in milk we drew
427. At the barrier of Time,
428. When our life was new.
429. We had eaten fairy fruit,
430. We were quick from head to foot,
431. All the forms we look on shone
432. As with diamond dews thereon.
433. What cared we for costly joys,
434. The Museum's far-fetched toys?
435. Gleam of sunshine on the wall
436. Poured a deeper cheer than all
437. The revels of the Carnival.
438. We a pine-grove did prefer
439. To a marble theatre,
440. Could with gods on mallows dine,
441. Nor cared for spices or for wine.
442. Wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned,
443. Arch on arch, the grimmest land;
444. Whistle of a woodland bird
445. Made the pulses dance,
446. Note of horn in valleys heard
447. Filled the region with romance.

448. None can tell how sweet,
449. How virtuous, the morning air;
450. Every accent vibrates well;
451. Not alone the wood-bird's call,
452. Or shouting boys that chase their ball,
453. Pass the height of minstrel skill,
454. But the ploughman's thoughtless cry,
455. Lowing oxen, sheep that bleat,
456. And the joiner's hammer-beat,
457. Softened are above their will.
458. All grating discords melt,
459. No dissonant note is dealt,
460. And though thy voice be shrill
461. Like rasping file on steel,
462. Such is the temper of the air,
463. Echo waits with art and care,
464. And will the faults of song repair.

465. So by remote Superior Lake,
466. And by resounding Mackinac,
467. When northern storms and forests shake,
468. And billows on the long beach break,
469. The artful Air doth separate
470. Note by note all sounds that grate,
471. Smothering in her ample breast
472. All but godlike words,
473. Reporting to the happy ear
474. Only purified accords.
475. Strangely wrought from barking waves,
476. Soft music daunts the Indian braves,--
477. Convent-chanting which the child
478. Hears pealing from the panther's cave
479. And the impenetrable wild.

480. One musician is sure,
481. His wisdom will not fail,
482. He has not tasted wine impure,
483. Nor bent to passion frail.
484. Age cannot cloud his memory,
485. Nor grief untune his voice,
486. Ranging down the ruled scale
487. From tone of joy to inward wail,
488. Tempering the pitch of all
489. In his windy cave.
490. He all the fables knows,
491. And in their causes tells,--
492. Knows Nature's rarest moods,
493. Ever on her secret broods.
494. The Muse of men is coy,
495. Oft courted will not come;
496. In palaces and market squares
497. Entreated, she is dumb;
498. But my minstrel knows and tells
499. The counsel of the gods,
500. Knows of Holy Book the spells,
501. Knows the law of Night and Day,
502. And the heart of girl and boy,
503. The tragic and the gay,
504. And what is writ on Table Round
505. Of Arthur and his peers,
506. What sea and land discoursing say
507. In sidereal years.
508. He renders all his lore
509. In numbers wild as dreams,
510. Modulating all extremes,--
511. What the spangled meadow saith
512. To the children who have faith;
513. Only to children children sing,
514. Only to youth will spring be spring.

515. Who is the Bard thus magnified?
516. When did he sing, and where abide?

517. Chief of song where poets feast
518. Is the wind-harp which thou seest
519. In the casement at my side.

520. AEolian harp,
521. How strangely wise thy strain!
522. Gay for youth, gay for youth,
523. (Sweet is art, but sweeter truth,)
524. In the hall at summer eve
525. Fate and Beauty skilled to weave.
526. From the eager opening strings
527. Rung loud and bold the song.
528. Who but loved the wind-harp's note?
529. How should not the poet doat
530. On its mystic tongue,
531. With its primeval memory,
532. Reporting what old minstrels said
533. Of Merlin locked the harp within,--
534. Merlin paying the pain of sin,
535. Pent in a dungeon made of air,--
536. And some attain his voice to hear,
537. Words of pain and cries of fear,
538. But pillowed all on melody,
539. As fits the griefs of bards to be.
540. And what if that all-echoing shell,
541. Which thus the buried Past can tell,
542. Should rive the Future, and reveal
543. What his dread folds would fain conceal?
544. It shares the secret of the earth,
545. And of the kinds that owe her birth.
546. Speaks not of self that mystic tone,
547. But of the Overgods alone:
548. It trembles to the cosmic breath,--
549. As it heareth, so it saith;
550. Obeying meek the primal Cause,
551. It is the tongue of mundane laws:
552. And this, at least, I dare affirm,
553. Since genius too has bound and term,
554. There is no bard in all the choir,
555. Not Homer's self, the poet sire,
556. Wise Milton's odes of pensive pleasure,
557. Or Shakspeare, whom no mind can measure,
558. Nor Collins' verse of tender pain,
559. Nor Byron's clarion of disdain,
560. Scott, the delight of generous boys,
561. Or Wordsworth, Pan's recording voice,--
562. Not one of all can put in verse,
563. Or to this presence could rehearse,
564. The sights and voices ravishing
565. The boy knew on the hills in Spring,
566. When pacing through the oaks he heard
567. Sharp queries of the sentry-bird,
568. The heavy grouse's sudden whirr,
569. The rattle of the kingfisher;
570. Saw bonfires of the harlot flies
571. In the lowland, when day dies;
572. Or marked, benighted and forlorn,
573. The first far signal-fire of morn.
574. These syllables that Nature spoke,
575. And the thoughts that in him woke,
576. Can adequately utter none
577. Save to his ear the wind-harp lone.
578. And best can teach its Delphian chord
579. How Nature to the soul is moored,
580. If once again that silent string,
581. As erst it wont, would thrill and ring.

582. Not long ago, at eventide,
583. It seemed, so listening, at my side
584. A window rose, and, to say sooth,
585. I looked forth on the fields of youth:
586. I saw fair boys bestriding steeds,
587. I knew their forms in fancy weeds,
588. Long, long concealed by sundering fates,
589. Mates of my youth,--yet not my mates,
590. Stronger and bolder far than I,
591. With grace, with genius, well attired,
592. And then as now from far admired,
593. Followed with love
594. They knew not of,
595. With passion cold and shy.
596. O joy, for what recoveries rare!
597. Renewed, I breathe Elysian air,
598. See youth's glad mates in earliest bloom,--
599. Break not my dream, obtrusive tomb!
600. Or teach thou, Spring! the grand recoil
601. Of life resurgent from the soil
602. Wherein was dropped the mortal spoil.

603. Soft on the south-wind sleeps the haze!
604. So on thy broad mystic van
605. Lie the opal-coloured days,
606. And waft the miracle to man.
607. Soothsayer of the eldest gods,
608. Repairer of what harms betide,
609. Revealer of the inmost powers
610. Prometheus proffered, Jove denied;
611. Disclosing treasures more than true,
612. Or in what far to-morrow due;
613. Speaking by the tongues of flowers,
614. By the ten-tongued laurel speaking,
615. Singing by the oriole songs,
616. Heart of bird the man's heart seeking;
617. Whispering hints of treasure hid
618. Under Morn's unlifted lid,
619. Islands looming just beyond
620. The dim horizon's utmost bound;--
621. Who can, like thee, our rags upbraid,
622. Or taunt us with our hope decayed?
623. Or who like thee persuade,
624. Making the splendour of the air,
625. The morn and sparkling dew, a snare?
626. Or who resent
627. Thy genius, wiles, and blandishment?

628. There is no orator prevails
629. To beckon or persuade
630. Like thee the youth or maid:
631. Thy birds, thy songs, thy brooks, thy gales,
632. Thy blooms, thy kinds,
633. Thy echoes in the wilderness,
634. Soothe pain, and age, and love's distress,
635. Fire fainting will, and build heroic minds.

636. For thou, O Spring! canst renovate
637. All that high God did first create.
638. Be still his arm and architect,
639. Rebuild the ruin, mend defect;
640. Chemist to vamp old worlds with new,
641. Coat sea and sky with heavenlier blue,
642. New-tint the plumage of the birds,
643. And slough decay from grazing herds,
644. Sweep ruins from the scarped mountain,
645. Cleanse the torrent at the fountain,
646. Purge alpine air by towns defiled,
647. Bring to fair mother fairer child,
648. Not less renew the heart and brain,
649. Scatter the sloth, wash out the stain,
650. Make the aged eye sun-clear,
651. To parting soul bring grandeur near.
652. Under gentle types, my Spring
653. Masks the might of Nature's king,
654. An energy that searches thorough
655. From Chaos to the dawning morrow;
656. Into all our human plight,
657. The soul's pilgrimage and flight;
658. In city or in solitude,
659. Step by step, lifts bad to good,
660. Without halting, without rest,
661. Lifting Better up to Best;
662. Planting seeds of knowledge pure,
663. Through earth to ripen, through heaven endure.
