1. Think me not unkind and rude
2. That I walk alone in grove and glen;
3. I go to the god of the wood
4. To fetch his word to men.

5. Tax not my sloth that I
6. Fold my arms beside the brook;
7. Each cloud that floated in the sky
8. Writes a letter in my book.

9. Chide me not, laborious band,
10. For the idle flowers I brought;
11. Every aster in my hand
12. Goes home loaded with a thought.

13. There was never mystery
14. But 'tis figured in the flowers;
15. Was never secret history
16. But birds tell it in the bowers.

17. One harvest from thy field
18. Homeward brought the oxen strong;
19. A second crop thine acres yield,
20. Which I gather in a song.
