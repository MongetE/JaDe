1. How much, preventing God! how much I owe
2. To the defenses thou hast round me set:
3. Example, custom, fear, occasional slow,
4. These scorned bondmen were my parapet.
5. I dare not peep over this parapet
6. To gauge with glance the roaring gulf beelow,
7. The depths of sin to which I had descended,
8. Had not these me against myself defended.
