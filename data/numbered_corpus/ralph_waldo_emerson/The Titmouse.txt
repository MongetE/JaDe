1. You shall not be overbold
2. When you deal with arctic cold,
3. As late I found my lukewarm blood
4. Chilled wading in the snow-choked wood.
5. How should I fight? my foeman fine
6. Has million arms to one of mine:
7. East, west, for aid I looked in vain,
8. East, west, north, south, are his domain.
9. Miles off, three dangerous miles, is home;
10. Must borrow his winds who there would come.
11. Up and away for life! be fleet!--
12. The frost-king ties my fumbling feet,
13. Sings in my ears, my hands are stones,
14. Curdles the blood to the marble bones,
15. Tugs at the heart-strings, numbs the sense,
16. And hems in life with narrowing fence.
17. Well, in this broad bed lie and sleep,
18. The punctual stars will vigil keep,
19. Embalmed by purifying cold,
20. The winds shall sing their dead-march old,
21. The snow is no ignoble shroud,
22. The moon thy mourner, and the cloud.

23. Softly,--but this way fate was pointing,
24. 'T was coming fast to such anointing,
25. When piped a tiny voice hard by,
26. Gay and polite a cheerful cry,
27. Chic-chicadeedee! saucy note
28. Out of sound heart and merry throat,
29. As if it said, 'Good day, good sir!
30. Fine afternoon, old passenger!
31. Happy to meet you in these places,
32. Where January brings few faces.'

33. This poet, though he live apart,
34. Moved by his hospitable heart,
35. Sped, when I passed his sylvan fort,
36. To do the honours of his court,
37. As fits a feathered lord of land;
38. Flew near, with soft wing grazed my hand,
39. Hopped on the bough, then, darting low,
40. Prints his small impress on the snow,
41. Shows feats of his gymnastic play,
42. Head downward, clinging to the spray.

43. Here was this atom in full breath,
44. Hurling defiance at vast death;
45. This scrap of valour just for play
46. Fronts the north-wind in waistcoat gray,
47. As if to shame my weak behaviour;
48. I greeted loud my little saviour,
49. 'You pet! what dost here? and what for?
50. In these woods, thy small Labrador,
51. At this pinch, wee San Salvador!
52. What fire burns in that little chest
53. So frolic, stout, and self-possest?
54. Henceforth I wear no stripe but thine;
55. Ashes and jet all hues outshine.
56. Why are not diamonds black and gray,
57. To ape thy dare-devil array?
58. And I affirm, the spacious North
59. Exists to draw thy virtue forth.
60. I think no virtue goes with size;
61. The reason of all cowardice
62. Is, that men are overgrown,
63. And, to be valiant, must come down
64. To the titmouse dimension.'

65. 'T is good-will makes intelligence,
66. And I began to catch the sense
67. Of my bird's song: 'Live out of doors,
68. In the great woods, on prairie floors.
69. I dine in the sun; when he sinks in the sea,
70. I too have a hole in a hollow tree;
71. And I like less when Summer beats
72. With stifling beams on these retreats,
73. Than noontide twilights which snow makes
74. With tempest of the blinding flakes.
75. For well the soul, if stout within,
76. Can arm impregnably the skin;
77. And polar frost my frame defied,
78. Made of the air that blows outside.'

79. With glad remembrance of my debt,
80. I homeward turn; farewell, my pet!
81. When here again thy pilgrim comes,
82. He shall bring store of seeds and crumbs.
83. Doubt not, so long as earth has bread,
84. Thou first and foremost shalt be fed;
85. The Providence that is most large
86. Takes hearts like thine in special charge,
87. Helps who for their own need are strong,
88. And the sky dotes on cheerful song.
89. Henceforth I prize thy wiry chant
90. O'er all that mass and minster vaunt;
91. For men mis-hear thy call in spring,
92. As 't would accost some frivolous wing;
93. Crying out of the hazel copse, Phe-be!
94. And, in winter, Chic-a-dee-dee!
95. I think old Caesar must have heard
96. In northern Gaul my dauntless bird,
97. And, echoed in some frosty wold,
98. Borrowed thy battle-numbers bold.
99. And I will write our annals new,
100. And thank thee for a better clew,
101. I, who dreamed not when I came here
102. To find the antidote of fear,
103. Now hear thee say in Roman key,
104. Paean! Veni, vidi, vici.
