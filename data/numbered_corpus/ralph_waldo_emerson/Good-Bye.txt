1. Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home;
2. Thou art my friend, and I'm not thine.
3. Long through thy weary crowds I roam;
4. A river-ark on the ocean brine,
5. Long I've been tossed like the driven foam;
6. But now, proud world! I'm going home.

7. Good-bye to Flattery's fawning face;
8. To Grandeur with his wise grimace;
9. To upstart Wealth's averted eye;
10. To supple Office, low and high;
11. To crowded halls, to court and street;
12. To frozen hearts and hasting feet;
13. To those who go, and those who come;
14. Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home.

15. I am going to my own hearth-stone,
16. Bosomed to yon green hills alone,--
17. A secret nook in a pleasant land,
18. Whose groves the frolic fairies planned;
19. Where arches green, the livelong day,
20. Echo the blackbird's roundelay,
21. And vulgar feet have never trod
22. A spot that is sacred to thought and God.

23. O, when I am safe in my sylvan home,
24. I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome;
25. And when I am stretched beneath the pines,
26. Where the evening star so holy shines,
27. I laugh at the lore and the pride of man,
28. At the sophist schools and the learned clan;
29. For what are they all, in their high conceit,
30. When man in the bush with God may meet?
