1. Grace, Beauty, and Caprice
2. Build this golden portal;
3. Graceful women, chosen men,
4. Dazzle every mortal.
5. Their sweet and lofty countenance
6. His enchanted food;
7. He need not go to them, their forms
8. Beset his solitude.
9. He looketh seldom in their face,
10. His eyes explore the ground,--
11. The green grass is a looking-glass
12. Whereon their traits are found.
13. Little and less he says to them,
14. So dances his heart in his breast;
15. Their tranquil mien bereaveth him
16. Of wit, of words, of rest.
17. Too weak to win, too fond to shun
18. The tyrants of his doom,
19. The much deceived Endymion
20. Slips behind a tomb.
