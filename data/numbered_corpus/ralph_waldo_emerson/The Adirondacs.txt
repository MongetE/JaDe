1. A JOURNAL.
2. DEDICATED TO MY FELLOW-TRAVELLERS IN AUGUST, 1858.


3. Wise and polite,--and if I drew
4. Their several portraits, you would own
5. Chaucer had no such worthy crew,
6. Nor Boccace in Decameron.

7. We crossed Champlain to Keeseville with our friends,
8. Thence, in strong country carts, rode up the forks
9. Of the Ausable stream, intent to reach
10. The Adirondac lakes. At Martin's Beach
11. We chose our boats; each man a boat and guide,--
12. Ten men, ten guides, our company all told.

13. Next morn, we swept with oars the Saranac,
14. With skies of benediction, to Round Lake,
15. Where all the sacred mountains drew around us,
16. Tahawus, Seaward, MacIntyre, Baldhead,
17. And other Titans without muse or name.
18. Pleased with these grand companions, we glide on,
19. Instead of flowers, crowned with a wreath of hills,
20. And made our distance wider, boat from boat,
21. As each would hear the oracle alone.
22. By the bright morn the gay flotilla slid
23. Through files of flags that gleamed like bayonets,
24. Through gold-moth-haunted beds of pickerel-flower,
25. Through scented banks of lilies white and gold,
26. Where the deer feeds at night, the teal by day,
27. On through the Upper Saranac, and up
28. Pere Raquette stream, to a small tortuous pass
29. Winding through grassy shallows in and out,
30. Two creeping miles of rushes, pads, and sponge,
31. To Follansbee Water, and the Lake of Loons.

32. Northward the length of Follansbee we rowed,
33. Under low mountains, whose unbroken ridge
34. Ponderous with beechen forest sloped the shore.
35. A pause and council: then, where near the head
36. On the east a bay makes inward to the land
37. Between two rocky arms, we climb the bank,
38. And in the twilight of the forest noon
39. Wield the first axe these echoes ever heard.
40. We cut young trees to make our poles and thwarts,
41. Barked the white spruce to weatherfend the roof,
42. Then struck a light, and kindled the camp-fire.

43. The wood was sovran with centennial trees,--
44. Oak, cedar, maple, poplar, beech and fir,
45. Linden and spruce. In strict society
46. Three conifers, white, pitch, and Norway pine,
47. Five-leaved, three-leaved, and two-leaved, grew thereby.
48. Our patron pine was fifteen feet in girth,
49. The maple eight, beneath its shapely tower.

50. 'Welcome!' the wood god murmured through the leaves,--
51. 'Welcome, though late, unknowing, yet known to me.'
52. Evening drew on; stars peeped through maple-boughs,
53. Which o'erhung, like a cloud, our camping fire.
54. Decayed millennial trunks, like moonlight flecks,
55. Lit with phosphoric crumbs the forest floor.

56. Ten scholars, wonted to lie warm and soft
57. In well-hung chambers daintily bestowed,
58. Lie here on hemlock-boughs, like Sacs and Sioux,
59. And greet unanimous the joyful change.
60. So fast will Nature acclimate her sons,
61. Though late returning to her pristine ways.
62. Off soundings, seamen do not suffer cold;
63. And, in the forest, delicate clerks, unbrowned,
64. Sleep on the fragrant brush, as on down-beds.
65. Up with the dawn, they fancied the light air
66. That circled freshly in their forest dress
67. Made them to boys again. Happier that they
68. Slipped off their pack of duties, leagues behind,
69. At the first mounting of the giant stairs.
70. No placard on these rocks warned to the polls,
71. No door-bell heralded a visitor,
72. No courier waits, no letter came or went,
73. Nothing was ploughed, or reaped, or bought, or sold;
74. The frost might glitter, it would blight no crop,
75. The falling rain will spoil no holiday.
76. We were made freemen of the forest laws,
77. All dressed, like Nature, fit for her own ends,
78. Essaying nothing she cannot perform.

79. In Adirondac lakes,
80. At morn or noon, the guide rows bareheaded:
81. Shoes, flannel shirt, and kersey trousers make
82. His brief toilette: at night, or in the rain,
83. He dons a surcoat which he doffs at morn:
84. A paddle in the right hand, or an oar,
85. And in the left, a gun, his needful arms.
86. By turns we praised the stature of our guides,
87. Their rival strength and suppleness, their skill
88. To row, to swim, to shoot, to build a camp,
89. To climb a lofty stem, clean without boughs
90. Full fifty feet, and bring the eaglet down:
91. Temper to face wolf, bear, or catamount,
92. And wit to track or take him in his lair.
93. Sound, ruddy men, frolic and innocent,
94. In winter, lumberers; in summer, guides;
95. Their sinewy arms pull at the oar untired
96. Three times ten thousand strokes, from morn to eve.

97. Look to yourselves, ye polished gentlemen!
98. No city airs or arts pass current here.
99. Your rank is all reversed: let men of cloth
100. Bow to the stalwart churls in overalls:
101. They are the doctors of the wilderness,
102. And we the low-prized laymen.
103. In sooth, red flannel is a saucy test
104. Which few can put on with impunity.
105. What make you, master, fumbling at the oar?
106. Will you catch crabs? Truth tries pretension here.
107. The sallow knows the basket-maker's thumb;
108. The oar, the guide's. Dare you accept the tasks
109. He shall impose, to find a spring, trap foxes,
110. Tell the sun's time, determine the true north,
111. Or stumbling on through vast self-similar woods
112. To thread by night the nearest way to camp?

113. Ask you, how went the hours?
114. All day we swept the lake, searched every cove,
115. North from Camp Maple, south to Osprey Bay,
116. Watching when the loud dogs should drive in deer,
117. Or whipping its rough surface for a trout;
118. Or bathers, diving from the rock at noon;
119. Challenging Echo by our guns and cries;
120. Or listening to the laughter of the loon;
121. Or, in the evening twilight's latest red,
122. Beholding the procession of the pines;
123. Or, later yet, beneath a lighted jack,
124. In the boat's bows, a silent night-hunter
125. Stealing with paddle to the feeding-grounds
126. Of the red deer, to aim at a square mist.
127. Hark to that muffled roar! a tree in the woods
128. Is fallen: but hush! it has not scared the buck
129. Who stands astonished at the meteor light,
130. Then turns to bound away,--is it too late?

131. Sometimes we tried our rifles at a mark,
132. Six rods, sixteen, twenty, or forty-five;
133. Sometimes our wits at sally and retort,
134. With laughter sudden as the crack of rifle;
135. Or parties scaled the near acclivities
136. Competing seekers of a rumoured lake,
137. Whose unauthenticated waves we named
138. Lake Probability,--our carbuncle,
139. Long sought, not found.

140. Two Doctors in the camp
141. Dissected the slain deer, weighed the trout's brain,
142. Captured the lizard, salamander, shrew,
143. Crab, mice, snail, dragon-fly, minnow, and moth;
144. Insatiate skill in water or in air
145. Waved the scoop-net, and nothing came amiss;
146. The while, one leaden pot of alcohol
147. Gave an impartial tomb to all the kinds.
148. Not less the ambitious botanist sought plants,
149. Orchis and gentian, fern, and long whip-scirpus,
150. Rosy polygonum, lake-margin's pride,
151. Hypnum and hydnum, mushroom, sponge, and moss,
152. Or harebell nodding in the gorge of falls.
153. Above, the eagle flew, the osprey screamed,
154. The raven croaked, owls hooted, the woodpecker
155. Loud hammered, and the heron rose in the swamp.
156. As water poured through the hollows of the hills
157. To feed this wealth of lakes and rivulets,
158. So Nature shed all beauty lavishly
159. From her redundant horn.

160. Lords of this realm,
161. Bounded by dawn and sunset, and the day
162. Rounded by hours where each outdid the last
163. In miracles of pomp, we must be proud,
164. As if associates of the sylvan gods.
165. We seemed the dwellers of the zodiac,
166. So pure the Alpine element we breathed,
167. So light, so lofty pictures came and went.
168. We trode on air, contemned the distant town,
169. Its timorous ways, big trifles, and we planned
170. That we should build, hard-by, a spacious lodge,
171. And how we should come hither with our sons,
172. Hereafter,--willing they, and more adroit.

173. Hard fare, hard bed, and comic misery,--
174. The midge, the blue-fly, and the mosquito
175. Painted our necks, hands, ankles, with red bands:
176. But, on the second day, we heed them not,
177. Nay, we saluted them Auxiliaries,
178. Whom earlier we had chid with spiteful names.
179. For who defends our leafy tabernacle
180. From bold intrusion of the travelling crowd,--
181. Who but the midge, mosquito, and the fly,
182. Which past endurance sting the tender cit,
183. But which we learn to scatter with a smudge,
184. Or baffle by a veil, or slight by scorn?

185. Our foaming ale we drunk from hunters' pans,
186. Ale, and a sup of wine. Our steward gave
187. Venison and trout, potatoes, beans, wheat-bread;
188. All ate like abbots, and, if any missed
189. Their wonted convenance, cheerly hid the loss
190. With hunters' appetite and peals of mirth.
191. And Stillman, our guides' guide, and Commodore,
192. Crusoe, Crusader, Pius AEneas, said aloud,
193. 'Chronic dyspepsia never came from eating
194. Food indigestible':--then murmured some,
195. Others applauded him who spoke the truth.

196. Nor doubt but visitings of graver thought
197. Checked in these souls the turbulent heyday
198. 'Mid all the hints and glories of the home.
199. For who can tell what sudden privacies
200. Were sought and found, amid the hue and cry
201. Of scholars furloughed from their tasks, and let
202. Into this Oreads' fended Paradise,
203. As chapels in the city's thoroughfares,
204. Whither gaunt Labour slips to wipe his brow,
205. And meditate a moment on Heaven's rest.
206. Judge with what sweet surprises Nature spoke
207. To each apart, lifting her lovely shows
208. To spiritual lessons pointed home.
209. And as through dreams in watches of the night,
210. So through all creatures in their form and ways
211. Some mystic hint accosts the vigilant,
212. Not clearly voiced, but waking a new sense
213. Inviting to new knowledge, one with old.
214. Hark to that petulant chirp! what ails the warbler?
215. Mark his capricious ways to draw the eye.
216. Now soar again. What wilt thou, restless bird,
217. Seeking in that chaste blue a bluer light,
218. Thirsting in that pure for a purer sky?

219. And presently the sky is changed; O world!
220. What pictures and what harmonies are thine!
221. The clouds are rich and dark, the air serene,
222. So like the soul of me, what if't were me?
223. A melancholy better than all mirth.
224. Comes the sweet sadness at the retrospect,
225. Or at the foresight of obscurer years?
226. Like yon slow-sailing cloudy promontory,
227. Whereon the purple iris dwells in beauty
228. Superior to all its gaudy skirts.
229. And, that no day of life may lack romance,
230. The spiritual stars rise nightly, shedding down
231. A private beam into each several heart.
232. Daily the bending skies solicit man,
233. The seasons chariot him from this exile,
234. The rainbow hours bedeck his glowing chair,
235. The storm-winds urge the heavy weeks along,
236. Suns haste to set, that so remoter lights
237. Beckon the wanderer to his vaster home.

238. With a vermilion pencil mark the day
239. When of our little fleet three cruising skiffs
240. Entering Big Tupper, bound for the foaming Falls
241. Of loud Bog River, suddenly confront
242. Two of our mates returning with swift oars.
243. One held a printed journal waving high
244. Caught from a late-arriving traveller,
245. Big with great news, and shouted the report
246. For which the world had waited, now firm fact,
247. Of the wire-cable laid beneath the sea,
248. And landed on our coast, and pulsating
249. With ductile fire. Loud, exulting cries
250. From boat to boat, and to the echoes round,
251. Greet the glad miracle. Thought's new-found path
252. Shall supplement henceforth all trodden ways,
253. Match God's equator with a zone of art,
254. And lift man's public action to a height
255. Worthy the enormous clouds of witnesses,
256. When linked hemispheres attest his deed.
257. We have few moments in the longest life
258. Of such delight and wonder as there grew,--
259. Nor yet unsuited to that solitude:
260. A burst of joy, as if we told the fact
261. To ears intelligent; as if gray rock
262. And cedar grove and cliff and lake should know
263. This feat of wit, this triumph of mankind;
264. As if we men were talking in a vein
265. Of sympathy so large, that ours was theirs,
266. And a prime end of the most subtle element
267. Were fairly reached at last. Wake, echoing caves!
268. Bend nearer, faint day-moon! Yon thundertops,
269. Let them hear well! 't is theirs as much as ours.

270. A spasm throbbing through the pedestals
271. Of Alp and Andes, isle and continent,
272. Urging astonished Chaos with a thrill
273. To be a brain, or serve the brain of man.
274. The lightning has run masterless too long;
275. He must to school, and learn his verb and noun,
276. And teach his nimbleness to earn his wage,
277. Spelling with guided tongue man's messages
278. Shot through the weltering pit of the salt sea.
279. And yet I marked, even in the manly joy
280. Of our great-hearted Doctor in his boat,
281. (Perchance I erred,) a shade of discontent;
282. Or was it for mankind a generous shame,
283. As of a luck not quite legitimate,
284. Since fortune snatched from wit the lion's part?
285. Was it a college pique of town and gown,
286. As one within whose memory it burned
287. That not academicians, but some lout,
288. Found ten years since the Californian gold?
289. And now, again, a hungry company
290. Of traders, led by corporate sons of trade,
291. Perversely borrowing from the shop the tools
292. Of science, not from the philosophers,
293. Had won the brightest laurel of all time.
294. 'Twas always thus, and will be; hand and head
295. Are ever rivals: but, though this be swift,
296. The other slow,--this the Prometheus,
297. And that the Jove,--yet, howsoever hid,
298. It was from Jove the other stole his fire,
299. And, without Jove, the good had never been.
300. It is not Iroquois or cannibals,
301. But ever the free race with front sublime,
302. And these instructed by their wisest too,
303. Who do the feat, and lift humanity.
304. Let not him mourn who best entitled was,
305. Nay, mourn not one: let him exult,
306. Yea, plant the tree that bears best apples, plant,
307. And water it with wine, nor watch askance
308. Whether thy sons or strangers eat the fruit:
309. Enough that mankind eat, and are refreshed.

310. We flee away from cities, but we bring
311. The best of cities with us, these learned classifiers,
312. Men knowing what they seek, armed eyes of experts.
313. We praise the guide, we praise the forest life;
314. But will we sacrifice our dear-bought lore
315. Of books and arts and trained experiment,
316. Or count the Sioux a match for Agassiz?
317. O no, not we! Witness the shout that shook
318. Wild Tupper Lake; witness the mute all-hail
319. The joyful traveller gives, when on the verge
320. Of craggy Indian wilderness he hears
321. From a log-cabin stream Beethoven's notes
322. On the piano, played with master's hand.
323. 'Well done!' he cries; 'the bear is kept at bay,
324. The lynx, the rattlesnake, the flood, the fire;
325. All the fierce enemies, ague, hunger, cold,
326. This thin spruce roof, this clayed log-wall,
327. This wild plantation will suffice to chase.
328. Now speed the gay celerities of art,
329. What in the desert was impossible
330. Within four walls is possible again,--
331. Culture and libraries, mysteries of skill,
332. Traditioned fame of masters, eager strife
333. Of keen competing youths, joined or alone
334. To outdo each other, and extort applause.
335. Mind wakes a new-born giant from her sleep.
336. Twirl the old wheels? Time takes fresh start again
337. On for a thousand years of genius more.'

338. The holidays were fruitful, but must end;
339. One August evening had a cooler breath;
340. Into each mind intruding duties crept;
341. Under the cinders burned the fires of home;
342. Nay, letters found us in our paradise;
343. So in the gladness of the new event
344. We struck our camp, and left the happy hills.
345. The fortunate star that rose on us sank not;
346. The prodigal sunshine rested on the land,
347. The rivers gambolled onward to the sea,
348. And Nature, the inscrutable and mute,
349. Permitted on her infinite repose
350. Almost a smile to steal to cheer her sons,
351. As if one riddle of the Sphinx were guessed.
