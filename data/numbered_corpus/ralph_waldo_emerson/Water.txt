1. The water understands
2. Civilization well;
3. It wets my foot, but prettily,
4. It chills my life, but wittily,
5. It is not disconcerted,
6. It is not broken-hearted:
7. Well used, it decketh joy,
8. Adorneth, doubleth joy:
9. Ill used, it will destroy,
10. In perfect time and measure
11. With a face of golden pleasure
12. Elegantly destroy.
