1. Trees in groves,
2. Kine in droves,
3. In ocean sport the scaly herds,
4. Wedge-like cleave the air the birds,
5. To northern lakes fly wind-borne ducks,
6. Browse the mountain sheep in flocks,
7. Men consort in camp and town,
8. But the poet dwells alone.

9. God who gave to him the lyre,
10. Of all mortals the desire,
11. For all breathing men's behoof,
12. Straitly charged him, "Sit aloof;"
13. Annexed a warning, poets say,
14. To the bright premium,—
15. Ever when twain together play,
16. Shall the harp be dumb.
17. Many may come,
18. But one shall sing;
19. Two touch the string,
20. The harp is dumb.
21. Though there come a million
22. Wise Saadi dwells alone.

23. Yet Saadi loved the race of men,—
24. No churl immured in cave or den,—
25. In bower and hall
26. He wants them all,
27. Nor can dispense
28. With Persia for his audience;
29. They must give ear,
30. Grow red with joy, and white with fear,
31. Yet he has no companion,
32. Come ten, or come a million,
33. Good Saadi dwells alone.

34. Be thou ware where Saadi dwells.
35. Gladly round that golden lamp
36. Sylvan deities encamp,
37. And simple maids and noble youth
38. Are welcome to the man of truth.
39. Most welcome they who need him most,
40. They feed the spring which they exhaust:
41. For greater need
42. Draws better deed:
43. But, critic, spare thy vanity,
44. Nor show thy pompous parts,
45. To vex with odious subtlety
46. The cheerer of men's hearts.

47. Sad-eyed Fakirs swiftly say
48. Endless dirges to decay;
49. Never in the blaze of light
50. Lose the shudder of midnight;
51. And at overflowing noon,
52. Hear wolves barking at the moon;
53. In the bower of dalliance sweet
54. Hear the far Avenger's feet;
55. And shake before those awful Powers
56. Who in their pride forgive not ours.
57. Thus the sad-eyed Fakirs preach;
58. "Bard, when thee would Allah teach,
59. And lift thee to his holy mount,
60. He sends thee from his bitter fount,
61. Wormwood; saying, Go thy ways,
62. Drink not the Malaga of praise,
63. But do the deed thy fellows hate,
64. And compromise thy peaceful state.
65. Smite the white breasts which thee fed,
66. Stuff sharp thorns beneath the head
67. Of them thou shouldst have comforted.
68. For out of woe and out of crime
69. Draws the heart a lore sublime."
70. And yet it seemeth not to me
71. That the high gods love tragedy;
72. For Saadi sat in the sun,
73. And thanks was his contrition;
74. For haircloth and for bloody whips,
75. Had active hands and smiling lips;
76. And yet his runes he rightly read,
77. And to his folk his message sped.
78. Sunshine in his heart transferred
79. Lighted each transparent word;
80. And well could honoring Persia learn
81. What Saadi wished to say;
82. For Saadi's nightly stars did burn
83. Brighter than Dschami's day.

84. Whispered the muse in Saadi's cot;
85. O gentle Saadi, listen not,
86. Tempted by thy praise of wit,
87. Or by thirst and appetite
88. For the talents not thine own,
89. To sons of contradiction.
90. Never, sun of eastern morning,
91. Follow falsehood, follow scorning,
92. Denounce who will, who will, deny,
93. And pile the hills to scale the sky;
94. Let theist, atheist, pantheist,
95. Define and wrangle how they list,—
96. Fierce conserver, fierce destroyer,
97. But thou joy-giver and enjoyer,
98. Unknowing war, unknowing crime,
99. Gentle Saadi, mind thy rhyme.
100. Heed not what the brawlers say,
101. Heed thou only Saadi's lay.

102. Let the great world bustle on
103. With war and trade, with camp and town.
104. A thousand men shall dig and eat,
105. At forge and furnace thousands sweat,
106. And thousands sail the purple sea,
107. And give or take the stroke of war,
108. Or crowd the market and bazaar.
109. Oft shall war end, and peace return,
110. And cities rise where cities burn,
111. Ere one man my hill shall climb,
112. Who can turn the golden rhyme;
113. Let them manage how they may,
114. Heed thou only Saadi's lay.
115. Seek the living among the dead:
116. Man in man is imprisoned.
117. Barefooted Dervish is not poor,
118. If fate unlock his bosom's door.
119. So that what his eye hath seen
120. His tongue can paint, as bright, as keen,
121. And what his tender heart hath felt,
122. With equal fire thy heart shall melt.
123. For, whom the muses shine upon,
124. And touch with soft persuasion,
125. His words like a storm-wind can bring
126. Terror and beauty on their wing;
127. In his every syllable
128. Lurketh nature veritable;
129. And though he speak in midnight dark,
130. In heaven, no star; on earth, no spark;
131. Yet before the listener's eye
132. Swims the world in ecstasy,
133. The forest waves, the morning breaks,
134. The pastures sleep, ripple the lakes,
135. Leaves twinkle, flowers like persons be,
136. And life pulsates in rock or tree.
137. Saadi! so far thy words shall reach;
138. Suns rise and set in Saadi's speech.

139. And thus to Saadi said the muse;
140. Eat thou the bread which men refuse;
141. Flee from the goods which from thee flee;
142. Seek nothing; Fortune seeketh thee.
143. Nor mount, nor dive; all good things keep
144. The midway of the eternal deep;
145. Wish not to fill the isles with eyes
146. To fetch thee birds of paradise;
147. On thine orchard's edge belong
148. All the brass of plume and song;
149. Wise Ali's sunbright sayings pass
150. For proverbs in the market-place;
151. Through mountains bored by regal art
152. Toil whistles as he drives his cart.
153. Nor scour the seas, nor sift mankind,
154. A poet or a friend to find;
155. Behold, he watches at the door,
156. Behold his shadow on the floor.
157. Open innumerable doors,
158. The heaven where unveiled Allah pours
159. The flood of truth, the flood of good,
160. The seraph's and the cherub's food;
161. Those doors are men; the pariah kind
162. Admits thee to the perfect Mind.
163. Seek not beyond thy cottage wall
164. Redeemer that can yield thee all.
165. While thou sittest at thy door,
166. On the desert's yellow floor,
167. Listening to the gray-haired crones,
168. Foolish gossips, ancient drones,—
169. Saadi, see, they rise in stature
170. To the height of mighty nature,
171. And the secret stands revealed
172. Fraudulent Time in vain concealed,
173. That blessed gods in servile masks
174. Plied for thee thy household tasks.
