1. The lords of life, the lords of life,—-
2. I saw them pass,
3. In their own guise,
4. Like and unlike,
5. Portly and grim, —
6. Use and Surprise,
7. Surface and Dream,
8. Succession swift and spectral Wrong,
9. Temperament without a tongue,
10. And the inventor of the game
11. Omnipresent without name; —
12. Some to see, some to be guessed,
13. They marched from east to west:
14. Little man, least of all,
15. Among the legs of his guardians tall,
16. Walked about with puzzled look.
17. Him by the hand dear Nature took,
18. Dearest Nature, strong and kind,
19. Whispered, 'Darling, never mind!
20. To-morrow they will wear another face,
21. The founder thou; these are thy race!'
