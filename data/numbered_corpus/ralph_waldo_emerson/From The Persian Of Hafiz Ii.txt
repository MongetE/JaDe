1. Of Paradise, O hermit wise,
2. Let us renounce the thought.
3. Of old therein our names of sin
4. Allah recorded not.

5. Who dear to God on earthly sod
6. No corn-grain plants,
7. The same is glad that life is had,
8. Though corn he wants.

9. Thy mind the mosque and cool kiosk,
10. Spare fast, and orisons;
11. Mine me allows the drink-house,
12. And sweet chase of the nuns.

13. O just fakeer, with brow austere,
14. Forbid me not the vine;
15. On the first day, poor Hafiz clay
16. Was kneaded up with wine.

17. He is no dervise, Heaven slights his service,
18. Who shall refuse
19. There in the banquet, to pawn his blanket
20. For Schiraz's juice.

21. Who his friend's shirt, or hem of his shirt,
22. Shall spare to pledge,
23. To him Eden's bliss and Angel's kiss
24. Shall want their edge.

25. Up, Hafiz; grace from high God's face
26. Beams on thee pure;
27. Shy then not hell, and trust thou well,
28. Heaven is secure.
