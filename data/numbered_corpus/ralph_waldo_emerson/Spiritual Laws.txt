1. The living Heaven thy prayers respect,
2. House at once and architect,
3. Quarrying man's rejected hours,
4. Builds therewith eternal towers;
5. Sole and self-commanded works,
6. Fears not undermining days,
7. Grows by decays,
8. And, by the famous might that lurks
9. In reaction and recoil,
10. Makes flame to freeze and ice to boil;
11. Forging, through swart arms of Offence,
12. The silver seat of Innocence.
