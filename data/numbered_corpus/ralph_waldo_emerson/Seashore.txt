1. I heard or seemed to hear the chiding Sea
2. Say, Pilgrim, why so late and slow to come?
3. Am I not always here, thy summer home?
4. Is not my voice thy music, morn and eve?
5. My breath thy healthful climate in the heats,
6. My touch thy antidote, my bay thy bath?
7. Was ever building like my terraces?
8. Was ever couch magnificent as mine?
9. Lie on the warm rock-ledges, and there learn
10. A little hut suffices like a town.
11. I make your sculptured architecture vain,
12. Vain beside mine. I drive my wedges home,
13. And carve the coastwise mountain into caves.
14. Lo! here is Rome and Nineveh and Thebes,
15. Karnak and Pyramid and Giant's Stairs
16. Half piled or prostrate; and my newest slab
17. Older than all thy race.

18. Behold the Sea,
19. The opaline, the plentiful and strong,
20. Yet beautiful as is the rose in June,
21. Fresh as the trickling rainbow of July;
22. Sea full of food, the nourisher of kinds,
23. Purger of earth, and medicine of men;
24. Creating a sweet climate by my breath,

25. Washing out harms and griefs from memory,
26. And, in my mathematic ebb and flow,
27. Giving a hint of that which changes not.
28. Rich are the sea-gods:--who gives gifts but they?
29. They grope the sea for pearls, but more than pearls:
30. They pluck Force thence, and give it to the wise.
31. For every wave is wealth to DÃ¦dalus,
32. Wealth to the cunning artist who can work
33. This matchless strength. Where shall he find, O waves!
34. A load your Atlas shoulders cannot lift?

35. I with my hammer pounding evermore
36. The rocky coast, smite Andes into dust,
37. Strewing my bed, and, in another age,
38. Rebuild a continent of better men.
39. Then I unbar the doors: my paths lead out
40. The exodus of nations: I dispersed
41. Men to all shores that front the hoary main.

42. I too have arts and sorceries;
43. Illusion dwells forever with the wave.
44. I know what spells are laid. Leave me to deal
45. With credulous and imaginative man;
46. For, though he scoop my water in his palm,
47. A few rods off he deems it gems and clouds.
48. Planting strange fruits and sunshine on the shore,
49. I make some coast alluring, some lone isle,
50. To distant men, who must go there, or die.
