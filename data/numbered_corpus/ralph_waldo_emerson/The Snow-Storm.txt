1. Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,
2. Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,
3. Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air
4. Hides hill and woods, the river, and the heaven,
5. And veils the farmhouse at the garden's end.
6. The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet
7. Delated, all friends shut out, the housemates sit
8. Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed
9. In a tumultuous privacy of storm.
10. Come see the north wind's masonry.
11. Out of an unseen quarry evermore
12. Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer
13. Curves his white bastions with projected roof
14. Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.
15. Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work
16. So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he
17. For number or proportion. Mockingly,
18. On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;
19. A swan-like form invests the hiddden thorn;
20. Fills up the famer's lane from wall to wall,
21. Maugre the farmer's sighs; and at the gate
22. A tapering turret overtops the work.
23. And when his hours are numbered, and the world
24. Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,
25. Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art
26. To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,
27. Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,
28. The frolic architecture of the snow.
