1. Set not thy foot on graves;
2. Hear what wine and roses say;
3. The mountain chase, the summer waves,
4. The crowded town, thy feet may well delay.

5. Set not thy foot on graves;
6. Nor seek to unwind the shroud
7. Which charitable time
8. And nature have allowed
9. To wrap the errors of a sage sublime.

10. Set not thy foot on graves;
11. Care not to strip the dead
12. Of his sad ornament;
13. His myrrh, and wine, and rings,
14. His sheet of lead,
15. And trophies buried;
16. Go get them where he earned them when alive,
17. As resolutely dig or dive.

18. Life is too short to waste
19. The critic bite or cynic bark,
20. Quarrel, or reprimand;
21. 'Twill soon be dark;
22. Up! mind thine own aim, and
23. God speed the mark.
