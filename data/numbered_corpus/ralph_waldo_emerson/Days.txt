1. Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days,
2. Muffled and dumb like barefoot dervishes,
3. And marching single in an endless file,
4. Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.
5. To each they offer gifts after his will,
6. Bread, kingdom, stars, and sky that holds them all.

7. I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,
8. Forgot my morning wishes, hastily
9. Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day
10. Turned and departed silent. I, too late,
11. Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.
