1. Virtue runs before the muse
2. And defies her skill,
3. She is rapt, and doth refuse
4. To wait a painter's will.

5. Star-adoring, occupied,
6. Virtue cannot bend her,
7. Just to please a poet's pride,
8. To parade her splendor.

9. The bard must be with good intent
10. No more his, but hers,
11. Throw away his pen and paint,
12. Kneel with worshippers.

13. Then, perchance, a sunny ray
14. From the heaven of fire,
15. His lost tools may over-pay,
16. And better his desire.
