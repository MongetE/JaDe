1. I

2. If thou canst bear
3. Strong meat of simple truth
4. If thou durst my words compare
5. With what thou thinkest in my soul’s free youth,
6. Then take this fact unto thy soul,-----
7. God dwells in thee.
8. It is no metaphor nor parable,
9. It is unknown to thousands, and to thee;
10. Yet there is God.

11. II

12. He is in thy world,
13. But thy world knows him not.
14. He is the mighty Heart
15. From which life’s varied pulses part.
16. Clouded and shrouded there doth sit
17. The Infinite
18. Embosomed in a man;
19. And thou art stranger to thy guest
20. And know’st not what thou doth invest.
21. The clouds that veil his life within
22. Are thy thick woven webs of sin,
23. Which his glory struggling through
24. Darkens to thine evil hue.

25. III

26. Then bear thyself, O man!
27. Up to the scale and compass of thy guest;
28. Soul of thy soul.
29. Be great as doth beseem
30. The ambassador who bears
31. The royal presence where he goes.

32. IV

33. Give up to thy soul-----
34. Let it have its way-----
35. It is, I tell thee, God himself,
36. The selfsame One that rules the Whole,
37. Tho’ he speaks thro’ thee with a stifled voice,
38. And looks through thee, shorn of his beams.
39. But if thou listen to his voice,
40. If thou obey the royal thought,
41. It will grow clearer to thine ear,
42. More glorious to thine eye.
43. The clouds will burst that veil him now
44. And thou shalt see the Lord.

45. V

46. Therefore be great,
47. Not proud,-----too great to be proud.
48. Let not thine eyes rove,
49. Peep not in corners; let thine eyes
50. Look straight before thee, as befits
51. The simplicity of Power.
52. And in thy closet carry state;
53. Filled with light, walk therein;
54. And, as a king
55. Would do no treason to his own empire,
56. So do not thou to thine.

57. VI

58. This is the reason why thou dost recognize
59. Things now first revealed,
60. Because in thee resides
61. The Spirit that lives in all;
62. And thou canst learn the laws of nature
63. Because its author is latent in thy breast.

64. VII

65. Therefore, O happy youth,
66. Happy if thou dost know and love this truth,
67. Thou art unto thyself a law,
68. And since the soul of things is in thee,
69. Thou needest nothing out of thee.
70. The law, the gospel, and the Providence,
71. Heaven, Hell, the Judgement, and the stores
72. Immeasurable of Truth and Good,
73. All these thou must find
74. Within thy single mind,
75. Or never find.

76. VIII

77. Thou art the law;
78. The gospel has no revelation
79. Of peace and hope until there is response
80. From the deep chambers of thy mind thereto,-----
81. The rest is straw.
82. It can reveal no truth unknown before.
83. The Providence
84. Thou art thyself that doth dispense
85. Wealth to thy work, want to thy sloth,
86. Glory to goodness, to neglect, the moth.
87. Thou sow’st the wind, the whirlwind reapest,
88. Thou payest the wages
89. Of thy own work, through all ages.
90. The almighty energy within
91. Crowneth virtue, curseth sin.
92. Virtue sees by its own light;
93. Stumbleth sin in self-made night.

94. IX

95. Who approves thee doing right?
96. God in thee.
97. Who condemns thee doing wrong?
98. God in thee.
99. Who punishes thine evil deed?
100. God in thee.
101. What is thine evil meed?
102. Thy worse mind, with error blind
103. And more prone to evil
104. That is, the greater hiding of the God within:
105. The loss of peace
106. The terrible displeasure of this inmate
107. And next the consequence
108. More faintly as more distant wro’t
109. Upon our outward fortunes
110. Which decay with vice
111. With Virtue rise.

112. X

113. The selfsame God
114. By the same law
115. Makes the souls of angels glad
116. And the souls of devils sad
117. See
118. There is nothing else but God
119. Where e'er I look
120. All things hasten back to him
121. Light is but his shadow dim.

122. XI

123. Shall I ask wealth or power of God, who gave
124. An image of himself to be my soul?
125. As well might swilling ocean ask a wave,
126. Or the starred firmament a dying coal,-----
127. For that which is in me lives in the whole.
