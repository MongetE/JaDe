1. Once I wished I might rehearse
2. Freedom's paean in my verse,
3. That the slave who caught the strain
4. Should throb until he snapped his chain.
5. But the Spirit said, 'Not so;
6. Speak it not, or speak it low;
7. Name not lightly to be said,
8. Gift too precious to be prayed,
9. Passion not to be expressed
10. But by heaving of the breast:
11. Yet,--wouldst thou the mountain find
12. Where this deity is shrined,
13. Who gives to seas and sunset skies
14. Their unspent beauty of surprise,
15. And, when it lists him, waken can
16. Brute or savage into man;
17. Or, if in thy heart he shine,
18. Blends the starry fates with thine,
19. Draws angels nigh to dwell with thee,
20. And makes thy thoughts archangels be;
21. Freedom's secret wilt thou know?--
22. Counsel not with flesh and blood;
23. Loiter not for cloak or food;
24. Right thou feelest, rush to do.'
