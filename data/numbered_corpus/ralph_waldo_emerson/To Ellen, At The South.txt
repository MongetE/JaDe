1. The green grass is growing,
2. The morning wind is in it,
3. 'Tis a tune worth the knowing,
4. Though it change every minute.

5. 'Tis a tune of the spring,
6. Every year plays it over,
7. To the robin on the wing,
8. To the pausing lover.

9. O'er ten thousand thousand acres
10. Goes light the nimble zephyr,
11. The flowers, tiny feet of shakers,
12. Worship him ever.

13. Hark to the winning sound!
14. They summon thee, dearest,
15. Saying; "We have drest for thee the ground,
16. Nor yet thou appearest.

17. "O hasten, 'tis our time,
18. Ere yet the red summer
19. Scorch our delicate prime,
20. Loved of bee, the tawny hummer.

21. "O pride of thy race!
22. Sad in sooth it were to ours,
23. If our brief tribe miss thy face,â€”
24. We pour New England flowers.

25. "Fairest! choose the fairest members
26. Of our lithe society;
27. June's glories and September's
28. Show our love and piety.

29. "Thou shalt command us all,
30. April's cowslip, summer's clover
31. To the gentian in the fall,
32. Blue-eyed pet of blue-eyed lover.

33. "O come, then, quickly come,
34. We are budding, we are blowing,
35. And the wind which we perfume
36. Sings a tune that's worth thy knowing."
