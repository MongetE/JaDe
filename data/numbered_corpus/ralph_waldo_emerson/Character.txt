1. The sun set, but set not his hope:
2. Stars rose; his faith was earlier up:
3. Fixed on the enormous galaxy,
4. Deeper and older seemed his eye;
5. And matched his sufferance sublime
6. The taciturnity of time.
7. He spoke, and words more soft than rain
8. Brought the Age of Gold again:
9. His action won such reverence sweet
10. As hid all measure of the feat.
