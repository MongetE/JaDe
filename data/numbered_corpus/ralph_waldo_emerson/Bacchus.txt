1. BRING me wine, but wine which never grew
2. In the belly of the grape,
3. Or grew on vine whose tap-roots, reaching through
4. Under the Andes to the Cape,
5. Suffer'd no savour of the earth to 'scape.

6. Let its grapes the morn salute
7. From a nocturnal root,
8. Which feels the acrid juice
9. Of Styx and Erebus;
10. And turns the woe of Night,
11. By its own craft, to a more rich delight.

12. We buy ashes for bread;
13. We buy diluted wine;
14. Give me of the true,
15. Whose ample leaves and tendrils curl'd
16. Among the silver hills of heaven
17. Draw everlasting dew;
18. Wine of wine,
19. Blood of the world,
20. Form of forms, and mould of statures,
21. That I intoxicated,
22. And by the draught assimilated,
23. May float at pleasure through all natures;
24. The bird-language rightly spell,
25. And that which roses say so well:

26. Wine that is shed
27. Like the torrents of the sun
28. Up the horizon walls,
29. Or like the Atlantic streams, which run
30. When the South Sea calls.

31. Water and bread,
32. Food which needs no transmuting,
33. Rainbow-flowering, wisdom-fruiting,
34. Wine which is already man,
35. Food which teach and reason can.

36. Wine which Music is,--
37. Music and wine are one,--
38. That I, drinking this,
39. Shall hear far Chaos talk with me;
40. Kings unborn shall walk with me;
41. And the poor grass shall plot and plan
42. What it will do when it is man.
43. Quicken'd so, will I unlock
44. Every crypt of every rock.

45. I thank the joyful juice
46. For all I know;
47. Winds of remembering
48. Of the ancient being blow,
49. And seeming-solid walls of use
50. Open and flow.

51. Pour, Bacchus! the remembering wine;
52. Retrieve the loss of me and mine!
53. Vine for vine be antidote,
54. And the grape requite the lote!
55. Haste to cure the old despair;
56. Reason in Nature's lotus drench'd--
57. The memory of ages quench'd--
58. Give them again to shine;
59. Let wine repair what this undid;
60. And where the infection slid,
61. A dazzling memory revive;
62. Refresh the faded tints,
63. Recut the aged prints,
64. And write my old adventures with the pen
65. Which on the first day drew,
66. Upon the tablets blue,
67. The dancing Pleiads and eternal men.
