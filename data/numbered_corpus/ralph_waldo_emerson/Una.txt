1. Roving, roving, as it seems,
2. Una lights my clouded dreams;
3. Still for journeys she is dressed;
4. We wander far by east and west.

5. In the homestead, homely thought;
6. At my work I ramble not;
7. If from home chance draw me wide,
8. Half-seen Una sits beside.

9. In my house and garden-plot,
10. Though beloved, I miss her not;
11. But one I seek in foreign places,
12. One face explore in foreign faces.

13. At home a deeper thought may light
14. The inward sky with chrysolite,
15. And I greet from far the ray,
16. Aurora of a dearer day.

17. But if upon the seas I sail,
18. Or trundle on the glowing rail,
19. I am but a thought of hers,
20. Loveliest of travellers.

21. So the gentle poet's name
22. To foreign parts is blown by fame;
23. Seek him in his native town,
24. He is hidden and unknown.
