1. O Fair and stately maid, whose eye
2. Was kindled in the upper sky
3. At the same torch that lighted mine;
4. For so I must interpret still
5. Thy sweet dominion o'er my will,
6. A sympathy divine.

7. Ah! let me blameless gaze upon
8. Features that seem in heart my own,
9. Nor fear those watchful sentinels
10. Which charm the more their glance forbids,
11. Chaste glowing underneath their lids
12. With fire that draws while it repels.

13. Thine eyes still shined for me, though far
14. I lonely roved the land or sea,
15. As I behold yon evening star,
16. Which yet beholds not me.

17. This morn I climbed the misty hill,
18. And roamed the pastures through;
19. How danced thy form before my path,
20. Amidst the deep-eyed dew!

21. When the red bird spread his sable wing,
22. And showed his side of flame,
23. When the rose-bud ripened to the rose,
24. In both I read thy name.
