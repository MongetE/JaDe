1. If the red slayer think he slays,
2. Or if the slain think he is slain,
3. They know not well the subtle ways
4. I keep, and pass, and turn again.

5. Far or forgot to me is near;
6. Shadow and sunlight are the same;
7. The vanished gods to me appear;
8. And one to me are shame and fame.

9. They reckon ill who leave me out;
10. When me they fly, I am the wings;
11. I am the doubter and the doubt,
12. And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.

13. The strong gods pine for my abode,
14. And pine in vain the sacred Seven;
15. But thou, meek lover of the good!
16. Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.
