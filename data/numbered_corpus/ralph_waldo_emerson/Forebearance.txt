1. Hast thou named all the birds without a gun;
2. Loved the wood-rose, and left it on its stalk;
3. At rich men's tables eaten bread and pulse;
4. Unarmed, faced danger with a heart of trust;
5. And loved so well a high behavior
6. In man or maid, that thou from speech refrained,
7. Nobility more nobly to repay?â€”
8. O be my friend, and teach me to be thine!
