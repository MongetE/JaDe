1. Give all to love;
2. Obey thy heart;
3. Friends, kindred, days,
4. Estate, good-fame,
5. Plans, credit, and the Muse,-
6. Nothing refuse.
7. 'Tis a brave master;
8. Let it have scope:
9. Follow it utterly,
10. Hope beyond hope:
11. High and more high
12. It dives into noon,
13. With wing unspent,
14. Untold intent;
15. But it is a god,
16. Knows its own path,
17. And the outlets of the sky.
18. It was not for the mean;
19. It requireth courage stout,
20. Souls above doubt,
21. Valor unbending;
22. It will reward,-
23. They shall return
24. More than they were,
25. And ever ascending.
26. Leave all for love;
27. Yet, hear me, yet,
28. One word more thy heart behoved,
29. One pulse more of firm endeavor,-
30. Keep thee today,
31. To-morrow, forever,
32. Free as an Arab
33. Of thy beloved.
34. Cling with life to the maid;
35. But when the surprise,
36. First vague shadow of surmise
37. Flits across her bosom young
38. Of a joy apart from thee,
39. Free be she, fancy-free;
40. Nor thou detain her vesture's hem,
41. Nor the palest rose she flung
42. From her summer diadem.
