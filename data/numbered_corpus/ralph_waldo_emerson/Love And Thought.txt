1. Two well-assorted travellers use
2. The highway, Eros and the Muse.
3. From the twins is nothing hidden,
4. To the pair is naught forbidden;
5. Hand in hand the comrades go
6. Every nook of nature through:
7. Each for other they were born,
8. Each can other best adorn;
9. They know one only mortal grief
10. Past all balsam or relief,
11. When, by false companions crossed,
12. The pilgrims have each other lost.
