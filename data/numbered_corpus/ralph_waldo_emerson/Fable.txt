1. The mountain and the squirrel
2. Had a quarrel;
3. And the former called the latter "Little Prig."
4. Bun replied,
5. "You are doubtless very big;
6. But all sorts of things and weather
7. Must be taken in together
8. To make up a year
9. And a sphere.
10. And I think it's no disgrace
11. To occupy my place.
12. If I'm not so large as you,
13. You are not so small as I,
14. And not half so spry.
15. I'll not deny you make
16. A very pretty squirrel track;
17. Talents differ: all is well and wisely put;
18. If I cannot carry forests on my back,
19. Neither can you crack a nut."
