1. What makes a nation's pillars high
2. And its foundations strong?
3. What makes it mighty to defy
4. The foes that round it throng?

5. It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand
6. Go down in battle shock;
7. Its shafts are laid on sinking sand,
8. Not on abiding rock.

9. Is it the sword? Ask the red dust
10. Of empires passed away;
11. The blood has turned their stones to rust,
12. Their glory to decay.

13. And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown
14. Has seemed to nations sweet;
15. But God has struck its luster down
16. In ashes at his feet.

17. Not gold but only men can make
18. A people great and strong;
19. Men who for truth and honor's sake
20. Stand fast and suffer long.

21. Brave men who work while others sleep,
22. Who dare while others fly...
23. They build a nation's pillars deep
24. And lift them to the sky.
