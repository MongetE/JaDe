1. Thy trivial harp will never please
2. Or fill my craving ear;
3. Its chords should ring as blows the breeze,
4. Free, peremptory, clear.
5. No jingling serenader's art,
6. Nor tinkle of piano strings,
7. Can make the wild blood start
8. In its mystic springs.
9. The kingly bard
10. Must smite the chords rudely and hard,
11. As with hammer or with mace,
12. That they may render back
13. Artful thunder that conveys
14. Secrets of the solar track,
15. Sparks of the supersolar blaze.
16. Merlin's blows are strokes of fate,
17. Chiming with the forest-tone,
18. When boughs buffet boughs in the wood;
19. Chiming with the gasp and moan
20. Of the ice-imprisoned flood;
21. With the pulse of manly hearts,
22. With the voice of orators,
23. With the din of city arts,
24. With the cannonade of wars.
25. With the marches of the brave,
26. And prayers of might from martyrs' cave.

27. Great is the art,
28. Great be the manners of the bard!
29. He shall not his brain encumber
30. With the coil of rhythm and number,
31. But, leaving rule and pale forethought,
32. He shall aye climb
33. For his rhyme:
34. Pass in, pass in, the angels say,
35. In to the upper doors;
36. Nor count compartments of the floors,
37. But mount to Paradise
38. By the stairway of surprise.

39. Blameless master of the games,
40. King of sport that never shames;
41. He shall daily joy dispense
42. Hid in song's sweet influence.
43. Things more cheerly live and go,
44. What time the subtle mind
45. Plays aloud the tune whereto
46. Their pulses beat,
47. And march their feet,
48. And their members are combined.

49. By Sybarites beguiled
50. He shall no task decline;
51. Merlin's mighty line,
52. Extremes of nature reconciled,
53. Bereaved a tyrant of his will,
54. And made the lion mild.
55. Songs can the tempest still,
56. Scattered on the stormy air,
57. Mould the year to fair increase,
58. And bring in poetic peace.

59. He shall not seek to weave,
60. In weak unhappy times,
61. Efficacious rhymes;
62. Wait his returning strength,
63. Bird, that from the nadir's floor,
64. To the zenith's top could soar,
65. The soaring orbit of the muse exceeds that journey's length!

66. Nor, profane, affect to hit
67. Or compass that by meddling wit,
68. Which only the propitious mind
69. Publishes when 'tis inclined.
70. There are open hours
71. When the god's will sallies free,
72. And the dull idiot might see
73. The flowing fortunes of a thousand years;
74. Sudden, at unawares,
75. Self-moved fly-to the doors,
76. Nor sword of angels could reveal
77. What they conceal.
