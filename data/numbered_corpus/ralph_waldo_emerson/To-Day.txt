1. I rake no coffined clay, nor publish wide
2. The resurrection of departed pride.
3. Safe in their ancient crannies, dark and deep,
4. Let kings and conquerors, saints and soldiers sleep--
5. Late in the world,--too late perchance for fame,
6. Just late enough to reap abundant blame,--
7. I choose a novel theme, a bold abuse
8. Of critic charters, an unlaurelled Muse.

9. Old mouldy men and books and names and lands
10. Disgust my reason and defile my hands.
11. I had as lief respect an ancient shoe,
12. As love old things for age, and hate the new.
13. I spurn the Past, my mind disdains its nod,
14. Nor kneels in homage to so mean a God.
15. I laugh at those who, while they gape and gaze,
16. The bald antiquity of China praise.
17. Youth is (whatever cynic tubs pretend)
18. The fault that boys and nations soonest mend.
