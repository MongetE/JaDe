1. When I was born,
2. From all the seas of strength Fate filled a chalice,
3. Saying, This be thy portion, child; this chalice,
4. Less than a lily's, thou shalt daily draw
5. From my great arteries; nor less, nor more.
6. All substances the cunning chemist Time
7. Melts down into that liquor of my life,
8. Friends, foes, joys, fortunes, beauty, and disgust,
9. And whether I am angry or content,
10. Indebted or insulted, loved or hurt,
11. All he distils into sidereal wine,
12. And brims my little cup; heedless, alas!
13. Of all he sheds how little it will hold,
14. How much runs over on the desert sands.
15. If a new muse draw me with splendid ray,
16. And I uplift myself into her heaven,
17. The needs of the first sight absorb my blood,
18. And all the following hours of the day
19. Drag a ridiculous age.
20. To-day, when friends approach, and every hour
21. Brings book or starbright scroll of genius,
22. The tiny cup will hold not a bead more,
23. And all the costly liquor runs to waste,
24. Nor gives the jealous time one diamond drop
25. So to be husbanded for poorer days.
26. Why need I volumes, if one word suffice?
27. Why need I galleries, when a pupil's draught
28. After the master's sketch, fills and o'erfills
29. My apprehension? Why should I roam,
30. Who cannot circumnavigate the sea
31. Of thoughts and things at home, but still adjourn
32. The nearest matters to another moon?
33. Why see new men
34. Who have not understood the old?
