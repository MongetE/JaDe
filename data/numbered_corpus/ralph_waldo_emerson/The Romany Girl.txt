1. The sun goes down, and with him takes
2. The coarseness of my por attire;
3. The fair moon mounts, and aye the flame
4. Of Gypsy beauty blazes higher.

5. Pale Northern girls! you scorn our race;
6. You captives of your air-tight halls,
7. Wear out in-doors your sickly days,
8. But leave us the horizon walls.

9. And if I take you, dames, to task,
10. And say it frankly without guile,
11. Then you are Gypsies in a mask,
12. And I the lady all the while.

13. If, on the heath, below the moon,
14. I court and play with paler blood,
15. Me false to mine dare whisper none,--
16. One sallow horseman knows me good.

17. Go, keep your cheek's rose from the rain,
18. For teeth and hair with shopmen deal;
19. My swarthy tint is in the grain,
20. The rocks and forest knoww it real.

21. The wild air bloweth in out lungs,
22. The keen stars twinkle in our eyes,
23. The birds gave us our wily tongues,
24. The panther in our dances flies.

25. You doubt we read the stars on high,
26. Nathless we read your fortunes true;
27. The stars may hide in the upper sky,
28. But without glass we fathom you.
