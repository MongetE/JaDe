1. Was never form and never face
2. So sweet to SEYD as only grace
3. Which did not slumber like a stone,
4. But hovered gleaming and was gone.
5. Beauty chased he everywhere,
6. In flame, in storm, in clouds of air.
7. He smote the lake to feed his eye
8. With the beryl beam of the broken wave;
9. He flung in pebbles well to hear
10. The moment's music which they gave.
11. Oft pealed for him a lofty tone
12. From nodding pole and belting zone.
13. He heard a voice none else could hear
14. From centred and from errant sphere.
15. The quaking earth did quake in rhyme,
16. Seas ebbed and flowed in epic chime.
17. In dens of passion, and pits of woe,
18. He saw strong Eros struggling through,
19. To sun the dark and solve the curse,
20. And beam to the bounds of the universe.
21. While thus to love he gave his days
22. In loyal worship, scorning praise,
23. How spread their lures for him in vain
24. Thieving Ambition and paltering Gain!
25. He thought it happier to be dead,
26. To die for Beauty, than live for bread.
