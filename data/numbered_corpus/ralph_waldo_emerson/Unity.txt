1. Space is ample, east and west,
2. But two cannot go abreast,
3. Cannot travel in it two:
4. Yonder masterful cuckoo
5. Crowds every egg out of the nest,
6. Quick or dead, except its own;
7. A spell is laid on sod and stone,
8. Night and day were tampered with,
9. Every quality and pith
10. Surcharged and sultry with a power
11. That works its will on age and hour.
