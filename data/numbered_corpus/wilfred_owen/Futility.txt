1. 1 Move him into the sun--
2. 2 Gently its touch awoke him once,
3. 3 At home, whispering of fields unsown.
4. 4 Always it awoke him, even in France,
5. 5 Until this morning and this snow.
6. 6 If anything might rouse him now
7. 7 The kind old sun will know.

8. 8 Think how it wakes the seeds--
9. 9 Woke, once, the clays of a cold star.
10. 10 Are limbs so dear-achieved, are sides
11. 11 Full-nerved,--still warm,--too hard to stir?
12. 12 Was it for this the clay grew tall?
13. 13 --O what made fatuous sunbeams toil
14. 14 To break earth's sleep at all?
