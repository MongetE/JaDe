1. Not one corner of a foreign field
2. But a span as wide as Europe;
3. An appearance of a titan's grave,
4. And the length thereof a thousand miles,
5. It crossed all Europe like a mystic road,
6. Or as the Spirits' Pathway lieth on the night.
7. And I heard a voice crying
8. This is the Path of Glory.
