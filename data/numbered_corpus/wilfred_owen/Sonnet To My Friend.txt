1. If ever I had dreamed of my dead name
2. High in the heart of London, unsurpassed
3. By Time for ever, and the Fugitive, Fame,
4. There seeking a long sanctuary at last, -


5. Or if I onetime hoped to hide its shame,
6. - Shame of success, and sorrow of defeats, -
7. Under those holy cypresses, the same
8. That shade always the quiet place of Keats,


9. Now rather thank I God there is no risk
10. Of gravers scoring it with florid screed.
11. Let my inscription be this soldier's disc.
12. Wear it, sweet friend. Inscribe no date nor deed.
13. But may thy heart-beat kiss it, night and day,
14. Until the name grow blurred and fade away.
