1. It lieth low near merry England's heart
2. Like a long-buried sin; and Englishmen
3. Forget that in its death their sires had part.
4. And, like a sin, Time lays it bare again
5. To tell of races wronged,
6. And ancient glories suddenly overcast,
7. And treasures flung to fire and rabble wrath.
8. If thou hast ever longed
9. To lift the gloomy curtain of Time Past,
10. And spy the secret things that Hades hath,
11. Here through this riven ground take such a view.
12. The dust, that fell unnoted as a dew,
13. Wrapped the dead city's face like mummy-cloth:
14. All is as was: except for worm and moth.

15. Since Jove was worshipped under Wrekin's shade
16. Or Latin phrase was writ in Shropshire stone,
17. Since Druid chaunts desponded in this glade
18. Or Tuscan general called that field his own,
19. How long ago? How long?
20. How long since wanderers in the Stretton Hills
21. Met men of shaggy hair and savage jaw,
22. With flint and copper prong,
23. Aiming behind their dikes and thorny grilles?
24. Ah! those were days before the axe and saw,
25. Then were the nights when this mid-forest town
26. Held breath to hear the wolves come yelping down,
27. And ponderous bears 'long Severn lifted paw,
28. And nuzzling boars ran grunting through the shaw.

29. Ah me! full fifteen hundred times the wheat
30. Hath risen, and bowed, and fallen to human hunger
31. Since those imperial days were made complete.
32. The weary moon hath waxen old and younger
33. These eighteen thousand times
34. Without a shrine to greet her gentle ray.
35. And other temples rose; to Power and Pelf,
36. And chimed centurial chimes
37. Until their very bells are worn away.
38. While King by King lay cold on vaulted shelf
39. And wars closed wars, and many a Marmion fell,
40. And dearths and plagues holp sire and son to hell;
41. And old age stiffened many a lively elf
42. And many a poet's heart outdrained itself.

43. I had forgot that so remote an age
44. Beyond the horizon of our little sight,
45. Is far from us by no more spanless gauge
46. Than day and night, succeeding day and night,
47. Until I looked on Thee,
48. Thou ghost of a dead city, or its husk!
49. But even as we could walk by field and hedge
50. Hence to the distant sea
51. So, by the rote of common dawn and dusk,
52. We travel back to history's utmost edge.
53. Yea, when through thy old streets I took my way,
54. And recked a thousand years as yesterday,
55. Methought sage fancy wrought a sacrilege
56. To steal for me such godly privilege!

57. For here lie remnants from a banquet table -
58. Oysters and marrow-bones, and seeds of grape -
59. The statement of whose age must sound a fable;
60. And Samian jars, whose sheen and flawless shape
61. Look fresh from potter's mould.
62. Plasters with Roman finger-marks impressed;
63. Bracelets that from the warm Italian arm
64. Might seem to be scarce cold;
65. And spears - the same that pushed the Cymry west-
66. Unblunted yet; with tools of forge and farm
67. Abandoned, as a man in sudden fear
68. Drops what he holds to help his swift career:
69. For sudden was Rome's flight, and wild the alarm.
70. The Saxon shock was like Vesuvius' qualm.

71. O ye who prate of modern art and craft .
72. Mark well that Gaulish brooch, and test that screw!
73. Art's fairest buds on antique stem are graft.
74. Under the sun is nothing wholly new!
75. At Viricon today
76. The village anvil rests on Roman base
77. And in a garden, may be seen a bower
78. With pillars for its stay
79. That anciently in basilic had place.
80. The church's font is but a pagan dower:
81. A Temple's column, hollowed into this.
82. So is the glory of our artifice,
83. Our pleasure and our worship, but the flower
84. Of Roman custom and of Roman power.

85. O ye who laugh and, living as if Time
86. Meant but the twelve hours ticking round your dial,
87. Find it too short for thee, watch the sublime,
88. Slow, epochal time-registers awhile,
89. Which are Antiquities.
90. O ye who weep and call all your life too long
91. And moan: Was ever sorrow like to mine?
92. Muse on the memories
93. That sad sepulchral stones and ruins prolong.
94. Here might men drink of wonder like strong wine
95. And feel ephemeral troubles soothed and curbed.
96. Yet farmers, wroth to have their laws disturbed,
97. Are sooner roused for little loss to pine
98. Than we are moved by mighty woes long syne.

99. Above this reverend ground, what traveller checks?
100. Yet cities such as these one time would breed
101. Apocalyptic visions of world-wrecks.
102. Let Saxon men return to them, and heed!
103. They slew and burnt,
104. But after, prized what Rome had given away
105. Out of her strength and her prosperity.
106. Have they yet learnt
107. The precious truth distilled from Rome's decay?
108. Ruins! On England's heart press heavily!
109. For Rome hath left us more than walls and words
110. And better yet shall leave; and more than herds
111. Or land or gold gave the Celts to us in fee;
112. E'en Blood, which makes poets sing and prophets see.
