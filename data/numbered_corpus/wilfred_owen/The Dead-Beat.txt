1. He dropped, - more sullenly than wearily,
2. Lay stupid like a cod, heavy like meat,
3. And none of us could kick him to his feet;
4. -just blinked at my revolver, blearily;
5. - Didn't appear to know a war was on,
6. Or see the blasted trench at which he stared.
7. 'I'll do 'em in,' he whined. 'If this hand's spared,
8. I'll murder them, I will.'

9. A low voice said,
10. 'It's Blighty, p'raps, he sees; his pluck's all gone,
11. Dreaming of all the valiant, that aren't dead:
12. Bold uncles, smiling ministerially;
13. Maybe his brave young wife, getting her fun
14. In some new home, improved materially.
15. It's not these stiffs have crazed him; nor the Hun.'

16. We sent him down at last, out of the way.
17. Unwounded; - stout lad, too, before that strafe.
18. Malingering? Stretcher-bearers winked, 'Not half!'

19. Next day I heard the Doc's well-whiskied laugh:
20. 'That scum you sent last night soon died. Hooray!'
