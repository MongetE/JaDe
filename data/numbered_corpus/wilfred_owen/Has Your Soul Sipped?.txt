1. Has your soul sipped
2. Of the sweetness of all sweets?
3. Has it well supped
4. But yet hungers and sweats?

5. I have been witness
6. Of a strange sweetness,
7. All fancy surpassing
8. Past all supposing.

9. Passing the rays
10. Of the rubies of morning,
11. Or the soft rise
12. Of the moon; or the meaning
13. Known to the rose
14. Of her mystery and mourning.

15. Sweeter than nocturnes
16. Of the wild nightingale
17. Or than love's nectar
18. After life's gall.

19. Sweeter than odours
20. Of living leaves,
21. Sweeter than ardours
22. Of dying loves.

23. Sweeter than death
24. And dreams hereafter
25. To one in dearth
26. Or life and its laughter.

27. Or the proud wound
28. The victor wears
29. Or the last end
30. Of all wars.

31. Or the sweet murder
32. After long guard
33. Unto the martyr
34. Smiling at God;

35. To me was that smile,
36. Faint as a wan, worn myth,
37. Faint and exceeding small,
38. On a boy's murdered mouth.

39. Though from his throat
40. The life-tide leaps
41. There was no threat
42. On his lips.

43. But with the bitter blood
44. And the death-smell
45. All his life's sweetness bled
46. Into a smile.
