1. Between the brown hands of a server-lad
2. The silver cross was offered to be kissed.
3. The men came up, lugubrious, but not sad,
4. And knelt reluctantly, half-prejudiced.
5. (And kissing, kissed the emblem of a creed.)
6. Then mourning women knelt; meek mouths they had,
7. (And kissed the Body of the Christ indeed.)
8. Young children came, with eager lips and glad.
9. (These kissed a silver doll, immensely bright.)
10. Then I, too, knelt before that acolyte.
11. Above the crucifix I bent my head:
12. The Christ was thin, and cold, and very dead:
13. And yet I bowed, yea, kissed - my lips did cling.
14. (I kissed the warm live hand that held the thing.)
