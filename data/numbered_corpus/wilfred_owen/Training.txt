1. Not this week nor this month dare I lie down
2. In languour under lime trees or smooth smile.
3. Love must not kiss my face pale that is brown.

4. My lips, parting, shall drink space, mile by mile;
5. Strong meats be all my hunger; my renown
6. Be the clean beauty of speed and pride of style.

7. Cold winds encountered on the racing Down
8. Shall thrill my heated bareness; but awhile
9. None else may meet me till I wear my crown.
