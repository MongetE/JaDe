1. Cramped in that funnelled hole, they watched the dawn
2. Open a jagged rim around; a yawn
3. Of death's jaws, which had all but swallowed them
4. Stuck in the bottom of his throat of phlegm.

5. They were in one of many mouths of Hell
6. Not seen of seers in visions, only felt
7. As teeth of traps; when bones and the dead are smelt
8. Under the mud where long ago they fell
9. Mixed with the sour sharp odour of the shell.
