1. So the church Christ was hit and buried
2. Under its rubbish and its rubble.
3. In cellars, packed-up saints long serried,
4. Well out of hearing of our trouble.

5. One Virgin still immaculate
6. Smiles on for war to flatter her.
7. She's halo'd with an old tin hat,
8. But a piece of hell will batter her.
