1. It seemed that out of the battle I escaped
2. Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped
3. Through granites which Titanic wars had groined.
4. Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,
5. Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.
6. Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared
7. With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,
8. Lifting distressful hands as if to bless.
9. And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall;
10. By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell.
11. With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;
12. Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,
13. And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.
14. 'Strange, friend,' I said, 'Here is no cause to mourn.'
15. 'None,' said the other, 'Save the undone years,
16. The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,
17. Was my life also; I went hunting wild
18. After the wildest beauty in the world,
19. Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,

26. Now men will go content with what we spoiled.
27. Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.
28. They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress,
29. None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.
30. Courage was mine, and I had mystery;
31. Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery;
32. To miss the march of this retreating world
33. Into vain citadels that are not walled.
34. Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels
35. I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,
36. Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.
37. I would have poured my spirit without stint
38. But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.
39. Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.
40. I am the enemy you killed, my friend.
41. I knew you in this dark; for so you frowned
42. Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.
43. I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.
