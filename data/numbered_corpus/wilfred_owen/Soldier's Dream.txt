1. I dreamed kind Jesus fouled the big-gun gears;
2. And caused a permanent stoppage in all bolts;
3. And buckled with a smile Mausers and Colts;
4. And rusted every bayonet with His tears.

5. And there were no more bombs, of ours or Theirs,
6. Not even an old flint-lock, not even a pikel.
7. But God was vexed, and gave all power to Michael;
8. And when I woke he'd seen to our repairs.
