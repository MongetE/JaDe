1. In Shrewsbury Town e'en Hercules wox tired,
2. Tired of the streets that end not up nor down;
3. Tired of the Quarry, though seats may be hired
4. Of Shrewsbury Town.

5. Tired of the tongues that knew not his renown;
6. Tired of the Quarry Bye-Laws, so admired
7. By the Salopian, the somnambulant clown.

8. Weak as a babe, and in like wise attired,
9. He leaned upon his club; frowned a last frown,
10. And of ineffable boredom, so expired
11. In Shrewsbury Town.
