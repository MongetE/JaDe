1. Schoolmistress
2. Having, with bold Horatius, stamped her feet
3. And waved a final swashing arabesque
4. O'er the brave days of old, she ceased to bleat,
5. Slapped her Macaulay back upon the desk,
6. Resuned her calm gaze and her lofty seat.

7. There, while she heard the classic lines repeat,
8. Once more the teacher's face clenched stern;
9. For through the window, looking on the street,
10. Three soldiers hailed her. She made no return.
11. One was called 'Orace whom she would not greet.
