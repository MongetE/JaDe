1. The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
2. And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
3. Each dawn and set of sun till Christmastide,
4. And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
5. Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

6. From off your face, into the winds of winter,
7. The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
8. But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
9. When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
10. And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going.
