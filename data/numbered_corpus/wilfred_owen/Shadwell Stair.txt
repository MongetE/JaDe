1. I am the ghost of Shadwell Stair.
2. Along the wharves by the water-house,
3. And through the cavernous slaughter-house,
4. I am the shadow that walks there.

5. Yet I have flesh both firm and cool,
6. And eyes tumultuous as the gems
7. Of moons and lamps in the full Thames
8. When dusk sails wavering down the pool.

9. Shuddering the purple street-arc burns
10. Where I watch always; from the banks
11. Dolorously the shipping clanks
12. And after me a strange tide turns.

13. I walk till the stars of London wane
14. And dawn creeps up the Shadwell Stair.
15. But when the crowing syrens blare
16. I with another ghost am lain.
