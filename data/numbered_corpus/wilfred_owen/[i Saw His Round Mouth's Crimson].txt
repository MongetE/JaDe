1. [I saw his round mouth's crimson deepen as it fell],
2. Like a Sun, in his last deep hour;
3. Watched the magnificent recession of farewell,
4. Clouding, half gleam, half glower,
5. And a last splendour burn the heavens of his cheek.
6. And in his eyes
7. The cold stars lighting, very old and bleak,
8. In different skies.
