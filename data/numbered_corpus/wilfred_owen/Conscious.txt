1. His fingers wake, and flutter up the bed.
2. His eyes come open with a pull of will,
3. Helped by the yellow may-flowers by his head.
4. A blind-cord drawls across the window-sill . . .
5. How smooth the floor of the ward is! what a rug!
6. And who's that talking, somewhere out of sight?
7. Why are they laughing?  What's inside that jug?
8. "Nurse!  Doctor!"  "Yes; all right, all right."

9. But sudden dusk bewilders all the air --
10. There seems no time to want a drink of water.
11. Nurse looks so far away.  And everywhere
12. Music and roses burnt through crimson slaughter.
13. Cold; cold; he's cold; and yet so hot:
14. And there's no light to see the voices by --
15. No time to dream, and ask -- he knows not what.
