1. Down the close, darkening lanes they sang their way
2. To the siding-shed,
3. And lined the train with faces grimly gay.

4. Their breasts were stuck all white with wreath and spray
5. As men's are, dead.

6. Dull porters watched them, and a casual tramp
7. Stood staring hard,
8. Sorry to miss them from the upland camp.
9. Then, unmoved, signals nodded, and a lamp
10. Winked to the guard.

11. So secretly, like wrongs hushed-up, they went.
12. They were not ours:
13. We never heard to which front these were sent.

14. Nor there if they yet mock what women meant
15. Who gave them flowers.

16. Shall they return to beatings of great bells
17. In wild trainloads?
18. A few, a few, too few for drums and yells,
19. May creep back, silent, to still village wells
20. Up half-known roads.
