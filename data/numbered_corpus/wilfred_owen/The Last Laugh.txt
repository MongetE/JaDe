1. 'Oh! Jesus Christ! I'm hit,' he said; and died.
2. Whether he vainly cursed or prayed indeed,
3. The Bullets chirped-In vain, vain, vain!
4. Machine-guns chuckled,-Tut-tut! Tut-tut!
5. And the Big Gun guffawed.

6. Another sighed,-'O Mother, -Mother, - Dad!'
7. Then smiled at nothing, childlike, being dead.
8. And the lofty Shrapnel-cloud
9. Leisurely gestured,-Fool!
10. And the splinters spat, and tittered.

11. 'My Love!' one moaned. Love-languid seemed his mood,
12. Till slowly lowered, his whole faced kissed the mud.
13. And the Bayonets' long teeth grinned;
14. Rabbles of Shells hooted and groaned;
15. And the Gas hissed.
