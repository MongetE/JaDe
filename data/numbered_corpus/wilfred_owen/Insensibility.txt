1. I

2. Happy are men who yet before they are killed
3. Can let their veins run cold.
4. Whom no compassion fleers
5. Or makes their feet
6. Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.
7. The front line withers,
8. But they are troops who fade, not flowers
9. For poets' tearful fooling:
10. Men, gaps for filling
11. Losses who might have fought
12. Longer; but no one bothers.


13. II

14. And some cease feeling
15. Even themselves or for themselves.
16. Dullness best solves
17. The tease and doubt of shelling,
18. And Chance's strange arithmetic
19. Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.
20. They keep no check on Armies' decimation.


21. III

22. Happy are these who lose imagination:
23. They have enough to carry with ammunition.
24. Their spirit drags no pack.
25. Their old wounds save with cold can not more ache.
26. Having seen all things red,
27. Their eyes are rid
28. Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.
29. And terror's first constriction over,
30. Their hearts remain small drawn.
31. Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle
32. Now long since ironed,
33. Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.


34. IV

35. Happy the soldier home, with not a notion
36. How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,
37. And many sighs are drained.
38. Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:
39. His days are worth forgetting more than not.
40. He sings along the march
41. Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,
42. The long, forlorn, relentless trend
43. From larger day to huger night.


44. V

45. We wise, who with a thought besmirch
46. Blood over all our soul,
47. How should we see our task
48. But through his blunt and lashless eyes?
49. Alive, he is not vital overmuch;
50. Dying, not mortal overmuch;
51. Nor sad, nor proud,
52. Nor curious at all.
53. He cannot tell
54. Old men's placidity from his.


55. VI

56. But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,
57. That they should be as stones.
58. Wretched are they, and mean
59. With paucity that never was simplicity.
60. By choice they made themselves immune
61. To pity and whatever mourns in man
62. Before the last sea and the hapless stars;
63. Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;
64. Whatever shares
65. The eternal reciprocity of tears.
