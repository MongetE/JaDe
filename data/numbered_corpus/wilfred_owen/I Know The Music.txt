1. All sounds have been as music to my listening:
2. Pacific lamentations of slow bells,
3. The crunch of boots on blue snow rosy-glistening,
4. Shuffle of autumn leaves; and all farewells:

5. Bugles that sadden all the evening air,
6. And country bells clamouring their last appeals
7. Before [the] music of the evening prayer;
8. Bridges, sonorous under carriage wheels.

9. Gurgle of sluicing surge through hollow rocks,
10. The gluttonous lapping of the waves on weeds,
11. Whisper of grass; the myriad-tinkling flocks,
12. The warbling drawl of flutes and shepherds' reeds.

13. The orchestral noises of October nights
14. Blowing ( ) symphonetic storms
15. Of startled clarions ( )
16. Drums, rumbling and rolling thunderous and ( ).

17. Thrilling of throstles in the keen blue dawn,
18. Bees fumbling and fuming over sainfoin-fields.
