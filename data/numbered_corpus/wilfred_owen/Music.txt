1. I have been urged by earnest violins
2. And drunk their mellow sorrows to the slake
3. Of all my sorrows and my thirsting sins.
4. My heart has beaten for a brave drum's sake.
5. Huge chords have wrought me mighty: I have hurled
6. Thuds of gods' thunder. And with old winds pondered
7. Over the curse of this chaotic world,-
8. With low lost winds that maundered as they wandered.

9. I have been gay with trivial fifes that laugh;
10. And songs more sweet than possible things are sweet;
11. And gongs, and oboes. Yet I guessed not half
12. Life's symphony till I had made hearts beat,
13. And touched Love's body into trembling cries,
14. And blown my love's lips into laughs and sighs.
