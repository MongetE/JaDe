1. A vague pearl, a wan pearl
2. You showed me once; I peered through far-gone winters
3. Until my mind was fog-bound in that gem.

4. Blue diamonds, cold diamonds
5. You shook before me, so that out of them
6. Glittered and glowed vast diamond dawns of spring.

7. Tiger-eyed rubies, wrathful rubies
8. You rolled. I watched their hot hearts fling
9. Flames from each glaring summer of my life.

10. Quiet amber, mellow amber
11. You lifted; and behold the whole air rife
12. With evening, and the auburn autumn cloud.

13. But pale skin, your pearl skin
14. Show this to me, and I shall have surprise
15. Of every snow-lit dawn before it break.

16. But clear eyes, your fresh eyes
17. Open; that I may laugh, and lightly take
18. All air of early April in one hour.

19. But brown curls, O shadow me with curls,
20. Full of September mist, half-gleam, half-glower,
21. And I shall roam warm nights in lands far south.
