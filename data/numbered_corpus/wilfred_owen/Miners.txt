1. There was a whispering in my hearth,
2. A sigh of the coal.
3. Grown wistful of a former earth
4. It might recall.

5. I listened for a tale of leaves
6. And smothered ferns,
7. Frond-forests; and the low, sly lives
8. Before the fawns.

9. My fire might show steam-phantoms simmer
10. From Time's old cauldron,
11. Before the birds made nests in summer,
12. Or men had children.

13. But the coals were murmuring of their mine,
14. And moans down there
15. Of boys that slept wry sleep, and men
16. Writhing for air.

17. And I saw white bones in the cinder-shard,
18. Bones without number.
19. For many hearts with coal are charred,
20. And few remember.

21. I thought of all that worked dark pits
22. Of war, and died
23. Digging the rock where Death reputes
24. Peace lies indeed.

25. Comforted years will sit soft-chaired
26. In rooms of amber;
27. The years will stretch their hands, well-cheered
28. By our lifes' ember.

29. The centuries will burn rich loads
30. With which we groaned,
31. Whose warmth shall lull their dreaming lids,
32. While songs are crooned.
33. But they will not dream of us poor lads
34. Left in the ground.
