9. Peace would do wrong to our undying dead, --
10. The sons we offered might regret they died

14. We rulers sitting in this ancient spot
15. Would wrong our very selves if we forgot
16. The greatest glory will be theirs who fought,
17. Who kept this nation in integrity."
18. Nation? --  The half-limbed readers did not chafe
19. But smiled at one another curiously

21. This is the thing they know and never speak,
22. That England one by one had fled to France
23. (Not many elsewhere now save under France).

25. And people in whose voice real feeling rings
26. Say:  How they smile!  They're happy now, poor things.
