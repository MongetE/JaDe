1. After the blast of lightning from the east,
2. The flourish of loud clouds, the Chariot throne,
3. After the drums of time have rolled and ceased
4. And from the bronze west long retreat is blown,

5. Shall Life renew these bodies?  Of a truth
6. All death will he annul, all tears assuage?
7. Or fill these void veins full again with youth
8. And wash with an immortal water age?

9. When I do ask white Age, he saith not so, --
10. "My head hangs weighed with snow."
11. And when I hearken to the Earth she saith
12. My fiery heart sinks aching.  It is death.
13. Mine ancient scars shall not be glorified
14. Nor my titanic tears the seas be dried."
