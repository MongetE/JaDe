1. If ever I dreamed of my dead name
2. High in the heart of London, unsurpassed
3. By Time for ever, and the Fugitive, Fame,
4. There seeking a long sanctuary at last,

5. I better that; and recollect with shame
6. How once I longed to hide it from life's heats
7. Under those holy cypresses, the same
8. That shade always the quiet place of Keats,

9. Now rather thank I God there is no risk
10. Of gravers scoring it with florid screed,
11. But let my death be memoried on this disc.
12. Wear it, sweet friend. Inscribe no date nor deed.
13. But may thy heart-beat kiss it night and day,
14. Until the name grow vague and wear away.
