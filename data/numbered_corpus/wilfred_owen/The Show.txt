1. My soul looked down from a vague height with Death,
2. As unremembering how I rose or why,
3. And saw a sad land, weak with sweats of dearth,
4. Gray, cratered like the moon with hollow woe,
5. And fitted with great pocks and scabs of plaques.

6. Across its beard, that horror of harsh wire,
7. There moved thin caterpillars, slowly uncoiled.
8. It seemed they pushed themselves to be as plugs
9. Of ditches, where they writhed and shrivelled, killed.

10. By them had slimy paths been trailed and scraped
11. Round myriad warts that might be little hills.

12. From gloom's last dregs these long-strung creatures crept,
13. And vanished out of dawn down hidden holes.

14. (And smell came up from those foul openings
15. As out of mouths, or deep wounds deepening.)

16. On dithering feet upgathered, more and more,
17. Brown strings towards strings of gray, with bristling spines,
18. All migrants from green fields, intent on mire.

19. Those that were gray, of more abundant spawns,
20. Ramped on the rest and ate them and were eaten.

21. I saw their bitten backs curve, loop, and straighten,
22. I watched those agonies curl, lift, and flatten.

23. Whereat, in terror what that sight might mean,
24. I reeled and shivered earthward like a feather.

25. And Death fell with me, like a deepening moan.
26. And He, picking a manner of worm, which half had hid
27. Its bruises in the earth, but crawled no further,
28. Showed me its feet, the feet of many men,
29. And the fresh-severed head of it, my head.
