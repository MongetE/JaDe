1. His face was charged with beauty as a cloud
2. With glimmering lightning. When it shadowed me
3. I shook, and was uneasy as a tree
4. That draws the brilliant danger, tremulous, bowed.


5. So must I tempt that face to loose its lightning.
6. Great gods, whose beauty is death, will laugh above,
7. Who made his beauty lovelier than love.
8. I shall be bright with their unearthly brightening.


9. And happier were it if my sap consume;
10. Glorious will shine the opening of my heart;
11. The land shall freshen that was under gloom;
12. What matter if all men cry aloud and start,
13. And women hide bleak faces in their shawl,
14. At those hilarious thunders of my fall?
