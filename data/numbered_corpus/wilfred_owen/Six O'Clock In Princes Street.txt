1. In twos and threes, they have not far to roam,
2. Crowds that thread eastward, gay of eyes;
3. Those seek no further than their quiet home,
4. Wives, walking westward, slow and wise.

5. Neither should I go fooling over clouds,
6. Following gleams unsafe, untrue,
7. And tiring after beauty through star-crowds,
8. Dared I go side by side with you;

9. Or be you in the gutter where you stand,
10. Pale rain-flawed phantom of the place,
11. With news of all the nations in your hand,
12. And all their sorrows in your face.
