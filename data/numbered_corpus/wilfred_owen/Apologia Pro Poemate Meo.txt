1. I, too, saw God through mud--
2. The mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled.
3. War brought more glory to their eyes than blood,
4. And gave their laughs more glee than shakes a child.

5. Merry it was to laugh there--
6. Where death becomes absurd and life absurder.
7. For power was on us as we slashed bones bare
8. Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder.

9. I, too, have dropped off fear--
10. Behind the barrage, dead as my platoon,
11. And sailed my spirit surging, light and clear,
12. Past the entanglement where hopes lie strewn;

13. And witnessed exhultation--
14. Faces that used to curse me, scowl for scowl,
15. Shine and lift up with passion of oblation,
16. Seraphic for an hour, though they were foul.

17. I have made fellowships--
18. Untold of happy lovers in old song.
19. For love is not the binding of fair lips
20. With the soft silk of eyes that look and long.

21. By joy, whose ribbon slips,--
22. But wound with war's hard wire whose stakes are strong;
23. Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
24. Knit in the welding of the rifle-thong.

25. I have perceived much beauty
26. In the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight;
27. Heard music in the silentness of duty;
28. Found peace where shell-storms spouted reddest spate.

29. Nevertheless, except you share
30. With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell,
31. Whose world is but a trembling of a flare
32. And heaven but a highway for a shell,

33. You shall not hear their mirth:
34. You shall not come to think them well content
35. By any jest of mine. These men are worth
36. Your tears: You are not worth their merriment.
