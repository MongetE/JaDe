1. The roads also have their wistful rest,
2. When the weathercocks perch still and roost,
3. And the looks of men turn kind to clocks
4. And the trams go empty to their drome.
5. The streets also dream their dream.

6. The old houses muse of the old days
7. And their fond trees leaning on them doze.
8. On their steps chatter and clatter stops
9. For the cries of other times hold men
10. And they hear the unknown moan.

11. They remember alien ardours and far futures
12. And the smiles not seen in happy features.
13. Their begetters call them from the gutters;
14. In the gardens unborn child-souls wail,
15. And the dead scribble on walls.

16. Though their own child cry for them in tears,
17. Women weep but hear no sound upstairs.
18. They believe in love they had not lived
19. And passion past the reach of stairs
20. To the world's towers or stars.
