1. 1 Let the boy try along this bayonet-blade
2. 2 How cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood;
3. 3 Blue with all malice, like a madman's flash;
4. 4 And thinly drawn with famishing for flesh.

5. 5 Lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-heads
6. 6 Which long to muzzle in the hearts of lads.
7. 7 Or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth,
8. 8 Sharp with the sharpness of grief and death.

9. 9 For his teeth seem for laughing round an apple.
10. 10 There lurk no claws behind his fingers supple;
11. 11 And God will grow no talons at his heels,
12. 12 Nor antlers through the thickness of his curls.
