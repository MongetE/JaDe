1. Sing me at morn but only with your laugh;
2. Even as Spring that laugheth into leaf;
3. Even as Love that laugheth after Life.


4. Sing me but only with your speech all day,
5. As voluble leaflets do; let viols die;
6. The least word of your lips is melody!


7. Sing me at eve but only your sigh!
8. Like lifting seas it solaceth; breathe so,
9. Slowly and low, the sense that no songs say.


10. Sing me at midnight with your murmurous heart!
11. Let youth's immortal-moaning chord be heard
12. Throbbing through you, and sobbing, unsubdued.
