1. The flame-red moon, the harvest moon,
2. Rolls along the hills, gently bouncing,
3. A vast balloon,
4. Till it takes off, and sinks upward
5. To lie on the bottom of the sky, like a gold doubloon.
6. The harvest moon has come,
7. Booming softly through heaven, like a bassoon.
8. And the earth replies all night, like a deep drum.

9. So people can't sleep,
10. So they go out where elms and oak trees keep
11. A kneeling vigil, in a religious hush.
12. The harvest moon has come!

13. And all the moonlit cows and all the sheep
14. Stare up at her petrified, while she swells
15. Filling heaven, as if red hot, and sailing
16. Closer and closer like the end of the world.

17. Till the gold fields of stiff wheat
18. Cry `We are ripe, reap us!' and the rivers
19. Sweat from the melting hills.
