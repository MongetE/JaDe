1. He loved her and she loved him. 
2. His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to 
3. He had no other appetite 
4. She bit him she gnawed him she sucked 
5. She wanted him complete inside her 
6. Safe and sure forever and ever 
7. Their little cries fluttered into the curtains 

8. Her eyes wanted nothing to get away 
9. Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows 
10. He gripped her hard so that life 
11. Should not drag her from that moment 
12. He wanted all future to cease 
13. He wanted to topple with his arms round her 
14. Off that moment's brink and into nothing 
15. Or everlasting or whatever there was 

16. Her embrace was an immense press 
17. To print him into her bones 
18. His smiles were the garrets of a fairy palace 
19. Where the real world would never come 
20. Her smiles were spider bites 
21. So he would lie still till she felt hungry 
22. His words were occupying armies 
23. Her laughs were an assassin's attempts 
24. His looks were bullets daggers of revenge 
25. His glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets 
26. His whispers were whips and jackboots 
27. Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing 
28. His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway 
29. Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks 
30. And their deep cries crawled over the floors 
31. Like an animal dragging a great trap 
32. His promises were the surgeon's gag 
33. Her promises took the top off his skull 
34. She would get a brooch made of it 
35. His vows pulled out all her sinews 
36. He showed her how to make a love-knot 
37. Her vows put his eyes in formalin 
38. At the back of her secret drawer 
39. Their screams stuck in the wall 

40. Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves 
41. Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop 

42. In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs 
43. In their dreams their brains took each other hostage 

44. In the morning they wore each other's face
