1. Stirs its ashes and embers, its burnt sticks

2. An eye powdered over, half melted and solid again
3. Ponders
4. Ideas that collapse
5. At the first touch of attention

6. The light at the window, so square and so same
7. So full-strong as ever, the window frame
8. A scaffold in space, for eyes to lean on

9. Supporting the body, shaped to its old work
10. Making small movements in gray air
11. Numbed from the blurred accident
12. Of having lived, the fatal, real injury
13. Under the amnesia

14. Something tries to save itself-searches
15. For defenses-but words evade
16. Like flies with their own notions

17. Old age slowly gets dressed
18. Heavily dosed with death's night
19. Sits on the bed's edge

20. Pulls its pieces together
21. Loosely tucks in its shirt
