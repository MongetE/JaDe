1. The grass is happy
2. To run like the sea, to be glossed like a mink’s fur
3. By polishing wind.
4. Her heart is the weather.
5. She loves nobody
6. Least of all the farmer who leans on the gate.

7. The grass is happy
8. When the June sun roasts the foxgloves in the hedges.
9. She comes into her flower.
10. She lifts her skirts.
11. It does not concern her
12. The pondering farmer has begun to hope.

13. The grass is happy to open her scents, like a dress, through the county,
14. Drugging light heartsTo heavy betrothals 
15. And next April’s fools,
16. While pensioners puzzle where life went so airily.

17. The grass is happy
18. When the spinner tumbles her, she silvers and she sweetens
19. Plain as a castle.
20. The hare looks for home
21. And the dusty farmer
22. For a hand-shaped cloud and a yellow evening.

23. Happy the grass
24. To be wooed by the farmer, who wins her and brings her to church in her beauty,
25. Bride of the Island.
26. Luckless the long-drawn
27. Aeons of Eden
28. Before he came to mow.
