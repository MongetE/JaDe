1. Freezing dusk is closing
2.     Like a slow trap of steel
3. On trees and roads and hills and all
4.     That can no longer feel.
5.         But the carp is in its depth
6.           Like a planet in its heaven.
7.         And the badger in its bedding
8.           Like a loaf in the oven.
9.         And the butterfly in its mummy
10.           Like a viol in its case.
11.         And the owl in its feathers
12.           Like a doll in its lace. 

13. Freezing dusk has tightened
14.     Like a nut screwed tight
15. On the starry aeroplane
16.     Of the soaring night.
17.         But the trout is in its hole
18.           Like a chuckle in a sleeper.
19.         The hare strays down the highway
20.           Like a root going deeper.
21.         The snail is dry in the outhouse
22.           Like a seed in a sunflower.
23.         The owl is pale on the gatepost
24.           Like a clock on its tower. 

25. Moonlight freezes the shaggy world
26.     Like a mammoth of ice - 
27. The past and the future
28.     Are the jaws of a steel vice.
29.         But the cod is in the tide-rip
30.           Like a key in a purse.
31.         The deer are on the bare-blown hill
32.           Like smiles on a nurse.
33.         The flies are behind the plaster
34.           Like the lost score of a jig.
35.         Sparrows are in the ivy-clump
36.           Like money in a pig. 

37. Such a frost
38.     The flimsy moon
39.         Has lost her wits. 

40.           A star falls. 

41. The sweating farmers
42.     Turn in their sleep
43.         Like oxen on spits.
