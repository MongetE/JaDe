1. Against the rubber tongues of cows and the hoeing hands of men
2. Thistles spike the summer air
3. And crackle open under a blue-black pressure.

4. Every one a revengeful burst
5. Of resurrection, a grasped fistful
6. Of splintered weapons and Icelandic frost thrust up

7. From the underground stain of a decayed Viking.
8. They are like pale hair and the gutturals of dialects.
9. Every one manages a plume of blood.

10. Then they grow grey like men.
11. Mown down, it is a feud. Their sons appear
12. Stiff with weapons, fighting back over the same ground.
