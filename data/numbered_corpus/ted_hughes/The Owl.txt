1. I saw my world again through your eyes
2. As I would see it again through your children's eyes.
3. Through your eyes it was foreign.
4. Plain hedge hawthorns were peculiar aliens,
5. A mystery of peculiar lore and doings.
6. Anything wild, on legs, in your eyes
7. Emerged at a point of exclamation
8. As if it had appeared to dinner guests
9. In the middle of the table. Common mallards
10. Were artefacts of some unearthliness,
11. Their wooings were a hypnagogic film
12. Unreeled by the river. Impossible
13. To comprehend the comfort of their feet
14. In the freezing water. You were a camera
15. Recording reflections you could not fathom.
16. I made my world perform its utmost for you.
17. You took it all in with an incredulous joy
18. Like a mother handed her new baby
19. By the midwife. Your frenzy made me giddy.
20. It woke up my dumb, ecstatic boyhood
21. Of fifteen years before. My masterpiece
22. Came that black night on the Grantchester road.
23. I sucked the throaty thin woe of a rabbit
24. Out of my wetted knuckle, by a copse
25. Where a tawny owl was enquiring.
26. Suddenly it swooped up, splaying its pinions
27. Into my face, taking me for a post.
