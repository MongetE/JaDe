1. What am I? Nosing here, turning leaves over
2. Following a faint stain on the air to the river's edge
3. I enter water. Who am I to split
4. The glassy grain of water looking upward I see the bed
5. Of the river above me upside down very clear
6. What am I doing here in mid-air? Why do I find
7. this frog so interesting as I inspect its most secret
8. interior and make it my own? Do these weeds
9. know me and name me to each other have they
10. seen me before do I fit in their world? I seem
11. separate from the ground and not rooted but dropped
12. out of nothing casually I've no threads
13. fastening me to anything I can go anywhere
14. I seem to have been given the freedom
15. of this place what am I then? And picking
16. bits of bark off this rotten stump gives me
17. no pleasure and it's no use so why do I do it
18. me and doing that have coincided very queerly
19. But what shall I be called am I the first
20. have I an owner what shape am I what
21. shape am I am I huge if I go
22. to the end on this way past these trees and past these trees
23. till I get tired that's touching one wall of me
24. for the moment if I sit still how everything
25. stops to watch me I suppose I am the exact centre
26. but there's all this what is it roots
27. roots roots roots and here's the water
28. again very queer but I'll go on looking
