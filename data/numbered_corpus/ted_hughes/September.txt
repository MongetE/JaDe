1. We sit late, watching the dark slowly unfold:
2. No clock counts this.
3. When kisses are repeated and the arms hold 
4. There is no telling where time is.

5. It is midsummer: the leaves hang big and still:
6. Behind the eye a star,
7. Under the silk of the wrist a sea, tell
8. Time is nowhere.

9. We stand; leaves have not timed the summer.
10. No clock now needs
11. Tell we have only what we remember:
12. Minutes uproaring with our heads

13. Like an unfortunate King's and his Queen's 
14. When the senseless mob rules;
15. And quietly the trees casting their crowns
16. Into the pools.
