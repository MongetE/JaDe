1. Baled hay out in a field
2. Five miles from home.Barometer falling.
3. A muffler of still cloud padding the stillness.
4. The day after day of blue scorch up to yesterday,
5. The heavens of dazzling iron, that seemed unalterable,
6. Hard now to remember.

7. Now, tractor bounding along lanes, among echoes,
8. The trailer bouncing, all its iron shouting
9. Under sag-heavy leaves
10. That seem ready to drip with stillness.
11. Cheek in the air alert for the first speck.

12. You feel sure the rain's already started---
13. But for the tractor's din you'd hear it hushing
14. In all the leaves. But still not one drop
15. On your face or arm. You can't believe it.
16. Then hoicking bales, as if at a contest. Leaping
17. On and off the tractor as at a rodeo.

18. Hurling the bales higher. The loader on top
19. Dodging like a monkey. The fifth layer full
20. Then a teetering sixth. Then for a seventh
21. A row down the middle. And if a bale topples
22. You feel you've lost those seconds forever.
23. Then roping it all tight, like a hard loaf.

24. Then fast as you dare, watching the sky
25. And watching the load, and feeling the air darken
26. With wet electricity,
27. The load foaming through leaves, and wallowing

28. Like a tug-boat meeting the open sea---
29. The tractor's front wheels rearing up, as you race,
30. And pawing the air. Then all hands
31. Pitching the bales off, in under a roof,
32. Anyhow, then back for the last load.

33. And now as you dash through the green light
34. You see between dark trees
35. On all the little emerald hills
36. The desperate loading, under the blue cloud.

37. Your sweat tracks through your dust, your shirt flaps chill,
38. And bales multiply out of each other
39. All down the shorn field ahead.
40. The faster you fling them up, the more there are of them---
41. Till suddenly the field's grey empty.

42. It's finished. And a tobacco reek breaks in your nostrils
43. As the rain begins
44. Softly and vertically silver, the whole sky softly
45. Falling into the stubble all round you

46. The trees shake out their masses, joyful,
47. Drinking the downpour.
48. The hills pearled, the whole distance drinking
49. And the earth-smell warm and thick as smoke

50. And you go, and over the whole land
51. Like singing heard across evening water
52. The tall loads are swaying towards their barns
53. Down the deep lanes.
