1. The wind is inside the hill.
2. The wood is a struggle---like a wood
3. Struggling through a wood.
4. A panic Only just holds off---every gust
5. Breaches the sky-walls and it seems, this time,
6. The whole sea of air will pour through,
7. The thunder will take deep hold, roots
8. Will have to come out, every loose thing
9. Will have to lift and go. And the cows, dark lumps of dusk
10. Stand waiting, like nails in a tin roof.
11. For the crucial moment, taking the strain
12. In their stirring stillness. As if their hooves
13. Held their field in place, held the hill
14. To its trembling shape. Night-thickness
15. Purples in the turmoil, making
16. Everything more alarming. Unidentifiable, tiny
17. Birds go past like elf-bolts.
18. Battling the hay-bales from me, the cows
19. Jostle and crush, like hulls blown from their moorings
20. And piling at the jetty. The wind
21. Has got inside their wintry buffalo skins,
22. Their wild woolly bulk-heads, their fierce, joyful breathings
23. And the reckless strength of their necks.
24. What do they care, their hooves
25. Are knee-deep in porage of earth---
26. The hay blows luminous tatters from their chewings,
27. A fiery loss, frittering downwind,
28. Snatched away over the near edge
29. Where the world becomes water
30. Thundering like a flood-river at night.
31. They grunt happily, half-dissolved
32. On their steep, hurtling brink, as I flounder back
33. Towards headlights.
