1. She gives him his eyes, she found them
2. Among some rubble, among some beetles

3. He gives her her skin
4. He just seemed to pull it down out of the air and lay it over her
5. She weeps with fearfulness and astonishment

6. She has found his hands for him, and fitted them freshly at the wrists
7. They are amazed at themselves, they go feeling all over her

8. He has assembled her spine, he cleaned each piece carefully
9. And sets them in perfect order
10. A superhuman puzzle but he is inspired
11. She leans back twisting this way and that, using it and laughing
12. Incredulous

13. Now she has brought his feet, she is connecting them
14. So that his whole body lights up

15. And he has fashioned her new hips
16. With all fittings complete and with newly wound coils, all shiningly oiled
17. He is polishing every part, he himself can hardly believe it

18. They keep taking each other to the sun, they find they can easily
19. To test each new thing at each new step

20. And now she smoothes over him the plates of his skull
21. So that the joints are invisible

22. And now he connects her throat, her breasts and the pit of her stomach
23. With a single wire

24. She gives him his teeth, tying the the roots to the centrepin of his body

25. He sets the little circlets on her fingertips

26. She stitches his body here and there with steely purple silk

27. He oils the delicate cogs of her mouth

28. She inlays with deep cut scrolls the nape of his neck

29. He sinks into place the inside of her thighs

30. So, gasping with joy, with cries of wonderment
31. Like two gods of mud
32. Sprawling in the dirt, but with infinite care
33. They bring each other to perfection.
