1. Once upon a time there was a person
2. He was walking along
3. He met the full burning moon
4. Rolling slowly twoards him
5. Crushing the stones and houses by the wayside.
6. She shut his eyes from the glare.
7. He drew his dagger
8. And stabbed and stabbed and stabbed.
9. The cry that quit the moon's wounds
10. Circled the earth.
11. The moon shrank, like a punctured airship,
12. Shrank, shrank, smaller, smaller,
13. Till it was nothing
14. But a silk handkerchief, torn,
15. And wet as tears.
16. The person picked it up. He walked on
17. Into moonless night
18. Carrying his strange trophy.
