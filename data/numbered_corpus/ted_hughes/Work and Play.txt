1. The swallow of summer, she toils all the summer,
2. A blue-dark knot of glittering voltage,
3. A whiplash swimmer, a fish of the air.
4.           But the serpent of cars that crawls through the dust
5.           In shimmering exhaust
6.           Searching to slake
7.           Its fever in ocean
8.           Will play and be idle or else it will bust. 

9. The swallow of summer, the barbed harpoon,
10. She flings from the furnace, a rainbow of purples,
11. Dips her glow in the pond and is perfect.
12.           But the serpent of cars that collapsed on the beach
13.           Disgorges its organs
14.           A scamper of colours
15.           Which roll like tomatoes
16.           Nude as tomatoes
17.           With sand in their creases
18.           To cringe in the sparkle of rollers and screech. 

19. The swallow of summer, the seamstress of summer,
20. She scissors the blue into shapes and she sews it,
21. She draws a long thread and she knots it at the corners.
22.           But the holiday people
23.           Are laid out like wounded
24.           Flat as in ovens
25.           Roasting and basting
26.           With faces of torment as space burns them blue
27.           Their heads are transistors
28.           Their teeth grit on sand grains
29.           Their lost kids are squalling
30.           While man-eating flies
31.           Jab electric shock needles but what can they do? 

32. They can climb in their cars with raw bodies, raw faces
33.           And start up the serpent
34.           And headache it homeward
35.           A car full of squabbles
36.           And sobbing and stickiness
37.           With sand in their crannies
38.           Inhaling petroleum
39.           That pours from the foxgloves
40.           While the evening swallow
41. The swallow of summer, cartwheeling through crimson,
42. Touches the honey-slow river and turning
43. Returns to the hand stretched from under the eaves -
44. A boomerang of rejoicing shadow.
