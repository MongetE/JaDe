1. I imagine this midnight moment's forest:
2. Something else is alive
3. Beside the clock's loneliness
4. And this blank page where my fingers move.
5. Through the window I see no star:
6. Something more near
7. Though deeper within darkness
8. Is entering the loneliness:
9. Cold, delicately as the dark snow
10. A fox's nose touches twig, leaf;
11. Two eyes serve a movement, that now
12. And again now, and now, and now
13. Sets neat prints into the snow
14. Between trees, and warily a lame
15. Shadow lags by stump and in hollow
16. Of a body that is bold to come
17. Across clearings, an eye,
18. A widening deepening greenness,
19. Brilliantly, concentratedly,
20. Coming about its own business
21. Till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox
22. It enters the dark hole of the head.
23. The window is starless still; the clock ticks,
24. The page is printed.
