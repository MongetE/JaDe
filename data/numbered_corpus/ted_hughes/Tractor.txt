1. The tractor stands frozen - an agony
2. To think of. All night
3. Snow packed its open entrails. Now a head-pincering gale,
4. A spill of molten ice, smoking snow,
5. Pours into its steel.
6. At white heat of numbness it stands
7. In the aimed hosing of ground-level fieriness. 

8. It defied flesh and won't start.
9. Hands are like wounds already
10. Inside armour gloves, and feet are unbelievable
11. As if the toe-nails were all just torn off.
12. I stare at it in hatred. Beyond it
13. The copse hisses - capitulates miserably
14. In the fleeing, failing light. Starlings,
15. A dirtier sleetier snow, blow smokily, unendingly, over
16. Towards plantations Eastward.
17. All the time the tractor is sinking
18. Through the degrees, deepening
19. Into its hell of ice. 

20. The starting lever
21. Cracks its action, like a snapping knuckle.
22. The battery is alive - but like a lamb
23. Trying to nudge its solid-frozen mother -
24. While the seat claims my buttock-bones, bites
25. With the space-cold of earth, which it has joined
26. In one solid lump. 

27. I squirt commercial sure-fire
28. Down the black throat - it just coughs.
29. It ridicules me - a trap of iron stupidity
30. I've stepped into. I drive the battery
31. As if I were hammering and hammering
32. The frozen arrangement to pieces with a hammer
33. And it jabbers laughing pain-crying mockingly
34. Into happy life. 

35. And stands
36. Shuddering itself full of heat, seeming to enlarge slowly
37. Like a demon demonstrating
38. A more-than-usually-complete materialization -
39. Suddenly it jerks from its solidarity
40. With the concrete, and lurches towards a stanchion
41. Bursting with superhuman well-being and abandon
42. Shouting Where Where? 

43. Worse iron is waiting. Power-lift kneels
44. Levers awake imprisoned deadweight,
45. Shackle-pins bedded in cast-iron cow-shit.
46. The blind and vibrating condemned obedience
47. Of iron to the cruelty of iron,
48. Wheels screeched out of their night-locks - 

49. Fingers
50. Among the tormented
51. Tonnage and burning of iron 

52. Eyes
53. Weeping in the wind of chloroform 

54. And the tractor, streaming with sweat,
55. Raging and trembling and rejoicing.
