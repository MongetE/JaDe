1. Looking at cows in their high-roofy roomy
2. Windy home, mid-afternoon idling,
3. Late winter, near spring, the fields not greening,
4. The wind North-East and sickening, the hay
5. Shrinking, the year growing. The parapets
6. Of toppled hay, the broken walls of hay,
7. The debris of hay. The peace of cattle
8. Mid-afternoon, cud-munching, eyelids lowered.
9. The deep platform of dung. Looking at cows
10. Sharing their trance, it was an anomalous
11. Blue plastic apron I noticed
12. Hitched under the tail of one cow
13. That went on munching, with angling ears. A glistening
14. Hanging sheet of blue-black. I thought
15. Of aprons over ewes' back-ends
16. To keep the ram out till it's timely. I thought
17. Of surgical aprons to keep cleanliness
18. Under the shit-fall. Crazily far thoughts
19. Proposed themselves as natural, and I almost
20. Looked away. Suddenly
21. The apron slithered, and a whole calf's
22. Buttocks and hind-legs---whose head and forefeet
23. Had been hidden from me by another cow---
24. Toppled out of its mother, and collapsed on the ground.
25. Leisurely, as she might be leisurely curious,
26. She turned, pulling her streamers of blood-tissue
27. Away from this lumpish jetsam. She nosed it
28. Where it lay like a still-birth in its tissues.
29. She began to nibble and lick. The jelly
30. Shook its head and nosed the air. She gave it
31. The short small swallowed moo-grunts hungry cows
32. Give when they stand suddenly among plenty.
