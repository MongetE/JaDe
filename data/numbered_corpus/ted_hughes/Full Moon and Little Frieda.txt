1. A cool small evening shrunk to a dog bark and the clank of a bucket -
2. And you listening.
3. A spider's web, tense for the dew's touch.
4. A pail lifted, still and brimming - mirror
5. To tempt a first star to a tremor.

6. Cows are going home in the lane there, looping the hedges with their warm
7. wreaths of breath -
8. A dark river of blood, many boulders,
9. Balancing unspilled milk.
10. 'Moon!' you cry suddenly, 'Moon! Â Moon!'

11. The moon has stepped back like an artist gazing amazed at a work
12. That points at him amazed.
