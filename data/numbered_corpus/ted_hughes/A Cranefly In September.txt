1. She is struggling through grass-mesh - not flying,
2. Her wide-winged, stiff, weightless basket-work of limbs
3. Rocking, like an antique wain, a top-heavy ceremonial cart
4. Across mountain summits
5. (Not planing over water, dipping her tail)
6. But blundering with long strides, long reachings, reelings
7. And ginger-glistening wings
8. From collision to collision.
9. Aimless in no particular direction,
10. Just exerting her last to escape out of the overwhelming
11. Of whatever it is, legs, grass,
12. The garden, the county, the country, the world -

13. Sometimes she rests long minutes in the grass forest
14. Like a fairytale hero, only a marvel can help her.
15. She cannot fathom the mystery of this forest
16. In which, for instance, this giant watches -
17. The giant who knows she cannot be helped in any way.

18. Her jointed bamboo fuselage,
19. Her lobster shoulders, and her face
20. Like a pinhead dragon, with its tender moustache,
21. And the simple colourless church windows of her wings
22. Will come to an end, in mid-search, quite soon.
23. Everything about her, every perfected vestment
24. Is already superfluous.
25. The monstrous excess of her legs and curly feet
26. Are a problem beyond her.
27. The calculus of glucose and chitin inadequate
28. To plot her through the infinities of the stems.

29. The frayed apple leaves, the grunting raven, the defunct tractor
30. Sunk in nettles, wait with their multiplications
31. Like other galaxies.
32. The sky's Northward September procession, the vast
33. soft armistice,
34. Like an Empire on the move,
35. Abandons her, tinily embattled
36. With her cumbering limbs and cumbered brain.
