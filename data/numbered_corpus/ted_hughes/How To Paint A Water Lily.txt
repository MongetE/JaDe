1. To Paint a Water Lily

2. A green level of lily leaves
3. Roofs the pond's chamber and paves

4. The flies' furious arena: study
5. These, the two minds of this lady.

6. First observe the air's dragonfly
7. That eats meat, that bullets by

8. Or stands in space to take aim;
9. Others as dangerous comb the hum

10. Under the trees.  There are battle-shouts
11. And death-cries everywhere hereabouts

12. But inaudible, so the eyes praise
13. To see the colours of these flies

14. Rainbow their arcs, spark, or settle
15. Cooling like beads of molten metal

16. Through the spectrum.  Think what worse
17. is the pond-bed's matter of course;

18. Prehistoric bedragoned times
19. Crawl that darkness with Latin names,

20. Have evolved no improvements there,
21. Jaws for heads, the set stare,

22. Ignorant of age as of hour—
23. Now paint the long-necked lily-flower

24. Which, deep in both worlds, can be still
25. As a painting, trembling hardly at all

26. Though the dragonfly alight,
27. Whatever horror nudge her root.
