1. There is no star within the flag
2. That's brighter than its brothers,
3. And when of Michigan I brag,
4. I'm boasting of the others.
5. Just which is which no man can say â€”
6. One star for every state
7. Gleams brightly on our flag to-day,
8. And every one is great.

9. The stars that gem the skies at night
10. May differ in degree,
11. And some are pale and some are bright,
12. But in our flag we see
13. A sky of blue wherein the stars
14. Are equal in design;
15. Each has the radiance of Mars
16. And all are yours and mine.

17. The glory that is Michigan's
18. Is Colorado's too;
19. The same sky Minnesota spans,
20. The same sun warms it through;
21. And all are one beneath the flag,
22. A common hope is ours;
23. Our country is the mountain crag,
24. The valley and its flowers.

25. The land we love lies far away
26. As well as close at hand;
27. He has no vision who would say:
28. This state's my native land.
29. Though sweet the charms he knows the best,
30. Deep down within his heart
31. The farthest east, the farthest west
32. Of him must be a part.

33. There is no star within the flag
34. That's brighter than its brothers;
35. So when of Michigan I brag
36. I'm boasting of the others.
37. We share alike one purpose true;
38. One common end awaits;
39. We must in all we dream or do
40. Remain United States.
