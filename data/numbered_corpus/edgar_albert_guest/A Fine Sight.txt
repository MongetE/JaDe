1. I reckon the finest sight of all
2. That a man can see in this world of ours
3. Ain't the works of art on the gallery wall,
4. Or the red an' white o' the fust spring flowers,
5. Or a hoard o' gold from the yellow mines;
6. But the' sight that'll make ye want t' yell
7. Is t' catch a glimpse o' the fust pink signs
8. In yer baby's cheek, that she's gittin' well.

9. When ye see the pink jes' a-creepin' back
10. T' the pale, drawn cheek, an' ye note a smile,
11. Then th' cords o' yer heart that were tight, grow slack
12. An' ye jump fer joy every little while,
13. An' ye tiptoe back to her little bed
14. As though ye doubted yer eyes, or were
15. Afraid it was fever come back instead,
16. An' ye found that th' pink still blossomed there.

17. Ye've watched fer that smile an' that bit o' bloom
18. With a heavy heart fer weeks an' weeks;
19. An' a castle o' joy becomes that room
20. When ye glimpse th' pink 'in yer baby's cheeks.
21. An' out o' yer breast flies a weight o' care,
22. An' ye're lifted up by some magic spell,
23. An' yer heart jes' naturally beats a prayer
24. O' joy to the Lord 'cause she's gittin' well.
