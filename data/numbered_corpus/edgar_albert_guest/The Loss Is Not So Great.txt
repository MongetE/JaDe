1. It is better as it is: I have failed but I can sleep;
2. Though the pit I now am in is very dark and deep
3. I can walk to-morrow's streets and can meet to-morrow's men
4. Unashamed to face their gaze as I go to work again.

5. I have lost the hope I had; in the dust are all my dreams,
6. But my loss is not so great or so dreadful as it seems;
7. I made my fight and though I failed I need not slink away
8. For I do not have to fear what another man may say.

9. They may call me over-bold, they may say that I was frail;
10. They may tell I dared too much and was doomed at last to fail;
11. They may talk my battle o'er and discuss it as they choose,
12. But I did no brother wrong- I'm the only one to lose.

13. It is better as it is: I have kept my self-respect.
14. I can walk to-morrow's streets meeting all men head erect.
15. No man can charge his loss to a pledge I did not keep;
16. I have no shame to regret: I have failed, but I can sleep.
