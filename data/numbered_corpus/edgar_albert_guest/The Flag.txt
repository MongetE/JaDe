1. We never knew how much the Flag
2. Could mean, until he went away,
3. We used to boast of it and brag,
4. As something of a by-gone day;
5. But now the Flag can start our tears
6. In moments of our greatest joy,
7. Old Glory in the sky appears
8. The symbol of our little boy.

9. We knew that sometimes people wept
10. To see the Flag go waving by,
11. But never guessed the griefs they keptâ€”
12. We never understood just why.
13. But now our eyes grow quickly dim,
14. Our voices choke with sobs to-day;
15. The Flag is telling us of him,
16. Our little boy who's gone away.

17. We never knew the Flag could be
18. So much a part of human life,
19. We thought it beautiful to see
20. Before these bitter days of strife;
21. But now more beautiful it gleams,
22. And deeper in our hearts it dwells;
23. It is the emblem of our dreams,
24. For of our little boy it tells.
