1. YOURS is the loser's part to play,
2. For you the goal is far away
3. And never to be gained.
4. It is your lot to stand and see
5. The golden apples on life's tree
6. By some one else attained;
7. To view with yearning in your eyes
8. Another grasp the precious prize.

9. It is for you to wade through fire,
10. To feel the burning of desire
11. And want unsatisfied;
12. And from the sleepless hours of night
13. You rise at morn, once more to fight
14. With victory denied;
15. Spurred on by hope that never dies,
16. You struggle ever toward the prize.

17. A failure? Yes, as glory goes,
18. Yet braver in the end than those
19. Who life's great battles win;
20. For you return at break of day
21. With courage to renew the fray,
22. And with a lifted chin
23. You strive once more to reach the goal,
24. And ground your bark upon a shoal.

25. But when earth's story shall be told,
26. And God's great purpose we behold
27. With eyes new-born to see;
28. When we have passed beyond the pale
29. Of earth, and torn aside the veil
30. Of death's great mystery,
31. As souls victorious you'll stand
32. And God's great prizes you'll command.
