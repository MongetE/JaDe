1. Here we are, Britain! the finest and best of us
2. Taking our coats off and rolling our sleeves,
3. Answering the thoughtless that once made a jest of us,
4. Each man a soldier for what he believes.
5. Here we are, tight little island, in unity!
6. Tell us the job that you want us to do!
7. You can depend on us all with impunity.
8. Give us a task and we'll all see it through.

9. Here we are, France! every Yankee born man of us
10. Coming to stand by your side in the fight;
11. Liberty's cause makes a whole-hearted clan of us.
12. Here we are, willing to die for the right.
13. Silently, long from our shores we've admired you,
14. Secretly proud of the pluck you've displayed.
15. Brothers we are of the love that inspired you;
16. Now we are coming, full front, to your aid.

17. Here we are, Allies! make room in your trenches!
18. Shoulder to shoulder we'll share in each drive.
19. Here we are! quitting our lathes and our benches,
20. Bringing our best that our best shall survive.
21. Here we are! Liberty's children, red-blooded,
22. Coming to share in the struggle with you,
23. Ready to die for the Flag that's star-studded;
24. Tell us the work that you want us to do.

25. What is it, fighting or building you're needing?
26. Boring a mountain or bridging a stream,
27. Steel work and real work? Your call we are heeding.
28. Each of us here is a man with a dream.
29. Here we are! tacklers of tough jobs and dangers,
30. Any old post where you put us we'll fit;
31. Coming to serve you as brothers, not strangers;
32. Here we are, Allies! to offer our bit!
