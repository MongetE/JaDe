1. Under the shade of trees,
2. Flat on my back at ease,
3. Lulled by the hum of bees,
4. There's where I rest;
5. Breathing the scented air,
6. Lazily loafing there,
7. Never a thought of care,
8. Peace in my breast.
9. There where the waters run,
10. Laughing along in fun,
11. I go when work is done,
12. There's where I stray;
13. Couch of a downy green,
14. Restful and sweet and clean,
15. Set in a fairy scene,
16. Wondrously gay.
17. Worn out with toil and strife,
18. Sick of the din of life,
19. With pain and sorrow rife,
20. There's where I go;
21. Soothing and sweet I find,
22. Comforts that ease the mind,
23. Leaving dull care behind,
24. Rest there I know.
25. Flat on my back I lie,
26. Watching the ships go by,
27. Under the fleecy sky,
28. Day dreaming there;
29. From grief I find surcease,
30. From worry gain release,
31. Resting in perfect peace,
32. Free from all care.
