1. We were sittin' there,
2. and smokin' of our pipes, discussin' things
3. Like taxes, votes for wimmin,
4. an' the totterin' thrones of kings,
5. When he ups an' strokes his whiskers
6. with his hand an' says to me:
7. 'Changin' laws an' legislatures ain't
8. as fur as I can see,
9. Goin' to make this world much better,
10. unless somehow we can
11. Find a way to make a better an' a finer sort o' man.

12. 'The trouble ain't with statutes or with systemsâ€”
13. not at all;
14. It's with humans jus' like we air
15. an' their petty ways an' small.
16. We could stop our writin' law-books
17. an' our regulatin' rules
18. If a better sort of manhood
19. was the product of our schools.
20. For the things that we air needin'
21. isn't writing' from a pen
22. Or bigger guns to shoot with,
23. but a bigger type of men.

24. 'I reckon all these problems
25. air jest ornery like the weeds,
26. They grow in soil that oughta nourish
27. only decent deeds,
28. An' they waste our time an' fret us when,
29. if we were thinkin' straight
30. An' livin' right,
31. they wouldn't be so terrible and great.
32. A good horse needs no snaffle
33. and a good man, I opine,
34. Doesn't need a law to check him
35. or to force him into line.

36. 'If we ever start in teachin' to our children,
37. year by year,
38. How to live with one another,
39. there'll be less o' trouble here.
40. If we'd teach 'em how to neighbor
41. an' to walk in honor's ways,
42. We could settle every problem
43. which the mind o' man can raise.
44. What we're needin' isn't systems
45. or some regulatin' plan
46. But a bigger an' a finer an' a truer type o' man.'
