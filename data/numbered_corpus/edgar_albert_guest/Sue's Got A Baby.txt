1. Sue's got a baby now, an' she
2. Is like her mother used to be;
3. Her face seems prettier, an' her ways
4. More settled-like. In these few days
5. She's changed completely, an' her smile
6. Has taken on the mother-style.
7. Her voice is sweeter, an' her words
8. Are clear as is the song of birds.
9. She still is Sue, but not the sameâ€”
10. She's different since the baby came.
11. There is a calm upon her face
12. That marks the change that's taken place;
13. It seems as though her eyes now see
14. The wonder things that are to be,
15. An' that her gentle hands now own
16. A gentleness before unknown.
17. Her laughter has a clearer ring
18. Than all the bubbling of a spring,
19. An' in her cheeks love's tender flame
20. Glows brighter since the baby came.
21. I look at her an' I can see
22. Her mother as she used to be.
23. How sweet she was, an' yet how much
24. She sweetened by the magic touch
25. That made her mother! In her face
26. It seemed the angels left a trace
27. Of Heavenly beauty to remain
28. Where once had been the lines of pain
29. An' with the baby in her arms
30. Enriched her with a thousand charms.
31. Sue's got a baby now an' she
32. Is prettier than she used to be.
33. A wondrous change has taken place,
34. A softer beauty marks her face
35. An' in the warmth of her caress
36. There seems the touch of holiness,
37. An' all the charms her mother knew
38. Have blossomed once again in Sue.
39. I sit an' watch her an' I claim
40. My lost joys since her baby came.
