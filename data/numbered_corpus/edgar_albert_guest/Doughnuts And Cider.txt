1. LAST night I single handed fought a gang of murderers that came
2. To get my money or my life, and very nearly did the same;
3. I struggled with them on a cliff, and over it I toppled two,
4. I hit another one a biff that dazed him, but I wasn't through,
5. As fast as one was overpowered another villain forced the fight,
6. Because four doughnuts I devoured and used a cider wash last night.

7. The horse that I was riding ran away with me at furious pace,
8. He tossed me up against a tree, I ploughed a furrow with my face!
9. A farmer's bull was grazing near, and he took up the battle then
10. And landed me upon my ear upon the farmer's cattle pen;
11. An aeroplane came whizzing by, I grabbed at it with all my might,
12. Because four doughnuts that you buy, with cider I washed down last night.

13. A strange and angry beast then came, a creature with a horrid grunt,
14. The way he used me was a shame, he galloped up and down my front;
15. He had the roughest kind of feet that ever I have gazed upon,
16. His breath was hardly fresh and sweet, of nostrils he had only one
17. But that belched fire and brimstone, too; his tusks were long and sharp and white â€”
18. It's awful what doughnuts will do when mixed with cider late at night!
