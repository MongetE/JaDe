1. We've got another mouth to feed,
2. From out our little store;
3. To satisfy another's need
4. Is now my daily chore.
5. A growing family is ours,
6. Beyond the slightest doubt;
7. It takes all my financial powers
8. To keep them looking stout.
9. With us another makes his bow
10. To breakfast, dine and sup;
11. Our little circle's larger now,
12. For Buddy's got a pup.
13. If I am frayed about the heels
14. And both my elbows shine
15. And if my overcoat reveals
16. The poverty that's mine,
17. 'Tis not because I squander gold
18. In folly's reckless way;
19. The cost of foodstuffs, be it told,
20. Takes all my weekly pay.
21. 'Tis putting food on empty plates
22. That eats my wages up;
23. And now another mouth awaits,
24. For Buddy's got a pup.
25. And yet I gladly stand the strain,
26. And count the task worth while,
27. Nor will I dismally complain
28. While Buddy wears a smile.
29. What's one mouth more at any board
30. Though costly be the fare?
31. The poorest of us can afford
32. His frugal meal to share.
33. And so bring on the extra plate,
34. He will not need a cup,
35. And gladly will I pay the freight
36. Now Buddy's got a pup
