2. He shall be loved who ever guards her fame.
3. His worth the starry banner long shall tell,
4. Who loves his land too much to stoop to shame.
5. Who shares the splendor of these sunny skies
6. Has freedom as his birthright, and may know
7. Rich fellowship with comrades brave and wise;
8. Into the realms of manhood he may go.

9. Who writes, 'United States' beside his name
10. Offers a pledge that he himself is true;
11. Gives guarantee that selfishness or shame
12. Shall never mar the work he finds to do.

13. He is received world-wide as one who lives
14. Above the sordid dreams of petty gain,
15. And is reputed as a man who gives
16. His best to others in their hours of pain.

17. This is the heritage of Freedom's soil:
18. High purposes and lofty goals to claim.
19. And he shall be rewarded for his toil
20. Who loves his land too much to stoop to shame.
