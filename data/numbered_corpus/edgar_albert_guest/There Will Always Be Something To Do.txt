1. There will always be something to do, my boy;
2. There will always be wrongs to right;
3. There will always be need for a manly breed
4. And men unafraid to fight.
5. There will always be honor to guard, my boy;
6. There will always be hills to climb,
7. And tasks to do, and battles new
8. From now to the end of time.

9. There will always be dangers to face, my boy;
10. There will always be goals to take;
11. Men shall be tried, when the roads divide,
12. And proved by the choice they make.
13. There will always be burdens to bear, my boy;
14. There will always be need to pray;
15. There will always be tears through the future years,
16. As loved ones are borne away.

17. There will always be God to serve, my boy,
18. And always the Flag above;
19. They shall call to you until life is through
20. For courage and strength and love.
21. So these are things that I dream, my boy,
22. And have dreamed since your life began:
23. That whatever befalls, when the old world calls,
24. It shall find you a sturdy man.
