1. Keep your dreams-they're richer far
2. Than the facts discovered are.
3. Do not seek all things to touch;
4. Do not want to know too much.

5. Growing old, still play the child;
6. Keep some glory undefiled.
7. What if clouds are mist and air?
8. Still see ships sailing there.

9. What would life be if we knew
10. Only those things which are true?
11. If the things of bad and good
12. Were by all men understood.

13. Nature's hills and brooks and springs
14. Would be catalogued as things.
15. Keep your dreams, for in them lies
16. Joy denied to men grown wise.

17. Still build castles in the air!
18. Still see white ships sailing there!
19. Still have something to pursue,
20. Something which you wish you knew.
