1. BEHIND full many a gift there lies
2. A splendid tale of sacrifice.

3. On Christmas morn a mother's hand
4. About a young girl's neck will place
5. A trinket small, and she will stand
6. With radiant smiles upon her face
7. To see her daughter decked in gold,
8. Nor will she think, nor will she care
9. That she may suffer from the cold
10. Because that bauble glistens there.

11. A child will wake on Christmas Day
12. And find his stocking filled with toys;
13. The home will ring with laughter gay,
14. That boy be glad as richer boys.
15. And there a mother fond will sing
16. A song of joy to hear his shout,
17. Forgetting every needed thing
18. That she will have to do without.

19. A heart that's brimming o'er with love
20. Will suffer gladly for a friend,
21. And take no time in thinking of
22. How much it can afford to spend.
23. And suddenly on Christmas morn
24. Will gladness beam from shining eyes,
25. A gladness that alone was born
26. Of someone's willing sacrifice.

27. Let cynics scoff howe'er they will
28. And say but fools such presents give,
29. There'll be such sacrifices till
30. All human love shall cease to live.
31. 'Twould be a dreary world of thrift,
32. Of barren ways, and sunless skies,
33. If no one ever gave a gift
34. That was not born of sacrifice.

35. The brightest gifts that us reward
36. Are those the givers can't afford.
