1. HE died a poor man, so they say,
2. Few were the dollars stored away
3. By him while he lived, and yet
4. His memory I'll not forget.
5. A spendthrift! True, but not for self
6. He scattered thus his hard-earned pelf;
7. Not that he might in splendor roam,
8. But for the ones he loved at home.

9. A spendthrift! That he was for those
10. Who, weeping, watched his eyelids close;
11. For them he toiled, for them he spent
12. His pittance and was well content.
13. The best in life to them he gave,
14. Denied them nothing just to save;
15. For those at home his coin he blew,
16. I would the world more spendthrifts knew.
