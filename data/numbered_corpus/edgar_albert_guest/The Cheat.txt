1. I cheated a good friend yesterday,
2. Kept what was his, and went my way,
3. Wronged him by silence-for in haste
4. I let a glad thought go to waste.

5. I had a word of cheer to speak,
6. To strengthen him when he grew weak,
7. To send him smiling on his way -
8. But what I thought I didn't say.

9. He would have richer been to know
10. That deed of his had pleased me so,
11. But oh, I failed to let him see
12. How much his conquest meant to me.

13. I cheated him of words of praise
14. Which would have cheered his troubled days;
15. In this a faithful friend I wronged,
16. By keeping what to him belonged.

17. The praise was his by right to hear,
18. To him belonged my word of cheer;
19. In silence, though, from him I turned
20. And cheated him of what he'd earned.
