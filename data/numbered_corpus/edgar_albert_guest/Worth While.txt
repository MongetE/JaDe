1. He doesn't care that I'm not rich,
2. Or that I'm poorly dressed,
3. That I'm a toiler in the ditch
4. He hasn't even guessed.
5. My faults that other people know
6. He doesn't even see,
7. For every night with eyes aglow
8. He toddles up to me.
9. Although I'm just a common dub,
10. And ordinary clay,
11. His cheek to mine he's glad to rub
12. Before I go away;
13. And every night when I return,
14. He's glad as he can be,
15. And though but little I may earn
16. He toddles up to me.
17. To come to me he'd leave a king,
18. If one were sitting near,
19. Unto no millionaire he'd cling
20. If only I'd appear.
21. And though but tattered rags are mine
22. When I go home to tea
23. With eyes that fairly beam and shine
24. He'd toddle up to me.

25. And so I've reason to be glad,
26. And reason to rejoice,
27. It's worth the world to be a dad,
28. To be a baby's choice.
29. There is no prize fame can bestow,
30. No joy can ever be
31. So real, as when, with eyes aglow,
32. He toddles up to me.
