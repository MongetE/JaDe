1. Last night I held my arms to you
2. And you held yours to mine
3. And started out to march to me
4. As any soldier fine.
5. You lifted up your little feet
6. And laughingly advanced;
7. And I stood there and gazed upon
8. Your first wee steps, entranced.

9. You gooed and gurgled as you came
10. Without a sign of fear;
11. As though you knew, your journey o'er,
12. I'd greet you with a cheer.
13. And, what is more, you seemed to know,
14. Although you are so small,
15. That I was there, with eager arms,
16. To save you from a fall.
17. Three tiny steps you took, and then,
18. Disaster and dismay!
19. Your over-confidence had led
20. Your little feet astray.
21. You did not see what we could see
22. Nor fear what us alarms;
23. You stumbled, but ere you could fall
24. I caught you in my arms.

25. You little tyke, in days to come
26. You'll bravely walk alone,
27. And you may have to wander paths
28. Where dangers lurk unknown.
29. And, Oh, I pray that then, as now,
30. When accidents befall
31. You'll still remember that I'm near
32. To save you from a fall.
