1. IF I had wealth and I had health,
2. And I 'd a roof above me,
3. If I'd a wife to cheer my life,
4. But not one child to love me,
5. No rosy-lipped young laughing miss,
6. No bright-eyed, roguish laddie,
7. I 'd search the town, both up and down,
8. Till one should call me daddie.

9. I would not have a roof that ne'er
10. Knew sound of childish chatter,
11. Nor keep a floor, unlettered o'er
12. By little feet that patter.
13. Nor would I hang upon my walls
14. Great pictures, just to show them,
15. Unless a tot had left a lot
16. Of finger-marks below them.

17. I would not like to settle down
18. Within my old armchair,
19. And take my ease, with empty knees —
20. I want a youngster there.
21. Likewise with everything I have,
22. How incomplete 't would be,
23. Unless I had a girl or lad
24. To share it all with me.

25. And so I say if I had wealth,
26. And had a roof above me.
27. If I 'd a wife to cheer my life,
28. But had no child to love me,
29. Then I would search both up and down,
30. To beg or buy or borrow,
31. A child to be a part of me —
32. I 'd have one here tomorrow.
