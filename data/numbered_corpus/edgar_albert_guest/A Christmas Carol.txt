1. God bless you all this Christmas Day
2. And drive the cares and griefs away.
3. Oh, may the shining Bethlehem star
4. Which led the wise men from afar
5. Upon your heads, good sirs, still glow
6. To light the path that ye should go.

7. As God once blessed the stable grim
8. And made it radiant for Him;
9. As it was fit to shield His Son,
10. May thy roof be a holy one;
11. May all who come this house to share
12. Rest sweetly in His gracious care.

13. Within thy walls may peace abide,
14. The peace for which the Savior died.
15. Though humble be the rafters here,
16. Above them may the stars shine clear,
17. And in this home thou lovest well
18. May excellence of spirit dwell.

19. God bless you all this Christmas Day;
20. May Bethlehem's star still light thy way
21. And guide thee to the perfect peace
22. When every fear and doubt shall cease.
23. And may thy home such glory know
24. As did the stable long ago.
