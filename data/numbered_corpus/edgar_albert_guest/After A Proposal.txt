1. IS IT so sudden? Then did you believe, dear,
2. Those evenings I called at your flat
3. And lovingly, longingly gazed in your eyes,
4. That I merely had come for a chat?
5. Did it strike you the times that I lingered till twelve
6. And hated to leave you alone,
7. I was doing that merely to fill up my time,
8. Because I 'd no home of my own?

9. So sudden, you say?  Yet for years I have stood
10. On your doorstep each evening at eight.
11. Did you think I had come for a chat with your ma,
12. Or a word with your maiden aunt, Kate?
13. Did you think, when I sighed as I fondled your hand,
14. 'T was dyspepsia that troubled me then?
15. Or that the cigars I bestowed on your dad
16. Were smokes I would give to all men?

17. O, the tickets for shows I have purchased for you,
18. The automobiles I have hired!
19. The lockets and bracelets and purses and things,
20. All gifts that I knew you desired,
21. That I tenderly laid at your feet, as a shrine,
22. Though each cost me a half a week's pay!
23. I thought that my actions betrayed my design,
24. And yet, 'It's so sudden,' you say.
