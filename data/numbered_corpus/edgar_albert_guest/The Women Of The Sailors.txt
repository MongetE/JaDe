1. The women of the sailors, unto them, O God, be kind!
2. They never hear the breaking waves, they never hear the wind
3. But that their hearts are anguish-tossed-, and every thought's a fear,
4. For the women of the sailors it's a bitter time of year.

5. The women of the sailors, unto them, O God, be good!
6. 'Tis they who know and understand how frail are steel and wood;
7. 'Tis they who never see the spray upon a rock-bound coast
8. But what they breathe a prayer to Thee for those that love them most.

9. The women of the sailors, unto them, O God, be nigh!
10. They never hear the hurricane but that it means a sigh;
11. They never hear the tempest but that they pray to
12. Thee For the safety of their loved ones who are battling with the sea.
