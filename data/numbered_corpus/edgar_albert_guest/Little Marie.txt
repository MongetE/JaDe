1. I  REMEMBER the day that you came to me,
2. Little Marie,
3. The nurse brought you out so that I might
4. see
5. Little Marie.
6. Oh, this heart o' mine leapt as I gazed at you
7. And got my first peep at those eyes o' blue,
8. And I kissed your cheek and I hugged you, too,
9. Little Marie.
10. I remember the very first word you spake,
11. Little Marie,
12. The very first steps that you tried to take,
13. Little Marie;
14. I remember the very first bump you got
15. And you came to me and I kissed the spot;
16. Of your bumps and bruises I've cured a lot,
17. Little Marie.

18. The birds in the tree still sing your name,
19. Little Marie;
20. The roses somehow aren't quite the same,
21. Little Marie;
22. And there isn't a nook in the home or yard
23. But what like my battered old heart you've scarred;
24. And we miss you so, and it's oh, so hard!
25. Little Marie.

26. You smiled when I said I was losing you,
27. Little Marie;
28. You said you'd come back in a year or two,
29. Little Marie;
30. And your mother prays, and I say amen,
31. That we'll be grandpa and grandma then,
32. And you will place in our arms again
33. A little Marie.
