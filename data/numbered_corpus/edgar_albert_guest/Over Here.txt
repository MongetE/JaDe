1. Pledged to the bravest and the best,
2. We stand, who cannot share the fray,
3. Staunch for the danger and the test.
4. For them at night we kneel and pray.
5. Be with them, Lord, who serve the truth,
6. And make us worthy of our youth!

7. Here mother-love and father-love
8. Unite in love of country now;
9. Here to the flag that flies above,
10. Our heads we reverently bow;
11. Here as one people, night and day,
12. For victory we work and pray.

13. Nor race nor creed shall difference make,
14. Nor bigot mar the zealot's plan;
15. We give our all for Freedom's sake,
16. Each man a king, each king a man.
17. Make us the equal, Lord, we pray
18. Of them who die for truth to-day!

19. Let us as gladly give our best,
20. Let us as bravely pay the price
21. As they, who in the bitter test
22. Meet the supremest sacrifice.
23. Oh, God! Wherever we are led,
24. Let us be worthy of our dead!

25. Let us not compromise the truth,
26. Let us not cringe so much in fear
27. That foes may whisper to our youth
28. That we have failed in courage here.
29. Lord, strengthen us, that they may know
30. Our spirits follow where they go!
