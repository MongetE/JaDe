1. He has heard his country calling, and has fallen into line,
2. And he's doing something bigger than his daddy ever did;
3. He has caught a greater vision than the finest one of mine,
4. And I know to-day I'm prouder of than sorry for the kid.

5. His speech is soft and vibrant with the messages of truth,
6. And he says some things of duty that I cannot understand;
7. It may be that I'm selfish, but this ending of his youth
8. Is not the dream I cherished and it's not the thing I planned.

9. I only know he's bigger in his uniform to-day
10. Than I, who stand and watch him as he drills, have ever been;
11. That he sees a greater vision of life's purpose far away,
12. And a finer goal to die for than my eyes have ever seen.

13. I wish I felt as he does, wish I had his sense of right;
14. With the vision he possesses I should be supremely glad;
15. But I sometimes start to choking when I think of him at night-
16. The boy that has grown bigger, yes, and better than his dad.
