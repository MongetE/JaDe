1. It's the dull road that leads to the gay road;
2. The practice that leads to success;
3. The work road that leads to the play road;
4. It is trouble that breeds happiness.

5. It's the hard work and merciless grinding
6. That purchases glory and fame;
7. It's repeatedly doing, nor minding
8. The drudgery drear of the game.

9. It's the passing up glamor or pleasure
10. For the sake of the skill we may gain,
11. And in giving up comfort or leisure
12. For the joy that we hope to attain.

13. It's the hard road of trying and learning,
14. Of toiling, uncheered and alone,
15. That wins us the prizes worth earning,
16. And leads us to goals we would own.
