1. IT 'S human for a woman
2. To enjoy a little cry;
3. Though a man will grin and bear 'em
4. And pass little troubles by,
5. A woman seeks a pillow
6. And her face she buries in it,
7. Starts the bitter tears to running,
8. And she's better in a minute.

9. It's human for a woman
10. To expect a lot of fussing,
11. Though a man will greet his fellow
12. Without once his topknot mussing;
13. A woman greets her sister
14. Disarranging gown and hair,
15. Kissing, hugging, squeezing, gurgling,
16. With enthusiasm rare.

17. It's human for a woman
18. Not to know just what she wants,
19. That's the reason she goes shopping
20. And the down-town stores she haunts;
21. Though a man knows just exactly
22. What he wants and goes and gets it,
23. A woman spends time looking,
24. And she never once regrets it.

25. It's human for a woman
26. To enjoy a lettuce sandwich,
27. Though a man wants steak and onions
28. And a cup of 'Mocha and' rich;
29. he must have her lady fingers,
30. Ices, tea and macaroons,
31. And she gets her fun in toying
32. With the solid silver spoons.

33. Man must grin and bear his troubles,
34. Lovely woman always cries,
35. And the man who 'd seek to stop her
36. Does a thing that's most unwise;
37. Let her weep and kiss in greeting,
38. Shop and feed on dainty fare â€”
39. These are human for a woman,
40. They 're her meat and drink and air.
