1. The job will not make you, my boy;
2. The job will not bring you to fame
3. Or riches or honor or joy
4. Or add any weight to your name.
5. You may fail or succeed where you are,
6. May honestly serve or may rob;
7. From the start to the end
8. Your success will depend
9. On just what you make of your job.

10. Don't look on the job as the thing
11. That shall prove what you're able to do;
12. The job does no more than to bring
13. A chance for promotion to you.
14. Men have shirked in high places and won
15. Very justly the jeers of the mob;
16. And you'll find it is true
17. That it's all up to you
18. To say what shall come from the job.

19. The job is an incident small;
20. The thing that's important is man.
21. The job will not help you at all
22. If you won't do the best that you can.
23. It is you that determines your fate,
24. You stand with your hand on the knob
25. Of fame's doorway to-day,
26. And life asks you to say
27. Just what you will make of your job.
