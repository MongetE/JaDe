1. There's nothing cheers a fellow up just like a hearty greeting,
2. A handclasp and an honest smile that flash the joy of meeting;
3. And when at friendly doors you ring, somehow it seems to free you
4. From all life's doubts to hear them say: 'Come in! We're glad to
5. see you!'

6. At first the portal slips ajar in answer to your ringing,
7. And then your eyes meet friendly eyes, and wide the door goes flinging;
8. And something seems to stir the soul, however troubled be you,
9. If but the cheery host exclaims: 'Come in! We're glad to see you!'
