1. OUT in the open, the wide sky above,
2. And the green meadows stretched at my feet;
3. Out in the open, midst scenes that I love,
4. Where the rest hour is soothing and sweet;
5. Out in the country, where nature's at play
6. And the wild Sowers look up with a smile,
7. I am hurrying now for a short holiday,
8. I am going to rest there a while.

9. Into the city, where life isn't dead,
10. An' there's something a feller can do;
11. Where hundreds of people keep forging ahead
12. An' runnin' right plump into you;
13. Where there's hustle an' bustle, an' something to'see,
14. An' you never get lonesome nor blue;
15. I tell you, the city's the fine place to be,
16. An' I 'm goin' when ploughin' is through.
