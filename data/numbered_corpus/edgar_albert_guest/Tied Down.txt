1. 'They tie you down,' a woman said,
2. Whose cheeks should have been flaming red
3. With shame to speak of children so.
4. 'When babies come you cannot go
5. In search of pleasure with your friends,
6. And all your happy wandering ends.
7. The things you like you cannot do,
8. For babies make a slave of you.'

9. I looked at her and said: ''Tis true
10. That children make a slave of you,
11. And tie you down with many a knot,
12. But have you never thought to what
13. It is of happiness and pride
14. That little babies have you tied?
15. Do you not miss the greater joys
16. That come with little girls and boys?

17. 'They tie you down to laughter rare,
18. To hours of smiles and hours of care,
19. To nights of watching and to fears;
20. Sometimes they tie you down to tears
21. And then repay you with a smile,
22. And make your trouble all worth while.
23. They tie you fast to chubby feet,
24. And cheeks of pink and kisses sweet.

25. 'They fasten you with cords of love
26. To God divine, who reigns above.
27. They tie you, whereso'er you roam,
28. Unto the little place called home;
29. And over sea or railroad track
30. They tug at you to bring you back.
31. The happiest people in the town
32. Are those the babies have tied down.

33. 'Oh, go your selfish way and free,
34. But hampered I would rather be,
35. Yes rather than a kingly crown
36. I would be, what you term, tied down;
37. Tied down to dancing eyes and charms,
38. Held fast by chubby, dimpled arms,
39. The fettered slave of girl and boy,
40. And win from them earth's finest joy.'
