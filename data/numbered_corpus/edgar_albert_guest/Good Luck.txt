1. Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you sail across the sea;
2. The best o' luck, in the parting, is the prayer you get from me.
3. May you never meet a danger that you won't come safely through,
4. May you never meet a German that can get the best of you;
5. Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow's at the front,
6. A thousand different mishaps, but here's hoping that they won't.

7. Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you turn away to go,
8. Good luck and plenty of it, may it be your lot to know;
9. May you never meet rough weather, but remember if you do
10. That the folks at home are wishing that you'll all come safely through.
11. Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow bears the brunt
12. Of His Country's fight for glory, but I'm praying that they won't.

13. Good luck! That's all I'm saying as you're falling into line;
14. May the splendour of your service bring you everything that's fine;
15. May the fates deal kindly with you, may you never know distress,
16. And may every task you tackle end triumphant with success.
17. Oh! A thousand things may happen that with joy your life will fill;
18. You may not get all the gladness, but I'm hoping that you will.
