1. I'd like to steal a day and be
2. All alone with little me,
3. Little me that used to run
4. Everywhere in search of fun;
5. Little me of long ago
6. Who was glad and didn't know
7. Life is freighted down with care
8. For the backs of men to bear;
9. Little me who thought a smile
10. Ought to linger all the while-
11. On his Mother's pretty face
12. And a tear should never trace
13. Lines of sorrow, hurt or care
14. On those cheeks so wondrous fair.

15. I should like once more to be
16. All alone with youthful me;
17. Youthful me who saw the hills
18. Where the sun its splendor spills
19. And was certain that in time
20. To the topmost height he'd climb;
21. Youthful me, serene of soul,
22. Who beheld a shining goal.
23. And imagined he could gain
24. Glory without grief or pain,
25. Confident and quick with life,
26. Madly eager for the strife,
27. Knowing not that bitter care
28. Waited for his coming there.

29. I should like to sit alone
30. With the me now older grown,
31. Like to lead the little me
32. And the youth that used to be
33. Once again along the ways
34. Of our glorious yesterdays.
35. We could chuckle soft and low
36. At the things we didn't know,
37. And could laugh to think how bold
38. We had been in days of old,
39. And how blind we were to care
40. With its heartache and despair,
41. We could smile away the tears
42. And the pain of later years.
