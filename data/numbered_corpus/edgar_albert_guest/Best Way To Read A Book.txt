1. Best way to read a book I know
2. Is get a lad of six or so,
3. And curl him up upon my knee
4. Deep in a big arm chair, where we
5. Can catch the warmth of blazing coals,
6. And then let two contented souls
7. Melt into one, old age and youth,
8. Sharing adventure's marvelous truth.

9. I read a page, and then we sit
10. And talk it over, bit by bit;
11. Just how the pirates looked, and why
12. They flung a black flag to the sky.
13. We pass no paragraph without
14. First knowing what it's all about,
15. And when the author starts a fight
16. We join the forces that are right.

17. We're deep in Treasure Island, and
18. From Spy Glass Hill we've viewed the land;
19. Through thickets dense we've followed Jim
20. And shared the doubts that came to him.
21. We've heard Cap. Smollett arguing there
22. With Long John Silver, gaunt and spare,
23. And mastering our many fears
24. We've battled with those buccaneers.

25. Best way to read a book I've found
26. Is have a little boy around
27. And take him up upon your knee;
28. Then talk about the tale, till he
29. Lives it and feels it, just as you,
30. And shares the great adventure, too.
31. Books have a deep and lasting joy
32. For him who reads them to his boy.
