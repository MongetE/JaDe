1. We was speakin' of folks, jes' common folks,
2. An' we come to this conclusion,
3. That wherever they be, on land or sea,
4. They warm to a home allusion;
5. That under the skin an' under the hide
6. There's a spark that starts a-glowin'
7. Whenever they look at a scene or book
8. That something of home is showin'.

9. They may differ in creeds an' politics,
10. They may argue an' even quarrel,
11. But their throats grip tight,
12. If they catch a sight
13. Of their favorite elm or laurel.
14. An' the winding lane that they used to tread
15. With never a care to fret 'em,
16. Or the pasture gate where they used to wait,
17. Right under the skin will get 'em.

18. Now folks is folks on their different ways,
19. With their different griefs an' pleasures,
20. But the home they knew, when their years were few,
21. Is the dearest of all their treasures.
22. An' the richest man to the poorest waif
23. Right under the skin is brother
24. When they stand an' sigh,
25. With a tear-dimmed eye,
26. At a thought of the dear old mother.

27. It makes no difference where it may be,
28. Nor the fortunes that years may alter,
29. Be they simple or wise, the old home ties
30. Make all of 'em often falter.
31. Time may robe 'em in sackcloth coarse
32. Or garb 'em in gorgeous splendor,
33. But whatever their lot, they keep one spot
34. Down deep that is sweet an' tender.

35. We was speakin' of folks, jes' common folks,
36. An' we come to this conclusion,
37. That one an' all, be they great or small,
38. Will warm to a home allusion;
39. That under the skin an' the beaten hide
40. They're kin in a real affection
41. For the joys they knew,
42. When their years were few,
43. An' the home of their recollection.
