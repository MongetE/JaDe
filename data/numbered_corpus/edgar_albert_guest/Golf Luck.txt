1. As a golfer I'm not one who cops the money;
2. I shall always be a member of the dubs;
3. There are times my style is positively funny;
4. I am awkward in my handling of the clubs.
5. I am not a skillful golfer, nor a plucky,
6. But this about myself I proudly say-
7. When I win a hole by freaky stroke or lucky,
8. I never claim I played the shot that way.

9. There are times, despite my blundering behavior,
10. When fortune seems to follow at my heels;
11. Now and then I play supremely in her favor,
12. And she lets me pull the rankest sort of steals;
13. She'll give to me the friendliest assistance,
14. I'll jump a ditch at times when I should not,
15. I'll top the ball and get a lot of distance-
16. But I don't claim that's how I played the shot.

17. I've hooked a ball when just that hook I needed,
18. And wondered how I ever turned the trick;
19. I've thanked my luck for what a friendly tree did,
20. Although my fortune made my rival sick;
21. Sometimes my shots turn out just as I planned 'em,
22. The sort of shots I usually play,
23. But when up to the cup I chance to land 'em,
24. I never claim I played 'em just that way.

25. There's little in my game that will commend me;
26. I'm not a shark who shoots the course in par;
27. I need good fortune often to befriend me;
28. I have my faults and know just what they are.
29. I play golf in a desperate do-or-die way,
30. And into traps and trouble oft I stray,
31. But when by chance the breaks are coming my way,
32. I do not claim I played the shots that way.
