1. There's nothing that builds up a toil-weary soul
2. Like a day on a stream,
3. Back on the banks of the old fishing hole
4. Where a fellow can dream.
5. There's nothing so good for a man as to flee
6. From the city and lie
7. Full length in the shade of a whispering tree
8. And gaze at the sky.

9. Out there where the strife and the greed are forgot
10. And the struggle for pelf,
11. A man can get rid of each taint and each spot
12. And clean up himself;
13. He can be what he wanted to be when a boy,
14. If only in dreams;
15. And revel once more in the depths of a joy
16. That's as real as it seems.

17. The things that he hates never follow him there —
18. The jar of the street,
19. The rivalries petty, the struggling unfair —
20. For the open is sweet.
21. In purity's realm he can rest and be clean,
22. Be he humble or great,
23. And as peaceful his soul may become as the scene
24. That his eyes contemplate.

25. It is good for the world that men hunger to go
26. To the banks of a stream,
27. And weary of sham and of pomp and of show
28. They have somewhere to dream.
29. For this life would be dreary and sordid and base
30. Did they not now and then
31. Seek refreshment and calm in God's wide, open space
32. And come back to be men.
