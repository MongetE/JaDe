1. Mine is a song of hope
2. For the days that lie before;
3. For the grander things
4. The morrow brings
5. When the struggle days are o'er.
6. Dark be the clouds to-day,
7. Bitter the winds that blow,
8. But falter nor fail,
9. Through the howling gale-
10. Comes peace in the afterglow.

11. Mine is the song of hope,
12. A song for the mother here,
13. Who lulls to rest
14. The babe at breast,
15. And hopes for a brighter year.
16. Hope is the song she sings,
17. Hope is the prayer she prays;
18. As she rocks her boy,
19. She dreams of the joy
20. He'll bring in the future days.

21. Mine is the song of hope,
22. A song for the father, too,
23. Whose right arm swings,
24. While his anvil sings
25. A song of the journey through.
26. Hope is the star that guides,
27. Hope is the father's sun;
28. Far ahead he sees,
29. Through the waving trees,
30. Sweet peace when his work is done.

31. Mine is the song of hope,
32. Of hope that sustains us all;
33. Be we young or old,
34. Be we weak or bold,
35. Do we falter or even fall,
36. Brightly the star of hope
37. From the distance is shining still;
38. And with courage new
39. We rise to do,
40. For hope is the God of Will.
