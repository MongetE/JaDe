1. Trouble is an exerciser
2. Sent us by a Wisdom wiser
3. Than the mind of man possesses.
4. Doubts and dangers and distresses
5. Come not purposely to best us,
6. But to strengthen us and test us.

7. He who never gets In tussles
8. Soon has soft and flabby muscles.
9. He who, fearing hurts and bruises.
10. Guards his strength, grows weak and loses
11. All the power he thought to nourish.
12. Strong men by their trials flourish.

13. Never was a stately figure
14. But by trouble was made bigger.
15. Cares a man has borne, and still bears.
16. Trove how much he can and will bear.
17. He Is strongest of your neighbors
18. Who performs the heaviest labors.

19. Not from easy ways and tender
20. Brilliant minds receive their splendor.
21. But from problems deep, perplexing,
22. And from solving questions vexing,
23. (Nightly pondering wisdom's pages)
24. Comes the luster of the sages.

25. Trouble is an exerciser
26. Sent to make us stronger, wiser.
27. Sent to make us bigger, better:
28. It Is not a chain or fetter
29. Or a snare or trap to best us,
30. It is Just life's way to test us.
