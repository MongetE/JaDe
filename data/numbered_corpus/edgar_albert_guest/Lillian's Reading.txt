1. AIRY, fairy Lillian,
2. What a naughty thing to do,
3. By noon had read a Laura
4. Libbey paper novel through.

5. By four o'clock another
6. Tale of love and passion trite
7. She had devoured, and on the third
8. Was well along by night.

9. But in the kitchen, Lillian's
10. Mother toiled with dish and spoon,
11. Endeavoring to work, and get
12. A lunch for dad at noon.

13. She washed the dishes, scrubbed the floors
14. And made each bed by four,
15. And even ironed every waist
16. That lovely Lillian wore.

17. Thus every Laura Libbey book
18. That lovely Lillian reads,
19. Is built on mushy love affairs
20. And mother's noble deeds.
