1. She is fair to see and sweet,
2. Dainty from her head to feet,
3. Modest, as her blushing shows,
4. Happy, as her smiles disclose,
5. And the young man at her side
6. Nervously attempts to hide
7. Underneath a visage grim
8. That the fuss is bothering him.

9. Pause a moment, happy pair!
10. This is not the station where
11. Romance ends, and wooing stops
12. And the charm from courtship drops;
13. This is but the outward gate
14. Where the souls of mortals mate,
15. But the border of the land
16. You must travel hand in hand.

17. You who come to marriage, bring
18. All your tenderness, and cling
19. Steadfastly to all the ways
20. That have marked your wooing days.
21. You are only starting out
22. On life's roadways, hedged about
23. Thick with roses and with tares,
24. Sweet delights and bitter cares.

25. Heretofore you've only played
26. At love's game, young man and maid;
27. Only known it at its best;
28. Now you'll have to face its test.
29. You must prove your love worth while,
30. Something time cannot defile,
31. Something neither care nor pain
32. Can destroy or mar or stain.

33. You are now about to show
34. Whether love is real or no;
35. Yonder down the lane of life
36. You will find, as man and wife,
37. Sorrows, disappointments, doubt,
38. Hope will almost flicker out;
39. But if rightly you are wed
40. Love will linger where you tread.

41. There are joys that you will share,
42. Joys to balance every care;
43. Arm in arm remain, and you
44. Will not fear the storms that brew,
45. If when you are sorest tried
46. You face your trials, side by side.
47. Now your wooing days are done,
48. And your loving years begun.
