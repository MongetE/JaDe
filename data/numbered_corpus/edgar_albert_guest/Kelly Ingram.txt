1. His name was Kelly Ingram; he was Alabama's son,
2. And he whistled 'Yankee Doodle,' as he stood beside his gun;
3. There was laughter in his make-up, there was manhood in his face,
4. And he knew the best traditions and the courage of his race;
5. Now there's not a heart among us but should swell with loyal pride
6. When he thinks of Kelly Ingram and the splendid way he died.

7. On the swift Destroyer Cassin he was merely gunner's mate,
8. But up there to-day, I fancy, he is standing with the great.
9. On that grim day last October his position on the craft
10. Was that portion of the vessel which the sailors christen aft;
11. There were deep sea bombs beside him to be dropped upon the Hun
12. Who makes women folks his victims and then gloats o'er what he's done.

13. From the lookout came a warning; came the cry all sailors fear,
14. A torpedo was approaching, and the vessel's doom was near;
15. Ingram saw the streak of danger, but he saw a little more,
16. A greater menace faced them than that missile had in store;
17. If those deep sea bombs beside him were not thrown beneath the wave,
18. Every man aboard the Cassin soon would find a watery grave.

19. It was death for him to linger, but he figured if he ran
20. And quit his post of duty, 'twould be death for every man;
21. So he stood at his position, threw those depth bombs overboard,
22. And when that torpedo struck them, he went forth to meet his Lord.
23. Oh, I don't know how to say it, but these whole United States
24. Should remember Kelly Ingramâ€”he who died to save his mates.
