1. The golden dreamboat's ready, all her silken sails are spread,
2. And the breeze is gently blowing to the fairy port of Bed,
3. And the fairy's captain's waiting while the busy sandman flies
4. With the silver dust of slumber, closing every baby's eyes.

5. Oh, the night is rich with moonlight and the sea is calm with peace,
6. And the angels fly to guard you and their watch shall never cease,
7. And the fairies there await you; they have splendid dreams to spin;
8. You shall hear them gayly singing as the dreamboat's putting in.

9. Like the ripple of the water does the dreamboat's whistle blow,
10. Only baby ears can catch it when it comes the time to go,
11. Only little ones may journey on so wonderful a ship,
12. And go drifting off to slumber with no care to mar the trip.

13. Oh, the little eyes are heavy but the little soul is light;
14. It shall never know a sorrow or a terror through the night.
15. And at last when dawn is breaking and the dreamboat's trip is o'er,
16. You shall wake to find the mother smiling over you once more.
