1. There's a wondrous smell of spices
2. In the kitchen,
3. Most bewitchin';
4. There are fruits cut into slices
5. That just set the palate itchin';
6. There's the sound of spoon on platter
7. And the rattle and the clatter;
8. And a bunch of kids are hastin'
9. To the splendid joy of tastin':
10. It's the fragrant time of year
11. When fruit-cannin' days are here.

12. There's a good wife gayly smilin'
13. And perspirin'
14. Some, and tirin';
15. And while jar on jar she's pilin'
16. And the necks o' them she's wirin'
17. I'm a-sittin' here an' dreamin'
18. Of the kettles that are steamin',
19. And the cares that have been troublin'
20. All have vanished in the bubblin'.
21. I am happy that I'm here
22. At the cannin' time of year.

23. Lord, I'm sorry for the feller
24. That is missin'
25. All the hissin'
26. Of the juices, red and yeller,
27. And can never sit and listen
28. To the rattle and the clatter
29. Of the sound of spoon on platter.
30. I am sorry for the single,
31. For they miss the thrill and tingle
32. Of the splendid time of year
33. When the cannin' days are here.
