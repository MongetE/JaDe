1. She put her arms about my neck,
2. And whispered low to me:
3. 'I'm thinking daddy, dear, how nice
4. And lovely it would be
5. If only every little girl
6. In all this wide world through
7. Had daddies that were just as nice
8. And kind and good as you.'

9. And then I took her in my arms
10. And held her on my knee
11. And said: 'A nicer, brighter world
12. I'm sure that it would be
13. If only every grown-up man
14. Beneath the skies of blue
15. Were daddy to a little girl
16. As nice and sweet as you.'
