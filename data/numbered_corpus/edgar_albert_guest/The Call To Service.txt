1. These are the days when little thoughts
2. Must cease men's minds to occupy;
3. The nation needs men's larger creeds,
4. Big men must answer to her cry;
5. No longer selfish ways we tread,
6. The greater task lies just ahead.

7. These are the days when petty things
8. By all men must be thrust aside;
9. The country needs men's finest deeds,
10. Awakened is the nation's pride;
11. Men must forsake their selfish strife
12. Once more to guard their country's life.
