1. Love and laughter lead you
2. Down the pathways of the year,
3. And may each morning feed you
4. From the golden spoon of cheer;
5. May every eye be shining,
6. And every cheek aglow,
7. And may the silver lining
8. Of the clouds forever show.

9. May peace and plenty find you,
10. May pain and grief depart ;
11. And may you leave behind you
12. The little cares that smart;
13. May no day be distressful,
14. No night be filled with woe,
15. And may you be successful
16. Wherever you may go.

17. May June bring you her roses,
18. May summer poppies bloom,
19. And may each day that closes
20. Be fragrant with perfume.
21. May you have no regretting
22. When evening is begun,
23. No vain and idle fretting
24. O'er what you might have done.

25. May envy quit your dwelling
26. And hatred leave your heart ;
27. May you rejoice in telling
28. Your brother's better part.
29. May you be glad you're living
30. However dark your way,
31. And find your joy in giving
32. Your service to the day.
