1. We have boasted our courage in moments of ease,
2. Our star-spangled banner we've flung on the breeze;
3. We have taught men to cheer for its beauty and worth,
4. And have called it the flag of the bravest on earth
5. Now the dark days are here, we must stand to the test.
6. Oh, God! let us prove we are true to our best!

7. We have drunk to our flag, and we've talked of the right,
8. We have challenged oppression to show us its might;
9. We have strutted for years through the world as a race
10. That for God and for country, earth's tyrants would face;
11. Now the gage is flung down, hate is loosed in the world.
12. Oh, God! shall our flag in dishonor be furled?

13. We have said we are brave; we have preached of the truth,
14. We have walked in conceit of the strength of our youth;
15. We have mocked at the ramparts and guns of the foe,
16. As though we believed we could laugh them all low.
17. Now oppression has struck! We are challenged to fight!
18. Oh, God! let us prove we can stand for the right!

19. If in honor and glory our flag is to wave,
20. If we are to keep thisâ€”the land of the brave;
21. If more than fine words are to fashion our creeds,
22. Now must our hands and our hearts turn to deeds.
23. We are challenged by tyrants our strength to reveal!
24. Oh, God! let us prove that our courage is real!
