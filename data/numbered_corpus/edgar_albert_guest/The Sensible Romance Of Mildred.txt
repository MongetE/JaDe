1. MILDRED McGee was a beautiful blond,
2. As fair as peroxide could make her.
3. She was never so shy that a man going by
4. Would imagine that she was a Quaker.
5. She had suitors that called every night in the week
6. And one of them worked in a shoe shop,
7. But her 'favor-ite' man was a chap named McGann
8. Who was boss of a gang in a glue shop.

9. Her folks used to scoff at young Patrick McGann
10. For they wished her to marry a plumber;
11. But Mildred was true to the maker of glue,
12. Though she flirted at times with a drummer.
13. Though she flirted at times with the pharmacist's clerk,
14. And she flirted at times with the baker,
15. She stuck to McGann, the glue factory man.
16. Not a bit could her fond parents shake her.

17. 'You're in awful bad odor,' she said, 'with my folks,
18. When you come they both turn up their noses;
19. But I said when they kicked, that the plumber they've picked
20. Isn't scented with attar of roses.
21. When a girl is in love with a fellow, I've found
22. There's something inside her that rages;
23. An' I'd rather be true to a sweetheart like you
24. Than a sweet-smelling chap with no wages.

25. 'There's many fine fellows who brag of their jobs
26. An' spend all their coin in a brew shop;
27. An' take it from me, I'd much rather be
28. The wife of the man in a glue shop.
29. Not all of us girls can get married to dudes
30. An' college professors an' scholars;
31. With you I'm content, I'll not stop at a scent
32. So long as you bring in the dollars.'
