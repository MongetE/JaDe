1. Turn me loose and let me be
2. Young once more and fancy free;
3. Let me wander where I will,
4. Down the lane and up the hill,
5. Trudging barefoot in the dust
6. In an age that knows no 'must,'
7. And no voice insistently
8. Speaks of duty unto me;
9. Let me tread the happy ways
10. Of those by-gone yesterdays.

11. Fame had never whispered then,
12. Making slaves of eager men;
13. Greed had never called me down
14. To the gray walls of the town,
15. Offering frankincense and myrrh
16. If I'd be its prisoner;
17. I was free to come and go
18. Where the cherry blossoms blow,
19. Free to wander where I would,
20. Finding life supremely good.

21. But I turned, as all must do,
22. From the happiness I knew
23. To the land of care and strife,
24. Seeking for a fuller life;
25. Heard the lure of fame and sought
26. That renown so dearly bought;
27. Listened to the voice of greed
28. Saying: 'These the things you need,'
29. Now the gray town holds me fast,
30. Prisoner to the very last.

31. Age has stamped me as its own;
32. Youth to younger hearts has flown;
33. Still the cherry blossoms blow
34. In the land loused to know;
35. Still the fragrant clover spills
36. Perfume over dales and hills,
37. But I'm not allowed to stray
38. Where the young are free to play;
39. All the years will grant to me
40. Is the book of memory.
