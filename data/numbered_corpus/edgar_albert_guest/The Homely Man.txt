1. Looks as though a cyclone hit him—
2. Can't buy clothes that seem to fit him;
3. An' his cheeks are rough like leather,
4. Made for standin' any weather.
5. Outwards he was fashioned plainly,
6. Loose o' joint an' blamed ungainly,
7. But I'd give a lot if I'd
8. Been built half as fine inside.

9. Best thing I can tell you of him
10. Is the way the children love him.
11. Now an' then I get to thinkin'
12. He's much like old Abe Lincoln;
13. Homely like a gargoyle graven—
14. Worse'n that when he's unshaven;
15. But I'd take his ugly phiz
16. Jes' to have a heart like his.

17. I ain't over-sentimental,
18. But old Blake is so blamed gentle
19. An' so thoughtfull-like of others
20. He reminds us of our mothers.
21. Rough roads he is always smoothing
22. An' his way is, Oh, so soothin',
23. That he takes away the sting
24. When your heart is sorrowing.

25. Children gather round about him
26. Like they can't get on without him.
27. An' the old depend upon him,
28. Pilin' all their burdens on him,
29. Like as though the thing that grieves 'em
30. Has been lifted when he leaves 'em.
31. Homely? That can't be denied,
32. But he's glorious inside.
