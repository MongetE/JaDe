1. Did you ever sit down and talk with men
2. In a serious sort of a way,
3. On their views of life and ponder then
4. On all that they have to say?
5. If not, you should in some quiet hour;
6. It's a glorious thing to do:
7. For you'll find that back of the pomp and power
8. Most men have a goal in view.

9. They'll tell you then that their aim is not
10. The clink of the yellow gold;
11. That not in the worldly things they've got
12. Would they have their stories told.
13. They'll say the joys that they treasure most
14. Are their good friends, tried and true,
15. And an honest name for their own to boast
16. And peace when the day is through.

17. I've talked with men and I think I know
18. What's under the toughened skin.
19. I've seen their eyes grow bright and glow
20. With the fire that burns within.
21. And back of the gold and back of the fame
22. And back of the selfish strife,
23. In most men's breasts you'll find the flame
24. Of the nobler things of life.
