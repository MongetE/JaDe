1. Sympathy
2. One came to the house with a pretty speech:
3. 'It's all for the best,' said he,
4. And I know that he sought my heart to reach,
5. And I know that he grieved with me.

6. But I was too full of my sorrow then
7. To list to his words or care;
8. Though I've tried I cannot recall again
9. The comfort he gave me there.

10. But another came, and his lips were dumb
11. As he grasped me by the hand,
12. And he stammered: 'Old man, I had to come,
13. Oh, I hope you'll understand.'

14. And ever since then I have felt his hand
15. Clasped tightly in my own,
16. And to-day his silence I understand-
17. My sorrowing he had known.
