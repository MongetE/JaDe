1. With a twinkle in his eye
2. He'd come gayly walkin' by
3. An' he'd whistle to the children
4. An' he'd beckon 'em to come,
5. Then he'd chuckle low an' say,
6. 'Come along, I'm on my way,
7. An' it's I that need your company
8. To buy a little gum.'

9. When his merry call they'd hear,
10. All the children, far an' near,
11. Would come flyin' from the gardens
12. Like the chickens after wheat;
13. When we'd shake our heads an' say:
14. 'No, you mustn't go to-day!'
15. He'd beg to let him have 'em
16. In a pack about his feet.

17. Oh, he spoiled 'em, one an' all;
18. There was not a youngster small
19. But was over-fed on candy
20. An' was stuffed with lollypops,
21. An' I think his greatest joy
22. Was to get some girl or boy
23. An' bring 'em to their parents
24. All besmeared by chocolate drops.

25. Now the children's hearts are sore
26. For he comes to them no more,
27. And no more to them he whistles
28. And no more for them he stops;
29. But in Paradise, I think,
30. With his chuckle and his wink,
31. He is leading little angels
32. To the heavenly candy shops.
