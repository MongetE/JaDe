1. I do not quarrel with the gas,
2. Our modern range is fine,
3. The ancient stove was doomed to pass
4. From Time's grim firing line,
5. Yet now and then there comes to me
6. The thought of dinners good
7. And pies and cake that used to be
8. When mother cooked with wood.The axe has vanished from the yard,
9. The chopping block is gone,
10. There is no pile of corkwood hard
11. For boys to work upon;
12. There is no box that must be filled
13. Each morning to the hood;
14. Time in its ruthlessness has willed
15. The passing of the wood.
16. And yet those days were fragrant days
17. And spicy days and rare;
18. The kitchen knew a cheerful blaze
19. And friendliness was there.
20. And every appetite was keen
21. For breakfasts that were good
22. When I had scarcely turned thirteen
23. And mother cooked with wood.
24. I used to dread my daily chore,
25. I used to think it tough
26. When mother at the kitchen door
27. Said I'd not chopped enough.
28. And on her baking days, I know,
29. I shirked whene'er I could
30. In that now happy long ago
31. When mother cooked with wood.I never thought I'd wish to see
32. That pile of wood again;
33. Back then it only seemed to me
34. A source of care and pain.
35. But now I'd gladly give my all
36. To stand where once I stood,
37. If those rare days I could recall
38. When mother cooked with wood.
