1. Get off your downy cots of ease,
2. There's work that must be done.
3. Great danger's riding on the seas.
4. The storm is coming on.
5. Don't think that it will quickly pass.
6. Who smiles at distant fate,
7. And waits until it strikes, alas!
8. Has roused himself too late.

9. Who thinks the fight will end before
10. The need of him arrives,
11. Is lengthening this brutal war
12. And costing many lives.
13. For over us that storm shall break
14. Ere many weeks have fled,
15. And we shall pay for our mistake
16. In fields of mangled dead.

17. Be ready when the foe shall near,
18. Be there to strike him hard;
19. Let us, though he be miles from here,
20. Be standing now on guard.
21. To-morrow's victories won't be won
22. By pluck that we display
23. To-morrow when the foe comes on,
24. But by our work to-day.
