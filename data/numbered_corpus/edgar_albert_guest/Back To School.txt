1. It ain' the ringing of the bell
2. which calls me back to skule once more;
3. it ain't that i must lurn to spell
4. that makes my hart so orful soar:
5. it ain't that fracktions i must lurn
6. nor jografy that makes me blew,
7. it 's just becoz today i yurn
8. to do the things i didn't doo.

9. ring out, wild bell! ime on mi way
10. to skule again, and summer's done —
11. it dussent seem more than a day
12. since i began to have mi fun.
13. i wouldn't mind this cuming back,
14. it ain't the skule ime kicking on,
15. it's just becoz i missed a stack
16. of fun, and now the summer's gone.

17. i planned to bild a coogie in
18. our yard, where all the kids could meat;
19. the roof was going to be of tin,
20. and we 'd have carpet for our feet;
21. and i was going to organize
22. a brave and daring pirut crew
23. and we 'd take rich men bi surprize —
24. but gee! how fast the summer's flue.

25. and that's the skule bell ringing now,
26. vacashun's slipped away from me;
27. what i acomplisshed anyhow
28. is something more than i can see;
29. i've had some fun, of course, but then,
30. it really seams to beet the dutch
31. how very little i did when
32. i planned to do so very much.

33. Ah, little boy, you do not know
34. The lesson that you teach us all;
35. You with unwilling feet now go
36. To school at the approach of Fall.
37. We grown-ups soon will hear a bell,
38. Announcing that our course is run,
39. Far more than death we fear to tell
40. The good deeds that we might have done.
