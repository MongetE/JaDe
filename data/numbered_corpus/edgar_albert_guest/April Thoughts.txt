1. Listen to the laughter of the brook that's racin' by!
2. Listen to the chatter of the black-birds on the fence!
3. Stand an' see the beauties of the blue that's in the sky-
4. Then ask of God why mortals haven't any better sense
5. Than to quarrel an' to battle
6. Where the guns an' cannon rattle
7. An' to slaughter one another an' to fill the world with hate.
8. God brings the buds to blossom
9. Where the gentle breezes toss 'em
10. An' the soul is blind to beauty that takes anger for its mate.

11. Listen to the singin' of the robins in the trees!
12. See the sunbeams flashin' where they're mirrored by the stream!
13. Hear the drowsy buzzin' of the honey-seekin' bees,
14. Then draw a little closer to your God the while you dream.
15. When the world is dressed to cheer you
16. Don't you feel Him standin' near you?
17. When your soul drinks in the beauty of the wonders in His plan,
18. An' you've put away your passions,
19. Don't you think the works He fashions
20. In their beauty an' their bigness mock the littleness of man?

21. Oh, I never walk an orchard nor a field with daisies strewn,
22. An' I never stand bare-headed gazin' everywhere about
23. At the living joys around me, be it morning, night or noon,
24. But I ask God to forgive me that I ever held a doubt.
25. Surely men must walk in blindness,
26. With the whole world tuned to kindness,
27. An' all dumb an' feathered creatures fairly bubblin' o'er with glee
28. To devote themselves to madness
29. That can only end in sadness
30. An' to think that they are being what God put them here to be.
