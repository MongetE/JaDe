1. The moon swings low in the sky above,
2. And the twinkling stars shine bright,
3. And a mother sings to her baby love
4. Those wonderful songs of night;
5. Those wonderful songs of sugar plum trees,
6. And the fields where the fairies play,
7. Of cockle-shell boats on golden seas
8. That never are seen by day.

9. It is by-low time and she sweetly hums
10. Those wonderful songs of night;
11. Of the blare of trumpets and sound of drums
12. When the little tin soldiers fight;
13. She sings of a comical candy dog
14. And the gingerbread man who stands
15. By the side of a blinking cooky frog,
16. Without any arms or hands.

17. And the moonbeams dance on the parlor floor,
18. And a ship sets out to sea,
19. And a baby sails for the golden shore
20. In search of the sugar plum tree;
21. She's off to the cave of the Teddy Bear,
22. And the haunts of the fairies kind,
23. Where never an ache or a pain or care
24. Shall trouble her baby mind.

25. Oh, sweet is the smile on the baby's face
26. As she softly sinks to rest,
27. For where in the world is so fine a place
28. To sleep, as a mother's breast?
29. And if ever a song can reach the skies,
30. The angels must find delight
31. In hearing a mother's lullabies -
32. Those wonderful songs of night.
