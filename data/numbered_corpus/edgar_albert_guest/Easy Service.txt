1. When an empty sleeve or a sightless eye
2. Or a legless form I see,
3. I breathe my thanks to my God on High
4. For His watchful care o'er me.
5. And I say to myself, as the cripple goes
6. Half stumbling on his way:
7. I may brag and boast, but that brother knows
8. Why the old flag floats to-day.

9. I think as I sit in my cozy den
10. Puffing one of my many pipes
11. That I've served with all of my fellow men
12. The glorious Stars and Stripes.
13. Then I see a troop in the faded blue
14. And a few in the dusty gray,
15. And I have to laugh at the deeds I do
16. For the flag that floats to-day.

17. I see men tangled in pointed wire,
18. The sport of the blazing sun,
19. Mangled and maimed by a leaden fire
20. As the tides of battle run,
21. And I fancy I hear their piteous calls
22. For merciful death, and then
23. The cannons cease and the darkness falls,
24. And those fluttering things are men.

25. Out there in the night they beg for death,
26. Yet the Reaper spurns their cries,
27. And it seems his jest to leave them breath
28. For their pitiful pleas and sighs.
29. And I am here in my cosy room
30. In touch with the joys of life,
31. I am miles away from the fields of doom
32. And the gory scenes of strife.

33. I never have vainly called for aid,
34. Nor suffered real pangs of thirst,
35. I have marched with life in its best parade
36. And never have seen its worst.
37. In the flowers of ease I have ever basked,
38. And I think as the Flag I see
39. How much of service from some it's asked,
40. How little of toil from me.
