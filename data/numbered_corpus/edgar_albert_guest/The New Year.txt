1. Come you with dangers to fright us? or hazards
2. to try out our souls?
3. Then may you find us undaunted; determined to
4. get to our goals.
5. Now, white are the pages you bring us to fill
6. with the tales of our deeds,
7. And I pray we shall square at the finish the work
8. of our lives with our creeds.

9. Oh, child of a year, do you wonder what here
10. upon earth you shall find?
11. America shows you a people united in purpose
12. and mind;
13. Whatever you bring us of danger, whatever you
14. hold to affright,
15. I pray that we never shall lower our standards
16. of truth and of right.

17. You find us a people united, full pledged to the
18. work of the world,
19. To banish the despot and tyrant, our banner in
20. battle's unfurled;
21. And here to a world that is bleeding and weary
22. and heartsick you come,
23. Whatever you've brought us of dutyâ€”we'll
24. answer the call of your drum.

25. We may weep in our grief and our sorrows, we
26. may bend 'neath the might of the blow,
27. But never our courage shall falter, and never
28. we'll run from the foe.
29. We know not how troubled our pathways shall
30. be nor how sorely beset,
31. But I pray we shall cling to our honor as men
32. and never our purpose forget.
