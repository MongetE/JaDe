1. I'm the bumps and bruises doctor;
2. I'm the expert that they seek
3. When their rough and tumble playing
4. Leaves a scar on leg or cheek.
5. I'm the rapid, certain curer
6. For the wounds of every fall;
7. I'm the pain eradicator;
8. I can always heal them all.

9. Bumps on little people's foreheads
10. I can quickly smooth away;
11. I take splinters out of fingers
12. Without very much delay.
13. Little sorrows I can banish
14. With the magic of my touch;
15. I can fix a bruise that's dreadful
16. So it isn't hurting much.

17. I'm the bumps and bruises doctor,
18. And I answer every call,
19. And my fee is very simple,
20. Just a kiss, and that is all.
21. And I'm sitting here and wishing
22. In the years that are to be,
23. When they face life's real troubles
24. That they'll bring them all to me.
