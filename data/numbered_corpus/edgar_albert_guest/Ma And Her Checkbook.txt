1. Ma has a dandy little book that's full of narrow
2. slips,
3. An' when she wants to pay a bill a page from
4. it she rips;
5. She just writes in the dollars and the cents and
6. signs her name
7. An' that's as good as money, though it doesn't
8. look the same.
9. When she wants another bonnet or some
10. feathers for her neck,
11. She promptly goes an' gets 'em, an' she writes
12. another check.
13. I don't just understand it, but I know she
14. sputters when
15. Pa says to her at supper:  'Well!  You're
16. overdrawn again!'
17. Ma's not a business woman, she is much too
18. kind of heart
19. To squabble over pennies or to play a selfish
20. part,
21. An' when someone asks for money, she's not
22. one to stop an' think
23. Of a little piece of paper an' the cost of pen
24. an' ink.
25. She just tells him very sweetly if he'll only
26. wait a bit
27. An' be seated in the parlor, she will write a
28. check for it.
29. She can write one out for twenty just as easily
30. as ten,
31. An' forgets that Pa may grumble:  'Well,
32. you're overdrawn again!'

33. Pa says it looks as though he'll have to start in
34. workin' nights
35. To gather in the money for the checks that
36. mother writes.
37. He says that every morning when he's summoned
38. to the phone,
39. He's afraid the bank is calling to make mother's
40. shortage known.
41. He tells his friends if ever anything our fortune
42. wrecks
43. They can trace it to the moment mother started
44. writing checks.
45. He's got so that he trembles when he sees her
46. fountain pen
47. An' he mutters:  'Do be careful!  You'll be
48. overdrawn again!'
