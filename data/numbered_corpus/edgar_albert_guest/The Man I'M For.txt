1. I'M for the happy man every time,
2. The man who smiles as he goes his way,
3. Whether he's up or whether he's down,
4. I 'm for the man with a grin, I say.
5. I 'm for the man who can bear his woes
6. With never a grumbling word or frown,
7. Who, smiling, gathers the rue or rose â€”
8. There is the man that you can't keep down.

9. I 'm for the cheerful man, heart and soul!
10. His is the hand that I like to grasp;
11. Who tunes his voice in a merry key,
12. Not files it down to a bitter rasp.
13. I 'm for the man who can take the cards
14. Just as they 're dealt by the hand of fate,
15. And, good or bad, play an honest game
16. With a lifted chin and a smile that's great.
