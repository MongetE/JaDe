1. Bill Jones, who goes to school with me,
2. Is the saddest boy I ever see.
3. He's just so 'fraid he runs away
4. When all of us fellows want to play,
5. An' says he dassent stay about
6. Coz if his father found it out
7. He'd wallop him. An' he can't go
8. With us to see a picture show
9. On Saturdays, an' it's too bad,
10. But he's afraid to ask his dad.

11. When he gets his report card, he
12. Is just as scared as scared can be,
13. An' once I saw him when he cried
14. Becoz although he'd tried an' tried
15. His best, the teacher didn't care
16. An' only marked his spelling fair,
17. An' he told me there'd be a fight
18. When his dad saw his card that night.
19. It seems to me it's awful bad
20. To be so frightened of your dad.
21. My Dad ain't that way- I can go
22. An' tell him everything I know,
23. An' ask him things, an' when he comes
24. Back home at night he says we're chums;
25. An' we go out an' take a walk,
26. An' all the time he lets me talk.
27. I ain't scared to tell him what
28. I've done to-day that I should not;
29. When I get home I'm always glad
30. To stay around an' play with Dad.

31. Bill Jones, he says, he wishes he
32. Could have a father just like me,
33. But his dad hasn't time to play,
34. An' so he chases him away
35. An' scolds him when he makes a noise
36. An' licks him if he breaks his toys.
37. Sometimes Bill says he's got to lie
38. Or else get whipped, an' that is why
39. It seems to me it's awful bad
40. To be so frightened of your dad.
