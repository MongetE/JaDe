1. The pathway of the living is our ever-present care.
2. Let us do our best to smooth it and to make it bright and fair;
3. Let us travel it with kindness, let's be careful as we tread,
4. And give unto the living what we'd offer to the dead.

5. The pathway of the living we can beautify and grace;
6. We can line it deep with roses and make earth a happier place.
7. But we've done all mortals can do, when our prayers are softly said
8. For the souls of those that travel o'er the pathway of the dead.

9. The pathway of the living all our strength and courage needs,
10. There we ought to sprinkle favors, there we ought to sow our deeds,
11. There our smiles should be the brightest, there our kindest words be said,
12. For the angels have the keeping of the pathway of the dead.
