1. I must be fit for a child to play with,
2. Fit for a youngster to walk away with;
3. Fit for his trust and fit to be
4. Ready to take him upon my knee;
5. Whether I win or I lose my fight,
6. I must be fit for my boy at night.
7. I must be fit for a child to come to,
8. Speech there is that I must be dumb to;
9. I must be fit for his eyes to see,
10. He must find nothing of shame in me;
11. Whatever I make of myself, I must
12. Square to my boy's unfaltering trust.
13. I must be fit for a child to follow,
14. Scorning the places where loose men wallow;
15. Knowing how much he shall learn from me,
16. I must be fair as I'd have him be;
17. I must come home to him, day by day,
18. Clean as the morning I went away.
19. I must be fit for a child's glad greeting,
20. His are eyes that there is no cheating;
21. He must behold me in every test,
22. Not at my worst, but my very best;
23. He must be proud when my life is done
24. To have men know that he is my son.
