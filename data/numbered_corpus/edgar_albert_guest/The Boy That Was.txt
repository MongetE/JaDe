1. When the hair about the temples starts to show
2. the signs of gray,
3. And a fellow realizes that he's wandering far
4. away
5. From the pleasures of his boyhood and his
6. youth, and never more
7. Will know the joy of laughter as he did in days
8. of yore,
9. Oh, it's then he starts to thinking of a stubby
10. little lad
11. With a face as brown as berries and a soul
12. supremely glad.

13. When a gray-haired dreamer wanders down the
14. lanes of memory
15. And forgets the living present for the time of
16. 'used-to-be,'
17. He takes off his shoes and stockings, and he
18. throws his coat away,
19. And he's free from all restrictions, save the rules
20. of manly play.
21. He may be in richest garments, but bareheaded
22. in the sun
23. He forgets his proud successes and the riches
24. he has won.

25. Oh, there's not a man alive but that would give
26. his all to be
27. The stubby little fellow that in dreamland he
28. can see,
29. And the splendors that surround him and the
30. joys about him spread
31. Only seem to rise to taunt him with the boyhood
32. that has fled.
33. When the hair about the temples starts to show
34. Time's silver stain,
35. Then the richest man that's living yearns to be
36. a boy again.
