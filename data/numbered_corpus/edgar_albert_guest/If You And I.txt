1. IF you would smile a little more
2. And I would kinder be,
3. If you would stop to think before
4. You speak of faults you see.
5. If I would show more patience, too,
6. With all with whom I'm hurled,
7. Then I would help and so would you
8. To make a better world.

9. If you would cheer your neighbor more
10. And I'd encourage mine,
11. If you would linger at his door
12. To say his work is fine,
13. And I would stop to help him when
14. His lips in frowns are curled,
15. Both you and I'd be helping then
16. To make a better world.

17. But just as long as you keep still
18. And plod your selfish way,
19. And I rush on, and heedless kill
20. The kind words I could say;
21. While you and I refuse to smile
22. And keep our gay flags furled,
23. Someone will grumble all the while
24. That it's a gloomy world.
