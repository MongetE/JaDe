1. WHY do I grind from morn till night,
2. And sick or well sit down to write?
3. Why do I line my brow with sweat,
4. An extra buck or two to get?
5. The reason isn't hard to trace,
6. For us our neighbors set the pace.

7. The Greens go weekly to a show,
8. And so, of course, we have to go;
9. A dollar-fifty per they pay
10. For seats down in the parquet,
11. And always they wear evening dress;
12. We couldn't think of doing less.

13. The Browns maintain a servant girl,
14. The one we have was christened Pearl;
15. At dinner, several kinds of wine
16. They serve in glass of rare design.
17. Their dinners are a great success;
18. And ours, of course, must be no less.

19. In summer all our neighbors flee
20. Unto the mountains or the sea;
21. They spend two months in big hotels
22. And hobnob with the other swells;
23. And though it's costly, I confess
24. That wife of mine shall do no less.

25. Two doors from us lives Mrs. Grout,
26. Who owns a lovely runabout,
27. And though she's very nice, it's plain
28. She looks on us with some disdain.
29. Although it's more than I can do,
30. My wife will shortly have one, too.

31. I 'd like to take a holiday
32. And spend a month or two in play;
33. I'd like to take an ocean trip
34. And give this awful grind the slip;
35. But there's no rest for me the while
36. We let our neighbors set the style.
