1. Lady in the show case carriage,
2. Do not think that I'm a bear;
3. Not for worlds would I disparage
4. One so gracious and so fair;
5. Do not think that I am blind to
6. One who has a smile seraphic;
7. You I'd never be unkind to,
8. But you are impeding traffic.

9. If I had some way of knowing
10. What you are about to do,
11. Just exactly where you're going,
12. If I could depend on you,
13. I could keep my engine churning,
14. Travel on and never mind you.
15. Lady, when you think of turning,
16. Why not signal us behind you?

17. Lady, free from care and worry,
18. Riding in your plate-glass car,
19. Some of us are in a hurry;
20. Some of us must travel far.
21. I, myself, am eager, very,
22. To be journeying on my way;
23. Lady, is it necessary
24. To monopolize the highway?

25. Lady, at the handle, steering,
26. Why not keep a course that's straight?
27. Know you not that wildly veering
28. As you do, is tempting fate?
29. Do not think my horn I'm blowing
30. Just on purpose to harass you,
31. It is just a signal showing
32. That I'd safely like to pass you.

33. Lady, there are times a duty
34. Must be done, however saddening;
35. It is hard to tell a beauty
36. That she's very often maddening.
37. And I would not now be saying
38. Harsh and cruel words to fuss you,
39. But when traffic you're delaying
40. You are forcing men to cuss you.
