1. I don't mind the man with a red blooded kick
2. At a real or a fancied wrong;
3. I can stand for the chap with a grouch, if he's quick
4. To drop it when joy comes along;
5. I have praise for the fellow who says what he thinks,
6. Though his thoughts may not fit in with mine;
7. But spare me from having to mix with the ginks
8. Who go through this world with a whine.
9. I am willing to listen to sinner or saint
10. Who is willing to fight for his rights,
11. And there's something sometimes in an honest complaint
12. That the soul of me really delights.
13. For kickers are useful and grouches are wise,
14. For their purpose is frequently fine;
15. But spare me from having to mix with the guys
16. Who go through this world with a whine.
