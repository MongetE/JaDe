1. When I was just a little lad
2. Not more than eight or nine,
3. One special treat to make me glad
4. Was set apart as 'mine.'
5. On baking days she granted me
6. The small boy's dearest wish,
7. And when the cake was finished, she
8. Gave me the frosting dish.
9. I've eaten chocolate many ways,
10. I've had it hot and cold;
11. I've sampled it throughout my days
12. In every form it's sold.
13. And though I still am fond of it,
14. And hold its flavor sweet,
15. The icing dish, I still admit,
16. Remains the greatest treat.
17. Never has chocolate tasted so,
18. Nor brought to me such joy
19. As in those days of long ago
20. When I was but a boy,
21. And stood beside my mother fair,
22. Waiting the time when she
23. Would gently stoop to kiss me there
24. And hand the plate to me.
25. Now there's another in my place
26. Who stands where once I stood.
27. And watches with an upturned face
28. And waits for 'something good.'
29. And as she hands him spoon and plate
30. I chuckle low and wish
31. That I might be allowed to wait
32. To scrape the frosting dish.
