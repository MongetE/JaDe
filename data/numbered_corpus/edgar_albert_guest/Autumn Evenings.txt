1. Apples on the table an' the grate-fire blazin' high,
2. Oh, I'm sure the whole world hasn't any happier man than I;
3. The Mother sittin' mendin' little stockin's, toe an' knee,
4. An' tellin' all that's happened through the busy day to me:
5. Oh, I don't know how to say it, but these cosy autumn nights
6. Seem to glow with true contentment an' a thousand real delights.

7. The dog sprawled out before me knows that huntin' days are here,
8. 'Cause he dreams and seems to whimper that a flock o' quail are near;
9. An' the children playin' checkers till it's time to go to bed,
10. Callin' me to settle questions whether black is beatin' red;
11. Oh, these nights are filled with gladness, an' I puff my pipe an' smile,
12. An' tell myself the struggle an' the work are both worth while.

13. The flames are full o' pictures that keep dancin' to an' fro,
14. Bringin' back the scenes o' gladness o' the happy long ago,
15. An' the whole wide world is silent an' I tell myself just this-
16. That within these walls I cherish, there is all my world there is!
17. Can I keep the love abiding in these hearts so close to me,
18. An' the laughter of these evenings, I shall gain life's victory.
