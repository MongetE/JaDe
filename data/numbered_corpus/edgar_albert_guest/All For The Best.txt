1. Things mostly happen for the best.
2. However hard it seems to-day,
3. When some fond plan has gone astray
4. Or what you've wished for most is lost
5. An' you sit countin' up the cost
6. With eyes half-blind by tears o' grief
7. While doubt is chokin' out belief,
8. You'll find when all is understood
9. That what seemed bad was really good.

10. Life can't be counted in a day.
11. The present rain that will not stop
12. Next autumn means a bumper crop.
13. We wonder why some things must be-
14. Care's purpose we can seldom see-
15. An' yet long afterwards we turn
16. To view the past, an' then we learn
17. That what once filled our minds with doubt
18. Was good for us as it worked out.

19. I've never known an hour of care
20. But that I've later come to see
21. That it has brought some joy to me.
22. Even the sorrows I have borne,
23. Leavin' me lonely an' forlorn
24. An' hurt an' bruised an' sick at heart,
25. In life's great plan have had a part.
26. An' though I could not understand
27. Why I should bow to Death's command,
28. As time went on I came to know
29. That it was really better so.

30. Things mostly happen for the best.
31. So narrow is our vision here
32. That we are blinded by a tear
33. An' stunned by every hurt an' blow
34. Which comes to-day to strike us low.
35. An' yet some day we turn an' find
36. That what seemed cruel once was kind.
37. Most things, I hold, are wisely planned
38. If we could only understand.
