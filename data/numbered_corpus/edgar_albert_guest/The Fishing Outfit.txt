1. You may talk of stylish raiment,
2. You may boast your broadcloth fine,
3. And the price you gave in payment
4. May be treble that of mine.
5. But there's one suit I'd not trade you
6. Though it's shabby and it's thin,
7. For the garb your tailor made you:
8. That's the tattered,
9. Mud-bespattered
10. Suit that I go fishing in.
11. There's no king in silks and laces
12. And with jewels on his breast,
13. With whom I would alter places.
14. There's no man so richly dressed
15. Or so like a fashion panel
16. That, his luxuries to win,
17. I would swap my shirt of flannel
18. And the rusty,
19. Frayed and dusty
20. Suit that I go fishing in.
21. 'Tis an outfit meant for pleasure;
22. It is freedom's raiment, too;
23. It's a garb that I shall treasure
24. Till my time of life is through.
25. Though perhaps it looks the saddest
26. Of all robes for mortal skin,
27. I am proudest and I'm gladdest
28. In that easy,
29. Old and greasy
30. Suit that I go fishing in.
