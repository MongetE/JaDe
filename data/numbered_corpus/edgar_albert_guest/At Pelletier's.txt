1. We've been out to Pelletier's
2. Brushing off the stain of years,
3. Quitting all the moods of men
4. And been boys and girls again.
5. We have romped through orchards blazing,
6. Petted ponies gently grazing,
7. Hidden in the hayloft's spaces,
8. And the queerest sort of places
9. That are lost (and it's a pity!)
10. To the youngsters in the city.
11. And the hired men have let us
12. Drive their teams, and stopped to get us
13. Apples from the trees, and lingered
14. While a cow's cool nose we fingered;
15. And they told us all about her
16. And her grandpa who was stouter.
17. We've been out to Pelletier's
18. Watching horses raise their ears,
19. And their joyous whinnies hearing
20. When the man with oats was nearing.
21. We've been climbing trees an' fences
22. Never minding consequences.
23. And we helped the man to curry
24. The fat ponies' sides so furry.
25. And we saw a squirrel taking
26. Walnuts to the nest he's making,
27. Storing them for winter, when he
28. Can't get out to hunt for any.
29. And we watched the turkeys, growing
30. Big and fat and never knowing
31. That the reason they were living
32. Is to die for our Thanksgiving.
33. We've been out to Pelletier's,
34. Brushing off the stain of years.
35. We were kids set free from shamming
36. And the city's awful cramming,
37. And the clamor and the bustle
38. And the fearful rush and hustleâ€”
39. Out of doors with room to race in
40. And broad acres soft to chase in.
41. We just stretched our souls and let them
42. Drop the petty cares that fret them,
43. Left our narrow thoughts behind us,
44. Loosed the selfish traits that bind us
45. And were wholesomer and plainer
46. Simpler, kinder folks and saner,
47. And at night said: 'It's a pity
48. Mortals ever built a city.'
