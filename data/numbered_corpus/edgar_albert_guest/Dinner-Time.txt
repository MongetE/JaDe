1. Tuggin' at your bottle,
2. An' it's O, you're mighty sweet!
3. Just a bunch of dimples
4. From your top-knot to your feet,
5. Lying there an' gooin'
6. In the happiest sort o' way,
7. Like a rosebud peekin' at me
8. In the early hours o' day;
9. Gloating over goodness
10. That you know an' sense an' clutch,
11. An' smilin' at your daddy,
12. Who loves you, O, so much!

13. Tuggin' at your bottle,
14. As you nestle in your crib,
15. With your daddy grinnin' at you
16. 'Cause you've dribbled on your bib,
17. An' you gurgle an' you chortle
18. Like a brook in early Spring;
19. An' you kick your pink feet gayly,
20. An' I think you'd like to sing.
21. All you wanted was your dinner,
22. Daddy knew it too, you bet!
23. An' the moment that you got it
24. Then you ceased to fuss an' fret.

25. Tuggin' at your bottle,
26. Not a care, excepting when
27. You lose the rubber nipple,
28. But you find it soon again;
29. An' the gurglin' an' the gooin'
30. An' the chortlin' start anew,
31. An' the kickin' an' the squirmin'
32. Show the wondrous joy o' you.
33. But I'll bet you're not as happy
34. At your dinner, little tot,
35. As the weather-beaten daddy
36. Who is bendin' o'er your cot!
