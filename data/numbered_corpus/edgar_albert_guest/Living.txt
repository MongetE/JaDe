1. The miser thinks he's living when he's hoarding up his gold;
2. The soldier calls it living when he's doing something bold;
3. The sailor thinks it living to be tossed upon the sea,
4. And upon this very subject no two men of us agree.
5. But I hold to the opinion, as I walk my way along,
6. That living's made of laughter and good-fellowship and song.
7. I wouldn't call it living to be always seeking gold,
8. To bank all the present gladness for the days when I'll be old.
9. I wouldn't call it living to spend all my strength for fame,
10. And forego the many pleasures which to-day are mine to claim.
11. I wouldn't for the splendor of the world set out to roam,
12. And forsake my laughing children and the peace I know at home.
13. Oh, the thing that I call living isn't gold or fame at all!
14. It's fellowship and sunshine, and it's roses by the wall.
15. It's evenings glad with music and a hearth-fire that's ablaze,
16. And the joys which come to mortals in a thousand different ways.
17. It is laughter and contentment and the struggle for a goal;
18. It is everything that's needful in the shaping of a soul.
