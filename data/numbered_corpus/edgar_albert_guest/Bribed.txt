1. I know that what I did was wrong;
2. I should have sent you far away.
3. You tempted me, and I'm not strong;
4. I tried but couldn't answer nay.
5. I should have packed you off to bed;
6. Instead I let you stay awhile,
7. And mother scolded when I said
8. That you had bribed me with your smile.
9. And yesterday I gave to you
10. Another piece of chocolate cake,
11. Some red-ripe watermelon, too,
12. And that gave you the stomach ache.
13. And that was after I'd been told
14. You'd had enough, you saucy miss;
15. You tempted me, you five-year-old,
16. And bribed me with a hug and kiss.
17. And mother said I mustn't get
18. You roller skates, yet here they are;
19. I haven't dared to tell her yet;
20. Some time, she says, I'll go too far.
21. I gave my word I wouldn't buy
22. These things, for accidents she fears;
23. Now I must tell, when questioned why,
24. Just how you bribed me with your tears.
25. I've tried so hard to do the right,
26. Yet I have broken every vow.
27. I let you do, most every night,
28. The things your mother won't allow.
29. I know that I am doing wrong,
30. Yet all my sense of honor flies,
31. The moment that you come along
32. And bribe me with those wondrous eyes.
