1. Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,
2. Where snow-crowned mountains hold their heads,
3. the vales where children play,
4. Beside the bench and whirring lathe, on every
5. lake and stream
6. And in the depths of earth below, men share a
7. common dreamâ€”
8. The dream our brave forefathers had of freedom
9. and of right,
10. And once again in honor's cause, they rally and
11. unite.

12. Not somewhere in America is love of country
13. found,
14. But east and west and north and south once
15. more the bugles sound,
16. And once again, as one, men stand to break
17. their brother's chains,
18. And make the world a better place, where only
19. justice reigns.
20. The patriotism that is here, is echoed over there,
21. The hero at a certain post is on guard everywhere.
22. O'er humble home and mansion rich the starry
23. banner flies,
24. And far and near throughout the land the men
25. of valor rise.

26. The flag that flutters o'er your home is fluttering
27. far away
28. O'er homes that you have never seen. The same
29. impulses sway
30. The souls of men in distant states. The red, the
31. white and blue
32. Means to one hundred million strong, just what
33. it means to you.
34. The self-same courage resolute you feel and
35. understand
36. Is throbbing in the breasts of men throughout
37. this mighty land.
38. Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,
39. For justice and for liberty all free men work
40. and pray.
