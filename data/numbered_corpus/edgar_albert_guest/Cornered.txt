1. I KNEW it was comin', I'd watched fer a year
2. Without sayin' a word to a soul excep' Ma
3. Of the sweet sort o' things that were happenin' here,
4. An,' 'You orter feel mighty glad of it, Pa!'
5. Was all that she said. But I didn't somehow,
6. I'd a feelin' that only old men understand,
7. I knew it was comin'. And it's happened now!
8. An' I answered yes, when he ast fer her hand.

9. I dodged him six weeks, now it's done, I confess.
10. I contrived it so's he'd never get me alone,
11. I knew all the time that he wanted our Bess,
12. An' that he was eager to make his wants known.
13. But he got me last night, passed me out a see-gar
14. An' while he was talkin' I looked at the band,
15. I knew in my heart that he wouldn't get far
16. Afore he'd get courage an' ask fer her hand.

17. An' I shook like a man with the ague, I guess,
18. Like a fellow must feel when they've doomed him to die,
19. An' I didn't look up when I answered him yes,
20. I was almost ashamed of the tears in each eye.
21. He's honest and clean, he's a man through and through
22. An' as soon as I got my old heart in command,
23. I said: 'Since it must be, I am glad it is you,
24. I give you my best when I give you her hand.'

25. I knew it was comin'. For months I could see
26. It was love that was lightin' those young people's eyes,
27. And so when he finally did corner me
28. I know what he said wasn't any surprise.
29. Now Ma's kissin' 'em both, then she'll come out and cry,
30. An' tomorrow she'll tell me it's perfectly grand;
31. Oh, happy young man, mebbe some day you'll sigh
32. When you're asked to part with your little one's hand.
