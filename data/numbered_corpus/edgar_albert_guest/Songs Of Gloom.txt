1. IF the song I have to sing
2. Is a dreary, gloomy thing,
3. I would rather silent be;
4. If I cannot sing of cheer,
5. I will never let you hear
6. Any song of dole from me.

7. Let no dirge escape my lips,
8. Rather song that gayly trips
9. Than a slow and mournful tone;
10. Let me sing a song of pleasure,
11. In a romping sort of measure,
12. But my woe I'll bear alone.
