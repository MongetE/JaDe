1. I want my boy to love his home,
2. His Mother, yes, and me:
3. I want him, wheresoe'er he'll roam,
4. With us in thought to be.
5. I want him to love what is fine,
6. Nor let his standards drag,
7. But, Oh! I want that boy of mine
8. To love his country's flag!

9. I want him when he older grows
10. To love all things of earth;
11. And Oh! I want him, when he knows,
12. To choose the things of worth.
13. I want him to the heights to climb
14. Nor let ambition lag;
15. But, Oh! I want him all the time
16. To love his country's flag.

17. I want my boy to know the best,
18. I want him to be great;
19. I want him in Life's distant West,
20. Prepared for any fate.
21. I want him to be simple, too,
22. Though clever, ne'er to brag,
23. But, Oh! I want him, through and through,
24. To love his country's flag.

25. I want my boy to be a man,
26. And yet, in distant years,
27. I pray that he'll have eyes that can
28. Not quite keep back the tears
29. When, coming from some foreign shore
30. And alien scenes that fag,
31. Borne on its native breeze, once more
32. He sees his country's flag.
