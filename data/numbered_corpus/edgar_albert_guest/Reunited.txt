1. The hours were long with you away,
2. Although I thought I could forget;
3. I banished you and cursed the day
4. That we had ever met.

5. I frowned upon you, and I vowed
6. That nevermore your charms I 'd seek;
7. I sought new pleasures with the crowd,
8. But I am weak.

9. Temptress I called you, and I swore
10. No longer your demands I 'd serve;
11. Freedom I 'd own forevermore,
12. But lost my nerve.

13. And absent, all my love returned,
14. Not for one moment was I free,
15. For you I nightly, daily yearned;
16. Your slave I 'd be.

17. No charm in anything I found,
18. No lustre in the skies of blue,
19. I merely moped my way around,
20. And sighed for you.

21. I must be made of fragile clay,
22. Unsuited for the hero type,
23. For back to you I come today,
24. Old briar pipe.
