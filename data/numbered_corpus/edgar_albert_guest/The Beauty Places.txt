1. Here she walked and romped about,
2. And here beneath this apple tree
3. Where all the grass is trampled out
4. The swing she loved so used to be.
5. This path is but a path to you,
6. Because my child you never knew.

7. 'Twas here she used to stoop to smell
8. The first bright daffodil of spring;
9. 'Twas here she often tripped and fell
10. And here she heard the robins sing.
11. You'd call this but a common place,
12. But you have never seen her face.

13. And it was here we used to meet.
14. How beautiful a spot is this,
15. To which she gayly raced to greet
16. Her daddy with his evening kiss!
17. You see here nothing grand or fine,
18. But, Oh, what memories are mine!

19. The people pass from day to day
20. And never turn their heads to see
21. The many charms along the way
22. That mean so very much to me.
23. For all things here are speaking of
24. The babe that once was mine to love.
