1. Show me the boy who never threw
2. A stone at someone's cat,
3. Or never hurled a snowball swift
4. At someone's high silk hat  —
5. Who never ran away from school,
6. To seek the swimming hole,
7. Or slyly from a neighbor's yard
8. Green apples never stole  —

9. Show me the boy who never broke
10. A pane of window glass,
11. Who never disobeyed the sign
12. That says: 'Keep off the grass.'
13. Who never did a thousand things,
14. That grieve us sore to tell,
15. And I'll show you a little boy
16. Who must be far from well.
