1. Life is a struggle for peace,
2. A longing for rest,
3. A hope for the battles to cease,
4. A dream for the best;
5. And he is not living who stays
6. Contented with things,
7. Unconcerned with the work of the days
8. And all that it brings.

9. He is dead who sees nothing to change,
10. No wrong to make right;
11. Who travels no new way or strange
12. In search of the light;
13. Who never sets out for a goal
14. That he sees from afar
15. But contents his indifferent soul
16. With things as they are.

17. Life isn't rest- it is toil;
18. It is building a dream;
19. It is tilling a parcel of soil
20. Or bridging a stream;
21. It's pursuing the light of a star
22. That but dimly we see,
23. And in wresting from things as they are
24. The joy that should be.
