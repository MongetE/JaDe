1. A FRIEND of mine said yesterday: 'There goes a man across the way
2. Who paid ten thousand dollars for a home a week ago;
3. He owns an automobile now, a saddle horse and keeps a cow,
4. And smokes cigars at fifty cents a throw.
5. He is a lucky chap, indeed! He got up something that we need,
6. The way he's making money is a shame;
7. It's not five years ago, I swear, he only had one suit to wear
8. And didn't have a dollar to his name.

9. 'There goes a man immensely rich, who was a digger in the ditch
10. Ten years ago, but fortune came his way;
11. I cannot now recall to mind just what it is that he designed,
12. But he got wealth and glory in a day.
13. How fortunate some fellows are! They're born beneath a lucky star —
14. I knew him when he didn't have a cent;
15. And now he owns his house and lot — Too bad, that's something I've forgot,
16. I don't know now just what he did invent.'

17. I said: 'Some fellows strike it rich, but somehow, I've a notion, which
18. Is that you never saw a lucky shirk;
19. I never knew a lazy moke that wasn't nearly always broke —
20. The men who get the money have to work.
21. I do not view with discontent, nor call them lucky who invent
22. The things that quickly bring great fortunes in;
23. The poor men of five years ago, who now possess a 'wad of dough'
24. But prove to me that industry can win.'
