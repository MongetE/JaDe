1. I'd like to be the sort of man
2. the flag could boast about;
3. I'd like to be the sort of man
4. it cannot live without;
5. I'd like to be the type of man
6. That really is American:
7. The head-erect and shoulders-square,
8. Clean-minded fellow, just and fair,
9. That all men picture when they see
10. The glorious banner of the free.

11. I'd like to be the sort of man
12. the flag now typifies,
13. The kind of man we really want
14. the flag to symbolize;
15. The loyal brother to a trust,
16. The big, unselfish soul and just,
17. The friend of every man oppressed,
18. The strong support of all that's best,
19. The sturdy chap the banner's meant,
20. Where'er it flies, to represent.

21. I'd like to be the sort of man
22. the flag's supposed to mean,
23. The man that all in fancy see
24. wherever it is seen,
25. The chap that's ready for a fight
26. Whenever there's a wrong to right,
27. The friend in every time of need,
28. The doer of the daring deed,
29. The clean and generous handed man
30. That is a real American.
