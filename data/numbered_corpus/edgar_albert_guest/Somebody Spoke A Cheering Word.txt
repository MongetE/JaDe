1. SOMEBODY spoke a cheering word,
2. Somebody praised his labor,
3. And something deep in his soul was stirred,
4. That night he smiled at his neighbor.
5. He kissed his wife with a hearty smack,
6. He rode the children upon his back
7. And he sang a tuneful ditty,
8. 'Ho, ho,' he cried to his patient wife,
9. 'I vow that never in all my life
10. Have I seen you look so pretty.'

11. Then into her eyes the love light crept,
12. A smile on her face appeared,
13. She hummed a song as the room she swept,
14. And the children tugged his beard.
15. He told them stories of fairies good,
16. Of pixies out in the distant wood,
17. And the sailors on the sea;
18. And there was a family made gay
19. Just because somebody chanced to say
20. One little word cheerfully.

21. And nobody knows how far it went,
22. And nobody here can say
23. When the morning came and he bravely went
24. To his labors for the day,
25. How much of the courage he showed was due
26. To the smile and the cheering word or two;
27. But this we know, anyhow,
28. That he climbed the ladder to wealth and fame,
29. And a cheering word may do the same
