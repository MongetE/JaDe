1. Somebody wants a new bonnet to wear;
2. Somebody wants a new dress;
3. Somebody needs a new bow for her hair,
4. And never the wanting grows less.
5. Oh, this is the reason I labor each day
6. And this is the joy of my tasks:
7. That deep in the envelope holding my pay
8. Is something that somebody asks.
9. I could go begging for water and bread
10. And travel the highways of ease,
11. But somebody wants a roof over his head
12. And stockings to cover his knees.
13. I could go shirking the duties of life
14. And laugh when necessity pleads,
15. But rather I stand to the toil and the strife
16. To furnish what somebody needs.
17. Somebody wants what I've strength to supply,
18. And somebody's waiting for me
19. To come home to-night with money to buy
20. Her bread and her cake and her tea.
21. And as I am strong so her laughter will ring,
22. And as I am true she will smile;
23. It's the somebody else of the toiler or king
24. That makes all the struggle worth while.
25. Somebody needs all the courage I own,
26. And somebody's trust is in me;
27. For never a man who can go it alone,
28. Whatever his station may be.
29. So I stand to my task and I stand to my care,
30. And struggle to come to success,
31. For the ribbons to tie up somebody's hair,
32. And my somebody's pretty new dress.
