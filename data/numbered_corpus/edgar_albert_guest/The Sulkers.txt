1. The world's too busy now to pause
2. To listen to a whiner's cause;
3. It has no time to stop and pet
4. The sulker in a peevish fret,
5. Who wails he'll neither work nor play

6. Because things haven't gone his way.
7. The world keeps plodding right along
8. And gives its favors right or wrong
9. To all who have the grit to work
10. Regardless of the fool or shirk.
11. The world says this to every man:
12. 'Go out and do the best you can.'

13. The world's too busy to implore
14. The beaten one to try once more;
15. 'Twill help him if he wants to rise,
16. And boost him if he bravely tries,
17. And shows determination grim;
18. But it won't stop to baby him.

19. The world is occupied with men
20. Who fall but quickly rise again;
21. But those who whine because they're hit
22. And step aside to sulk a bit
23. Are doomed some day to wake and find
24. The world has left them far behind.
