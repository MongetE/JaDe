1. An auto is a helpful thing;
2. I love the way the motor hums,
3. I love each cushion and each spring,
4. The way it goes, the way it comes;
5. It saves me many a dreary mile,
6. It brings me quickly to the smile
7. Of those at home, and every day
8. It adds unto my time for play.
9. It keeps me with my friends in touch;
10. No journey now appears too much
11. To make with meetings at the end:
12. It gives me time to be a friend.
13. It laughs at distance, and has power
14. To lengthen every fleeting hour.
15. It bears me into country new
16. That otherwise I'd never view.
17. It's swift and sturdy and it strives
18. To fill with happiness our lives;
19. When for the doctor we've a need
20. It brings him to our door with speed.
21. It saves us hours of anxious care
22. And heavy heartache and despair.
23. It has its faults, but still I sing:
24. The auto is a helpful thing.
