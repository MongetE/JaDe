1. I HOLD the finest picture-books
2. Are woods an' fields an' runnin' brooks;
3. An' when the month o' May has done
4. Her paintin', an' the mornin' sun
5. Is lightin' just exactly right
6. Each gorgeous scene for mortal sight,
7. I steal a day from toil an' go
8. To see the springtime's picture show.

9. It's everywhere I choose to treadâ€”
10. Perhaps I'll find a violet bed
11. Half hidden by the larger scenes,
12. Or group of ferns, or living greens,
13. So graceful an' so fine, I swear
14. That angels must have placed them there
15. To beautify the lonely spot
16. That mortal man would have forgot.

17. What hand can paint a picture book
18. So marvelous as a runnin' brook?
19. It matters not what time o' day
20. You visit it, the sunbeams play
21. Upon it just exactly right,
22. The mysteries of God to light.
23. No human brush could ever trace
24. A droopin' willow with such grace!

25. Page after page, new beauties rise
26. To thrill with gladness an' surprise
27. The soul of him who drops his care
28. And seeks the woods to wander there.
29. Birds, with the angel gift o' song,
30. Make music for him all day long;
31. An' nothin' that is base or mean
32. Disturbs the grandeur of the scene.

33. There is no hint of hate or strife;
34. The woods display the joy of life,
35. An' answer with a silence fine
36. The scoffer's jeer at power divine.
37. When doubt is high an' faith is low,
38. Back to the woods an' fields I go,
39. An' say to violet and tree:
40. 'No mortal hand has fashioned thee.'
