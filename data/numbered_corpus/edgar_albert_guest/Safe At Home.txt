1. Let the old fire blaze
2. An' the youngsters shout
3. An' the dog on the rug
4. Sprawl full length out,
5. An' Mother an' I
6. Sort o' settle down-
7. An' it's little we care
8. For the noisy town.

9. Oh, it's little we care
10. That the wind may blow,
11. An' the streets grow white
12. With the drifted snow;
13. We'll face the storm
14. With the break o' day,
15. But to-night we'll dream
16. An' we'll sing an' play.

17. We'll sit by the fire
18. Where it's snug an' warm,
19. An' pay no heed
20. To the winter storm;
21. With a sheltering roof
22. Let the blizzard roar;
23. We are safe at home-
24. Can a king say more?

25. That's all that counts
26. When the day is done:
27. The smiles of love
28. And the youngsters' fun,
29. The cares put down
30. With the evening gloam-
31. Here's the joy of all:
32. To be safe at home.
