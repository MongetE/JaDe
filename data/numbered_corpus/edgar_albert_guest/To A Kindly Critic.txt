1. If it's wrong to believe in the land that we love
2. And to pray for Our Flag to the good God above;
3. If it's wrong to believe that Our Country is best;
4. That honor's her standard, and truth is her crest;
5. If placing her first in our prayers and our song
6. Is false to true reason, we're glad to be wrong.

7. If it's wrong to wish victory day after day
8. For the troops of Our Country now marching away;
9. If it's wrong to believe they are moved by the right
10. And not by the love and the lure of the fight;
11. If to cheer them to battle and bid them be strong
12. Is false to right thinking, then let us be wrong.

13. If it's wrong to believe in America's dreams
14. Of a freedom on earth that's as real as it seems;
15. If it's error to cherish the hope, through and through,
16. That the Stars in Old Glory's immaculate blue
17. Shall shine through the ages, true beacons to men,
18. We pray that no right phrase shall flow from our pen.
