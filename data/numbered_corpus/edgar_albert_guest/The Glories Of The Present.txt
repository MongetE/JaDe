1. WHAT of the glories after death,
2. When this frail form gives up its breath?
3. Why do we strive to understand
4. The Future when the Now's at hand?
5. What matters it to you and me
6. That o'er some dark mysterious sea
7. Whereon we all must sail some day,
8. Awaits a port where we must stay?

9. It is enough for me to know
10. A brighter place there is to go;
11. I ask not when will come my time,
12. Whether the road is hard to climb,
13. What glories there await for me;
14. I would not solve Death's mystery
15. And still live on â€” I am content
16. To live the life that God has sent.

17. Now is the problem that I strive
18. To solve, while I am yet alive;
19. What am I here for, what to do?
20. Am I unto my purpose true?
21. Do I live, every day a man,
22. Helping and cheering where I can?
23. Am I employing every hour
24. For deeds of good, my gift of power?

25. This is what I prefer to know,
26. Not when or whither I must go;
27. No thought of Future lines my brow,
28. Mine is the problem of the Now.
29. My hopes are not on after-death,
30. But on today while I have breath;
31. If I have done my best while here,
32. I'll face hereafter without fear.
