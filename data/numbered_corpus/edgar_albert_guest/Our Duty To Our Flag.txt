1. Less hate and greed
2. Is what we need
3. And more of service true;
4. More men to love
5. The flag above
6. And keep it first in view.

7. Less boast and brag
8. About the flag,
9. More faith in what it means;
10. More heads erect,
11. More self-respect,
12. Less talk of war machines.

13. The time to fight
14. To keep it bright
15. Is not along the way,
16. Nor 'cross the foam,
17. But here at home
18. Within ourselves -  to-day.

19. 'Tis we must love
20. That flag above
21. With all our might and main;
22. For from our hands,
23. Not distant lands,
24. Shall come dishonor's stain.

25. If that flag be
26. Dishonored, we
27. Have done it, not the foe;
28. If it shall fall
29. We first of all
30. Shall be to strike a blow
