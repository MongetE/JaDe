1. It is better to die for the flag,
2. For its red and its white and its blue,
3. Than to hang back and shirk and to lag
4. And let the flag sink out of view.
5. It is better to give up this life
6. In the heat and the thick of the strife
7. Than to live out your days 'neath a sky,
8. Where Old Glory shall never more fly.

9. The peace that we long for will be
10. Far worse than the war that we dread
11. If never again we're to see
12. The blue, and the white and the red
13. Wind-tossed and sun-kissed in the skies.
14. If ever the Stars and Stripes dies
15. Or loses its lustre and pride,
16. We shall wish in our souls we had died.

17. It is better by far that we die
18. Than that flag shall pass out of the world;
19. If ever it ceases to fly,
20. If ever it's hauled down and furled,
21. Dishonor shall stamp us with shame
22. And freedom be naught but a name,
23. And the few years of dearly-bought breath
24. Will be filled with worse horrors than death.
