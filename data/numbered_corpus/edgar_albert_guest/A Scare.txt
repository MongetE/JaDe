1. There are noises that freeze up the blood,
2. There's the sound of the burglar at night
3. As he's picking the lock, and the thud
4. Of a wind-worried door I thought tight;
5. But there's nothing that frightens me more
6. Nor causes such horrible dread
7. As the bumpety-bump on the floor
8. When the baby falls out of his bed.
9. The coal pile may rattle and roll
10. As it will in its uncanny way,
11. But I keep my nerves under control.
12. The neighbor's pet canine may bay
13. At the moon, and I merely turn o'er,
14. But I lose absolutely my head
15. At that bumpety-bump on the floor
16. When the baby falls out of his bed.
17. A shot may ring out in the street,
18. And 'murder' a woman may yell;
19. I may listen to scurrying feet
20. But I handle myself rather well.
21. A dark house I'll even explore,
22. But my heart stops as though I were dead
23. At that bumpety-bump on the floor
24. When the baby falls out of his bed.
25. I know that the old mothers say
26. That once every baby must fall,
27. That they seldom are hurt in that way
28. And really don't mind it at all;
29. But still terror closes each pore
30. And my hair stands up straight on my head
31. At that bumpety-bump on the floor
32. When the baby falls out of his bed.
