1. She was gentle, she was true,
2. And her tender eyes of blue
3. Seemed to mock the morning sunbeams
4. And the starlight of the night;
5. And her laughter seemed to trill
6. Like the ripple of the rill,
7. And there never was a trouble
8. That she didn't make all right.

9. What though rough had been my way,
10. And the bitter hours of day
11. Had depressed my coward spirit
12. Till it only saw the gloom,
13. She could lift me from the strife
14. And bring back the joy of life,
15. For her smiling presence brightened
16. And made radiant the room.

17. Oh, so simple were her ways,
18. Oh, so merry were the days
19. That we trod life's lane together
20. Hand in hand, like children gay;
21. But my troubles seem to be
22. Mountain high today to me
23. For there are no happy evenings
24. When we laugh them all away.

25. Now the sunbeams dance and smile,
26. But I'm looking all the while
27. For the soft blue eyes of Mary
28. Who has passed beyond the night;
29. But I bravely tread my way
30. For I know there'll come a day
31. When she'll laugh away my sorrows
32. And make all my burdens light.
