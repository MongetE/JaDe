1. If I knew a better land on this glorious world of ours,
2. Where a man gets bigger money and is working shorter hours;
3. If the Briton or the Frenchman had an easier life than mine.
4. I'd pack my goods this minute and I'd sail across the brine.
5. But I notice when an alien wants a land of hope and cheer
6. And a future for his children, he comes out and settles here.

7. Here's the glorious land of Freedom.
8. Here's the milk and honey goal
9. For the peasant out of Russia, for the long subjected Pole.
10. It is here the sons of Italy and men of Austria turn
11. For the comfort of their bodies and the wages they can earn.
12. And with all that men complain of, and with all that goes amiss,
13. There's no happier, better nation on the world's broad face than this.

14. So I'm thinking when I listen to the wails of discontent.
15. And some foreign disbeliever spreads his evil sentiment,
16. That the breed of hate and envy that is sowing sin and shame
17. In this glorious land of Freedom should go back from whence it came.
18. And I hold it is the duty, rich or poor, of every man.
19. Who enjoys this country's bounty to be ALL American.
