1. Their childhood is so brief that we
2. Should hesitate to spoil their fun,
3. We should be very slow to see
4. The things that they should not have done.
5. For such a little while they play
6. Before the rough, long roads they tread,
7. We should be careful every day
8. To send no weeping child to bed.

9. So soon they'll women be and men,
10. With all the cares that grown-ups know,
11. We should be slow to punish, when
12. Their little feet in mischief go.
13. Our whippings should be very few,
14. Yes, very few, and very mild,
15. We should be careful what we do
16. In dealing with a happy child.

17. So few the years that are their own,
18. So brief the time to romp and play,
19. So very quickly are they grown
20. To face the battles of the day
21. That we should hesitate to mar
22. With punishment, however slight,
23. The days that oh, so precious are,
24. And turn to grief a child's delight.

25. Too soon will come the long days when
26. They'll often heavy-hearted be,
27. And they'll look back on childhood then
28. And think of you and think of me.
29. And we should have them then recall
30. When we are sleeping in the grave
31. Not how we punished children small,
32. But how we kissed them and forgave.
