1. IT'S a good old world we're livin' in
2. With all its pain an' sorrow;
3. A world where friends are givin' in
4. To cheer us till tomorrow.
5. A world where folks come forward, when
6. They see our feet are slippin'
7. To help us till we come again
8. To where the honey's drippin'.

9. I reckon that we'd never know
10. How kind an' good our friends are
11. If trouble's face should never show
12. Off yonder where the bends are.
13. If sudden-like there never came
14. A rain to drench a feller
15. We'd miss the friend who made us claim
16. A share of his umbreller.

17. If never came to us a woe
18. That seemed we couldn't bear it,
19. We'd never positively know
20. Which friend would rush to share it.
21. We'd miss a heap of sweetness, too,
22. That we could never borrow,
23. A sweetness no one ever knew,
24. Save it was born of sorrow.

25. This thought old care has driven in,
26. An' grief an' trouble taught me,
27. It's a good old world we're livin' in
28. Despite the woes it's brought me.
29. For had I never shed a tear,
30. Nor known what sorrow's rends are,
31. I never would have learned down here
32. How kind an' good my friends are.
