1. This I heard the Old Flag say
2. As I passed it yesterday:
3. 'Months ago your friendly hands
4. Fastened me on slender strands
5. And with patriotic love
6. Placed me here to wave above
7. You and yours. I heard you say
8. On that long departed day:
9. 'Flag of all that's true and fine,
10. Wave above this house of mine;
11. Be the first at break of day
12. And the last at night to say
13. To the world this word of cheer:
14. Loyalty abideth here.'

15. 'Here on every wind that's blown,
16. O'er your' portal I have flown;
17. Rain and snow have battered me,
18. Storms at night have tattered me;
19. Dust of street and chimney stack
20. Day by day have stained me black,
21. And I've watched you passing there,
22. Wondering how much you care.
23. Have you noticed that your flag,
24. Is to-day a wind-blown rag?
25. Has your love so careless grown
26. By the long neglect you've shown
27. That you never raise your eye
28. To the symbol that you fly?'

29. 'Flag, on which no stain has been,
30. 'Tis my sin that you're unclean,'
31. Then I answered in my shame.
32. 'On my head must lie the blame.
33. Now with patriotic hands
34. I release you from your strands,
35. And a spotless flag shall fly
36. Here to greet each passer-by.
37. Nevermore shall Flag of mine
38. Be a sad and sorry sign
39. Telling all who look above
40. I neglect the thing I love.
41. But my Flag of faith shall be
42. Fit for every eye to see.'
