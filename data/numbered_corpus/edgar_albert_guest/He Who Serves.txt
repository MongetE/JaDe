1. He has not served who gathers gold,
2. Nor has he served, whose life is told
3. In selfish battles he has won,
4. Or deeds of skill that he has done;
5. But he has served who now and then
6. Has helped along his fellow men.

7. The world needs many men today;
8. Red-blooded men along life's way,
9. With cheerful smiles and helping hands,
10. And with the faith that understands
11. The beauty of the simple deed
12. Which serves another's hour of need.

13. Strong men to stand beside the weak,
14. Kind men to hear what others speak;
15. True men to keep our country's laws
16. And guard its honor and its cause;
17. Men who will bravely play life's game
18. Nor ask rewards of gold and fame.

19. Teach me to do the best I can
20. To help and cheer our fellow man;
21. Teach me to lose my selfish need
22. And glory in the larger deed
23. Which smoothes the road, and lights the day
24. For all who chance to come my way.
