1. Under the roof where the laughter rings,
2. That's where I long to be;
3. There are all of the glorious things,
4. Meaning so much to me.
5. There is where striving and toiling ends;
6. There is where always the rainbow bends.

7. Under the roof where the children shout,
8. There is the perfect rest;
9. There is the clamor of greed shut out,
10. Ended the ceaseless quest.
11. Battles I fight through the heat of to-day
12. Are only to add to their hours of play.

13. Under the roof where the eyes are bright,
14. There I would build my fame;
15. There my record of life I'd write;
16. There I would sign my name.
17. There in laughter and true content
18. Let me fashion my monument.

19. Under the roof where the hearts are true,
20. There is my earthly goal;
21. There I am pledged till my work is through,
22. Body and heart and soul.
23. Think you that God will my choice condemn
24. If I have never played false to them?
