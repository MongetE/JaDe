1. The officers' friend is the waiter at camp.
2. In the night air 'twas cold and was bitterly damp,
3. And they asked me to dine, which I readily did,
4. For at dining I've talents I never keep hid.
5. Then a bright-eyed young fellow came in with the meat,
6. And straightway the troop of us started to eat.

7. I silently noticed that young fellow wait
8. At each officer's side 'til he'd filled up his plate;
9. I was startled a bit at the very first look
10. By the size of the helping each officer took,
11. And I thought as I sat there among them that night
12. Of the army's effect on a man's appetite.

13. The waiter at last brought the platter to me
14. And modestly proper I started to be.
15. A small piece of meat then I gracefully took;
16. The young fellow stood there and gave me a look.
17. 'Better get all you want,' he remarked to me then,
18. 'I pass this way once, but I don't come again.'

19. I turned in amazement. He nodded his head
20. In a way that convinced me he meant what he said.
21. I knew from his manner and smile on his lip
22. That the rule in the army is 'no second trip.'
23. And I thought as he left me my food to attack,
24. Life gives us one chance, but it never comes back.
