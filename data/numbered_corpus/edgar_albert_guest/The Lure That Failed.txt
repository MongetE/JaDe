1. I know a wonderful land, I said,
2. Where the skies are always blue,
3. Where on chocolate drops are the children fed,
4. And coconut cookies, too;
5. Where puppy dogs romp at the children's feet,
6. And the liveliest kittens play,
7. And little tin soldiers guard the street
8. To frighten the bears away.
9. This land is reached by a wonderful ship
10. That sails on a golden tide;
11. But never a grown-up makes the tripâ€”
12. It is only a children's ride.
13. And never a cross-patch journeys there,
14. And never a pouting face,
15. For it is the Land of Smiling, where
16. A frown is a big disgrace.
17. Oh, you board the ship when the sun goes down,
18. And over a gentle sea
19. You slip away from the noisy town
20. To the land of the chocolate tree.
21. And there, till the sun comes over the hill,
22. You frolic and romp and play,
23. And of candy and cake you eat your fill,
24. With no one to tell you 'Nay!'
25. So come! It is time for the ship to go
26. To this wonderful land so fair,
27. And gently the summer breezes blow
28. To carry you safely there.
29. So come! Set sail on this golden sea,
30. To the land that is free from dread!
31. 'I know what you mean,' she said to me,
32. 'An' I don't wanna go to bed.'
