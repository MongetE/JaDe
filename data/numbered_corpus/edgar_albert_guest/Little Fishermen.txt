1. A little ship goes out to sea
2. As soon as we have finished tea;
3. Off yonder where the big moon glows
4. This tiny little vessel goes,
5. But never grown-up eyes have seen
6. The ports to which this ship has been;
7. Upon the shore the old folks stand
8. Till morning brings it back to land.

9. In search of smiles this little ship
10. Each evening starts upon a trip;
11. Just smiles enough to last the day
12. Is it allowed to bring away;
13. So nightly to some golden shore
14. It must set out alone for more,
15. And sail the rippling sea for miles
16. Until the hold is full of smiles.

17. By gentle hands the sails are spread;
18. The stars are glistening overhead
19. And in that hour when tiny ships
20. Prepare to make their evening trips
21. The sea becomes a wondrous place,
22. As beautiful as mother's face;
23. And all the day's disturbing cries
24. Give way to soothing lullabies.

25. No clang of bell or warning shout
26. Is heard on shore when they put out;
27. The little vessels slip away
28. As silently as does the day.
29. And all night long on sands of gold
30. They cast their nets, and fill the hold
31. With smiles and joys beyond compare,
32. To cheer a world that's sad with care.
