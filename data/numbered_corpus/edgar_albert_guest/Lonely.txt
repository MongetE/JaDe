1. The walls have seemed to say to me
2. Where have the sticky fingers gone
3. That always found their way to me,
4. And left their prints to gaze upon.
5. The halls have worn a gloomy air
6. And seemed like tunnels, dark and black,
7. And it has seemed that every chair
8. Has asked me when they're coming back.

9. The stairs have seemed to speak to me
10. Each night as I have climbed alone,
11. And pitifully squeak to me:
12. 'Where have the little people flown?'
13. The beds all smooth and sternly kept
14. Have said with faces drawn and white
15. Where are the curly heads that slept
16. On us, so sweetly, every night?

17. The untouched toys have stared at me
18. As if to say the days are long,
19. And all their dolls have glared at me
20. As though accusing me of wrong.
21. And every rug so straight and stiff
22. Has seemed to sigh for rumpling feet,
23. And worn a sorry look as if
24. It missed the mud-tracks of the street.

25. The bird has twittered low to me
26. A sort of solemn, sad refrain
27. As though he tried to show to me
28. He wishes they were near again.
29. But soon the walls and halls and chairs
30. Will know once more the charm they lack,
31. And little feet will race the stairs,
32. They've sent me word they're coming back.
