1. He isn't long on speeches. At the banquet table, he
2. Could name a dozen places where he would much rather be.
3. He's not one for fuss and feathers or for marching in review,
4. But he's busy every minute when he's got a job to do.
5. And you'll find him in the open, fighting hard and fighting square
6. For the glory of his country when his boys get over there.

7. He has listened to the cheering of the splendid folks of France,
8. And he knows that he's the leader of America's advance,
9. And he knows his task is mighty and that words will not avail,
10. So he's standing to his duty, for he isn't there to fail.
11. And you'll find him cool and steady when the guns begin to flare,
12. And he'll talk in deeds of glory when his boys get over there.

13. He has gone to face the fury of the Prussian hordes that sweep
14. O'er the fertile fields of Freedom, where the forms of heroes sleep,
15. And it seems no time for talking or for laughter or for cheers,
16. With the wounded all about him and their moaning in his ears.
17. He is waiting for to-morrow, waiting there to do his share,
18. And he'll strike a blow for freedom when his boys get over there.
