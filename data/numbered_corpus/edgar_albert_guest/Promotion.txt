1. Promotion comes to him who sticks
2. Unto his work and never kicks,
3. Who watches neither clock nor sun
4. To tell him when his task is done;
5. Who toils not by a stated chart,
6. Defining to a jot his part,
7. But gladly does a little more
8. Than he's remunerated for.
9. The man, in factory or shop,
10. Who rises quickly to the top,
11. Is he who gives what can't be bought:
12. Intelligent and careful thought.

14. The service that promotion wins,

16. By certain hours or any kind
17. Of system that has been devised;
18. Merit cannot be systemized.
19. It is at work when it's at play;
20. It serves each minute of the day;
21. 'Tis always at its post, to see
22. New ways of help and use to be.
23. Merit from duty never slinks,
24. Its cardinal virtue is â€” it thinks!

25. Promotion comes to him who tries
26. Not solely for a selfish prize,
27. But day by day and year by year
28. Holds his employer's interests dear.
29. Who measures not by what he earns
30. The sum of labor he returns,
31. Nor counts his day of toiling through
32. Till he's done all that he can do.
33. His strength is not of muscle bred,
34. But of the heart and of the head.
35. The man who would the top attain
36. Must demonstrate .he has a brain.
