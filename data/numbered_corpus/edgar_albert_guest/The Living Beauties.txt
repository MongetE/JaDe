1. I never knew, until they went,
2. How much their laughter really meant
3. I never knew how much the place
4. Depended on each little face;
5. How barren home could be and drear
6. Without its living beauties here.

7. I never knew that chairs and books
8. Could wear such sad and solemn looks!
9. That rooms and halls could be at night
10. So still and drained of all delight.
11. This home is now but brick and board
12. Where bits of furniture are stored.

13. I used to think I loved each shelf
14. And room for what it was itself.
15. And once I thought each picture fine
16. Because I proudly called it mine.
17. But now I know they mean no more
18. Than art works hanging in a store.

19. Until they went away to roam
20. I never knew what made it home.
21. But I have learned that all is base,
22. However wonderful the place
23. And decked with costly treasures, rare,
24. Unless the living joys are there.
