1. The lady what comes up to our house t' wash
2. Is awfully poor, an' she's got
3. Three babies t' care for, an' that's why she works,
4. An' that's why she worries a lot.
5. An' Ma says her husband don't help her at all,
6. An' Pa says it's plainly a case
7. Where we should be kind t' the woman, becoz
8. Real poverty ain't no disgrace.

9. An' yesterday mornin' I went down t' her
10. An' told her what my Pa had said,
11. An' she started t' cry, an' she dried off her hands
12. An' stooped down an' patted my head.
13. Then I ast if her husband worked hard like my Pa,
14. Or couldn't he get work t' do,
15. Then she wiped off her tears an' smiled as she said:
16. 'What a queer little fellow are you!'

17. Then she told me her husband was no good at all,
18. But jes' loafs around all the day,
19. An' that's why she comes up t' our house t' wash,
20. So's she can get money t' pay
21. For stockin's an' things for her children t' wear,
22. An' buy 'em the food that they eat;
23. Coz if she didn't do it the landlord would come
24. An' turn 'em all into the street.

25. An' her husband ain't sick. He's as strong as my Pa,
26. An' I told her that I'd be ashamed
27. If I was so poor, not t' get out an' work,
28. Unless I was crippled an' lamed.
29. Then she kissed me an' told me t' run out an' play,
30. But I'm thinkin' as hard as I can
31. That sometimes it happens that poverty is
32. An awful disgrace to a man.
