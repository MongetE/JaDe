1. There's no lock upon your door,
2. And the polish that you wore
3. In the years ago when you were bright and new
4. Now has lost its splendid shine,
5. And your driver's bending spine
6. Shows that he's been getting old along with you.
7. You are slipping fast, I see;
8. So indeed, old bus, is he;
9. But you rattle and you bang along the street,
10. And I wonder as you go
11. What of joy or what of woe
12. You'll discover when the limited you meet.

13. Who is coming home once more
14. To his father's welcome door?
15. Is it failure or success that he will bring?
16. Is a daughter slipping back
17. From the city's cruel track
18. For the lullaby that mother used to sing?
19. Is she happy? Is she sad?
20. For I know, old bus, you've had
21. Both your passengers a thousand times or more;
22. And old driver, you can't hide
23. Just how many times you've sighed
24. As you've opened or have shut that shaky door.

25. You have seen them go away,
26. Full of strength and hope and gay,
27. You have seen them start as children fine — and then —
28. When the limited you've met,
29. Both your kindly eyes were wet
30. As you saw them back as women and as men.
31. You have read the tale of life,
32. Read the heartache and the strife,
33. Read the sorrows that we'd better not discuss,
34. Read the joy of splendid things
35. And the pain that failure brings,
36. As you've carried all that's human in your bus.

37. So I wonder as you go
38. What you'll find of joy or woe
39. When the limited pulls in on time today;
40. What of conquest or defeat
41. Will it be your lot to meet
42. And to welcome in your gentle, kindly way.
43. Both your shaky bus and you
44. With life's toil are nearly through,
45. Soon your soul upon a journey far will roam;
46. And I like to think you'll ask
47. God to let it be your task
48. To welcome all the children coming home.
