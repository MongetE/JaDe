1. His room is as it used to be
2. Before he went away,
3. The walls still keep the pennants he
4. Brought home but yesterday.
5. The picture of his baseball team
6. Still holds its favored spot,
7. And oh, it seems a dreadful dream
8. This age of shell and shot!

9. His golf clubs in the corner stand;
10. His tennis racket, too,
11. That once the pressure of his hand
12. In times of laughter knew
13. Is in the place it long has kept
14. For us to look upon.
15. The room is as it was, except
16. The boy, himself, has gone.

17. The pictures of his girls are here,
18. Still smiling as of yore,
19. And everything that he held dear
20. Is treasured as before.
21. Into his room his mother goes
22. As usual, day by day,
23. And cares for it, although she knows
24. Our boy is far away.

25. We keep it as he left it, when
26. He bade us all good-bye,
27. Though I confess that, now and then,
28. We view it with a sigh.
29. For never night shall thrill with joy
30. Nor day be free from gloom
31. Until once more our soldier boy
32. Shall occupy his room.
