1. Give me the house where the toys are strewn,
2. Where the dolls are asleep in the chairs,
3. Where the building blocks and the toy balloon
4. And the soldiers guard the stairs.
5. Let me step in a house where the tiny cart
6. With the horses rules the floor,
7. And rest comes into my weary heart,
8. For I am at home once more.

9. Give me the house with the toys about,
10. With the battered old train of cars,
11. The box of paints and the books left out,
12. And the ship with her broken spars.
13. Let me step in a house at the close of day
14. That is littered with children's toys,
15. And dwell once more in the haunts of play,
16. With the echoes of by-gone noise.

17. Give me the house where the toys are seen,
18. The house where the children romp,
19. And I'll happier be than man has been
20. 'Neath the gilded dome of pomp.
21. Let me see the litter of bright-eyed play
22. Strewn over the parlor floor,
23. And the joys I knew in a far-off day
24. Will gladden my heart once more.

25. Whoever has lived in a toy-strewn home,
26. Though feeble he be and gray,
27. Will yearn, no matter how far he roam,
28. For the glorious disarray
29. Of the little home with its littered floor
30. That was his in the by-gone days;
31. And his heart will throb as it throbbed before,
32. When he rests where a baby plays.
