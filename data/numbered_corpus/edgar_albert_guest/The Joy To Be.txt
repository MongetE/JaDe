1. Oh, mother, be you brave of heart and keep
2. your bright eyes shining;
3. Some day the smiles of joy shall start and you
4. shall cease repining.
5. Beyond the dim and distant line the days of
6. peace are waiting,
7. When you shall have your soldier fine, and men
8. shall turn from hating.

9. Oh, mother, bear the pain a-while, as long ago
10. you bore it;
11. You suffered then to win his smile, and you
12. were happier for it;
13. And now you suffer once again, and bear your
14. weight of sorrow;
15. Yet you shall thrill with gladness when he wins
16. the glad to-morrow.

17. Oh, mother, when the cannons roar and all the
18. brave are fighting,
19. Remember that the son you bore the wrongs
20. of earth is righting;
21. Remember through the hours of pain that he
22. with all his brothers
23. Is battling there to win again a happy world
24. for mothers.
