1. I DO not ask for roses all the time,
2. For blue skies bending o'er me every day,
3. I do not ask for easy hills to climb,
4. And always for my feet a pleasant way.
5. In laughter I would not spend all my life,
6. And miss the joy of sweet and sacred pain;
7. I want to know life's burden and its strife,
8. And feel upon my cheek the splash of rain.

9. I merely pray for strength enough to bear
10. My burdens, and to tread the rugged way;
11. To keep the right, howe'er beset with care,
12. To stand, unflinching, face front, to the fray.
13. And I would claim life's roses for my own,
14. But I would win my right to know their sweet;
15. To level paths I'd march my way alone,
16. For victory I'd venture with defeat.
