1. I WOULD like to wed your daughter,' said the multi-millionaire,
2. 'I will try to make her happy; if I don't you needn't care;
3. She shall have five million dollars just the minute we are married;
4. Say the word and I will take her'—but the maiden's father tarried.

5. 'Every luxury I'll give her, she shall dress in finest raiment
6. And the moment we are married I shall make the wedding payment;
7. She'll be worth five million dollars when the wedding vows are said,
8. Will you say that it's a bargain?'—but the father hung his head.

9. 'It is true I'm almost fifty and your daughter's scarce eighteen.
10. But she'll live a life of splendor, she shall be a social queen;
11. She shall dine with kings and princes and by royalty be favored,
12. And she'll have five million dollars'—here the tempted father wavered.

13. Oh! I would that I could write it, that before the father's eyes
14. Came the picture of the baby that he'd learned to idolize;
15. Came his little girl at evening for a romp upon his knee,
16. Came the little roguish lassie of the days that used to be.

17. Had there come that very moment when he saw the rich man's check
18. Just a vision of his baby with her arms about his neck;
19. Had his eyes turned back one minute to the days of long ago,
20. Then he never would have wavered—he'd have fairly shouted: 'No.'
