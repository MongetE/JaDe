1. When mother sleeps, a slamming door
2. Disturbs her not at all;
3. A man might walk across the floor
4. Or wander through the hall
5. A pistol shot outside would not
6. Drive slumber from her eyesâ€”
7. But she is always on the spot
8. The moment baby cries.
9. The thunder crash she would not hear,
10. Nor shouting in the street;
11. A barking dog, however near,
12. Of sleep can never cheat
13. Dear mother, but I've noticed this
14. To my profound surprise:
15. That always wide-awake she is
16. The moment baby cries.
17. However weary she may be,
18. Though wrapped in slumber deep,
19. Somehow it always seems to me
20. Her vigil she will keep.
21. Sound sleeper that she is, I take
22. It in her heart there lies
23. A love that causes her to wake
24. The moment baby cries.
