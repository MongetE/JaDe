1. I DO not care for garments fine,
2. I do not care for medals bright;
3. I have no wish to quench with wine
4. My thirst when I go home at night.
5. I'm satisfied with work to do,
6. And I'm content to bear my load
7. If only I can carve and hew
8. For those I love a better road.

9. I have no wish for luxury
10. If I must live it all alone;
11. Nor do I toil that I may be
12. By many strangers better known.
13. If I were here to toil for self
14. I'd have a very simple code,
15. And I'd need very little pelf—
16. But I'm the builder of a road.

17. I'm on this earth to pioneer
18. For those who follow after me,
19. According to my service here
20. Their chance for splendid life will be.
21. Into the future I must tread
22. Nor whimper at the present goad;
23. 'Tis mine to blaze the path ahead,
24. I am the builder of a road.
25. I dare not shirk what task I find,
26. I dare not falsely step aside,
27. Nor leave the tangled brush behind.
28. My pathway must be clear and wide.
29. For they will tread the way I go,
30. They'll come to reap the seed I sowed
31. When I am sleeping 'neath the snow,
32. I am the builder of a road.
33. It is for them I face the front
34. And strive to keep my pathway straight,
35. It is for them I bear the brunt
36. Of selfishness and bitter hate.
37. That they may know a smoother way,
38. That they may bear a lighter load,
39. I, smiling, face the heat of day—
40. I am the builder of a road.
