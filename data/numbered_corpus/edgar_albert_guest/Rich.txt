1. Who has a troop of romping youth
2. About his parlour floor,
3. Who nightly hears a round of cheers,
4. When he is at the door,
5. Who is attacked on every side
6. By eager little hands
7. That reach to tug his grizzled mug,
8. The wealth of earth commands.

9. Who knows the joys of girls and boys,
10. His lads and lassies, too,
11. Who's pounced upon and bounced upon
12. When his day's work is through,
13. Whose trousers know the gentle tug
14. Of some glad little tot,
15. The baby of his crew of love,
16. Is wealthier than a lot.

17. Oh, be he poor and sore distressed
18. And weary with the fight,
19. If with a whoop his healthy troop
20. Run, welcoming at night,
21. And kisses greet him at the end
22. Of all his toiling grim,
23. With what is best in life he's blest
24. And rich men envy him.
