1. Comes in flying from the street;
2. 'Where's Mamma?'Friend or stranger thus he'll greet:
3. 'Where's Mamma?'Doesn't want to say hello,
4. Home from school or play he'll go
5. Straight to what he wants to know:
6. 'Where's Mamma?'
7. Many times a day he'll shout,
8. 'Where's Mamma?'Seems afraid that she's gone out;
9. 'Where's Mamma?'Is his first thought at the door-
10. She's the one he's looking for,
11. And he questions o'er and o'er,
12. 'Where's Mamma?'
13. Can't be happy till he knows:
14. 'Where's Mamma?'So he begs us to disclose
15. 'Where's Mamma?'And it often seems to me,
16. As I hear his anxious plea,
17. That no sweeter phrase can be:
18. 'Where's Mamma?'
19. Like to hear it day by day;
20. 'Where's Mamma?'Loveliest phrase that lips can say:
21. 'Where's Mamma?'And I pray as time shall flow,
22. And the long years come and go,
23. That he'll always want to know
24. 'Where's Mamma?'
