1. The child world is a wondrous world,
2. For there the flags of hate are furled,
3. And there the imps of wickedness
4. Cause neither sorrow nor distress.
5. And there is never strife for gold,
6. There petty gossip's never told,
7. There all is joy and wondrous mirth,
8. The child earth is a glorious earth.

9. The land of childhood is aglow
10. With smiles, and there pink roses grow
11. Upon the cheeks of boys and girls;
12. The golden rod is yellow curls,
13. And eyes of brown and eyes of blue
14. Are daisies and the violets, too;
15. And warm and true is every hand
16. That clings to yours in Childhood Land.

17. Who owns a spot on childhood's globe
18. Envies no king his ermine robe;
19. Envies no sage his manners wise,â€”
20. His world is rich with glad surprise,
21. The quaintest of all speech he hears,
22. The truest smiles, the sweetest tears
23. Are his possessions every day
24. However troubled be his way.

25. Who knows the joys of Childhood Land,
26. The pressure of a tiny hand,
27. The joy that's in a babe's caress,
28. The soft embrace of happiness,
29. The sweet good-nights, the shouts of glee
30. That greet the morning lustily,
31. Has riches, those who childless live
32. To know, would all their fortunes give.
