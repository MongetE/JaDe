1. We shall thank our God for graces
2. That we've never known before;
3. We shall look on manlier faces
4. When our troubled days are o'er.
5. We shall rise a better nation
6. From the battle's grief and grime,
7. And shall win our soul's salvation
8. In this bitter trial time.
9. And the old Flag waving o'er us
10. In the dancing morning sun
11. Will be daily singing for us
12. Of a splendor new begun.

13. When the rifles cease to rattle
14. And the cannon cease to roar,
15. When is passed the smoke of battle
16. And the death lists are no more,
17. With a yet undreamed of beauty
18. As a people we shall rise,
19. And a love of right and duty
20. Shall be gleaming in our eyes.
21. As a country, tried by sorrow,
22. With a heritage of worth,
23. We shall stand in that to-morrow
24. With the leaders of the earth.
