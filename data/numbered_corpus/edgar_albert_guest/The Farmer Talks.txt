1. HERE 's a letter from John in th' city,
2. Ain't heard from him now fer a year;
3. Yes, his handwritin' s stylish an' pretty,
4. An' rounded an' wonderf'ly clear;
5. Says he hopes we are all well an' thrivin',
6. Remarks that June's been rather cool,
7. But I know jes' at what he is drivin'
8. When he says that the kids have done school.

9. Don't hear much from John through the winter,
10. Excep' when I go into town,
11. An' then he don't even begin ter
12. Warm up or git rid of his frown;
13. Guess he ain't fond of much entertainin',
14. An' mebbe thinks I am a fool,
15. Yet, I know jes' why he's explainin'
16. The kids will be soon out of school.

17. Poor John ain't got much excep' trouble,
18. A mortgage or two an' some debts.
19. An' I sell a hog fer jes' double
20. The weekly amount that he gets;
21. But still John is given ter braggin',
22. In the city that's often the rule;
23. An' his wife is eternally naggin'—
24. So the kids will be soon out of school.

25. Well, I guess that I'll send fer 'em, Jenny,
26. Though I ain't got much use fer John,
27. An' I wouldn't favor him any,
28. But now that th' summer is on,
29. Those youngsters need sunshine, I 'm thinkin',
30. An' air that is fresh an' is cool;
31. I 'm writin' him — darn me, I 'm blinkin'—
32. To send 'em when they 're out of school.
