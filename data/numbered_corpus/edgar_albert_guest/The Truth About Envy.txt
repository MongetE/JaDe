1. I like to see the flowers grow,
2. To see the pansies in a row;
3. I think a well-kept garden's fine,
4. And wish that such a one were mine;
5. But one can't have a stock of flowers
6. Unless he digs and digs for hours.
7. My ground is always bleak and bare;
8. The roses do not flourish there.
9. And where I once sowed poppy seeds
10. Is now a tangled mass of weeds.'
11. I'm fond of flowers, but admit,
12. For digging I don't care a bit.
13. I envy men whose yards are gay,
14. But never work as hard as they;
15. I also envy men who own
16. More wealth than I have ever known.
17. I'm like a lot of men who yearn
18. For joys that they refuse to earn.
19. You cannot have the joys of work
20. And take the comfort of a shirk.
21. I find the man I envy most
22. Is he who's longest at his post.
23. I could have gold and roses, too,
24. If I would work like those who do.
