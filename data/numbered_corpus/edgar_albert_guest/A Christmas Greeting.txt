1. Here's to you, little mother,
2. With your boy so far away;
3. May the joy of service smother
4. All your grief this Christmas day;
5. May the magic of his splendor
6. Thrill your spirit through and through
7. And may all that's fine and tender
8. Make a smiling day for you.

9. May you never know the sadness
10. That from day to day you dread;
11. May you never find but gladness
12. In the Flag that's overhead;
13. May the good God watch above him
14. As he stands to duty stern,
15. And at last to all who love him
16. May he have a safe return.

17. Little mother, take the blessing
18. Of a grateful nation's heart;
19. May the news that is distressing
20. Never cause your tears to start;
21. May there be no fears to haunt you,
22. And no lonely hours and sad;
23. May your trials never daunt you,
24. But may every day be glad.

25. Little Mother, could I do it,
26. This my Christmas gift would be:
27. That he'd safely battle through it,
28. This to you I'd guarantee.
29. And I'd pledge to you this morning
30. Joys to banish all your cares,
31. Gifts of gold and silver scorning,
32. I would answer all your prayers.
