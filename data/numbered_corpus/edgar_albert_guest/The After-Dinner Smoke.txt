1. THROUGH the smoke clouds that I blow
2. I can see the Long Ago
3. And the merry lanes of boyhood
4. That I gayly used to tread;
5. See the crows upon the wing,
6. Hear the thrushes sweetly sing,
7. And once more I 'm stretched out dreaming
8. With the green grass for a bed.

9. As I slowly puff away,
10. I 'm a boy once more at play,
11. I am angling for the catfish
12. Or I 'm swimming with my chums;
13. Now I chaw green apples, too,
14. Underneath God's stretch of blue,
15. With not a thought of trouble
16. Or the pain that after comes.

17. As the blue smoke slowly curls,
18. Once again I see the girls
19. In their little gingham dresses
20. And their faces berry-brown;
21. Then one little maid I see
22. Who was all in all to me
23. In the days before I journeyed
24. From the old home to the town.

25. Now she comes into the room
26. Where I 'm dreaming in the gloom,
27. And she says the air is frightful,
28. And she starts to gasp and choke;
29. But, of course, she doesn't know
30. How the days of Long Ago
31. Come back to me each evening
32. In my after-dinner smoke.
