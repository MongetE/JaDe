1. If we were all alike, what a dreadful world 'twould be!
2. No one would know which one was you or which of us was me.
3. We'd never have a 'Skinny' or a 'Freckles' or a 'Fat,'
4. An' there wouldn't be a sissy boy to wear a velvet hat;
5. An' we'd all of us be pitchers when we played a baseball match,
6. For we'd never have a feller who'd have nerve enough to catch.

7. If we were all alike an' looked an' thought the same,
8. I wonder how'd they call us, 'cause there'd only be one name.
9. An' there'd only be one flavor for our ice cream sodas, too,
10. An' one color for a necktie an' I 'spose that would be blue;
11. An' maybe we'd have mothers who were very fond of curls,
12. An' they'd make us fellers wear our hair like lovely little girls.

13. Sometimes I think it's funny when I hear some feller say
14. That he isn't fond of chocolate, when I eat it every day.
15. Or some other fellow doesn't like the books I like to read;
16. But I'm glad that we are different, yes, siree! I am indeed.
17. If everybody looked alike an' talked alike, Oh, Gee!
18. We'd never know which one was you or which of us was me.
