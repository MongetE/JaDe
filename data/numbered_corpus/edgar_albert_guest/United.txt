1. Forgotten petty difference now,
2. The larger purpose glows,
3. The storm is here, a common fear
4. Its deadly lightning shows.
5. The Ship of State must bear us all
6. And danger makes us kin,
7. As one, we all shall rise or fall,
8. So shall we strive to win.

9. Our banner's flying at the mast,
10. Our course lies straight ahead;
11. The ocean's trough is deep and rough,
12. The waves are stained with red.
13. The bond of danger tighter grows,
14. We serve a common plan;
15. Send o'er the sea the word that we
16. Are all American.

17. One hundred million sturdy souls
18. Once more united stand,
19. As one, you will find them all behind
20. The banner of our land.
21. And side by side they work to-day
22. In silken garb or rag,
23. And once again our troops of men
24. Are brothers of the flag.

25. And from the storm that hovers low,
26. And from the angry sea
27. Where dangers lurk and hate's at work.
28. Shall come new victory.
29. The flag shall know not race nor creed,
30. Nor different bands of men;
31. A people strong round it shall throng
32. To ne'er divide again.
