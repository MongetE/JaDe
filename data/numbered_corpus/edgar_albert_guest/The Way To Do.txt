1. "How's things?" says I,
2. Says he 'Not bad,
3. They might be worse,
4. But then I 'm glad
5. They ain't.' That's all
6. He had to say,
7. An' whistled as
8. He went away.

9. He had his troubles,
10. That I knew,
11. And sorrows also
12. Grieved him, too.
13. But not a word
14. Of them, says he,
15. But kep' 'em to
16. Himself, you see.

17. 'How's things? ' says I,
18. 'Not bad,' says he,
19. 'They might be worse,'
20. An' seems to me,
21. That's jes' the thing
22. We all should say
23. About our troubles
24. Every day.

25. They might be worse,
26. Of course they might.
27. This thought should put
28. Our gloom to flight.
29. Let's cease our
30. Troubles to rehearse,
31. And tell our friends
32. They might be worse.
