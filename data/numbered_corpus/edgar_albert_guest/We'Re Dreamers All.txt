1. Oh, man must dream of gladness wherever his pathways lead,
2. And a hint of something better is written in every creed;
3. And nobody wakes at morning but hopes ere the day is o'er
4. To have come to a richer pleasure than ever he's known before.

5. For man is a dreamer ever. He glimpses the hills afar
6. And plans for the joys off yonder where all his to-morrows are;
7. When trials and cares beset him, in the distance he still can see
8. A hint of a future splendid and the glory that is to be.

9. There's never a man among us but cherishes dreams of rest;
10. We toil for that something better than that which is now our best.
11. Oh, what if the cup be bitter and what if we're racked with pain?
12. There are wonderful days to follow when never we'll grieve again.

13. Back of the sound of the hammer, and back of the hissing steam,
14. And back of the hand at the throttle is ever a lofty dream;
15. All of us, great or humble, look over the present need
16. To the dawn of the glad to-morrow which is promised in every creed.
