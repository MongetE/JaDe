1. You'll learn when you're older, that chip on your shoulder
2. Which you dare other boys to upset
3. And stand up and fight for, and struggle and smite for,
4. Has caused you much pain and regret.
5. When Time, life's adviser, has made you much wiser,
6. You won't be so quick with the blow;
7. You won't be so willing to fight for a shilling,
8. And change a good friend to a foe.
9. You won't be a sticker for trifles, and bicker
10. And quarrel for nothing at all;
11. You'll grow to be kinder, more thoughtful, and blinder
12. To faults which are petty and small.
13. You won't take the trouble your two fists to double
14. When some one your pride may offend;
15. When with rage now you bristle you'll smile or you'll whistle,
16. And keep the good will of a friend.
17. You'll learn when you're older, that chip on your shoulder
18. Which proudly you battle to guard,
19. Has frequently shamed you and often defamed you,
20. And left you a record that's marred!
21. When you've grown calm and steady, you won't be so ready
22. To fight for a difference that's small
23. For you'll know, when you're older, that chip on your shoulder
24. Is only a chip after all.
