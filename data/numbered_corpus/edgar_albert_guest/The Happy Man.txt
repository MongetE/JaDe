1. If you would know a happy man,
2. Go find the fellow who
3. Has had a bout with trouble grim
4. And just come smiling through.
5. The load is off his shoulders now,
6. Where yesterday he frowned
7. And saw no joy in life, to-day
8. He laughs his way around.

9. He's done the very thing he thought
10. That he could never do;
11. His sun is shining high to-day
12. And all his skies are blue.

13. He's stronger than he was before;
14. Should trouble come anew
15. He'll know how much his strength can bear
16. And how much he can do.

17. To-day he has the right to smile,
18. And he may gaily sing,
19. For he has conquered where he feared
20. The pain of failure's sting.

21. Comparison has taught him, too,
22. The sweetest hours are those
23. Which follow on the heels of care,
24. With laughter and repose.

25. If you would meet a happy man,
26. Go find the fellow who
27. Has had a bout with trouble grim
28. And just come smiling through.
