1. The finest tribute we can pay
2. Unto our hero dead to-day,
3. Is not a rose wreath, white and red,
4. In memory of the blood they shed;
5. It is to stand beside each mound,
6. Each couch of consecrated ground,
7. And pledge ourselves as warriors true
8. Unto the work they died to do.

9. Into God's valleys where they lie
10. At rest, beneath the open sky,
11. Triumphant now o'er every foe,
12. As living tributes let us go.
13. No wreath of rose or immortelles
14. Or spoken word or tolling bells
15. Will do to-day, unless we give
16. Our pledge that liberty shall live.

17. Our hearts must be the roses red
18. We place above our hero dead;
19. To-day beside their graves we must
20. Renew allegiance to their trust;
21. Must bare our heads and humbly say
22. We hold the Flag as dear as they,
23. And stand, as once they stood, to die
24. To keep the Stars and Stripes on high.

25. The finest tribute we can pay
26. Unto our hero dead to-day
27. Is not of speech or roses red,
28. But living, throbbing hearts instead,
29. That shall renew the pledge they sealed
30. With death upon the battlefield:
31. That freedom's flag shall bear no stain
32. And free men wear no tyrant's chain.
