1. TAKE your troubles
2. Best you can.Stand right up
3. And play the man.

4. Face 'em just
5. As though you knew
6. You were coming
7. Safely through.

8. Blows will hurt
9. And bruise you, maybe,
10. But don't whimper
11. Like a baby.

12. Stand right up
13. And be a man.
14. Meet your troubles
15. Best you can.
