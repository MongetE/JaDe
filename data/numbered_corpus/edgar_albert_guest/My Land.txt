1. My land is where the kind folks are,
2. And where the friends are true,
3. Where comrades brave will travel far
4. Some kindly deed to do.
5. My land is where the smiles are bright
6. And where the speech is sweet,
7. And where men cling to what is right
8. Regardless of defeat.
9. My land is where the starry flag
10. Gleams brightly in the sun;
11. The land of rugged mountain crag,
12. The land where rivers run,
13. Where cheeks are tanned and hearts are bold
14. And women fair to see,
15. And all is not a strife for goldâ€”
16. That land is home to me.
17. My land is where the children play,
18. And where the roses bloom,
19. And where to break the peaceful day
20. No flaming cannons boom.
21. My land's the land of honest toil,
22. Of laughter, dance and song,
23. Where harvests crown the fertile soil
24. And thoughtful are the strong.
25. My land's the land of many creeds
26. And tolerance for all
27. It is the land of 'splendid deeds
28. Where men are seldom small.
29. And though the world should bid me roam,
30. Its distant scenes to see,
31. My land would keep my heart at home
32. And there I'd always be.
