1. To gentle ways I am inclined;
2. I have no wish to kill.
3. To creatures dumb I would be kind;
4. I like them all, but still
5. Right now I think I'd like to be
6. Beside some rippling brook,
7. And grab a worm I'd brought with me
8. And slip him on a hook.

9. I'd like to put my hand once more
10. Into a rusty can
11. And turn those squirmy creatures o'er
12. Like nuggets in a pan;
13. And for a big one, once again,
14. With eager eyes I'd look,
15. As did a boy I knew, and then
16. Impale it on a hook.

17. I've had my share of fishing joy,
18. I've fished with patent bait,
19. With chub and minnow, but the boy
20. Is lord of sport's estate
21. And no such pleasure comes to man
22. So rare as when he took
23. A worm from a tomato can
24. And slipped it on a hook.

25. I'd like to gaze with glowing eyes
26. Upon that precious bait,
27. To view each fat worm as a prize
28. To be accounted great.
29. And though I've passed from boyhood's term,
30. And opened age's book,
31. I still would like to put a worm
32. That wriggled on a hook.
