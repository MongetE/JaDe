1. The world is needing you and me,
2. In places where we ought to be;
3. Somewhere today it's needing you
4. To stand for what you know is true.
5. And needing me somewhere today.
6. To keep the faith, let come what may.

7. The world needs honest men today
8. To lead its youth along the way,
9. Men who will write in all their deeds
10. The beauty of their spoken creeds,
11. And spurn advantage here and gain,
12. On which deceit must leave its stain.

13. The world needs men who will not brag,
14. Men who will honor Freedom's Flag,
15. Men, who although the way is hard,
16. Against the lure of shame will guard,
17. The world needs gentle men and true
18. And calls aloud to me and you.

19. The world needs men of lofty aim,
20. Not merely men of skill and fame,
21. Not merely leaders wise and grave,
22. Or learned men or soldiers brave,
23. But men whose lives are fair to see,
24. Such men as you and I can be.
