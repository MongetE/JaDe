1. I must get out to the woods again, to the whispering tree, and the birds a-wing,
2. Away from the haunts of pale-faced men, to the spaces wide where strength is king;
3. I must get out where the skies are blue and the air is clean and the rest is sweet,
4. Out where there's never a task to do or a goal to reach or a foe to meet.

5. I must get out on the trails once more that wind through shadowy haunts and cool,
6. Away from the presence of wall and door, and see myself in a crystal pool;
7. I must get out with the silent things, where neither laughter nor hate is heard,
8. Where malice never the humblest stings and no one is hurt by a spoken word.

9. Oh, I've heard the call of the tall white pine, and heard the call of the running brook;
10. I'm tired of the tasks which each day are mine, I'm weary of reading a printed book;
11. I want to get out of the din and strife, the clang and clamor of turning wheel,
12. And walk for a day where life is life, and the joys are true and the pictures real.
