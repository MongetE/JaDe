1. ALL women are lovely and radiantly fair
2. In the magazine pages today,
3. They all have a mop of luxuriant hair,
4. In the magazine pages today.
5. There's not one with freckles or nose gone askew,
6. Or teeth that protrude, as some real girls' do,
7. There isn't a blemish on girls that we view
8. In the magazine pages today.

9. There's not one too pudgy or not one too thin,
10. In the magazine pages today;
11. Nor one who's just losing her tortoise shell pin,
12. In the magazine pages today.
13. 'Twixt shirtwaist and belt there is never a gap,
14. Or a tear in the silk that is lining her wrap,
15. And her gloves never lack a pearl button or snap,
16. In the magazine pages today.

17. She doesn't wear pink when she ought to wear blue,
18. In the magazine pages today;
19. And she isn't run down at the heel of her shoe,
20. In the magazine pages today.
21. You never can see when she hasn't a hat,
22. How much is real hair and how much of it's rat,
23. It's only in real life that we see things like that,
24. Not in magazine pages today.
