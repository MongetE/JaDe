1. If I can leave behind me here and there
2. A friend or two to say when I am gone
3. That I had helped to make their pathways fair,
4. Had brought them smiles when they were bowed with care,
5. The riches of this world I'll carry on.

6. If only three or four shall pause to say,
7. When I have passed beyond this earthly sphere,
8. That I brought gladness to them on a day
9. When bitterness was their's, I'll take away
10. More riches than a billionaire leaves here.
