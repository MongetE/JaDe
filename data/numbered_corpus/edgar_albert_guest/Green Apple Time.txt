1. Green apple time! an', Oh, the joy
2. Once more to be a healthy boy,
3. Casting a longin' greedy eye
4. At every tree he passes by!
5. Riskin' the direst consequence
6. To sneak inside a neighbor's fence
7. An' shake from many a loaded limb
8. The fruit that seems so near to him
9. Gosh! but once more I'd like to be
10. The boy I was in eighty-three.

11. Here I am sittin' with my pipe,
12. Waitin' for apples to get ripe;
13. Waitin' until the friendly sun
14. Has bronzed 'em all an' says they're done;
15. Not darin' any more to climb
16. An' pick a few afore their time.
17. No legs to run, no teeth to chew
18. The way that healthy youngsters do;
19. Jus' old enough to sit an' wait
20. An' pick my apple from a plate.

21. Plate apples ain't to be compared
22. With those you've ventured for an' dared.
23. It's winnin' 'em from branches high,
24. Or nippin' 'em when no one's by,
25. Or findin' 'em the time you feel
26. You really need another meal,
27. Or comin' unexpectedly
28. Upon a farmer's loaded tree
29. An' grabbin' all that you can eat,
30. That goes to make an apple sweet.

31. Green apple time! Go to it, boy,
32. An' cram yourself right full o' joy;
33. Watch for the farmer's dog an' run;
34. There'll come a time it can't be done.
35. There'll come a day you can't digest
36. The fruit you've stuffed into your vest,
37. Nor climb, but you'll sit down like me
38. An' watch 'em ripening on the tree,
39. An' jus' like me you'll have to wait
40. To pick your apples from a plate.
