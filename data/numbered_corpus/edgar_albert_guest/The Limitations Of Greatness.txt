1. NO MAN really knows enough
2. To be hateful to his brother,
3. None is rich enough to cuff
4. And be cruel to another;
5. None so clever that he can
6. Justly wrong his fellow man.

7. No one is so strong that he
8. Has the right to curb the weak,
9. None so great that properly
10. He can trample down the meek;
11. There is nothing in success
12. That excuses selfishness.

13. Climb unto the topmost bights,
14. Win yourself an honored name,
15. But respect another's rights,
16. Raise the weak and help the lame;
17. Strength of muscle or of mind
18. Gives no right to be unkind.
