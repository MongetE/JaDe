1. Time was the cry went round the world:
2. America for freedom speaks,
3. A new flag is to-day unfurled,
4. An eagle on the mountain shrieks,
5. A king is failing on his throne,
6. A race of men defies his power!
7. And no one could have guessed or known
8. The burden of that splendid hour.

9. A bell rang out that summer day
10. And men and women stood and heard;
11. That tongue of brass had more to say
12. Than could be spoken by a word.
13. It spoke the thoughts of honest men,
14. It whispered Destiny's intents
15. And rang a warning loudly then
16. To Kings of all the continents.

17. The old bell in its holy loft
18. Where pigeons nest, has ceased to swing
19. And yet through many a day and oft
20. A weary people hear it sing.
21. That hour long years ago, when first
22. America for freedom fought,
23. The bonds of slavery were burst:
24. That hour began the reign of thought.

25. Here comes another summer day:
26. America is on the sea,
27. America has dared to say
28. That other people shall be free.
29. No selfish stain her banner mars,
30. Her flag, for truth and right, unfurled,
31. With every stripe and all its stars
32. Still speaks its message to the world

33. Out where the soldiers fight for men,
34. Out where, for others, heroes die,
35. Out where they storm the Tyrant's den,
36. The Starry Banner lights the sky.
37. And once again the cry goes out
38. That brings the flush of hope to cheeks
39. Grown pale by bitter war and doubt:
40. 'America for Freedom speaks.'
