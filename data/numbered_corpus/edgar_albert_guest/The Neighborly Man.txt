1. Some are eager to be famous, some are striving
2. to be great,
3. Some are toiling to be leaders of their nation
4. or their state,
5. And in every man's ambition, if we only understood,
6. There is much that's fine and splendid; every
7. hope is mostly good.
8. So I cling unto the notion that contented I
9. will be
10. If the men upon life's pathway find a needed
11. friend in me.

12. I rather like to putter 'round the walks and
13. yards of life,
14. To spray at night the roses that are burned and
15. browned with strife;
16. To eat a frugal dinner, but always to have a
17. chair
18. For the unexpected stranger that my simple
19. meal would share.
20. I don't care to be a traveler, I would rather be
21. the one
22. Sitting calmly by the roadside helping weary
23. travelers on.

24. I'd like to be a neighbor in the good old-fashioned way,
25. Finding much to do for others, but not over
26. much to say.
27. I like to read the papers, but I do not yearn
28. to see
29. What the journal of the morning has been
30. moved to say of me;
31. In the silences and shadows I would live my
32. life and die
33. And depend for fond remembrance on some
34. grateful passers-by.

35. I guess I wasn't fashioned for the brilliant
36. things of earth,
37. Wasn't gifted much with talent or designed for
38. special worth,
39. But was just sent here to putter with life's little
40. odds and ends
41. And keep a simple corner where the stirring
42. highway bends,
43. And if folks should chance to linger, worn and
44. weary through the day,
45. To do some needed service and to cheer them
46. on their way.
