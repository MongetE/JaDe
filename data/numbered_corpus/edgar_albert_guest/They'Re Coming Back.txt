1. THEY 'RE coming home Thanksgiving Day,
2. They 're coming back once more,
3. And mother's smiles begin to play
4. The way they did before
5. The youngsters went away. Somehow
6. She doesn't seem so old;
7. The lines have faded from her brow,
8. She's sprightly now and bold.
9. And yesterday she sang a song
10. That took me back to when
11. The youngest merely crept along,
12. And Frank was only ten.
13. They 're coming home Thanksgiving Day,
14. And mother shows it, too;
15. Her hair, somehow, is not so gray,
16. And in her eyes the blue
17. Is clearer than it used to be,
18. And in them there's a light
19. Of love that I was wont to see
20. When courting her at night.
21. She's singing songs again, and in
22. Her voice there 's not a crack,
23. Once more the dimple's in her chin,
24. For they are coming back.

25. They 're coming back, that's all we know,
26. They 're coming back to see
27. The mother of the long ago,
28. They 're coming back to me.
29. And we've put off a thousand woes,
30. And shelved a dozen years;
31. In mother's fading cheek the rose
32. Of June once more appears;
33. The old home seems to thrill once more
34. The way it used to, when
35. The baby crept along the floor
36. And Frank was only ten.
