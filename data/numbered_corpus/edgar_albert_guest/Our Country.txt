1. God grant that we shall never see
2. Our country slave to lust and greed;
3. God grant that here all men shall be
4. United by a common creed.
5. Here Freedom's Flag has held the sky
6. Unstained, untarnished from its birth;
7. Long may it wave to typify
8. The happiest people on the earth.

9. Beneath its folds have mothers smiled
10. To see their little ones at play;
11. No tyrant hand, by shame defiled,
12. To them has barred life's rosy way.
13. No cruel wall of caste or class
14. Has bid men pause or turn aside;
15. Here looms no gate they may not pass-
16. Here every door is opened wide.

17. Here at the wells of Freedom all
18. Who are athirst may drink their fill.
19. Here fame and fortune wait to call
20. The toiler who has proved his skill.
21. Here wisdom sheds afar its light
22. As every morn the school bells ring,
23. And little children read and write
24. And share the knowledge of a king.

25. God grant that we shall never see
26. Our country slave to lust and greed;
27. God grant that men shall always be
28. United for our nation's need.
29. Here selfishness has never reigned,
30. Here freedom all who come may know;
31. By tyranny our Flag's unstained!
32. God grant that we may keep it so.
