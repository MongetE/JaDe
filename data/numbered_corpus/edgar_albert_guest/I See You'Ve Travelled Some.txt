1. I See You've Travelled Some
2. Wherever you may chance to be — wherever you may roam,
3. Far away in foreign lands; or just at home sweet home;
4. It always gives you pleasure, it makes your heart strings hum
5. Just to hear
6. The words of cheer,
7. 'I see you've travelled some.'

8. When you get a brother's greeting, and he takes you by the hand,
9. It thrills you with a feeling that you cannot understand,
10. You feel that bond of brotherhood, that tie that's sure to come
11. When you hear him say
12. In a friendly way
13. 'I see you've travelled some.'

14. And if you are a stranger, in strange lands all alone
15. If fate has left you stranded, dead broke and far from home,
16. Oh, it's a grand and glorious feeling, it thrills you; makes you numb,
17. When he says with a grip
18. Of fellowship,
19. 'I see you've travelled some.'

20. And when your final summons comes, to take a last long trip,
21. Adorned with Lambskin Apron White and gems of fellowship —
22. The Tiler at the Golden Gate, with Square and Level and Plumb
23. Will size up your pin
24. And say 'Walk In:
25. I see you've travelled some.'
