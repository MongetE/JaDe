1. SHE wants to go unto the shore,
2. And pack her trunk
3. With gowns no one has seen before,
4. And all such junk.

5. But I would seek some far off place
6. Where I 'm unknown,
7. And let my whiskers deck my face,
8. And be alone.

9. She sighs for parties and for teas,
10. They are her wish;
11. I merely want to take my ease
12. And loaf and fish.

13. She wants to lead a life that's grand,
14. In silken skirts;
15. I want to wear old trousers and
16. My outing shirts.
