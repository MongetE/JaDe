1. My father is a peaceful man;
2. He tries in every way he can
3. To live a life of gentleness
4. And patience all the while.
5. He says that needless fretting's vain,
6. That it's absurd to be profane,
7. That nearly every wrong can be
8. Adjusted with a smile.
9. Yet try no matter how he will,
10. There's one thing that annoys him still,
11. One thing that robs him of his calm
12. And leaves him very sore;
13. He cannot keep his self-control
14. When with a shovel full of coal
15. He misses where it's headed for,
16. And hits the furnace door.

17. He measures with a careful eye
18. The space for which he's soon to try,
19. Then grabs his trusty shovel up
20. And loads it in the bin,
21. Then turns and with a healthy lunge,
22. That's two parts swing and two parts plunge,
23. He lets go at the furnace fire,
24. Convinced it will go in!
25. And then we hear a sudden smack,
26. The cellar air turns blue and black;
27. Above the rattle of the coal
28. We hear his awful roar.
29. From dreadful language upward hissed
30. We know that father's aim has missed,
31. And that his shovel full of coal
32. Went up against the door.

33. The minister was here one day
34. For supper, and Pa went away
35. To fix the furnace fire, and soon
36. We heard that awful roar.
37. And through the furnace pipes there came
38. Hot words that made Ma blush for shame.
39. 'It strikes me,' said the minister,
40. 'He hit the furnace door.'
41. Ma turned away and hung her head;
42. 'I'm so ashamed,' was all she said.
43. And then the minister replied:
44. 'Don't worry. I admit
45. That when I hit the furnace door,
46. And spill the coal upon the floor,
47. I quite forget the cloth I wear
48. And- er- swear a little bit.'
