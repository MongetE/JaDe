1. I saw him in the distance, as the train went speeding by,
2. A shivery little fellow standing in the sun to dry.
3. And a little pile of clothing very near him I could see:
4. He was owner of a gladness that had once belonged to me.
5. I have shivered as he shivered, I have dried the way he dried,
6. I've stood naked in God's sunshine with my garments at my side;
7. And I thought as I beheld him, of the many weary men
8. Who would like to go in swimming as a little boy again.

9. I saw him scarce a moment, yet I knew his lips were blue
10. And I knew his teeth were chattering just as mine were wont to do;
11. And I knew his merry playmates in the pond were splashing still;
12. I could tell how much he envied all the boys that never chill;
13. And throughout that lonesome journey, I kept living o'er and o'er
14. The joys of going swimming when no bathing suits we wore;
15. I was with that little fellow, standing chattering in the sun;
16. I was sharing in his shivers and a partner of his fun.

17. Back to me there came the pictures that I never shall forget
18. When I dared not travel homewards if my shock of hair was wet,
19. When I did my brief undressing under fine and friendly trees
20. In the days before convention rigged us up in b.v.d's.
21. And I dived for stones and metal on the mill pond's muddy floor,
22. Then stood naked in the sunshine till my blood grew warm once more.
23. I was back again, a youngster, in those golden days of old,
24. When my teeth were wont to chatter and my lips were blue with cold.
