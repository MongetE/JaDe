1. Does the grouch get richer quicker than the friendly sort of man?
2. Can the grumbler labor better than the cheerful fellow can?
3. Is the mean and churlish neighbor any cleverer than the one
4. Who shouts a glad 'good morning,' and then smiling passes on?

5. Just stop and think about it.  Have you ever known or seen
6. A mean man who succeeded, just because he was so mean?
7. When you find a grouch with honors and with money in his pouch,
8. You can bet he didn't win them just because he was a grouch.

9. Oh, you'll not be any poorer if you smile along your way,
10. And your lot will not be harder for the kindly things you say.
11. Don't imagine you are wasting time for others that you spend:
12. You can rise to wealth and glory and still pause to be a friend.
