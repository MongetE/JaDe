1. The Girl He Left Behind
2. We used to think her frivolous—you know how
3. parents are,
4. A little quick to see the faults and petty flaws
5. that mar
6. The girl their son is fond of and may choose
7. to make his wife,
8. A little overjealous of the one who'd share his
9. life;
10. But the girl he left behind him when he bravely
11. marched away
12. Has blossomed into beauty that we see and need
13. to-day.

14. She was with us at the depot, and we turned our
15. backs a-while,
16. And her eyes were sad and misty, though she
17. tried her best to smile.
18. Then she put her arm round mother, and it
19. seemed to me as though
20. They just grew to love each other, for they
21. shared a common woe.
22. Now she often comes to see us, and it seems
23. to me we find
24. A heap of solid comfort in the girl he left behind.

25. 'She's so sensible and gentle,' mother said last
26. night to me,
27. 'The kind of girl I've often wished and prayed
28. his wife would be.
29. And I like to have her near us, for she understands
30. my sighs
31. And I see my brave boy smiling when I look into
32. her eyes.'
33. Now the presence of his sweetheart seems to fill
34. our home with joy.
35. She's no longer young and flighty—she's the
36. girl who loves our boy.
