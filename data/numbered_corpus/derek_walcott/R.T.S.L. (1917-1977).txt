1. As for that other thing
2. which comes when the eyelid is glazed
3. and the wax gleam
4. from the unwrinkled forehead
5. asks no more questions
6. of the dry mouth,

7. whether they open the heart like a shirt
8. to release a rage of swallows,
9. whether the brain
10. is a library for worms,
11. on the instant of that knowledge
12. of the moment
13. when everything became so stiff,

14. so formal with ironical adieux,
15. organ and choir,
16. and I must borrow a black tie,
17. and at what moment in the oration
18. shall I break down and weep -
19. there was the startle of wings
20. breaking from the closing cage
21. of your body, your fist unclenching
22. these pigeons circling serenely
23. over the page,

24. and,
25. as the parentheses lock like a gate
26. 1917 to 1977,
27. the semicircles close to form a face,
28. a world, a wholeness,
29. an unbreakable O,
30. and something that once had a fearful name
31. walks from the thing that used to wear its name,
32. transparent, exact representative,
33. so that we can see through it
34. churches, cars, sunlight, 
35. and the Boston Common,
36. not needing any book.
