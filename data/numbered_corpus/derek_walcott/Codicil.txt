1. Schizophrenic, wrenched by two styles,
2. one a hack's hired prose, I earn
3. me exile. I trudge this sickle, moonlit beach for miles,

4. tan, burn
5. to slough off
6. this live of ocean that's self-love.

7. To change your language you must change your life.

8. I cannot right old wrongs.
9. Waves tire of horizon and return.
10. Gulls screech with rusty tongues

11. Above the beached, rotting pirogues,
12. they were a venomous beaked cloud at Charlotteville.

13. One I thought love of country was enough,
14. now, even if I chose, there is no room at the trough.

15. I watch the best minds rot like dogs
16. for scraps of flavour.
17. I am nearing middle
18. age, burnt skin
19. peels from my hand like paper, onion-thin,
20. like Peer Gynt's riddle.

21. At heart there is nothing, not the dread
22. of death. I know to many dead.
23. They're all familiar, all in character,

24. even how they died. On fire,
25. the flesh no longer fears that furnace mouth
26. of earth,

27. that kiln or ashpit of the sun,
28. nor this clouding, unclouding sickle moon
29. withering this beach again like a blank page.

30. All its indifference is a different rage.
