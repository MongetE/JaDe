1. After that hot gospeller has levelled all but the churched sky,
2. I wrote the tale by tallow of a city's death by fire;
3. Under a candle's eye, that smoked in tears, I
4. Wanted to tell, in more than wax, of faiths that were snapped like wire.
5. All day I walked abroad among the rubbled tales,
6. Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar;
7. Loud was the bird-rocked sky, and all the clouds were bales
8. Torn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire.
9. By the smoking sea, where Christ walked, I asked, why
10. Should a man wax tears, when his wooden world fails?
11. In town, leaves were paper, but the hills were a flock of faiths;
12. To a boy who walked all day, each leaf was a green breath
13. Rebuilding a love I thought was dead as nails,
14. Blessing the death and the baptism by fire.
