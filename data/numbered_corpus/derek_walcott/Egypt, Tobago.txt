1. There is a shattered palm
2. on this fierce shore,
3. its plumes the rusting helm-
4. et of a dead warrior.

5. Numb Antony, in the torpor
6. stretching her inert
7. sex near him like a sleeping cat,
8. knows his heart is the real desert.

9. Over the dunes
10. of her heaving,
11. to his heart's drumming
12. fades the mirage of the legions,

13. across love-tousled sheets,
14. the triremes fading.
15. Ar the carved door of her temple
16. a fly wrings its message.

17. He brushes a damp hair
18. away from an ear
19. as perfect as a sleeping child's.
20. He stares, inert, the fallen column.

21. He lies like a copper palm
22. tree at three in the afternoon
23. by a hot sea
24. and a river, in Egypt, Tobago

25. Her salt marsh dries in the heat
26. where he foundered
27. without armor.
28. He exchanged an empire for her beads of sweat,

29. the uproar of arenas,
30. the changing surf
31. of senators, for
32. this silent ceiling over silent sand -

33. this grizzled bear, whose fur,
34. moulting, is silvered -
35. for this quick fox with her
36. sweet stench. By sleep dismembered,

37. his head
38. is in Egypt, his feet
39. in Rome, his groin a desert
40. trench with its dead soldier.

41. He drifts a finger
42. through her stiff hair
43. crisp as a mare's fountaining tail.
44. Shadows creep up the palace tile.

45. He is too tired to move;
46. a groan would waken
47. trumpets, one more gesture
48. war. His glare,

49. a shield
50. reflecting fires,
51. a brass brow that cannot frown
52. at carnage, sweats the sun's force.

53. It is not the turmoil
54. of autumnal lust,
55. its treacheries, that drove
56. him, fired and grimed with dust,

57. this far, not even love,
58. but a great rage without
59. clamor, that grew great
60. because its depth is quiet;

61. it hears the river
62. of her young brown blood,
63. it feels the whole sky quiver
64. with her blue eyelid.

65. She sleeps with the soft engine of a child,

66. that sleep which scythes
67. the stalks of lances, fells the
68. harvest of legions
69. with nothing for its knives,
70. that makes Caesars,

71. sputtering at flies,
72. slapping their foreheads
73. with the laurel's imprint,
74. drunkards, comedians.

75. All-humbling sleep, whose peace
76. is sweet as death,
77. whose silence has
78. all the sea's weight and volubility,

79. who swings this globe by a hair's trembling breath.

80. Shattered and wild and
81. palm-crowned Antony,
82. rusting in Egypt,
83. ready to lose the world,
84. to Actium and sand,

85. everything else
86. is vanity, but this tenderness
87. for a woman not his mistress
88. but his sleeping child.

89. The sky is cloudless. The afternoon is mild.
