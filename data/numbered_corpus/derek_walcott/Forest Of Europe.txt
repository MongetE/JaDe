1. The last leaves fell like notes from a piano
2. and left their ovals echoing in the ear;
3. with gawky music stands, the winter forest
4. looks like an empty orchestra, its lines
5. ruled on these scattered manuscripts of snow.

6. The inlaid copper laurel of an oak
7. shines though the brown-bricked glass above your head
8. as bright as whiskey, while the wintry breath
9. of lines from Mandelstam, which you recite,
10. uncoils as visibly as cigarette smoke.

11. "The rustling of ruble notes by the lemon Neva."
12. Under your exile's tongue, crisp under heel,
13. the gutturals crackle like decaying leaves,
14. the phrase from Mandelstam circles with light
15. in a brown room, in barren Oklahoma.

16. There is a Gulag Archipelago
17. under this ice, where the salt, mineral spring
18. of the long Trail of Tears runnels these plains
19. as hard and open as a herdsman's face
20. sun-cracked and stubbled with unshaven snow.

21. Growing in whispers from the Writers' Congress,
22. the snow circles like cossacks round the corpse
23. of a tired Choctaw till it is a blizzard
24. of treaties and white papers as we lose
25. sight of the single human through the cause.

26. So every spring these branches load their shelves,
27. like libraries with newly published leaves,
28. till waste recycles them—paper to snow—
29. but, at zero of suffering, one mind
30. lasts like this oak with a few brazen leaves.

31. As the train passed the forest's tortured icons,
32. ths floes clanging like freight yards, then the spires
33. of frozen tears, the stations screeching steam,
34. he drew them in a single winters' breath
35. whose freezing consonants turned into stone.

36. He saw the poetry in forlorn stations
37. under clouds vast as Asia, through districts
38. that could gulp Oklahoma like a grape,
39. not these tree-shaded prairie halts but space
40. so desolate it mocked destinations.

41. Who is that dark child on the parapets
42. of Europe, watching the evening river mint
43. its sovereigns stamped with power, not with poets,
44. the Thames and the Neva rustling like banknotes,
45. then, black on gold, the Hudson's silhouettes?

46. From frozen Neva to the Hudson pours,
47. under the airport domes, the echoing stations,
48. the tributary of emigrants whom exile
49. has made as classless as the common cold,
50. citizens of a language that is now yours,

51. and every February, every "last autumn",
52. you write far from the threshing harvesters
53. folding wheat like a girl plaiting her hair,
54. far from Russia's canals quivering with sunstroke,
55. a man living with English in one room.

56. The tourist archipelago's of my South
57. are prisons too, corruptible, and though
58. there is no harder prison than writing verse,
59. what's poetry, if it is worth its salt,
60. but a phrase men can pass from hand to mouth?

61. From hand to mouth, across the centuries,
62. the bread that lasts when systems have decayed,
63. when, in his forest of barbed-wire branches,
64. a prisoner circles, chewing the one phrase
65. whose music will last longer than the leaves,

66. whose condensation is the marble sweat
67. of angels' foreheads, which will never dry
68. till Borealis shuts the peacock lights
69. of its slow fan from L.A. to Archangel,
70. and memory needs nothing to repeat.

71. Frightened and starved, with divine fever
72. Osip Mandelstam shook, and every
73. metaphor shuddered him with ague,
74. each vowel heavier than a boundary stone,
75. "to the rustling of ruble notes by the lemon Neva,"

76. but now that fever is a fire whose glow
77. warms our hands, Joseph, as we grunt like primates
78. exchanging gutturals in this wintry cave
79. of a brown cottage, while in drifts outside
80. mastodons force their systems through the snow.
