1. I

2. I came up out of the subway and there were
3. people standing on the steps as if they knew
4. something I didn't. This was in the Cold War,
5. and nuclear fallout. I looked and the whole avenue
6. was empty, I mean utterly, and I thought,
7. The birds have abandoned our cities and the plague
8. of silence multiplies through their arteries, they fought
9. the war and they lost and there's nothing subtle or vague
10. in this horrifying vacuum that is New York. I caught
11. the blare of a loudspeaker repeatedly warning
12. the last few people, maybe strolling lovers in their walk,
13. that the world was about to end that morning
14. on Sixth or Seventh Avenue with no people going to work
15. in that uncontradicted, horrifying perspective.
16. It was no way to die, but it's also no way to live.
17. Well, if we burnt, it was at least New York.

18. II

19. Everybody in New York is in a sitcom.
20. I'm in a Latin American novel, one
21. in which an egret-haired viejo shakes with some
22. invisible sorrow, some obscene affliction,
23. and chronicles it secretly, till it shows in his face,
24. the parenthetical wrinkles confirming his fiction
25. to his deep embarrassment. Look, it's
26. just the old story of a heart that won't call it quits
27. whatever the odds, quixotic. It's just one that'll
28. break nobody's heart, even if the grizzled colonel
29. pitches from his steed in a cavalry charge, in a battle
30. that won't make him a statue. It is the hell
31. of ordinary, unrequited love. Watch these egrets
32. trudging the lawn in a dishevelled troop, white banners
33. trailing forlornly; they are the bleached regrets
34. of an old man's memoirs, printed stanzas.
35. showing their hinged wings like wide open secrets.

36. III

37. Who has removed the typewriter from my desk,
38. so that I am a musician without his piano
39. with emptiness ahead as clear and grotesque
40. as another spring? My veins bud, and I am so
41. full of poems, a wastebasket of black wire.
42. The notes outside are visible; sparrows will
43. line antennae like staves, the way springs were,
44. but the roofs are cold and the great grey river
45. where a liner glides, huge as a winter hill,
46. moves imperceptibly like the accumulating
47. years. I have no reason to forgive her
48. for what I brought on myself. I am past hating,
49. past the longing for Italy where blowing snow
50. absolves and whitens a kneeling mountain range
51. outside Milan. Through glass, I am waiting
52. for the sound of a bird to unhinge the beginning
53. of spring, but my hands, my work, feel strange
54. without the rusty music of my machine. No words
55. for the Arctic liner moving down the Hudson, for the mange
56. of old snow moulting from the roofs. No poems. No birds.

57. IV

58. The Sweet Life Café

59. If I fall into a grizzled stillness
60. sometimes, over the red-chequered tablecloth
61. outdoors of the Sweet Life Café, when the noise
62. of Sunday traffic in the Village is soft as a moth
63. working in storage, it is because of age
64. which I rarely admit to, or, honestly, even think of.
65. I have kept the same furies, though my domestic rage
66. is illogical, diabetic, with no lessening of love
67. though my hand trembles wildly, but not over this page.
68. My lust is in great health, but, if it happens
69. that all my towers shrivel to dribbling sand,
70. joy will still bend the cane-reeds with my pen's
71. elation on the road to Vieuxfort with fever-grass
72. white in the sun, and, as for the sea breaking
73. in the gap at Praslin, they add up to the grace
74. I have known and which death will be taking
75. from my hand on this chequered tablecloth in this good place.
