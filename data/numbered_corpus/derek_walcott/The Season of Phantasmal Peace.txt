1. Then all the nations of birds lifted together
2. the huge net of the shadows of this earth
3. in multitudinous dialects, twittering tongues,
4. stitching and crossing it. They lifted up
5. the shadows of long pines down trackless slopes,
6. the shadows of glass-faced towers down evening streets,
7. the shadow of a frail plant on a city sillâ€”
8. the net rising soundless as night, the birds' cries soundless, until
9. there was no longer dusk, or season, decline, or weather,
10. only this passage of phantasmal light
11. that not the narrowest shadow dared to sever.

12. And men could not see, looking up, what the wild geese drew,
13. what the ospreys trailed behind them in silvery ropes
14. that flashed in the icy sunlight; they could not hear
15. battalions of starlings waging peaceful cries,
16. bearing the net higher, covering this world
17. like the vines of an orchard, or a mother drawing
18. the trembling gauze over the trembling eyes
19. of a child fluttering to sleep;
20. it was the light
21. that you will see at evening on the side of a hill
22. in yellow October, and no one hearing knew
23. what change had brought into the raven's cawing,
24. the killdeer's screech, the ember-circling chough
25. such an immense, soundless, and high concern
26. for the fields and cities where the birds belong,
27. except it was their seasonal passing, Love,
28. made seasonless, or, from the high privilege of their birth,
29. something brighter than pity for the wingless ones
30. below them who shared dark holes in windows and in houses,
31. and higher they lifted the net with soundless voices
32. above all change, betrayals of falling suns,
33. and this season lasted one moment, like the pause
34. between dusk and darkness, between fury and peace,
35. but, for such as our earth is now, it lasted long.
