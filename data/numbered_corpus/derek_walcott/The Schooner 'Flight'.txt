1. 1  Adios, Carenage

2. In idle August, while the sea soft,
3. and leaves of brown islands stick to the rim
4. of this Carribean, I blow out the light
5. by the dreamless face of Maria Concepcion
6. to ship as a seaman on the schooner Flight.
7. Out in the yard turning gray in the dawn,
8. I stood like a stone and nothing else move
9. but the cold sea rippling like galvanize
10. and the nail holes of stars in the sky roof,
11. till a wind start to interfere with the trees.
12. I pass me dry neighbor sweeping she yard
13. as I went downhill, and I nearly said:
14. "Sweep soft, you witch, 'cause she don't sleep hard,"
15. but the bitch look through me like I was dead.
16. A route taxi pull up, park-lights still on.
17. The driver size up my bags with a grin:
18. "This time, Shabine, like you really gone!"
19. I ain't answer the ass, I simply pile in
20. the back seat and watch the sky burn
21. above Laventille pink as the gown
22. in which the woman I left was sleeping,
23. and I look in the rearview and see a man
24. exactly like me, and the man was weeping
25. for the houses, the street, that whole fucking island.

26. Christ have mercy on all sleeping things!
27. From that dog rotting down Wrightson Road
28. to when I was a dog on these streets;
29. if loving these islands must be my load.
30. out of corruption my soul takes wings,
31. But they had started to poison my soul
32. with their big house, big car, big time bohbohl,
33. coolie, nigger, Syrian and French Creole,
34. so I leave it for them and their carnival - 
35. I taking a sea bath, I gone down the road.
36. I know these islands from Monos to Nassau,
37. a rusty head sailor with sea-green eyes
38. that they nickname Shabine, the patois for
39. any red nigger, and I, Shabine, saw
40. when these slums of empire was paradise.
41. I'm just a red nigger who love the sea,
42. I had a sound colonial education,
43. I have Dutch, nigger, and English in me,
44. and either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation,

45. But Maria Concepcion was all my thought
46. watching the sea heaving up and down
47. as the port side of dories, schooners, and yachts
48. was painted afresh by the strokes of the sun
49. signing her name with every reflection;
50. I knew when dark-haired evening put on
51. her bright silk at sunset, and, folding the sea,
52. sidled under the sheet with her starry laugh,
53. that there'd be no rest, there'd be no forgetting.
54. Is like telling mourners round the graveside
55. about resurrection, they want the dead back,
56. so I smile to myself as the bow rope untied
57. and the Flight swing seaward:"Is no use repeating
58. that the sea have more fish. I ain't want her
59. dressed in the sexless light of a seraph,
60. I want those round brown eyes like a marmoset, and
61. till the day when I can lean back and laugh,
62. those claws that tickled my back on sweating
63. Sunday afternoons, like a crab on wet sand."

64. As I worked, watching the rotting waves come
65. past the bow that scissor the sea like milk,
66. I swear to you all, by my mother's milk,
67. by the stars that shall fly from tonight's furnace,
68. that I loved them, my children, my wife, my home;
69. I loved them as poets love the poetry
70. that kills them, as drowned sailors the sea.

71. You ever look up from some lonely beach
72. and see a far schooner? Well, when I write
73. this poem, each phrase go be soaked in salt;
74. I go draw and knot every line as tight
75. as ropes in this rigging; in simple speech
76. my common language go be the wind,
77. my pages the sails of the schooner Flight.
78. But let me tell you how this business begin.


79. 2  Raptures of the Deep

80. Smuggled Scotch for O'Hara, big government man,
81. between Cedros and the Main, so the Coast Guard couldn't touch us,
82. and the Spanish pirogues always met us halfway,
83. but a voice kept saying: "Shabine, see this business
84. of playing pirate?" Well, so said, so done!
85. That whole racket crash. And I for a woman,
86. for her laces and silks, Maria Concepcion.
87. Ay, ay! Next thing I hear, some Commission of Enquiry
88. was being organized to conduct a big quiz,
89. with himself as chairman investigating himself.
90. Well, I knew damn well who the suckers would be,
91. not that shark in shark skin, but his pilot fish,
92. khaki-pants red nigger like you or me.
93. What worse, I fighting with Maria Concepcion,
94. plates flying and thing, so I swear: "Not again!"
95. It was mashing up my house and my family.
96. I was so broke all I needed was shades and a cup
97. or four shades and four cups in four-cup Port of Spain;
98. all the silver I had was the coins on the sea.

99. You saw them ministers in The Express,
100. guardians of the poor - one hand at their back,
101. and one set o'police only guarding their house,
102. and the Scotch pouring in through the back door.
103. As for that minister-monster who smuggled the booze,
104. that half-Syrian saurian, I got so vex to see
105. that face thick with powder, the warts, the stone lids
106. like a dinosaur caked with primordial ooze
107. by the lightning of flashbulbs sinking in wealth,
108. that I said: "Shabine, this is shit, understand!"
109. But he get somebody to kick my crutch out his office
110. like I was some artist! That bitch was so grand,
111. couldn't get off his high horse and kick me himself.
112. I have seen things that would make a slave sick
113. in this Trinidad, the Limers' Republic.

114. I couldn't shake the sea noise out of my head,
115. the shell of my ears sang Maria Concepcion,
116. so I start salvage diving with a crazy Mick,
117. name O'Shaugnessy, and a limey named Head;
118. but this Caribbean so choke with the dead
119. that when I would melt in emerald water,
120. whose ceiling rippled like a silk tent,
121. I saw them corals: brain, fire, sea fans,
122. dead-men's-fingers, and then, the dead men.
123. I saw that the powdery sand was their bones
124. ground white from Senegal to San Salvador,
125. so, I panic third dive, and surface for a month
126. in the Seamen's Hostel. Fish broth and sermons.
127. When I thought of the woe I had brought my wife,
128. when I saw my worries with that other woman,
129. I wept under water, salt seeking salt,
130. for her beauty had fallen on me like a sword
131. cleaving me from my children, flesh of my flesh!

132. There was this barge from St. Vincent, but she was too deep
133. to float her again. When we drank, the limey
134. got tired of my sobbing for Maria Concepcion.
135. He said he was getting the bends. Good for him!
136. The pain in my heart for Maria Concepcion,
137. the hurt I had done to my wife and children,
138. was worse than the bends. In the rapturous deep
139. there was no cleft rock where my soul could hide
140. like the boobies each sunset, no sandbar of light
141. where I could rest, like the pelicans know,
142. so I got raptures once, and I saw God
143. like a harpooned grouper bleeding, and a far
144. voice was rumbling, "Shabine, if you leave her,
145. if you leave her, I shall give you the morning star."
146. When I left the madhouse I tried other women
147. but, once they stripped naked, their spiky cunts
148. bristled like sea eggs and I couldn't dive.
149. The chaplain came round. I paid him no mind.
150. Where is my rest place, Jesus? Where is my harbor?
151. Where is the pillow I will not have to pay for,
152. and the window I can look from that frames my life?


153. 3   Shabine Leaves the Republic

154. I had no nation now but the imagination.
155. After the white man, the niggers didn't want me
156. when the power swing to their side.
157. The first chain my hands and apologize, "History";
158. the next said I wasn't black enough for their pride.
159. Tell me, what power, on these unknown rocks -
160. a spray-plane Air Force, the Fire Brigade,
161. the Red Cross, the Regiment, two, three police dogs
162. that pass before you finish bawling "Parade!"?
163. I met History once, but he ain't recognize me,
164. a parchment Creole, with warts
165. like an old sea bottle, crawling like a crab
166. through the holes of shadow cast by the net
167. of a grille balcony ; cream linen, cream hat.
168. I confront him and shout, "Sir, is Shabine!
169. They say I'se your grandson. You remember Grandma,
170. your black cook, at all?" The bitch hawk and spat.
171. A spit like that worth any number of words.
172. But that's all them bastards have left us: words.

173. I no longer believed in the revolution.
174. I was losing faith in the love of my woman.
175. I had seen that moment Aleksandr Blok
176. crystallize in The Twelve. Was between
177. the Police Marine Branch and Hotel Venezuelan
178. one Sunday at noon. Young men without flags
179. using shirts, their chests waiting for holes.
180. They kept marching into the mountains, and their
181. noise ceased as foam sinks into sand.
182. They sank in the bright hills like rain, every one
183. with his own nimbus, leaving shirts in the streets,
184. and the echo of power at the end of the street.
185. Propeller-blade fans turn over the Senate;
186. the judges, they say, still sweat in carmine,
187. on Frederick Street the idlers all marching
188. by standing still, the Budget turns a new leaf.
189. In the 12.30 movies the projectors best
190. not break down, or you go see revolution. Aleksandr Blok
191. enters and sits in the third row of pit eating choc-
192. olate cone, waiting for a spaghetti West-
193. ern with Clint Eastwood and featuring Lee Van Cleef.


194. 4   The Flight, Passing 
195.      Blanchisseuse.

196. Dusk. The Flight passing Blanchisseuse.
197. Gulls wheel like from a gun again,
198. and foam gone amber that was white,
199. lighthouse and star start making friends,
200. down every beach the long day ends,
201. and there, on that last stretch of sand,
202. on a beach bare of all but light,
203. dark hands start pulling in the seine
204. of the dark sea, deep, deep inland.


205. 5    Shabine Encounters the
206.       Middle Passage

207. Man, I brisk in the galley first thing next dawn,
208. brewing li'l coffee; fog coil from the sea
209. like the kettle steaming when I put it down
210. slow, slow, 'cause I couldn't believe what I see:
211. where the horizon was one silver haze,
212. the fog swirl and swell into sails, so close
213. that I saw it was sails, my hair grip my skull,
214. it was horrors, but it was beautiful.
215. We float through a rustling forest of ships
216. with sails dry like paper, behind the glass
217. I saw men with rusty eyeholes like cannons,
218. and whenever their half-naked crews cross the sun,
219. right through their tissue, you traced their bones
220. like leaves against the sunlight; frigates, barkentines,
221. the backward-moving current swept them on,
222. and high on their decks I saw great admirals,
223. Rodney, Nelson, de Grasse, I heard the hoarse orders
224. they gave those Shabines, and that forest
225. of masts sail right through the Flight,
226. and all you could hear was the ghostly sound
227. of waves rustling like grass in a low wind
228. and the hissing weds they trail from the stern;
229. slowly they heaved past from east to west
230. like this round world was some cranked water wheel,
231. every ship pouring like a wooden bucket
232. dredged from the deep; my memory revolve
233. on all sailors before me, then the sun
234. heat the horizon's ring and they was mist.

235. Next we pass slave ships. Flags of all nations,
236. our fathers below deck too deep, I suppose,
237. to hear us shouting. So we stop shouting. Who knows
238. who his grandfather is, much less his name?
239. Tomorrow our landfall will be the Barbados.


240. 6   The Sailor Sings Back to the
241.      Casuarinas

242. You see them on the low hills of Barbados
243. bracing like windbreaks, needles for hurricanes,
244. trailing, like masts, the cirrus of torn sails;
245. when I was green like them, I used to think
246. those cypresses, leaning against the sea,
247. that take the sea noise up into their branches,
248. are not real cypresses but casuarinas.
249. Now captain just call them Canadian cedars.
250. But cedars, cypresses, or casuarinas,
251. whoever called them so had a good cause,
252. watching their bending bodies wail like women
253. after a storm, when some schooner came home
254. with news of one more sailor drowned again.
255. Once the sound "cypress" used to make more sense
256. than the green "casuarinas", though, to the wind
257. whatever grief bent them was all the same,
258. since they were trees with nothing else in mind
259. but heavenly leaping or to guard a grave;
260. but we live like our names and you would have
261. to be colonial to know the difference,
262. to know the pain of history words contain,
263. to love those trees with an inferior love,
264. and to believe: "Those casuarinas bend
265. like cypresses, their hair hangs down in rain
266. like sailors' wives. They're classic trees, and we,
267. if we live like the names our masters please,
268. by careful mimicry might become men."


269. 7  The Flight Anchors in
270.     Castries Harbor

271. When the stars self were young over Castries,
272. I loved you alone and I loved the whole world.
273. What does it matter that our lives are different?
274. Burdened with the loves of our different children?
275. When I think of your young face washed by the wind
276. and your voice that chuckles in the slap of the sea?
277. The lights are out on La Toc promontory,
278. except for the hospital. Across at Vigie
279. the marina arcs keep vigil. I have kept my own
280. promise, to leave you the one thing I own,
281. you whom I loved first: my poetry.
282. We here for one night. Tomorrow, the Flight will be gone.


283. 8  Fight with the Crew

284. It had one bitch on board, like he had me mark -
285. that was the cook, some Vincentian arse
286. with a skin like a gommier tree, red peeling bark,
287. and wash-out blue eyes; he wouldn't give me a ease,
288. like he feel he was white. Had an exercise book,
289. this same one here, that I was using to write
290. my poetry, so one day this man snatch it
291. from my hand, and start throwing it left and right
292. to the rest of the crew,bawling out, "Catch it,"
293. and start mincing me like I was some hen
294. because of the poems. Some case is for fist,
295. some case is for tholing pin, some is for knife -
296. this one was for knife. Well, I beg him first,
297. but he kept reading, "O my children, my wife,"
298. and playing he crying, to make the crew laugh;
299. it move like a flying fish, the silver knife
300. that catch him right in the plump of his calf,
301. and he faint so slowly, and he turn more white
302. than he thought he was. I suppose among men
303. you need that sort of thing. It ain't right
304. but that's how it is. There wasn't much pain,
305. just plenty blood, and Vincie and me best friend,
306. but none of them go fuck with my poetry again.


307. 9  Maria Concepcion & the Book of Dreams

308. The jet that was screeching over the Flight
309. was opening a curtain into the past.
310. "Dominica ahead!"
311.                                "It still have Caribs there."
312. "One day go be planes only, no more boat."
313. "Vince, God ain't made nigger to fly through the air."
314. "Progress, Shabine, that's what it's all about.
315. Progress leaving all we small islands behind."
316. I was at the wheel, Vince sitting next to me
317. gaffing. Crisp, bracing day. A high-running sea.
318. "Progress is something to ask Caribs about.
319. They kill them by millions, some in war,
320. some by forced labor dying in the mines
321. looking for silver, after that niggers; more
322. progress. Until I see definite signs
323. that mankind change, Vince, I ain't want to hear.
324. Progress is history's dirty joke.
325. Ask that sad green island getting nearer."
326. Green islands, like mangoes pickled in brine.
327. In such fierce salt let my wound be healed,
328. me, in my freshness as a seafarer.

329. That night, with the sky sparks frosty with fire,
330. I ran like a Carib through Dominica,
331. my nose holes choked with memory of smoke;
332. I heard the screams of my burning children,
333. I ate the brains of mushrooms, the fungi
334. of devil's parasols under white, leprous rocks;
335. my breakfast was leaf mold in leaking forests,
336. with leaves big as maps, and when I heard noise
337. of the soldiers' progress through the thick leaves,
338. though my heart was bursting, I get up and ran
339. through the blades of balisier sharper than spears:
340. with the blood of my race, I ran, boy, I ran
341. with moss-footed speed like a painted bird;
342. then I fall, but I fall by an icy stream under
343. cool fountains of fern, and a screaming parrot
344. catch the dry branches and I drowned at last
345. in big breakers of smoke; then when that ocean
346. of black smoke pass, and the sky turn white,
347. there was nothing but Progress, if Progress is
348. an iguana as still as a young leaf in sunlight.
349. I bawl for Maria, and her Book of Dreams.

350. It anchored her sleep, that insomniac's Bible,
351. a soiled orange booklet with a cyclop's eye
352. center, from the Dominican Republic.
353. Its coarse pages were black with the usual
354. symbols of prophecy, in excited Spanish:
355. an open palm upright, sectioned and numbered
356. like a butcher chart, delivered the future.
357. One night, in a fever, radiantly ill,
358. she say, "Bring me the book, the end has come."
359. She said, "I dreamt of whales and a storm,"
360. but for that dream, the book had no answer.
361. A next night I dreamed of three old women
362. featureless as silkworms, stitching my fate,
363. and I scream at them to come out of my house,
364. and I try beating them away with a broom,
365. but as they go out, so they crawl back again,
366. until I start screaming and crying, my flesh
367. raining with sweat, and she ravage the book
368. for the dream meaning, and there was nothing;
369. my nerves melt like a jellyfish - that was when I broke -
370. they found me round the Savannah, screaming:

371. All you see me talking to the wind, so you think I mad.
372. Well, Shabine has bridled the horses of the sea;
373. you see me watching the sun till my eyeballs seared,
374. so all you mad people feel Shabine crazy,
375. but all you ain't know my strength, hear? The coconuts
376. standing by in their regiments in yellow khaki,
377. they waiting for Shabine to take over these islands,
378. and all you best dread the day I am healed
379. of being a human. All you fate in my hand,
380. ministers, businessmen, Shabine have you, friend,
381. I shall scatter your lives like a handful of sand,
382. I who have no weapon but poetry and
383. the lances of palms and the sea's shining shield!


384. 10  Out of the Depths

385. Next day, dark sea. A arse-aching dawn.
386. "Damn wind shift sudden as a woman mind."
387. The slow swell start cresting like some mountain range
388. with snow on the top.
389.                                        "Ay, skipper, sky dark!"
390. "This ain't right for August."
391.                                        "This light damn strange,
392. this season, sky should be clear as a field."

393. A stingray steeplechase across the sea,
394. tail whipping water, the high man-o'-wars
395. start reeling inland, quick, quick an archery
396. of flying fish miss us! Vince say: "You notice?"
397. and a black-mane squall pounce on the sail
398. like a dog on a pigeon, and it snap the neck
399. of the Flight and shake it from head to tail.
400. "Be Jesus, I never see sea get so rough
401. so fast! That wind come from God back pocket!"
402. "Where Cap'n headin? Like the man gone blind!"
403. "If we's to drong, we go drong, Vince, fock-it!"
404. "Shabine, say your prayers, if life leave you any!"

405. I have not loved those that I loved enough.
406. Worse than the mule kick of Kick-'Em-Jenny
407. Channel, rain start to pelt the Flight between
408. mountains of water. If I was frighten?
409. The tent poles of water spouts bracing the sky
410. start wobbling, clouds  unstitch at the seams
411. and sky water drench us, and I hear myself cry,
412. "I'm the drowned sailor in her Book of Dreams."
413. I remembered those ghost ships, I saw me corkscrewing
414. to the sea bed of sae worms, fathom past fathom,
415. my jaw clench like a fist, and only one thing
416. hold me, trembling, how my family safe home.
417. Then a strength like it seize me and the strength said:
418. "I from backward people who still fear God."
419. Let Him, in His might, heave Leviathan upward
420. by the winch of His will, the beast pouring lace
421. from his sea-bottom bed; and that was the faith
422. that had fade from a child in the Methodist chapel
423. in Chisel Street, Castries, when the whale-bell
424. sang service and, in hard pews ribbed like the whale,
425. proud with despair, we sang how our race
426. survive the sea's maw, our history, our peril,
427. and now I was ready for whatever death will.
428. But if that storm had strength, was in Cap'n face,
429. beard beading with spray, tears salting his eyes,
430. crucify to his post, that nigger hold fast
431. to that wheel, man, like the cross held Jesus,
432. and the wounds of his eyes like they crying for us,
433. and I feeding him white rum, while every crest
434. with Leviathan-lash made the Flight quail
435. like two criminal. Whole night, with no rest,
436. till red-eyed like dawn, we watch our travail
437. subsiding, subside, and there was no more storm.
438. And the noon sea get calm as Thy Kingdom come.


439. 11  After the Storm

440. There's a fresh light that follows a storm
441. while the whole sea still havoc; in its bright wake
442. I saw the veiled face of Maria Concepcion
443. marrying the ocean, then drifting away
444. in the widening lace of her bridal train
445. with white gulls her bridesmaids, till she was gone.
446. I wanted nothing after that day.
447. Across my own face, like the face of the sun,
448. a light rain was falling, wih the sea calm.

449. Fall gently, rain, on the sea's upturned face
450. like a girl showering; make these islands fresh
451. as Shabine once knew them! Let every trace,
452. every hot road, smell like clothes she just press
453. and sprinkle with drizzle. I finish dream;
454. whatever the rain wash and the sun iron:
455. the white clouds, the sea and sky wih one seam,
456. is clothes enough for my nakedness.
457. Though my Flight never pass the incoming tide
458. of this inland sea beyond the loud reefs
459. of the final Bahamas, I am satisfied
460. if my hand gave voice to one people's grief.
461. Open the map. More islands there, man,
462. than peas on a tin plate, all different size,
463. one thousand in the Bahamas alone,
464. from mountains to low scrub with coral keys,
465. and from this bowsprit, I bless every town,
466. the blue smell of smoke in hills behind them,
467. and the one small road winding down them like twine
468. to the roofs below; I have only one theme:
469. The bowsprit, the arrow, the longing, the lunging heart - 
470. the flight to a target whose aim we'll never know,
471. vain search for an island that heals with its harbor
472. and a guiltless horizon, where the almond's shadow
473. doesn't injure the sand. There are so many islands!
474. As many islands as the stars at night
475. like falling fruit around the schooner Flight.
476. But things must fall, and so it always was,
477. on one hand Venus, on the other Mars;
478. fall, and are one, just as this earth is one
479. island in archipelago's of stars.
480. My first friend was the sea. Now, is my last.
481. I stop talking now. I work, then I read,
482. cotching under a lantern hooked to the mast.
483. I try to forget what happiness was,
484. and when that don't work, I study the stars.
485. Sometimes is just me, and the soft-scissored foam
486. as the deck turn white and the moon open
487. a cloud like a door, and the light over me
488. is a road in white moonlight taking me home.
489. Shabine sang to you from the depths of the sea.
