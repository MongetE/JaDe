1. Those villages stricken with the melancholia of Sunday,
2. in all of whose ocher streets one dog is sleeping

3. those volcanoes like ashen roses, or the incurable sore
4. of poverty, around whose puckered mouth thin boys are
5. selling yellow sulphur stone

6. the burnt banana leaves that used to dance
7. the river whose bed is made of broken bottles
8. the cocoa grove where a bird whose cry sounds green and
9. yellow and in the lights under the leaves crested with
10. orange flame has forgotten its flute

11. gommiers peeling from sunburn still wrestling to escape the sea

12. the dead lizard turning blue as stone

13. those rivers, threads of spittle, that forgot the old music

14. that dry, brief esplanade under the drier sea almonds
15. where the dry old men sat

16. watching a white schooner stuck in the branches
17. and playing draughts with the moving frigate birds

18. those hillsides like broken pots

19. those ferns that stamped their skeletons on the skin

20. and those roads that begin reciting their names at vespers

21. mention them and they will stop
22. those crabs that were willing to let an epoch pass
23. those herons like spinsters that doubted their reflections
24. inquiring, inquiring

25. those nettles that waited
26. those Sundays, those Sundays

27. those Sundays when the lights at the road's end were an occasion

28. those Sundays when my mother lay on her back
29. those Sundays when the sisters gathered like white moths
30. round their street lantern

31. and cities passed us by on the horizon
