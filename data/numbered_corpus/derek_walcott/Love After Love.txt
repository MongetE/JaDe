1. The time will come 
2. when, with elation 
3. you will greet yourself arriving 
4. at your own door, in your own mirror 
5. and each will smile at the other's welcome, 

6. and say, sit here. Eat. 
7. You will love again the stranger who was your self.
8. Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart 
9. to itself, to the stranger who has loved you 

10. all your life, whom you ignored 
11. for another, who knows you by heart. 
12. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, 

13. the photographs, the desperate notes, 
14. peel your own image from the mirror. 
15. Sit. Feast on your life.
