1. The fist clenched round my heart
2. loosens a little, and I gasp
3. brightness; but it tightens
4. again. When have I ever not loved
5. the pain of love? But this has moved

6. past love to mania. This has the strong
7. clench of the madman, this is
8. gripping the ledge of unreason, before
9. plunging howling into the abyss.

10. Hold hard then, heart. This way at least you live.
