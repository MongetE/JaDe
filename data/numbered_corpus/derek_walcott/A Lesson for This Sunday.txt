1. The growing idleness of summer grass
2. With its frail kites of furious butterflies
3. Requests the lemonade of simple praise
4. In scansion gentler than my hammock swings
5. And rituals no more upsetting than a
6. Black maid shaking linen as she sings
7. The plain notes of some Protestant hosanna—
8. Since I lie idling from the thought in things—

9. Or so they should, until I hear the cries
10. Of two small children hunting yellow wings,
11. Who break my Sabbath with the thought of sin.
12. Brother and sister, with a common pin,
13. Frowning like serious lepidopterists.
14. The little surgeon pierces the thin eyes.
15. Crouched on plump haunches, as a mantis prays
16. She shrieks to eviscerate its abdomen.
17. The lesson is the same. The maid removes
18. Both prodigies from their interest in science.
19. The girl, in lemon frock, begins to scream
20. As the maimed, teetering thing attempts its flight.
21. She is herself a thing of summery light,
22. Frail as a flower in this blue August air,
23. Not marked for some late grief that cannot speak.

24. The mind swings inward on itself in fear
25. Swayed towards nausea from each normal sign.
26. Heredity of cruelty everywhere,
27. And everywhere the frocks of summer torn,
28. The long look back to see where choice is born,
29. As summer grass sways to the scythe's design.
