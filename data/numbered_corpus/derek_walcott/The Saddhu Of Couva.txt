1. When sunset, a brass gong,
2. vibrate through Couva,
3. is then I see my soul, swiftly unsheathed,
4. like a white cattle bird growing more small
5. over the ocean of the evening canes,
6. and I sit quiet, waiting for it to return
7. like a hog-cattle blistered with mud,
8. because, for my spirit, India is too far.
9. And to that gong
10. sometimes bald clouds in saffron robes assemble
11. sacred to the evening,
12. sacred even to Ramlochan,
13. singing Indian hits from his jute hammock
14. while evening strokes the flanks
15. and silver horns of his maroon taxi,
16. as the mosquitoes whine their evening mantras,
17. my friend Anopheles, on the sitar,
18. and the fireflies making every dusk Divali.

19. I knot my head with a cloud,
20. my white mustache bristle like horns,
21. my hands are brittle as the pages of Ramayana.
22. Once the sacred monkeys multiplied like branches
23. in the ancient temples: I did not miss them,
24. because these fields sang of Bengal,
25. behind Ramlochan Repairs there was Uttar Pradesh;
26. but time roars in my ears like a river,
27. old age is a conflagration
28. as fierce as the cane fires of crop time.
29. I will pass through these people like a cloud,
30. they will see a white bird beating the evening sea
31. of the canes behind Couva,
32. and who will point it as my soul unsheathed?
33. Naither the bridegroom in beads,
34. nor the bride in her veils,
35. their sacred language on the cinema hoardings.

36. I talked too damn much on the Couva Village Council.
37. I talked too softly, I was always drowned
38. by the loudspeakers in front of the stores
39. or the loudspeakers with the greatest pictures.
40. I am best suited to stalk like a white cattle bird
41. on legs like sticks, with sticking to the Path
42. between the canes on a district road at dusk.
43. Playing the Elder. There are no more elders.
44. Is only old people.

45. My friends spit on the government.
46. I do not think is just the government.
47. Suppose all the gods too old,
48. Suppose they dead and they burning them,
49. supposing when some cane cutter
50. start chopping up snakes with a cutlass
51. he is severing the snake-armed god,
52. and suppose some hunter has caught
53. Hanuman in his mischief in a monkey cage.
54. Suppose all the gods were killed by electric light?
55. Sunset, a bonfire, roars in my ears;
56. embers of brown swallows dart and cry,
57. like women distracted,
58. around its cremation.
59. I ascend to my bed of sweet sandalwood.
