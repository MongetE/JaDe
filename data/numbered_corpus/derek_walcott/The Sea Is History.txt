1. Where are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?
2. Where is your tribal memory? Sirs,
3. in that gray vault. The sea. The sea
4. has locked them up. The sea is History.

5. First, there was the heaving oil,
6. heavy as chaos;
7. then, likea light at the end of a tunnel,

8. the lantern of a caravel,
9. and that was Genesis.
10. Then there were the packed cries,
11. the shit, the moaning:

12. Exodus.
13. Bone soldered by coral to bone,
14. mosaics
15. mantled by the benediction of the shark's shadow,

16. that was the Ark of the Covenant.
17. Then came from the plucked wires
18. of sunlight on the sea floor

19. the plangent harp of the Babylonian bondage,
20. as the white cowries clustered like manacles
21. on the drowned women,

22. and those were the ivory bracelets
23. of the Song of Solomon,
24. but the ocean kept turning blank pages

25. looking for History.
26. Then came the men with eyes heavy as anchors
27. who sank without tombs,

28. brigands who barbecued cattle,
29. leaving their charred ribs like palm leaves on the shore,
30. then the foaming, rabid maw

31. of the tidal wave swallowing Port Royal,
32. and that was Jonah,
33. but where is your Renaissance?

34. Sir, it is locked in them sea sands
35. out there past the reef's moiling shelf,
36. where the men-o'-war floated down;

37. strop on these goggles, I'll guide you there myself.
38. It's all subtle and submarine,
39. through colonnades of coral,

40. past the gothic windows of sea fans
41. to where the crusty grouper, onyx-eyed,
42. blinks, weighted by its jewels, like a bald queen;

43. and these groined caves with barnacles
44. pitted like stone
45. are our cathedrals,

46. and the furnace before the hurricanes:
47. Gomorrah. Bones ground by windmills
48. into marl and cornmeal,

49. and that was Lamentations - 
50. that was just Lamentations,
51. it was not History; 

52. then came, like scum on the river's drying lip,
53. the brown reeds of villages
54. mantling and congealing into towns,

55. and at evening, the midges' choirs, 
56. and above them, the spires
57. lancing the side of God

58. as His son set, and that was the New Testament.

59. Then came the white sisters clapping
60. to the waves' progress,
61. and that was Emancipation - 

62. jubilation, O jubilation - 
63. vanishing swiftly
64. as the sea's lace dries in the sun,

65. but that was not History,
66. that was only faith,
67. and then each rock broke into its own nation;

68. then came the synod of flies,
69. then came the secretarial heron,
70. then came the bullfrog bellowing for a vote,

71. fireflies with bright ideas
72. and bats like jetting ambassadors
73. and the mantis, like khaki police,

74. and the furred caterpillars of judges
75. examining each case closely,
76. and then in the dark ears of ferns

77. and in the salt chuckle of rocks
78. with their sea pools, there was the sound
79. like a rumour without any echo

80. of History, really beginning.
