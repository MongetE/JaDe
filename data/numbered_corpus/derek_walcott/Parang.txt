1. Man, I suck me tooth when I hear
2. How dem croptime fiddlers lie,
3. And de wailing, kiss-me-arse flutes
4. That bring water to me eye!
5. Oh, when I t'ink how from young
6. I wasted time at de fetes,
7. I could bawl in a red-eyed rage
8. For desire turned to regret,
9. Not knowing the truth that I sang
10. At parang and la commette.
11. Boy, every damned tune them tune
12. Of love that go last forever
13. Is the wax and the wane of the moon
14. Since Adam catch body-fever.

15. I old, so the young crop won't
16. Have these claws to reap their waist,
17. But I know "do more" from "don't"
18. Since the grave cry out "Make haste!"
19. This banjo world have one string
20. And all man does dance to that tune:
21. That love is a place in the bush
22. With music grieving from far,
23. As you look past her shoulder and see
24. Like her one tear afterwards

25. The falling of a fixed star.
26. Yound men does bring love to disgrace
27. With remorseful, regretful words,
28. When flesh upon flesh was the tune
29. Since the first cloud raise up to disclose
30. The breast of the naked moon.
