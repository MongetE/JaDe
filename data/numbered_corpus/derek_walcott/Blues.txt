1. Those five or six young guys
2. lunched on the stoop
3. that oven-hot summer night
4. whistled me over. Nice
5. and friendly. So, I stop.
6. MacDougal or Christopher
7. Street in chains of light.

8. A summer festival. Or some
9. saint's. I wasn't too far from
10. home, but not too bright
11. for a nigger, and not too dark.
12. I figured we were all
13. one, wop, nigger, jew,
14. besides, this wasn't Central Park.
15. I'm coming on too strong? You figure
16. right! They beat this yellow nigger
17. black and blue.

18. Yeah. During all this, scared
19. on case one used a knife,
20. I hung my olive-green, just-bought
21. sports coat on a fire plug.
22. I did nothing. They fought
23. each other, really. Life
24. gives them a few kcks,
25. that's all. The spades, the spicks.

26. My face smashed in, my bloddy mug
27. pouring, my olive-branch jacket saved
28. from cuts and tears,
29. I crawled four flights upstairs.
30. Sprawled in the gutter, I
31. remember a few watchers waved
32. loudly, and one kid's mother shouting
33. like "Jackie" or "Terry,"
34. "now that's enough!"
35. It's nothing really.
36. They don't get enough love.

37. You know they wouldn't kill
38. you. Just playing rough,
39. like young Americans will.
40. Still it taught me somthing
41. about love. If it's so tough,
42. forget it.
