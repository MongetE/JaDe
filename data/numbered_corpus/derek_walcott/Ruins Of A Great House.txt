1. though our longest sun sets at right declensions and
2. makes but winter arches,
3. it cannot be long before we lie down in darkness, and
4. have our light in ashes. . .
5. Browne, Urn Burial
6. Stones only, the disjecta membra of this Great House,
7. Whose moth-like girls are mixed with candledust,
8. Remain to file the lizard's dragonish claws.
9. The mouths of those gate cherubs shriek with stain;
10. Axle and coach wheel silted under the muck
11. Of cattle droppings.
12. Three crows flap for the trees
13. And settle, creaking the eucalyptus boughs.
14. A smell of dead limes quickens in the nose
15. The leprosy of empire.
16. ‘Farewell, green fields,
17. Farewell, ye happy groves!'
18. Marble like Greece, like Faulkner's South in stone,
19. Deciduous beauty prospered and is gone,
20. But where the lawn breaks in a rash of trees
21. A spade below dead leaves will ring the bone
22. Of some dead animal or human thing
23. Fallen from evil days, from evil times.
24. It seems that the original crops were limes
25. Grown in that silt that clogs the river's skirt;
26. The imperious rakes are gone, their bright girls gone,
27. The river flows, obliterating hurt.
28. I climbed a wall with the grille ironwork
29. Of exiled craftsmen protecting that great house
30. From guilt, perhaps, but not from the worm's rent
31. Nor from the padded calvary of the mouse.
32. And when a wind shook in the limes I heard
33. What Kipling heard, the death of a great empire, the
34. abuse
35. Of ignorance by Bible and by sword.
36. A green lawn, broken by low walls of stone,
37. Dipped to the rivulet, and pacing, I thought next
38. Of men like Hawkins, Walter Raleigh, Drake,
39. Ancestral murderers and poets, more perplex4ed
40. In memory now by every ulcerous crime.
41. The world's green age then was rotting lime
42. Whose stench became the charnel galleon's text.
43. The rot remains with us, the men are gone.
44. But, as dead ash is lifted in a wind
45. That fans the blackening ember of the mind,
46. My eyes burned from the ashen prose of Donne.
47. Ablaze with rage I thought,
48. Some slave is rotting in this manorial lake,
49. But still the coal of my compassion fought
50. That Albion too was once
51. A colony like ours, ‘part of the continent, piece of the
52. main',
53. Nook-shotten, rook o'erblown, deranged
54. By foaming channels and the vain expense
55. Of bitter faction.
56. All in compassion ends
57. So differently from what the heart arranged:
58. ‘as well as if a manor of thy friend's. . . ‘
