1. BOOK SIX


2. Chapter XLIV

3. I

4. In hill-towns, from San Fernando to Mayagüez,   
5. the same sunrise stirred the feathered lances of cane   
6. down the archipelago's highways. The first breeze

7. rattled the spears and their noise was like distant rain   
8. marching down from the hills, like a shell at your ears.   
9. In the cool asphalt Sundays of the Antilles

10. the light brought the bitter history of sugar
11. across the squared fields, heightening towards harvest,   
12. to the bleached flags of the Indian diaspora.

13. The drizzling light blew across the savannah   
14. darkening the racehorses' hides; mist slowly erased   
15. the royal palms on the crests of the hills and the

16. hills themselves. The brown patches the horses had grazed   
17. shone as wet as their hides. A skittish stallion   
18. jerked at his bridle, marble-eyed at the thunder

19. muffling the hills, but the groom was drawing him in   
20. like a fisherman, wrapping the slack line under   
21. one fist, then with the other tightening the rein

22. and narrowing the circle. The sky cracked asunder   
23. and a forked tree flashed, and suddenly that black rain   
24. which can lose an entire archipelago

25. in broad daylight was pouring tin nails on the roof,   
26. hammering the balcony. I closed the French window,   
27. and thought of the horses in their stalls with one hoof

28. tilted, watching the ropes of rain. I lay in bed
29. with current gone from the bed-lamp and heard the roar   
30. of wind shaking the windows, and I remembered

31. Achille on his own mattress and desperate Hector   
32. trying to save his canoe, I thought of Helen   
33. as my island lost in the haze, and I was sure

34. I'd never see her again. All of a sudden
35. the rain stopped and I heard the sluicing of water   
36. down the guttering. I opened the window when

37. the sun came out. It replaced the tiny brooms   
38. of palms on the ridges. On the red galvanized
39. roof of the paddock, the wet sparkled, then the grooms

40. led the horses over the new grass and exercised   
41. them again, and there was a different brightness   
42. in everything, in the leaves, in the horses' eyes.


43. II

44. I smelt the leaves threshing at the top of the year   
45. in green January over the orange villas   
46. and military barracks where the Plunketts were,

47. the harbour flecked by the wind that comes with Christmas,   
48. edged with the Arctic, that was christened Vent Noël;   
49. it stayed until March and, with luck, until Easter.

50. It freshened the cedars, waxed the laurier-cannelle,   
51. and hid the African swift. I smelt the drizzle
52. on the asphalt leaving the Morne, it was the smell

53. of an iron on damp cloth; I heard the sizzle   
54. of fried jackfish in oil with their coppery skin;
55. I smelt ham studded with cloves, the crusted accra,

56. the wax in the varnished parlour: Come in. Come in,   
57. the arm of the Morris chair sticky with lacquer;   
58. I saw a sail going out and a sail coming in,

59. and a breeze so fresh it lifted the lace curtains   
60. like a petticoat, like a sail towards Ithaca;   
61. I smelt a dead rivulet in the clogged drains.


62. III

63. Ah, twin-headed January, seeing either tense:   
64. a past, they assured us, born in degradation,   
65. and a present that lifted us up with the wind's

66. noise in the breadfruit leaves with such an elation   
67. that it contradicts what is past! The cannonballs   
68. of rotting breadfruit from the Battle of the Saints,

69. the asterisks of bulletholes in the brick walls   
70. of the redoubt. I lived there with every sense.
71. I smelt with my eyes, I could see with my nostrils.



72. Chapter XLV

73. I

74. One side of the coast plunges its precipices   
75. into the Atlantic. Turns require wide locks,
76. since the shoulder is sharp and the curve just misses

77. a long drop over the wind-bent trees and the rocks   
78. between the trees. There is a wide view of Dennery,   
79. with its stone church and raw ochre cliffs at whose base

80. the African breakers end. Across the flecked sea
81. whose combers veil and unveil the rocks with their lace   
82. the next port is Dakar. The uninterrupted wind

83. thuds under the wings of frigates, you see them bent   
84. from a force that has crossed the world, tilting to find   
85. purchase in the sudden downdrafts of its current.

86. The breeze threshed the palms on the cool December road   
87. where the Comet hurtled with empty leopard seats,   
88. so fast a man on a donkey trying to read

89. its oncoming fiery sign heard only two thudding beats   
90. from the up-tempo zouk that its stereo played
91. when it screeched round a bridge and began to ascend

92. away from the palm-fronds and their wickerwork shade   
93. that left the windscreen clear as it locked round the bend,   
94. where Hector suddenly saw the trotting piglet

95. and thought of Plunkett's warning as he heard it screel   
96. with the same sound that the tires of the Comet
97. made rounding the curve from the sweat-greased steering wheel.

98. The rear wheels spin to a dead stop, like a helm.   
99. The piglet trots down the safer side of the road.
100. Lodged in their broken branches the curled letters flame.

101. Hector had both hands on the wheel. His head was bowed   
102. under the swaying statue of the Madonna   
103. of the Rocks, her smile swayed under the blue hood,

104. and when her fluted robe stilled, the smile stayed on her   
105. dimpled porcelain. She saw, in the bowed man, the calm   
106. common oval of prayer, the head's usual angle

107. over the pew of the dashboard. Her lifted palm,   
108. small as a doll's from its cerulean mantle,   
109. indicated that he had prayed enough to the lace

110. of foam round the cliff's altar, that now, if he wished,   
111. he could lift his head, but he stayed in the same place,   
112. the way a man will remain when Mass is finished,

113. not unclenching his hands or freeing one to cross   
114. forehead, heart, and shoulders swiftly and then kneel   
115. facing the altar. He bowed in endless remorse,

116. for her mercy at what he had done to Achille,   
117. his brother. But his arc was over, for the course   
118. of every comet is such. The fated crescent

119. was printed on the road by the scorching tires.
120. A salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it went
121. in one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still gripped

122. the wheel. On the flecked sea, the uninterrupted   
123. wind herded the long African combers, and whipped   
124. the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead.


125. II

126. Drivers leant over the rail. One seized my luggage   
127. off the porter's cart. The rest burst into patois,   
128. with gestures of despair at the lost privilege

129. of driving me, then turned to other customers.
130. In the evening pastures horses grazed, their hides wet   
131. with light that shot its lances over the combers.

132. I had the transport all to myself.
133. "You all set?
134. Good. A good pal of mine died in that chariot   
135. of his called the Comet."
136. He turned in the front seat,

137. spinning the air with his free hand. I sat, sprawled out   
138. in the back, discouraging talk, with my crossed feet.   
139. "You never know when, eh? I was at the airport

140. that day. I see him take off like a rocket.
141. I always said that thing have too much horsepower.   
142. And so said, so done. The same hotel, chief, correct?"

143. I saw the coastal villages receding as
144. the highway's tongue translated bush into forest,   
145. the wild savannah into moderate pastures,

146. that other life going in its "change for the best,"   
147. its peace paralyzed in a postcard, a concrete   
148. future ahead of it all, in the cinder-blocks

149. of hotel development with the obsolete
150. craft of the carpenter, as I sensed, in the neat   
151. marinas, the fisherman's phantom. Old oarlocks

152. and rusting fretsaw. My craft required the same   
153. crouching care, the same crabbed, natural devotion   
154. of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frame

155. or planed an elegant canoe; its time was gone   
156. with the spirit in the wood, as wood grew obsolete
157. and plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete.

158. I watched the afternoon sea. Didn't I want the poor   
159. to stay in the same light so that I could transfix   
160. them in amber, the afterglow of an empire,

161. preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks   
162. to that blue bus-stop? Didn't I prefer a road
163. from which tracks climbed into the thickening syntax

164. of colonial travellers, the measured prose I read
165. as a schoolboy? That cove, with its brown shallows   
166. there, Praslin? That heron? Had they waited for me

167. to develop my craft? Why hallow that pretence   
168. of preserving what they left, the hypocrisy   
169. of loving them from hotels, a biscuit-tin fence

170. smothered in love-vines, scenes to which I was attached   
171. as blindly as Plunkett with his remorseful research?   
172. Art is History's nostalgia, it prefers a thatched

173. roof to a concrete factory, and the huge church
174. above a bleached village. The gap between the driver   
175. and me increased when he said:
176. "The place changing, eh?"

177. where an old rumshop had gone, but not that river
178. with its clogged shadows. That would make me a stranger.   
179. "All to the good," he said. I said, "All to the good,"

180. then, "whoever they are," to myself. I caught his eyes   
181. in the mirror. We were climbing out of Micoud.   
182. Hadn't I made their poverty my paradise?

183. His back could have been Hector's, ferrying tourists   
184. in the other direction home, the leopard seat
185. scratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests.

186. He had driven his burnt-out cargo, tired of sweat,
187. who longed for snow on the moon and didn't have to face   
188. the heat of that sinking sun, who knew a climate

189. as monotonous as this one could only produce   
190. from its unvarying vegetation flashes   
191. of a primal insight like those red-pronged lilies

192. that shot from the verge, that their dried calabashes   
193. of fake African masks for a fake Achilles
194. rattled with the seeds that came from other men's minds.

195. So let them think that. Who needed art in this place   
196. where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines,   
197. and the fishermen had such adept thumbs, such grace

198. these people had, but what they envied most in them   
199. was the calypso part, the Caribbean lilt   
200. still in the shells of their ears, like the surf's rhythm,

201. until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt   
202. like any Eden, and they sighed at the sign:   
203. HEWANNORRA (Iounalao), the gold sea

204. flat as a credit-card, extending its line
205. to a beach that now looked just like everywhere else,   
206. Greece or Hawaii. Now the goddamn souvenir

207. felt absurd, excessive. The painted gourds, the shells.   
208. Their own faces as brown as gourds. Mine felt as strange   
209. as those at the counter feeling their bodies change.


210. III

211. Change lay in our silence. We had come to that bend   
212. where the trees are warped by wind, and the cliffs, raw,   
213. shelve surely to foam.
214. "Is right here everything end,"

215. the driver said, and rammed open the transport door   
216. on his side, then mine.
217. "Anyway, chief, the view nice."   
218. I joined him at the gusting edge.
219. "His name was Hector."

220. The name was bent like the trees on the precipice   
221. to point inland. In its echo a man-o'-war
222. screamed on the wind. The driver moved off for a piss,

223. then shouted over his shoulder:
224. "A road-warrior.
225. He would drive like a madman when the power took.   
226. He had a nice woman. Maybe he died for her."

227. For her and tourism, I thought. The driver shook   
228. himself, zipping then hoisting his crotch.
229. "Crazy, but   
230. a gentle fellow anyway, with a very good brain."

231. Cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain   
232. across Serengeti. Cut to the spraying fans   
233. drummed by a riderless stallion, its wild mane

234. scaring the Scamander. Cut to a woman's hands
235. clenched towards her mouth with no sound. Cut to the wheel   
236. of a chariot's spiked hubcap. Cut to the face

237. of his muscling jaw, then flashback to Achille   
238. hurling a red tin and a cutlass. Next, a vase   
239. with a girl's hoarse whisper echoing "Omeros,"

240. as in a conch-shell. Cut to a shield of silver   
241. rolling like a hubcap. Rewind, in slow motion,   
242. myrmidons gathering by a village river

243. with lances for oars. Cut to the surpliced ocean   
244. droning its missal. Cut. A crane hoisting a wreck.   
245. A horse nosing the surf, then shuddering its neck.

246. He'd paid the penalty of giving up the sea
247. as graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed,   
248. for the taxi-business; he was making money,

249. but all of that money was making him ashamed   
250. of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf   
251. hustling passengers. He missed the uncertain sand

252. under his feet, he sighed for the trough of a wave,   
253. and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand,   
254. and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans.

255. Castries was corrupting him with its roaring life,   
256. its littered market, with too many transport vans   
257. competing. Castries had been his common-law wife

258. who, like Helen, he had longed for from a distance,   
259. and now he had both, but a frightening discontent   
260. hollowed his face; to find that the sea was a love

261. he could never lose made every gesture violent:   
262. ramming the side-door shut, raking the clutch. He drove   
263. as if driven by furies, but furies paid the rent.

264. A man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother.   
265. Mer was both mother and sea. In his lost canoe   
266. he had said his prayers. But now he was in another

267. kind of life that was changing him with his brand-new   
268. stereo, its endless garages, where he could not
269. whip off his shirt, hearing the conch's summoning note.



270. Chapter XLVI

271. I

272. Hector was buried near the sea he had loved once.   
273. Not too far from the shallows where he fought Achille   
274. for a tin and Helen. He did not hear the sea-almond's

275. moan over the bay when Philoctete blew the shell,   
276. nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud, nor a sail   
277. rattling to rest as its day's work was over,

278. and its mate, gauging depth, bent over the gunwale,   
279. then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar,
280. the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enough

281. when it was their turn to lie quiet as Hector,   
282. lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth's trough,
283. to sleep under the piled conchs, through every weather

284. on the violet-wreathed mound. Crouching for his friend to hear,   
285. Achille whispered about their ancestral river,   
286. and those things he would recognize when he got there,

287. his true home, forever and ever and ever,   
288. forever, compère. Then Philoctete limped over   
289. and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulder

290. to anchor his sorrow. Seven Seas and Helen   
291. did not come nearer. Achille had carried an oar
292. to the church and propped it outside with the red tin.

293. Now his voice strengthened. He said: "Mate, this is your spear,"
294. and laid the oar slowly, the same way he had placed   
295. the parallel oars in the hull of the gommier

296. the day the African swift and its shadow raced.
297. And this was the prayer that Achille could not utter:   
298. "The spear that I give you, my friend, is only wood.

299. Vexation is past. I know how well you treat her.   
300. You never know my admiration, when you stood   
301. crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoe

302. with the plates of your chest like a shield; I would say   
303. any enemy so was a compliment. 'Cause no   
304. African ever hurled his wide seine at the bay

305. by which he was born with such beauty. You hear me? Men   
306. did not know you like me. All right. Sleep good. Good night."   
307. Achille moved Philoctete's hand, then he saw Helen

308. standing alone and veiled in the widowing light.   
309. Then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin   
310. to her. Helen nodded. A wind blew out the sun.


311. II

312. Pride set in Helen's face after this, like a stone   
313. bracketed with Hector's name; her lips were incised   
314. by its dates in parenthesis. She seemed more stern,

315. more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed   
316. the hot street of the village like a distant sail
317. on the horizon. Grief heightened her. When she smiled

318. it was with such distance that it was hard to tell
319. if she had heard your condolence. It was the child,   
320. Ma Kilman told them, that made her more beautiful.


321. III

322. The rites of the island were simplified by its elements,
323. which changed places. The grooved sea was Achille's garden,   
324. the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their sense

325. of the sea, and Philoctete, on his height, often heard, in   
326. a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges,   
327. the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke,

328. and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches   
329. on the blue heights at sunrise, doing the same work   
330. as Philoctete clearing his plot, just as, at sunset,

331. smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if   
332. from his enamel pot. The woodsmoke smelt of a regret   
333. that men cannot name. On the charred field, the massive

334. sawn trunks burnt slowly like towers, and the great
335. indigo dusk slowly plumed down, devouring the still leaves,   
336. igniting the firefly huts, lifting the panicky egret

337. to beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves,   
338. take in the spars of its sails, then with quick-pricking head   
339. anchor itself shiftingly, and lift its question again.

340. At night, the island reversed its elements, the heron   
341. of a quarter-moon floated from Hector's grave, rain   
342. rose upwards from the sea, and the corrugated iron

343. of the sea glittered with nailheads. Ragged
344. plantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers   
345. over the furrows of Philoctete's garden, a chorus of aged

346. ancestors and straw, and, rustling, surrounded every house   
347. in the village with its back garden, with its rank midden
348. of rusted chamber pots, rotting nets, and the moon's cold basin.

349. They sounded, when they shook, after the moonlit meridian   
350. of their crossing, like the night-surf; they gazed in   
351. silence at the shadows of their lamplit children.

352. At Philoctete, groaning and soaking the flower on his shin   
353. with hot sulphur, cleaning its edges with yellow Vaseline,   
354. and, gripping his knee, squeezing rags from the basin.

355. At night, when yards are asleep, and the broken line
356. of the surf hisses like Philo, "Bon Dieu, aie, waie, my sin   
357. is this sore?" the old plantains suffer and shine.



358. Chapter XLVII

359. I

360. Islands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath   
361. of a cauldron, a sibylline cure. The citron   
362. sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in half

363. dipped its divining rod. The white spray of the thorn,   
364. which the swift bends lightly, waited for a black hand   
365. to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the wound

366. from the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand.   
367. Ma Kilman, in a black hat with its berried fringe,   
368. eased herself sideways down the broken concrete step

369. of the rumshop's back door, closed it, and rammed the hinge   
370. tight. The bolt caught a finger and with that her instep   
371. arch twisted and she let out a soft Catholic

372. curse, then crossed herself. She closed the gate. The asphalt   
373. sweated with the heat, the limp breadfruit leaves were thick   
374. over the fence. Her spectacles swam in their sweat.

375. She plucked an armpit. The damn wig was badly made.   
376. She was going to five o'clock Mass, to la Messe,   
377. and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayed

378. until the wafer dissolved her with tenderness,
379. the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze.
380. In the church's cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes.

381. She rolled down the elastic bands below the knees   
382. of her swollen stockings. It was then that their vise   
383. round her calves reminded her of Philoctete. Then,

384. numbering her beads, she began her own litany   
385. of berries, Hail Mary marigolds that stiffen   
386. their aureoles in the heights, mild anemone

387. and clear watercress, the sacred heart of Jesus   
388. pierced like the anthurium, the thorns of logwood,   
389. called the tree of life, the aloe good for seizures,

390. the hole in the daisy's palm, with its drying blood   
391. that was the hole in the fisherman's shin since he was   
392. pierced by a hook; there was the pale, roadside tisane

393. of her malarial childhood. There was this one
394. for easing a birth-breach, that one for a love-bath,   
395. before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sun

396. ripened like her nipples in girlhood. But what path   
397. led through nettles to the cure, the furious sibyl   
398. couldn't remember. Mimosa winced from her fingers,

399. shutting like jalousies at some passing evil
400. when she reached for them. The smell of incense lingers   
401. in her clothes. Inside, the candle-flames are erect

402. round the bier of the altar while she and her friends   
403. old-talk on the steps, but the plant keeps its secret   
404. when her memory reaches, shuttering in its fronds.


405. II

406. The dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings   
407. and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams   
408. where the dark grove had not heat but early mornings

409. of perpetual freshness, in which the bearded arms   
410. of a cedar held council. Between its gnarled toes
411. grew the reek of an unknown weed; its pronged flower

412. sprang like a buried anchor; its windborne odours   
413. diverted the bee from its pollen, but its power,
414. rooted in bitterness, drew her bowed head by the nose

415. as a spike does a circling bull. To approach it
416. Ma Kilman lowered her head to one side and screened   
417. the stench with a cologned handkerchief. The mulch it

418. was rooted in carried the smell, when it gangrened,   
419. of Philoctete's cut. In her black dress, her berried   
420. black hat, she climbed a goat-path up from the village,

421. past the stones with dried palms and conchs, where the buried   
422. suffer the sun all day Sunday, while goats forage   
423. the new wreaths. Once more she pulled at the itch in her

424. armpits, nearly dropping her purse. Then she climbed hard   
425. up the rain-cracked path, the bay closing behind her   
426. like a wound, and rested. Everything that echoed

427. repeated its outline: a goat's doddering bleat,
428. a hammer multiplying a roof, and, through the back yards,   
429. a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat.

430. Ma Kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards   
431. to the thread of the smell, one arm behind her back,   
432. passing the cactus, the thorn trees, and then the wood

433. appeared over her, thick green, the green almost black   
434. as her dress in its shade, its border of flowers
435. flecking the pasture with spray. Then she staggered back

436. from the line of ants at her feet. She saw the course   
437. they had kept behind her, following her from church,   
438. signalling a language she could not recognize.


439. III

440. A swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach   
441. centuries ago from its antipodal shore,
442. skimming the sea-troughs, outdarting ospreys, her luck

443. held to its shadow. She aimed to carry the cure   
444. that precedes every wound; the reversible Bight   
445. of Benin was her bow, her target the ringed haze

446. of a circling horizon. The star-grains at night   
447. made her hungrier; the leafless sea with no house   
448. for her weariness. Sometimes she dozed in her flight

449. for a swift's second, closing the seeds of her stare,
450. then ruddering straight. The dry sea-flakes whitened her   
451. breast, her feathers thinned. Then, one dawn the day-star

452. rose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her   
453. because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong   
454. east. She saw the horned island and uncurled her claws

455. with one frail cry, since swifts are not given to song,   
456. and fluttered down to a beach, ejecting the seed   
457. in grass near the sand. She nestled in dry seaweed.

458. In a year she was bleached bone. All of that motion   
459. a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will,   
460. but the vine grew its own wings, out of the ocean

461. it climbed like the ants, the ancestors of Achille,   
462. the women carrying coals after the dark door   
463. slid over the hold. As the weed grew in odour

464. so did its strength at the damp root of the cedar,   
465. where the flower was anchored at the mottled root   
466. as a lizard crawled upwards, foot by sallow foot.
