1. Better a jungle in the head
2. than rootless concrete.
3. Better to stand bewildered
4. by the fireflies' crooked street;

5. winter lamps do not show
6. where the sidewalk is lost,
7. nor can these tongues of snow
8. speak for the Holy Ghost;

9. the self-increasing silence 
10. of words dropped from a roof
11. points along iron railings,
12. direction, in not proof.

13. But best is this night surf
14. with slow scriptures of sand,
15. that sends, not quite a seraph,
16. but a late cormorant,

17. whose fading cry propels
18. through phosphorescent shoal
19. what, in my childhood gospels,
20. used to be called the Soul.
