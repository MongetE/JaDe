1. In the long night, when every creature should
2. naturally take some rest, or else his life cannot long
3. hold out, then it falls most into my woeful thoughts
4. how I have dropped so far behind that except death
5. nothing can comfort me, so do I despair of all
6. happiness. This thought remains with me until
7. morning, and forth from morning until eve. I need
8. borrow no grief; I have both leisure and leave to
9. mourn. There is no creature who will take my woe or
10. forbid me to weep enough and wail my fill; the sore
11. spark of pain destroys me.
12. This love has so placed me that he will never fulfill
13. my desire; for neither pity, mercy, nor grace can I
14. find. Yet even for fear of death can I not root out love
15. from my sorrowful heart. The more I love, the more
16. my lady pains me; through which I see, without
17. remedy, that I may in no way escape death.
18. Now in truth I will rehearse her name. She is called
19. Goodness-set-in-womanhood, Staidness-in-youth,
20. and Beauty-without-pride, and Pleasure-under-
21. control-and-fear. Her surname is Fair-ruthless,
22. Wisdom-knit-to-fortune. Because I love her she slays
23. me guiltless. Her I love best, and shall as long as I
24. live, better an hundred thousand times than myself,
25. better than all the riches and created beings of this world.
26. Now has not Love bestowed me well, to love where I
27. shall never have part or lot! Alas, so is Fortune's
28. wheel turned for me, so am I slain with Love's fiery
29. arrow! I can only love her best, my sweet foe. Love
30. has taught me no more of his art than ever to serve,
31. and cease for no sorrow.
32. Within my true, care-worn heart there is so much
33. woe, and so little joy as well, that woe is me that ever
34. I was born. For all that I desire I lack, and all that
35. ever I would not have, that, in truth, I ever find ready
36. to my hand. And of all this I know not to whom to
37. complain, for she who might bring me out of this
38. cares not whether I weep or sing, so little pities she
39. my pain. Alas! In sleeping-time I wake; when I
40. should dance I tremble with fear.
41. This heavy life I lead for your sake, though you pay
42. no heed thereto, my heart's lady, all my life's queen!
43. For truly I dare say it, as I see it: I seems to methat
44. your sweet heart of steel is now whetted against me
45. too keenly. My dear heart, foe best-beloved, why will
46. you do me all this sorrow? What have I done or said
47. to grieve you, except that I serve and love you and
48. nobody else, and as long as I live will ever?
49. Therefore, sweet, be not displeased. You are so good
50. and fair, it would be a very great wonder if you did
51. not have suitors of all kinds, both good and bad; and
52. the least worthy of all, I am he.
53. Nevertheless, my own sweet lady, though I be
54. unskillful and unfit ever to serve your highness, even
55. as best I knew how, yet this I swear, there is nobody
56. more glad than I to do your pleasure or to cure
57. whatever I know to distress you. And had I as much
58. power as will, then should you feel whether it were
59. so or not; for in this world is no living being who
60. would more gladly fulfill your heart's desire. For I
61. both love and fear you so sorely, and ever must and
62. have done right long, that none is better loved, and
63. never shall be. And yet I would only beg you to
64. believe me well, and be not angry, and let me
65. continue to serve you. Lo, this is all! For I am not so
66. bold or mad as to desire that you should love me; for
67. alas! Well I know that may not be; I have so little
68. worth, and you so much. For you are one of the most
69. excellent of the living, and I the most unlikely to
70. prosper. Yet, for all this, know you right well you
71. shall not so drive me from your service that I shall
72. not ever serve you faithfully, with all my five wits,
73. whatever woe I feel. For I am so set upon you that
74. though you never pity me, I must love you and ever
75. be as true as any man living can be.
76. The more I love you, goodly and noble one, the less I
77. find you love me. Alas! When will that obduracy
78. soften? Where now is all your womanly pity, your
79. noble gentleness, your graciousness? Will you spend
80. nothing of it on me? And as wholly as I am your,
81. sweet, and as great will I have to serve you, if thus
82. you let me die, you have gained but little from it. For
83. I believe I have given no cause. And this I beseech
84. you heartily, that if ever you find, so long as you live,
85. a servant more true to you than I, then leave me and
86. boldly slay me, and I will forgive you all my death.
87. And if you find no truer man, why will you allow me
88. to perish thus, and for no type of guilt except my
89. good desire? As good then be untrue as true.
90. But to your will I submit my life and death, and with
91. a fully obedient heart I pray, do with me as is your
92. pleasure. Much rather had I please you and die than
93. to think or say anything to offend you at any time.
94. Therefore, pity my bitter pains, sweet, and of your
95. grace grant me some drop; for else neither hope nor
96. happiness may remain with me, nor linger in my
97. troubled, careworn heart.
