1. A Balade.


2. Ma dame, ye ben of al beaute shryne
3. As fer as cercled is the mapamonde;
4. For as the cristall glorious ye shyne,
5. And lyke ruby ben your chekys rounde.
6. Therwyth ye ben so mery and so iocunde
7. That at a reuell whan that I se you dance,
8. It is an oynement vnto my wounde,
9. Thoght ye to me ne do no daliance.

10. For thogh I wepe of teres ful a tyne,
11. Yet may that wo myn herte nat confounde;
12. Your semy voys that ye so small out twyne
13. Makyth my thoght in ioy and blys habounde.
14. So curtaysly I go, wyth loue bounde,
15. That to my self I sey, in my penaunce,
16. Suffyseth me to loue you, Rosemounde,
17. Thogh ye to me ne do no daliaunce.

18. Nas neuer pyk walwed in galauntyne
19. As I in loue am walwed and iwounde;
20. For whych ful ofte I of my self deuyne
21. That I am trew Tristam the secunde.
22. My loue may not refreyde nor affounde;
23. I brenne ay in an amorouse plesaunce.
24. Do what you lyst, I wyl your thral be founde,
25. Thogh ye to me ne do no daliance.
