1. A.

2. Almighty and all-merciable Queen,
3. To whom all this world fleeth for succour,
4. To have release of sin, of sorrow, of teen!
5. Glorious Virgin! of all flowers flow'r,
6. To thee I flee, confounded in errour!
7. Help and relieve, almighty debonair,
8. Have mercy of my perilous languour!
9. Vanquish'd me hath my cruel adversair.

10. B.

11. Bounty so fix'd hath in thy heart his tent,
12. That well I wot thou wilt my succour be;
13. Thou canst not warne that with good intent
14. Asketh thy help, thy heart is ay so free!
15. Thou art largess of plein felicity,
16. Haven and refuge of quiet and rest!
17. Lo! how that thieves seven chase me!
18. Help, Lady bright, ere that my ship to-brest!

19. C.

20. Comfort is none, but in you, Lady dear!
21. For lo! my sin and my confusion,
22. Which ought not in thy presence to appear,
23. Have ta'en on me a grievous action,
24. Of very right and desperation!
25. And, as by right, they mighte well sustene
26. That I were worthy my damnation,
27. Ne were it mercy of you, blissful Queen!

28. D.

29. Doubt is there none, Queen of misericorde,
30. That thou art cause of grace and mercy here;
31. God vouchesaf'd, through thee, with us t'accord;
32. For, certes, Christe's blissful mother dear!
33. Were now the bow y-bent, in such mannere
34. As it was first, of justice and of ire,
35. The rightful God would of no mercy hear;
36. But through thee have we grace as we desire.

37. E.

38. Ever hath my hope of refuge in thee be';
39. For herebefore full oft in many a wise
40. Unto mercy hast thou received me.
41. But mercy, Lady! at the great assize,
42. When we shall come before the high Justice!
43. So little fruit shall then in me be found,
44. That, thou ere that day correcte me,
45. Of very right my work will me confound.

46. F.

47. Flying, I flee for succour to thy tent,
48. Me for to hide from tempest full of dread;
49. Beseeching you, that ye you not absent,
50. Though I be wick'. O help yet at this need!
51. All have I been a beast in wit and deed,
52. Yet, Lady! thou me close in with thy grace;
53. Thine enemy and mine, -- Lady, take heed! --
54. Unto my death in point is me to chase.

55. G.

56. Gracious Maid and Mother! which that never
57. Wert bitter nor in earthe nor in sea,
58. But full of sweetness and of mercy ever,
59. Help, that my Father be not wroth with me!
60. Speak thou, for I ne dare Him not see;
61. So have I done in earth, alas the while!
62. That, certes, but if thou my succour be,
63. To sink etern He will my ghost exile.

64. H.

65. He vouchesaf'd, tell Him, as was His will,
66. Become a man, as for our alliance,
67. And with His blood He wrote that blissful bill
68. Upon the cross, as general acquittance
69. To ev'ry penitent in full creance;
70. And therefore, Lady bright! thou for us pray;
71. Then shalt thou stenten alle His grievance,
72. And make our foe to failen of his prey.

73. I.

74. I wote well thou wilt be our succour,
75. Thou art so full of bounty in certain;
76. For, when a soule falleth in errour,
77. Thy pity go'th, and haleth him again;
78. Then makest thou his peace with his Sov'reign,
79. And bringest him out of the crooked street:
80. Whoso thee loveth shall not love in vain,
81. That shall he find as he the life shall lete.

82. K.

83. Kalendares illumined be they
84. That in this world be lighted with thy name;
85. And whoso goeth with thee the right way,
86. Him shall not dread in soule to be lame;
87. Now, Queen of comfort! since thou art the same
88. To whom I seeke for my medicine,
89. Let not my foe no more my wound entame;
90. My heal into thy hand all I resign.

91. L.

92. Lady, thy sorrow can I not portray
93. Under that cross, nor his grievous penance;
94. But, for your bothe's pain, I you do pray,
95. Let not our aller foe make his boastance,
96. That he hath in his listes, with mischance,
97. Convicte that ye both have bought so dear;
98. As I said erst, thou ground of all substance!
99. Continue on us thy piteous eyen clear.

100. M.

101. Moses, that saw the bush of flames red
102. Burning, of which then never a stick brenn'd,
103. Was sign of thine unwemmed maidenhead.
104. Thou art the bush, on which there gan descend
105. The Holy Ghost, the which that Moses wend
106. Had been on fire; and this was in figure.
107. Now, Lady! from the fire us do defend,
108. Which that in hell eternally shall dure.

109. N.

110. Noble Princess! that never haddest peer;
111. Certes if any comfort in us be,
112. That cometh of thee, Christe's mother dear!
113. We have none other melody nor glee,
114. Us to rejoice in our adversity;
115. Nor advocate, that will and dare so pray
116. For us, and for as little hire as ye,
117. That helpe for an Ave-Mary or tway.

118. O.

119. O very light of eyen that be blind!
120. O very lust of labour and distress!
121. O treasurer of bounty to mankind!
122. The whom God chose to mother for humbless!
123. From his ancill he made thee mistress
124. Of heav'n and earth, our billes up to bede;
125. This world awaiteth ever on thy goodness;
126. For thou ne failedst never wight at need.

127. P.

128. Purpose I have sometime for to enquere
129. Wherefore and why the Holy Ghost thee sought,
130. When Gabrielis voice came to thine ear;
131. He not to war us such a wonder wrought,
132. But for to save us, that sithens us bought:
133. Then needeth us no weapon us to save,
134. But only, where we did not as we ought,
135. Do penitence, and mercy ask and have.

136. Q.

137. Queen of comfort, right when I me bethink
138. That I aguilt have bothe Him and thee,
139. And that my soul is worthy for to sink,
140. Alas! I, caitiff, whither shall I flee?
141. Who shall unto thy Son my meane be?
142. Who, but thyself, that art of pity well?
143. Thou hast more ruth on our adversity
144. Than in this world might any tongue tell!

145. R.

146. Redress me, Mother, and eke me chastise!
147. For certainly my Father's chastising
148. I dare not abiden in no wise,
149. So hideous is his full reckoning.
150. Mother! of whom our joy began to spring,
151. Be ye my judge, and eke my soule's leach;
152. For ay in you is pity abounding
153. To each that will of pity you beseech.

154. S.

155. Sooth is it that He granteth no pity
156. Withoute thee; for God of his goodness
157. Forgiveth none, but it like unto thee;
158. He hath thee made vicar and mistress
159. Of all this world, and eke governess
160. Of heaven; and represseth his justice
161. After thy will; and therefore in witness
162. He hath thee crowned in so royal wise.

163. T.

164. Temple devout! where God chose his wonning,
165. From which, these misbeliev'd deprived be,
166. To you my soule penitent I bring;
167. Receive me, for I can no farther flee.
168. With thornes venomous, O Heaven's Queen!
169. For which the earth accursed was full yore,
170. I am so wounded, as ye may well see,
171. That I am lost almost, it smart so sore!

172. V.

173. Virgin! that art so noble of apparail,
174. That leadest us into the highe tow'r
175. Of Paradise, thou me wiss and counsail
176. How I may have thy grace and thy succour;
177. All have I been in filth and in errour,
178. Lady! *on that country thou me adjourn,
179. That called is thy bench of freshe flow'r,
180. There as that mercy ever shall sojourn.

181. X.

182. Xpe thy Son, that in this world alight,
183. Upon a cross to suffer his passioun,
184. And suffer'd eke that Longeus his heart pight,
185. And made his hearte-blood to run adown;
186. And all this was for my salvatioun:
187. And I to him am false and eke unkind,
188. And yet he wills not my damnation;
189. This thank I you, succour of all mankind!

190. Y.

191. Ysaac was figure of His death certain,
192. That so farforth his father would obey,
193. That him ne raughte nothing to be slain;
194. Right so thy Son list as a lamb to dey:
195. Now, Lady full of mercy! I you pray,
196. Since he his mercy 'sured me so large,
197. Be ye not scant, for all we sing and say,
198. That ye be from vengeance alway our targe.

199. Z.

200. Zachary you calleth the open well
201. That washed sinful soul out of his guilt;
202. Therefore this lesson out I will to tell,
203. That, n'ere thy tender hearte, we were spilt.
204. Now, Lady brighte! since thou canst and wilt,
205. Be to the seed of Adam merciable;
206. Bring us unto that palace that is built
207. To penitents that be *to mercy able!
