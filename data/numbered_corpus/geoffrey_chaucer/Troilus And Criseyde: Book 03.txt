13. God loveth, and to love wol nought werne;
14. And in this world no lyves creature,

52. Incipit Liber Tercius.


53. Lay al this mene whyle Troilus,
54. Recordinge his lessoun in this manere,
55. 'Ma fey!' thought he, 'Thus wole I seye and thus;
56. Thus wole I pleyne unto my lady dere;
57. That word is good, and this shal be my chere;
58. This nil I not foryeten in no wyse.'
59. God leve him werken as he can devyse!

60. And, lord, so that his herte gan to quappe,
61. Heringe hir come, and shorte for to syke!
62. And Pandarus, that ledde hir by the lappe,
63. Com ner, and gan in at the curtin pyke,
64. And seyde, 'God do bote on alle syke!
65. See, who is here yow comen to visyte;
66. Lo, here is she that is your deeth to wyte.'

67. Ther-with it semed as he wepte almost;
68. 'A ha,' quod Troilus so rewfully,
69. 'Wher me be wo, O mighty god, thow wost!
70. Who is al there? I se nought trewely.'
71. 'Sire,' quod Criseyde, 'it is Pandare and I.'
72. 'Ye, swete herte? Allas, I may nought ryse
73. To knele, and do yow honour in som wyse.'

74. And dressede him upward, and she right tho
75. Gan bothe here hondes softe upon him leye,
76. 'O, for the love of god, do ye not so
77. To me,' quod she, 'Ey! What is this to seye?
78. Sire, come am I to yow for causes tweye;
79. First, yow to thonke, and of your lordshipe eke
80. Continuance I wolde yow biseke.'

81. This Troilus, that herde his lady preye
82. Of lordship him, wex neither quik ne deed,
83. Ne mighte a word for shame to it seye,
84. Al-though men sholde smyten of his heed.
85. But lord, so he wex sodeinliche reed,
86. And sire, his lesson, that he wende conne,
87. To preyen hir, is thurgh his wit y-ronne.

88. Cryseyde al this aspyede wel y-nough,
89. For she was wys, and lovede him never-the-lasse,
90. Al nere he malapert, or made it tough,
91. Or was to bold, to singe a fool a masse.
92. But whan his shame gan somwhat to passe,
93. His resons, as I may my rymes holde,
94. I yow wole telle, as techen bokes olde.

95. In chaunged vois, right for his verray drede,
96. Which vois eek quook, and ther-to his manere
97. Goodly abayst, and now his hewes rede,
98. Now pale, un-to Criseyde, his lady dere,
99. With look doun cast and humble yolden chere,
100. Lo, the alderfirste word that him asterte
101. Was, twyes, 'Mercy, mercy, swete herte!'

102. And stinte a whyl, and whan he mighte out-bringe,
103. The nexte word was, 'God wot, for I have,
104. As feyfully as I have had konninge,
105. Ben youres, also god so my sowle save;
106. And shal til that I, woful wight, be grave.
107. And though I dar ne can un-to yow pleyne,
108. Y-wis, I suffre nought the lasse peyne.

109. 'Thus muche as now, O wommanliche wyf,
110. I may out-bringe, and if this yow displese,
111. That shal I wreke upon myn owne lyf
112. Right sone, I trowe, and doon your herte an ese,
113. If with my deeth your herte I may apese.
114. But sin that ye han herd me som-what seye,
115. Now recche I never how sone that I deye.'

116. Ther-with his manly sorwe to biholde,
117. It mighte han maad an herte of stoon to rewe;
118. And Pandare weep as he to watre wolde,
119. And poked ever his nece newe and newe,
120. And seyde, 'Wo bigon ben hertes trewe!
121. For love of god, make of this thing an ende,
122. Or slee us bothe at ones, er that ye wende.'

123. 'I? What?' quod she, 'By god and by my trouthe,
124. I noot nought what ye wilne that I seye.'
125. 'I? What?' quod he, 'That ye han on him routhe,
126. For goddes love, and doth him nought to deye.'
127. 'Now thanne thus,' quod she, 'I wolde him preye
128. To telle me the fyn of his entente;
129. Yet wist I never wel what that he mente.'

130. 'What that I mene, O swete herte dere?'
131. Quod Troilus, 'O goodly, fresshe free!
132. That, with the stremes of your eyen clere,
133. Ye wolde som-tyme freendly on me see,
134. And thanne agreen that I may ben he,
135. With-oute braunche of vyce on any wyse,
136. In trouthe alwey to doon yow my servyse,

137. 'As to my lady right and chief resort,
138. With al my wit and al my diligence,
139. And I to han, right as yow list, comfort,
140. Under your yerde, egal to myn offence,
141. As deeth, if that I breke your defence;
142. And that ye deigne me so muche honoure,
143. Me to comaunden ought in any houre.

144. 'And I to ben your verray humble trewe,
145. Secret, and in my paynes pacient,
146. And ever-mo desire freshly newe,
147. To serven, and been y-lyke ay diligent,
148. And, with good herte, al holly your talent
149. Receyven wel, how sore that me smerte,
150. Lo, this mene I, myn owene swete herte.'

151. Quod Pandarus, 'Lo, here an hard request,
152. And resonable, a lady for to werne!
153. Now, nece myn, by natal Ioves fest,
154. Were I a god, ye sholde sterve as yerne,
155. That heren wel, this man wol no-thing yerne
156. But your honour, and seen him almost sterve,
157. And been so looth to suffren him yow serve.'

158. With that she gan hir eyen on him caste
159. Ful esily, and ful debonairly,
160. Avysing hir, and hyed not to faste
161. With never a word, but seyde him softely,
162. 'Myn honour sauf, I wol wel trewely,
163. And in swich forme as he can now devyse,
164. Receyven him fully to my servyse,

165. 'Biseching him, for goddes love, that he
166. Wolde, in honour of trouthe and gentilesse,
167. As I wel mene, eek mene wel to me,
168. And myn honour, with wit and besinesse
169. Ay kepe; and if I may don him gladnesse,
170. From hennes-forth, y-wis, I nil not feyne:
171. Now beeth al hool; no lenger ye ne pleyne.

172. 'But nathelees, this warne I yow,' quod she,
173. 'A kinges sone al-though ye be, y-wis,
174. Ye shal na-more have soverainetee
175. Of me in love, than right in that cas is;
176. Ne I nil forbere, if that ye doon a-mis,
177. To wrathen yow; and whyl that ye me serve,
178. Cherycen yow right after ye deserve.

179. 'And shortly, dere herte and al my knight,
180. Beth glad, and draweth yow to lustinesse,
181. And I shal trewely, with al my might,
182. Your bittre tornen al in-to swetenesse.
183. If I be she that may yow do gladnesse,
184. For every wo ye shal recovere a blisse';
185. And him in armes took, and gan him kisse.

186. Fil Pandarus on knees, and up his eyen
187. To hevene threw, and held his hondes hye,
188. 'Immortal god!' quod he, 'That mayst nought dyen,
189. Cupide I mene, of this mayst glorifye;
190. And Venus, thou mayst maken melodye;
191. With-outen hond, me semeth that in the towne,
192. For this merveyle, I here ech belle sowne.

193. 'But ho! No more as now of this matere,
194. For-why this folk wol comen up anoon,
195. That han the lettre red; lo, I hem here.
196. But I coniure thee, Criseyde, and oon,
197. And two, thou Troilus, whan thow mayst goon,
198. That at myn hous ye been at my warninge,
199. For I ful wel shal shape youre cominge;

200. 'And eseth ther your hertes right y-nough;
201. And lat see which of yow shal bere the belle
202. To speke of love a-right!' ther-with he lough,
203. 'For ther have ye a layser for to telle.'
204. Quod Troilus, 'How longe shal I dwelle
205. Er this be doon?' Quod he, 'Whan thou mayst ryse,
206. This thing shal be right as I yow devyse.'

207. With that Eleyne and also Deiphebus
208. Tho comen upward, right at the steyres ende;
209. And Lord, so than gan grone Troilus,
210. His brother and his suster for to blende.
211. Quod Pandarus, 'It tyme is that we wende;
212. Tak, nece myn, your leve at alle three,
213. And lat hem speke, and cometh forth with me.'

214. She took hir leve at hem ful thriftily,
215. As she wel coude, and they hir reverence
216. Un-to the fulle diden hardely,
217. And speken wonder wel, in hir absence,
218. Of hir, in preysing of hir excellence,
219. Hir governaunce, hir wit; and hir manere
220. Commendeden, it Ioye was to here.

221. Now lat hir wende un-to hir owne place,
222. And torne we to Troilus a-yein,
223. That gan ful lightly of the lettre passe
224. That Deiphebus hadde in the gardin seyn.
225. And of Eleyne and him he wolde fayn
226. Delivered been, and seyde that him leste
227. To slepe, and after tales have reste.

228. Eleyne him kiste, and took hir leve blyve,
229. Deiphebus eek, and hoom wente every wight;
230. And Pandarus, as faste as he may dryve,
231. To Troilus tho com, as lyne right;
232. And on a paillet, al that glade night,
233. By Troilus he lay, with mery chere,
234. To tale; and wel was hem they were y-fere.

235. Whan every wight was voided but they two,
236. And alle the dores were faste y-shette,
237. To telle in short, with-oute wordes mo,
238. This Pandarus, with-outen any lette,
239. Up roos, and on his beddes syde him sette,
240. And gan to speken in a sobre wyse
241. To Troilus, as I shal yow devyse:

242. 'Myn alderlevest lord, and brother dere,
243. God woot, and thou, that it sat me so sore,
244. When I thee saw so languisshing to-yere,
245. For love, of which thy wo wex alwey more;
246. That I, with al my might and al my lore,
247. Have ever sithen doon my bisinesse
248. To bringe thee to Ioye out of distresse,

249. 'And have it brought to swich plyt as thou wost,
250. So that, thorugh me, thow stondest now in weye
251. To fare wel, I seye it for no bost,
252. And wostow which? For shame it is to seye,
253. For thee have I bigonne a gamen pleye
254. Which that I never doon shal eft for other,
255. Al-though he were a thousand fold my brother.

256. 'That is to seye, for thee am I bicomen,
257. Bitwixen game and ernest, swich a mene
258. As maken wommen un-to men to comen;
259. Al sey I nought, thou wost wel what I mene.
260. For thee have I my nece, of vyces clene,
261. So fully maad thy gentilesse triste,
262. That al shal been right as thy-selve liste.

263. 'But god, that al wot, take I to witnesse,
264. That never I this for coveityse wroughte,
265. But only for to abregge that distresse,
266. For which wel nygh thou deydest, as me thoughte.
267. But, gode brother, do now as thee oughte,
268. For goddes love, and kep hir out of blame,
269. Sin thou art wys, and save alwey hir name.

270. 'For wel thou wost, the name as yet of here
271. Among the peple, as who seyth, halwed is;
272. For that man is unbore, I dar wel swere,
273. That ever wiste that she dide amis.
274. But wo is me, that I, that cause al this,
275. May thenken that she is my nece dere,
276. And I hir eem, and trattor eek y-fere!

277. 'And were it wist that I, through myn engyn,
278. Hadde in my nece y-put this fantasye,
279. To do thy lust, and hoolly to be thyn,
280. Why, al the world up-on it wolde crye,
281. And seye, that I the worste trecherye
282. Dide in this cas, that ever was bigonne,
283. And she for-lost, and thou right nought y-wonne.

284. 'Wher-fore, er I wol ferther goon a pas,
285. Yet eft I thee biseche and fully seye,
286. That privetee go with us in this cas;
287. That is to seye, that thou us never wreye;
288. And be nought wrooth, though I thee ofte preye
289. To holden secree swich an heigh matere;
290. For skilful is, thow wost wel, my preyere.

291. 'And thenk what wo ther hath bitid er this,
292. For makinge of avantes, as men rede;
293. And what mischaunce in this world yet ther is,
294. Fro day to day, right for that wikked dede;
295. For which these wyse clerkes that ben dede
296. Han ever yet proverbed to us yonge,
297. That "Firste vertu is to kepe tonge."

298. 'And, nere it that I wilne as now tabregge
299. Diffusioun of speche, I coude almost
300. A thousand olde stories thee alegge
301. Of wommen lost, thorugh fals and foles bost;
302. Proverbes canst thy-self y-nowe, and wost,
303. Ayeins that vyce, for to been a labbe,
304. Al seyde men sooth as often as they gabbe.

305. 'O tonge, allas! So often here-biforn
306. Hastow made many a lady bright of hewe
307. Seyd, "Welawey! The day that I was born!"
308. And many a maydes sorwes for to newe;
309. And, for the more part, al is untrewe
310. That men of yelpe, and it were brought to preve;
311. Of kinde non avauntour is to leve.

312. 'Avauntour and a lyere, al is on;
313. As thus: I pose, a womman graunte me
314. Hir love, and seyth that other wol she non,
315. And I am sworn to holden it secree,
316. And after I go telle it two or three;
317. Y-wis, I am avauntour at the leste,
318. And lyere, for I breke my biheste.

319. 'Now loke thanne, if they be nought to blame,
320. Swich maner folk; what shal I clepe hem, what,
321. That hem avaunte of wommen, and by name,
322. That never yet bihighte hem this ne that,
323. Ne knewe hem more than myn olde hat?
324. No wonder is, so god me sende hele,
325. Though wommen drede with us men to dele.

326. 'I sey not this for no mistrust of yow,
327. Ne for no wys man, but for foles nyce,
328. And for the harm that in the world is now,
329. As wel for foly ofte as for malyce;
330. For wel wot I, in wyse folk, that vyce
331. No womman drat, if she be wel avysed;
332. For wyse ben by foles harm chastysed.

333. 'But now to purpos; leve brother dere,
334. Have al this thing that I have seyd in minde,
335. And keep thee clos, and be now of good chere,
336. For at thy day thou shalt me trewe finde.
337. I shal thy proces sette in swich a kinde,
338. And god to-forn, that it shall thee suffyse,
339. For it shal been right as thou wolt devyse.

340. 'For wel I woot, thou menest wel, parde;
341. Therfore I dar this fully undertake.
342. Thou wost eek what thy lady graunted thee,
343. And day is set, the chartres up to make.
344. Have now good night, I may no lenger wake;
345. And bid for me, sin thou art now in blisse,
346. That god me sende deeth or sone lisse.'

347. Who mighte telle half the Ioye or feste
348. Which that the sowle of Troilus tho felte,
349. Heringe theffect of Pandarus biheste?
350. His olde wo, that made his herte swelte,
351. Gan tho for Ioye wasten and to-melte,
352. And al the richesse of his sykes sore
353. At ones fledde, he felte of hem no more.

354. But right so as these holtes and these hayes,
355. That han in winter dede been and dreye,
356. Revesten hem in grene, whan that May is,
357. Whan every lusty lyketh best to pleye;
358. Right in that selve wyse, sooth to seye,
359. Wax sodeynliche his herte ful of Ioye,
360. That gladder was ther never man in Troye.

361. And gan his look on Pandarus up caste
362. Ful sobrely, and frendly for to see,
363. And seyde, 'Freend, in Aprille the laste,
364. As wel thou wost, if it remembre thee,
365. How neigh the deeth for wo thou founde me;
366. And how thou didest al thy bisinesse

368. 'Thou wost how longe I it for-bar to seye
369. To thee, that art the man that I best triste;
370. And peril was it noon to thee by-wreye,

386. And this, in alle the temples of this toun
387. Upon the goddes alle, I wol thee swere,
388. To-morwe day, if that thee lyketh here.

389. 'And that thou hast so muche y-doon for me,
390. That I ne may it never-more deserve,
391. This knowe I wel, al mighte I now for thee
392. A thousand tymes on a morwen sterve.
393. I can no more, but that I wol thee serve
394. Right as thy sclave, whider-so thou wende,
395. For ever-more, un-to my lyves ende!

396. 'But here, with al myn herte, I thee biseche,
397. That never in me thou deme swich folye
398. As I shal seyn; me thoughte, by thy speche,
399. That this, which thou me dost for companye,
400. I sholde wene it were a bauderye;
401. I am nought wood, al-if I lewed be;
402. It is not so, that woot I wel, pardee.

403. 'But he that goth, for gold or for richesse,
404. On swich message, calle him what thee list;
405. And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse,
406. Compassioun, and felawship, and trist;
407. Departe it so, for wyde-where is wist
408. How that there is dyversitee requered
409. Bitwixen thinges lyke, as I have lered.

410. 'And, that thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene

412. I have my faire suster Polixene,
413. Cassandre, Eleyne, or any of the frape;
414. Be she never so faire or wel y-shape,
415. Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone,
416. To han for thyn, and lat me thanne allone.

417. 'But, sith that thou hast don me this servyse
418. My lyf to save, and for noon hope of mede,
419. So, for the love of god, this grete empryse
420. Performe it out; for now is moste nede.
421. For high and low, with-outen any drede,
422. I wol alwey thyne hestes alle kepe;
423. Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.'

424. Thus held him ech of other wel apayed,
425. That al the world ne mighte it bet amende;
426. And, on the morwe, whan they were arayed,
427. Ech to his owene nedes gan entende.
428. But Troilus, though as the fyr he brende
429. For sharp desyr of hope and of plesaunce,
430. He not for-gat his gode governaunce.

431. But in him-self with manhod gan restreyne
432. Ech rakel dede and ech unbrydled chere,
433. That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne,
434. Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere,
435. What that he mente, as touching this matere.
436. From every wight as fer as is the cloude
437. He was, so wel dissimulen he coude.

438. And al the whyl which that I yow devyse,
439. This was his lyf; with al his fulle might,
440. By day he was in Martes high servyse,
441. This is to seyn, in armes as a knight;
442. And for the more part, the longe night
443. He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve
444. His lady best, hir thank for to deserve.

445. Nil I nought swere, al-though he lay softe,
446. That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed,
447. Ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte,
448. And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed;
449. But in swich cas men is nought alwey plesed,
450. For ought I wot, no more than was he;
451. That can I deme of possibilitee.

452. But certeyn is, to purpos for to go,
453. That in this whyle, as writen is in geste,
454. He say his lady som-tyme; and also
455. She with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste,
456. And by hir bothe avys, as was the beste,
457. Apoynteden ful warly in this nede,
458. So as they dorste, how they wolde procede.

459. But it was spoken in so short a wyse,
460. In swich awayt alwey, and in swich fere,
461. Lest any wyght devynen or devyse
462. Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere,
463. That al this world so leef to hem ne were
464. As that Cupido wolde hem grace sende
465. To maken of hir speche aright an ende.

466. But thilke litel that they spake or wroughte,
467. His wyse goost took ay of al swich hede,
468. It semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte
469. With-outen word, so that it was no nede
470. To bidde him ought to done, or ought for-bede;
471. For which she thought that love, al come it late,
472. Of alle Ioye hadde opned hir the yate.

473. And shortly of this proces for to pace,
474. So wel his werk and wordes he bisette,
475. That he so ful stood in his lady grace,
476. That twenty thousand tymes, or she lette,
477. She thonked god she ever with him mette;
478. So coude he him governe in swich servyse,
479. That al the world ne might it bet devyse.

480. For-why she fond him so discreet in al,
481. So secret, and of swich obeisaunce,
482. That wel she felte he was to hir a wal
483. Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce;
484. That, to ben in his gode governaunce,
485. So wys he was, she was no more afered,
486. I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered.

487. And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fyr,
488. Was evere y-lyke prest and diligent;
489. To ese his frend was set al his desyr.
490. He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent;
491. He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent.
492. That never man, as in his freendes nede,
493. Ne bar him bet than he, with-outen drede.

494. But now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde
495. That every word, or sonde, or look, or chere
496. Of Troilus that I rehersen sholde,
497. In al this whyle un-to his lady dere;
498. I trowe it were a long thing for to here;
499. Or of what wight that stant in swich disioynte,
500. His wordes alle, or every look, to poynte.

501. For sothe, I have not herd it doon er this,
502. In storye noon, ne no man here, I wene;
503. And though I wolde I coude not, y-wis;
504. For ther was som epistel hem bitwene,
505. That wolde, as seyth myn auctor, wel contene
506. Neigh half this book, of which him list not wryte;
507. How sholde I thanne a lyne of it endyte?

508. But to the grete effect: than sey I thus,
509. That stonding in concord and in quiete,
510. Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus,
511. As I have told, and in this tyme swete,
512. Save only often mighte they not mete,
513. Ne layser have hir speches to fulfelle,
514. That it befel right as I shal yow telle.

515. That Pandarus, that ever dide his might
516. Right for the fyn that I shal speke of here,
517. As for to bringe to his hous som night
518. His faire nece, and Troilus y-fere,
519. Wher-as at leyser al this heigh matere,
520. Touching hir love, were at the fulle up-bounde,
521. Hadde out of doute a tyme to it founde.

522. For he with greet deliberacioun
523. Hadde every thing that her-to mighte avayle
524. Forn-cast, and put in execucioun.
525. And neither laft, for cost ne for travayle;
526. Come if hem list, hem sholde no-thing fayle;
527. And for to been in ought espyed there,
528. That, wiste he wel, an inpossible were.

529. Dredelees, it cleer was in the wind
530. Of every pye and every lette-game;
531. Now al is wel, for al the world is blind
532. In this matere, bothe fremed and tame.
533. This timbur is al redy up to frame;
534. Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde
535. A certein houre, in which she comen sholde.

536. And Troilus, that al this purveyaunce
537. Knew at the fulle, and waytede on it ay,
538. Hadde here-up-on eek made gret ordenaunce,
539. And founde his cause, and ther-to his aray,
540. If that he were missed, night or day,
541. Ther-whyle he was aboute this servyse,
542. That he was goon to doon his sacrifyse,

543. And moste at swich a temple alone wake,
544. Answered of Appollo for to be;
545. And first to seen the holy laurer quake,
546. Er that Apollo spak out of the tree,
547. To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee,
548. And forthy lette him no man, god forbede,
549. But preye Apollo helpen in this nede.

550. Now is ther litel more for to doone,
551. But Pandare up, and shortly for to seyne,
552. Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone,
553. Whan lightles is the world a night or tweyne,
554. And that the welken shoop him for to reyne,
555. He streight a-morwe un-to his nece wente;
556. Ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente.

557. Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye
558. As he was wont, and of him-self to Iape;
559. And fynally, he swor and gan hir seye,
560. By this and that, she sholde him not escape,
561. Ne lengere doon him after hir to gape;
562. But certeynly she moste, by hir leve,
563. Come soupen in his hous with him at eve.

564. At whiche she lough, and gan hir faste excuse,
565. And seyde, 'It rayneth; lo, how sholde I goon?'
566. 'Lat be,' quod he, 'ne stond not thus to muse;
567. This moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.'
568. So at the laste her-of they felle at oon,
569. Or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere,
570. He nolde never come ther she were.

571. Sone after this, to him she gan to rowne,
572. And asked him if Troilus were there?
573. He swor hir, 'Nay, for he was out of towne,'
574. And seyde, 'Nece, I pose that he were,
575. Yow thurfte never have the more fere.
576. For rather than men mighte him ther aspye,
577. Me were lever a thousand-fold to dye.'

578. Nought list myn auctor fully to declare
579. What that she thoughte whan he seyde so,
580. That Troilus was out of town y-fare,
581. As if he seyde ther-of sooth or no;
582. But that, with-outen awayt, with him to go,
583. She graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte
584. And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte.

585. But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche,
586. Al-though with him to goon it was no fere,
587. For to be war of goosish peples speche,
588. That dremen thinges whiche that never were,
589. And wel avyse him whom he broughte there;
590. And seyde him, 'Eem, sin I mot on yow triste,
591. Loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste.'

592. He swor hire, 'Yis, by stokkes and by stones,
593. And by the goddes that in hevene dwelle,
594. Or elles were him levere, soule and bones,
595. With Pluto king as depe been in helle
596. As Tantalus!' What sholde I more telle?
597. Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve,
598. And she to souper com, whan it was eve,

599. With a certayn of hir owene men,
600. And with hir faire nece Antigone,
601. And othere of hir wommen nyne or ten;
602. But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye,
603. But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see
604. Thurgh-out a litel windowe in a stewe,
605. Ther he bishet, sin midnight, was in mewe,

606. Unwist of every wight but of Pandare?
607. But to the poynt; now whan that she was y-come
608. With alle Ioye, and alle frendes fare,
609. Hir em anoon in armes hath hir nome,
610. And after to the souper, alle and some,
611. Whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette;
612. God wot, ther was no deyntee for to fette.

613. And after souper gonnen they to ryse,
614. At ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade,
615. And wel was him that coude best devyse
616. To lyken hir, or that hir laughen made.
617. He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade.
618. But at the laste, as every thing hath ende,
619. She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende.

620. But O, Fortune, executrice of wierdes,
621. O influences of thise hevenes hye!
622. Soth is, that, under god, ye ben our hierdes,
623. Though to us bestes been the causes wrye.
624. This mene I now, for she gan hoomward hye,
625. But execut was al bisyde hir leve,
626. At the goddes wil, for which she moste bleve.

627. The bente mone with hir hornes pale,
628. Saturne, and Iove, in Cancro ioyned were,
629. That swich a rayn from hevene gan avale
630. That every maner womman that was there
631. Hadde of that smoky reyn a verray fere;
632. At which Pandare tho lough, and seyde thenne,
633. 'Now were it tyme a lady to go henne!

634. 'But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese
635. Yow any-thing, than prey I yow,' quod he,
636. 'To doon myn herte as now so greet an ese
637. As for to dwelle here al this night with me,
638. For-why this is your owene hous, pardee.
639. For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought a-game,
640. To wende as now, it were to me a shame.'

641. Criseyde, which that coude as muche good
642. As half a world, tok hede of his preyere;
643. And sin it ron, and al was on a flood,
644. She thoughte, as good chep may I dwellen here,
645. And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere,
646. And have a thank, as grucche and thanne abyde;
647. For hoom to goon, it may nought wel bityde.'

648. 'I wol,' quod she, 'myn uncle leef and dere,
649. Sin that yow list, it skile is to be so;
650. I am right glad with yow to dwellen here;
651. I seyde but a-game, I wolde go.'
652. 'Y-wis, graunt mercy, nece!' quod he tho;
653. 'Were it a game or no, soth for to telle,
654. Now am I glad, sin that yow list to dwelle.'

655. Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright
656. The newe Ioye, and al the feste agayn;
657. But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might,
658. He wolde han hyed hir to bedde fayn,
659. And seyde, 'Lord, this is an huge rayn!
660. This were a weder for to slepen inne;
661. And that I rede us sonE to biginne.

662. 'And nece, woot ye wher I wol yow leye,
663. For that we shul not liggen fer asonder,
664. And for ye neither shullen, dar I seye,
665. Heren noise of reynes nor of thondre?
666. By god, right in my lyte closet yonder.
667. And I wol in that outer hous allone
668. Be wardeyn of your wommen everichone.

669. 'And in this middel chaumbre that ye see
670. Shal youre wommen slepen wel and softe;
671. And ther I seyde shal your-selve be;
672. And if ye liggen wel to-night, com ofte,
673. And careth not what weder is on-lofte.
674. The wyn anon, and whan so that yow leste,
675. So go we slepe, I trowe it be the beste.'

676. Ther nis no more, but here-after sone,
677. The voyde dronke, and travers drawe anon,
678. Gan every wight, that hadde nought to done
679. More in the place, out of the chaumber gon.
680. And ever-mo so sternelich it ron,
681. And blew ther-with so wonderliche loude,
682. That wel neigh no man heren other coude.

683. Tho Pandarus, hir eem, right as him oughte,
684. With women swiche as were hir most aboute,
685. Ful glad un-to hir beddes syde hir broughte,
686. And toke his leve, and gan ful lowe loute,
687. And seyde, 'Here at this closet-dore with-oute,
688. Right over-thwart, your wommen liggen alle,
689. That, whom yow list of hem, ye may here calle.'

690. So whan that she was in the closet leyd,
691. And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce
692. A-bedde weren, ther as I have seyd,
693. There was no more to skippen nor to traunce,
694. But boden go to bedde, with mischaunce,
695. If any wight was steringe any-where,
696. And late hem slepe that a-bedde were.

697. But Pandarus, that wel coude eche a del
698. The olde daunce, and every poynt ther-inne,
699. Whan that he sey that alle thing was wel,
700. He thoughte he wolde up-on his werk biginne,
701. And gan the stewe-dore al softe un-pinne;
702. And stille as stoon, with-outen lenger lette,
703. By Troilus a-doun right he him sette.

704. And, shortly to the poynt right for to gon,
705. Of al this werk he tolde him word and ende,
706. And seyde, 'Make thee redy right anon,
707. For thou shalt in-to hevene blisse wende.'
708. 'Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,'
709. Quod Troilus, 'for never yet no nede
710. Hadde I er now, ne halvendel the drede.'

711. Quod Pandarus, 'Ne drede thee never a del,
712. For it shal been right as thou wilt desyre;
713. So thryve I, this night shal I make it wel,
714. Or casten al the gruwel in the fyre.'
715. 'Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspyre,'
716. Quod Troilus, 'as wis as I thee serve,
717. And ever bet and bet shal, til I sterve.

718. 'And if I hadde, O Venus ful of murthe,
719. Aspectes badde of Mars or of Saturne,
720. Or thou combust or let were in my birthe,
721. Thy fader prey al thilke harm disturne
722. Of grace, and that I glad ayein may turne,
723. For love of him thou lovedest in the shawe,
724. I mene Adoon, that with the boor was slawe.

725. 'O Iove eek, for the love of faire Europe,
726. The whiche in forme of bole awey thou fette;
727. Now help, O Mars, thou with thy blody cope,
728. For love of Cipris, thou me nought ne lette;
729. O Phebus, thenk whan Dane hir-selven shette
730. Under the bark, and laurer wex for drede,
731. Yet for hir love, O help now at this nede!

732. 'Mercurie, for the love of Hierse eke,
733. For which Pallas was with Aglauros wrooth,
734. Now help, and eek Diane, I thee biseke
735. That this viage be not to thee looth.
736. O fatal sustren, which, er any clooth
737. Me shapen was, my destene me sponne,
738. So helpeth to this werk that is bi-gonne!'

739. Quod Pandarus, 'Thou wrecched mouses herte,
740. Art thou agast so that she wol thee byte?
741. Why, don this furred cloke up-on thy sherte,
742. And folowe me, for I wol have the wyte;
743. But byd, and lat me go bifore a lyte.'
744. And with that word he gan un-do a trappe,
745. And Troilus he broughte in by the lappe.

746. The sterne wind so loude gan to route
747. That no wight other noyse mighte here;
748. And they that layen at the dore with-oute,
749. Ful sykerly they slepten alle y-fere;
750. And Pandarus, with a ful sobre chere,
751. Goth to the dore anon with-outen lette,
752. Ther-as they laye, and softely it shette.

753. And as he com ayeinward prively,
754. His nece awook, and asked, 'Who goth there?'
755. 'My dere nece,' quod he, 'it am I;
756. Ne wondreth not, ne have of it no fere;'
757. And ner he com, and seyde hir in hir ere,
758. 'No word, for love of god I yow biseche;
759. Lat no wight ryse and heren of oure speche.'

760. 'What! Which wey be ye comen, benedicite?'
761. Quod she; 'And how thus unwist of hem alle?'
762. 'Here at this secre trappe-dore,' quod he.
763. Quod tho Criseyde, 'Lat me som wight calle.'
764. 'Ey! God forbede that it sholde falle,'
765. Quod Pandarus, 'that ye swich foly wroughte!
766. They mighte deme thing they never er thoughte!

767. 'It is nought good a sleping hound to wake,
768. Ne yeve a wight a cause to devyne;
769. Your wommen slepen alle, I under-take,
770. So that, for hem, the hous men mighte myne;
771. And slepen wolen til the sonne shyne.
772. And whan my tale al brought is to an ende,
773. Unwist, right as I com, so wol I wende.

774. 'Now, nece myn, ye shul wel understonde,'
775. Quod he, 'so as ye wommen demen alle,
776. That for to holde in love a man in honde,
777. And him hir "leef" and "dere herte" calle,
778. And maken him an howve above a calle,
779. I mene, as love an other in this whyle,
780. She doth hir-self a shame, and him a gyle.

781. 'Now wherby that I telle yow al this?
782. Ye woot your-self, as wel as any wight,
783. How that your love al fully graunted is
784. To Troilus, the worthieste knight,
785. Oon of this world, and ther-to trouthe plyght,
786. That, but it were on him along, ye nolde
787. Him never falsen, whyle ye liven sholde.

788. 'Now stant it thus, that sith I fro yow wente,
789. This Troilus, right platly for to seyn,
790. Is thurgh a goter, by a prive wente,
791. In-to my chaumbre come in al this reyn,
792. Unwist of every maner wight, certeyn,
793. Save of my-self, as wisly have I Ioye,
794. And by that feith I shal Pryam of Troye!

795. 'And he is come in swich peyne and distresse
796. That, but he be al fully wood by this,
797. He sodeynly mot falle in-to wodnesse,
798. But-if god helpe; and cause why this is,
799. He seyth him told is, of a freend of his,
800. How that ye sholde love oon that hatte Horaste,
801. For sorwe of which this night shalt been his laste.'

802. Criseyde, which that al this wonder herde,
803. Gan sodeynly aboute hir herte colde,
804. And with a syk she sorwfully answerde,
805. 'Allas! I wende, who-so tales tolde,
806. My dere herte wolde me not holde
807. So lightly fals! Allas! Conceytes wronge,
808. What harm they doon, for now live I to longe!

809. 'Horaste! Allas! And falsen Troilus?
810. I knowe him not, god helpe me so,' quod she;
811. 'Allas! What wikked spirit tolde him thus?
812. Now certes, eem, to-morwe, and I him see,
813. I shal ther-of as ful excusen me
814. As ever dide womman, if him lyke';
815. And with that word she gan ful sore syke.

816. 'O god!' quod she, 'So worldly selinesse,
817. Which clerkes callen fals felicitee,
818. Y-medled is with many a bitternesse!
819. Ful anguisshous than is, god woot,' quod she,
820. 'Condicioun of veyn prosperitee;
821. For either Ioyes comen nought y-fere,
822. Or elles no wight hath hem alwey here.

823. 'O brotel wele of mannes Ioye unstable!
824. With what wight so thou be, or how thou pleye,
825. Either he woot that thou, Ioye, art muable,
826. Or woot it not, it moot ben oon of tweye;
827. Now if he woot it not, how may he seye
828. That he hath verray Ioye and selinesse,
829. That is of ignoraunce ay in derknesse?

830. 'Now if he woot that Ioye is transitorie,
831. As every Ioye of worldly thing mot flee,
832. Than every tyme he that hath in memorie,
833. The drede of lesing maketh him that he
834. May in no perfit selinesse be.
835. And if to lese his Ioye he set a myte,
836. Than semeth it that Ioye is worth ful lyte.

837. 'Wherfore I wol deffyne in this matere,
838. That trewely, for ought I can espye,
839. Ther is no verray wele in this world here.
840. But O, thou wikked serpent, Ialousye,
841. Thou misbeleved and envious folye,
842. Why hastow Troilus me mad untriste,
843. That never yet agilte him, that I wiste?'

844. Quod Pandarus, 'Thus fallen is this cas.'
845. 'Why, uncle myn,' quod she, 'who tolde him this?
846. Why doth my dere herte thus, allas?'
847. 'Ye woot, ye nece myn,' quod he, 'what is;
848. I hope al shal be wel that is amis,
849. For ye may quenche al this, if that yow leste,
850. And doth right so, for I holde it the beste.'

851. 'So shal I do to-morwe, y-wis,' quod she,
852. 'And god to-forn, so that it shal suffyse.'
853. 'To-morwe? Allas, that were a fair!' quod he,
854. 'Nay, nay, it may not stonden in this wyse;
855. For, nece myn, thus wryten clerkes wyse,
856. That peril is with drecching in y-drawe;
857. Nay, swich abodes been nought worth an hawe.

858. 'Nece, al thing hath tyme, I dar avowe;
859. For whan a chaumber a-fyr is, or an halle,
860. Wel more nede is, it sodeynly rescowe
861. Than to dispute, and axe amonges alle
862. How is this candele in the straw y-falle?
863. A! Benedicite! For al among that fare
864. The harm is doon, and fare-wel feldefare!

865. 'And, nece myn, ne take it not a-greef,
866. If that ye suffre him al night in this wo,
867. God help me so, ye hadde him never leef,
868. That dar I seyn, now there is but we two;
869. But wel I woot, that ye wol not do so;
870. Ye been to wys to do so gret folye,
871. To putte his lyf al night in Iupertye.

872. 'Hadde I him never leef? By god, I wene
873. Ye hadde never thing so leef,' quod she.
874. 'Now by my thrift,' quod he, 'that shal be sene;
875. For, sin ye make this ensample of me,
876. If I al night wolde him in sorwe see
877. For al the tresour in the toun of Troye,
878. I bidde god, I never mote have Ioye!

879. 'Now loke thanne, if ye, that been his love,
880. Shul putte al night his lyf in Iupartye
881. For thing of nought! Now, by that god above,
882. Nought only this delay comth of folye,
883. But of malyce, if that I shal nought lye.
884. What, platly, and ye suffre him in distresse,
885. Ye neither bountee doon ne gentilesse!'

886. Quod tho Criseyde, 'Wole ye doon o thing,
887. And ye therwith shal stinte al his disese?
888. Have here, and bereth him this blewe ringe,
889. For ther is no-thing mighte him bettre plese,
890. Save I my-self, ne more his herte apese;
891. And sey my dere herte, that his sorwe
892. Is causeles, that shal be seen to-morwe.'

893. 'A ring?' quod he, 'Ye, hasel-wodes shaken!
894. Ye nece myn, that ring moste han a stoon
895. That mighte dede men alyve maken;
896. And swich a ring trowe I that ye have noon.
897. Discrecioun out of your heed is goon;
898. That fele I now,' quod he, 'and that is routhe;
899. O tyme y-lost, wel maystow cursen slouthe!

900. 'Wot ye not wel that noble and heigh corage
901. Ne sorweth not, ne stinteth eek for lyte?
902. But if a fool were in a Ialous rage,
903. I nolde setten at his sorwe a myte,
904. But feffe him with a fewe wordes whyte
905. Another day, whan that I mighte him finde;
906. But this thing stant al in another kinde.

907. 'This is so gentil and so tendre of herte,
908. That with his deeth he wol his sorwes wreke;
909. For trusteth wel, how sore that him smerte,
910. He wol to yow no Ialouse wordes speke.
911. And for-thy, nece, er that his herte breke,
912. So spek your-self to him of this matere;
913. For with o word ye may his herte stere.

914. 'Now have I told what peril he is inne,
915. And his coming unwist is to every wight;
916. Ne, pardee, harm may ther be noon, ne sinne;
917. I wol my-self be with yow al this night.
918. Ye knowe eek how it is your owne knight,
919. And that, by right, ye moste upon him triste,
920. And I al prest to fecche him whan yow liste.'

921. This accident so pitous was to here,
922. And eek so lyk a sooth, at pryme face,
923. And Troilus hir knight to hir so dere,
924. His prive coming, and the siker place,
925. That, though that she dide him as thanne a grace,
926. Considered alle thinges as they stode,
927. No wonder is, sin she dide al for gode.

928. Cryseyde answerde, 'As wisly god at reste
929. My sowle bringe, as me is for him wo!
930. And eem, y-wis, fayn wolde I doon the beste,
931. If that I hadde grace to do so.
932. But whether that ye dwelle or for him go,
933. I am, til god me bettre minde sende,
934. At dulcarnon, right at my wittes ende.'

935. Quod Pandarus, 'Ye, nece, wol ye here?
936. Dulcarnon called is "fleminge of wrecches";
937. It semeth hard, for wrecches wol not lere
938. For verray slouthe or othere wilful tecches;
939. This seyd by hem that be not worth two fecches.
940. But ye ben wys, and that we han on honde
941. Nis neither hard, ne skilful to withstonde.'

942. 'Thanne, eem,' quod she, 'doth her-of as yow list;
943. But er he come, I wil up first aryse;
944. And, for the love of god, sin al my trist
945. Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wyse,
946. So wircheth now in so discreet a wyse,
947. That I honour may have, and he plesaunce;
948. For I am here al in your governaunce.'

949. 'That is wel seyd,' quod he, 'my nece dere'
950. Ther good thrift on that wyse gentil herte!
951. But liggeth stille, and taketh him right here,
952. It nedeth not no ferther for him sterte;
953. And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte,
954. For love of god; and, Venus, I the herie;
955. For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie.'

956. This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette
957. Ful sobrely, right be hir beddes heed,
958. And in his beste wyse his lady grette;
959. But lord, so she wex sodeynliche reed!
960. Ne, though men sholden smyten of hir heed,
961. She coude nought a word a-right out-bringe
962. So sodeynly, for his sodeyn cominge.

963. But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele
964. In every thing, to pleye anoon bigan,
965. And seyde, 'Nece, see how this lord can knele!
966. Now, for your trouthe, seeth this gentil man!'
967. And with that word he for a quisshen ran,
968. And seyde, 'Kneleth now, whyl that yow leste,
969. Ther god your hertes bringe sone at reste!'

970. Can I not seyn, for she bad him not ryse,
971. If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce,
972. Or elles that she toke it in the wyse
973. Of duetee, as for his observaunce;
974. But wel finde I she dide him this plesaunce,
975. That she him kiste, al-though she syked sore;
976. And bad him sitte a-doun with-outen more.

977. Quod Pandarus, 'Now wol ye wel biginne;
978. Now doth him sitte, gode nece dere,
979. Upon your beddes syde al there with-inne,
980. That ech of yow the bet may other here.'
981. And with that word he drow him to the fere,
982. And took a light, and fond his contenaunce,
983. As for to loke up-on an old romaunce.

984. Criseyde, that was Troilus lady right,
985. And cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse,
986. Al thoughte she, hir servaunt and hir knight
987. Ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse,
988. Yet nathelees, considered his distresse,
989. And that love is in cause of swich folye,
990. Thus to him spak she of his Ialousye:

991. 'Lo, herte myn, as wolde the excellence
992. Of love, ayeins the which that no man may,
993. Ne oughte eek goodly maken resistence
994. And eek bycause I felte wel and say
995. Youre grete trouthe, and servyse every day;
996. And that your herte al myn was, sooth to seyne,
997. This droof me for to rewe up-on your peyne.

998. 'And your goodnesse have I founde alwey yit,
999. Of whiche, my dere herte and al my knight,
1000. I thonke it yow, as fer as I have wit,
1001. Al can I nought as muche as it were right;
1002. And I, emforth my conninge and my might,
1003. Have and ay shal, how sore that me smerte,
1004. Ben to yow trewe and hool, with a myn herte;

1005. 'And dredelees, that shal be founde at preve. --
1006. But, herte myn, what al this is to seyne
1007. Shal wel be told, so that ye noght yow greve,
1008. Though I to yow right on your-self compleyne.
1009. For ther-with mene I fynally the peyne,
1010. That halt your herte and myn in hevinesse,
1011. Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse.

1012. 'My goode, myn, not I for-why ne how
1013. That Ialousye, allas! That wikked wivere,
1014. Thus causelees is cropen in-to yow;
1015. The harm of which I wolde fayn delivere!
1016. Allas! That he, al hool, or of him slivere,
1017. Shuld have his refut in so digne a place,
1018. Ther Iove him sone out of your herte arace!

1019. 'But O, thou Iove, O auctor of nature,
1020. Is this an honour to thy deitee,
1021. That folk ungiltif suffren here iniure,
1022. And who that giltif is, al quit goth he?
1023. O were it leful for to pleyne on thee,
1024. That undeserved suffrest Ialousye,
1025. Of that I wolde up-on thee pleyne and crye!

1026. 'Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen
1027. To seyn right thus, "Ye, Ialousye is love!"
1028. And wolde a busshel venim al excusen,
1029. For that o greyn of love is on it shove!
1030. But that wot heighe god that sit above,
1031. If it be lyker love, or hate, or grame;
1032. And after that, it oughte bere his name.

1033. 'But certeyn is, som maner Ialousye
1034. Is excusable more than som, y-wis.
1035. As whan cause is, and som swich fantasye
1036. With pietee so wel repressed is,
1037. That it unnethe dooth or seyth amis,
1038. But goodly drinketh up al his distresse;
1039. And that excuse I, for the gentilesse.

1040. 'And som so ful of furie is and despyt
1041. That it sourmounteth his repressioun;
1042. But herte myn, ye be not in that plyt,
1043. That thanke I god, for whiche your passioun
1044. I wol not calle it but illusioun,
1045. Of habundaunce of love and bisy cure,
1046. That dooth your herte this disese endure.

1047. 'Of which I am right sory but not wrooth;
1048. But, for my devoir and your hertes reste,
1049. Wher-so yow list, by ordal or by ooth,
1050. By sort, or in what wyse so yow leste,
1051. For love of god, lat preve it for the beste!
1052. And if that I be giltif, do me deye,
1053. Allas! What mighte I more doon or seye?'

1054. With that a fewe brighte teres newe
1055. Owt of hir eyen fille, and thus she seyde,
1056. 'Now god, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe
1057. To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.'
1058. With that hir heed doun in the bed she leyde,
1059. And with the shete it wreigh, and syghed sore,
1060. And held hir pees; not o word spak she more.

1061. But now help god to quenchen al this sorwe,
1062. So hope I that he shal, for he best may;
1063. For I have seyn, of a ful misty morwe
1064. Folwen ful ofte a mery someres day;
1065. And after winter folweth grene May.
1066. Men seen alday, and reden eek in stories,
1067. That after sharpe shoures been victories.

1068. This Troilus, whan he hir wordes herde,
1069. Have ye no care, him liste not to slepe;
1070. For it thoughte him no strokes of a yerde
1071. To here or seen Criseyde, his lady wepe;
1072. But wel he felte aboute his herte crepe,
1073. For every teer which that Criseyde asterte,
1074. The crampe of deeth, to streyne him by the herte.

1075. And in his minde he gan the tyme acurse
1076. That he cam there, and that that he was born;
1077. For now is wikke y-turned in-to worse,
1078. And al that labour he hath doon biforn,
1079. He wende it lost, he thoughte he nas but lorn.
1080. 'O Pandarus,' thoughte he, 'allas! Thy wyle
1081. Serveth of nought, so weylaway the whyle!'

1082. And therwithal he heng a-doun the heed,
1083. And fil on knees, and sorwfully he sighte;
1084. What mighte he seyn? He felte he nas but deed,
1085. For wrooth was she that shulde his sorwes lighte.
1086. But nathelees, whan that he speken mighte,
1087. Than seyde he thus, 'God woot, that of this game,
1088. Whan al is wist, than am I not to blame!'

1089. Ther-with the sorwe so his herte shette,
1090. That from his eyen fil there not a tere,
1091. And every spirit his vigour in-knette,
1092. So they astoned or oppressed were.
1093. The feling of his sorwe, or of his fere,
1094. Or of ought elles, fled was out of towne;
1095. And doun he fel al sodeynly a-swowne.

1096. This was no litel sorwe for to see;
1097. But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste,
1098. 'O nece, pees, or we be lost,' quod he,
1099. 'Beth nought agast;' But certeyn, at the laste,
1100. For this or that, he in-to bedde him caste,
1101. And seyde, 'O theef, is this a mannes herte?'
1102. And of he rente al to his bare sherte;

1103. And seyde, 'Nece, but ye helpe us now,
1104. Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!'
1105. 'Y-wis, so wolde I, and I wiste how,
1106. Ful fayn,' quod she; 'Allas! That I was born!'
1107. 'Ye, nece, wole ye pullen out the thorn
1108. That stiketh in his herte?' quod Pandare;
1109. 'Sey "Al foryeve," and stint is al this fare!'

1110. 'Ye, that to me,' quod she, 'ful lever were
1111. Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth';
1112. And therwith-al she swoor him in his ere,
1113. 'Y-wis, my dere herte, I am nought wrooth,
1114. Have here my trouthe and many another ooth;
1115. Now speek to me, for it am I, Cryseyde!'
1116. But al for nought; yet mighte he not a-breyde.

1117. Therwith his pous and pawmes of his hondes
1118. They gan to frote, and wete his temples tweyne,
1119. And, to deliveren him from bittre bondes,
1120. She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne,
1121. Him to revoken she dide al hir peyne.
1122. And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe,
1123. And of his swough sone after that adawe,

1124. And gan bet minde and reson to him take,
1125. But wonder sore he was abayst, y-wis.
1126. And with a syk, whan he gan bet a-wake,
1127. He seyde, 'O mercy, god, what thing is this?'
1128. 'Why do ye with your-selven thus amis?'
1129. Quod tho Criseyde, 'Is this a mannes game?
1130. What, Troilus! Wol ye do thus, for shame?'

1131. And therwith-al hir arm over him she leyde,
1132. And al foryaf, and ofte tyme him keste.
1133. He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seyde
1134. As fil to purpos for his herte reste.
1135. And she to that answerde him as hir leste;
1136. And with hir goodly wordes him disporte
1137. She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte.

1138. Quod Pandarus, 'For ought I can espyen,
1139. This light, nor I ne serven here of nought;
1140. Light is not good for syke folkes yen.
1141. But for the love of god, sin ye be brought
1142. In thus good plyt, lat now non hevy thought
1143. Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweye:'
1144. And bar the candele to the chimeneye.

1145. Sone after this, though it no nede were,
1146. Whan she swich othes as hir list devyse
1147. Hadde of him take, hir thoughte tho no fere,
1148. Ne cause eek non, to bidde him thennes ryse.
1149. Yet lesse thing than othes may suffyse
1150. In many a cas; for every wight, I gesse,
1151. That loveth wel meneth but gentilesse.

1152. But in effect she wolde wite anoon
1153. Of what man, and eek where, and also why
1154. He Ielous was, sin ther was cause noon;
1155. And eek the signe, that he took it by,
1156. She bad him that to telle hir bisily,
1157. Or elles, certeyn, she bar him on honde,
1158. That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde.

1159. With-outen more, shortly for to seyne,
1160. He moste obeye un-to his lady heste;
1161. And for the lasse harm, he moste feyne.
1162. He seyde hir, whan she was at swiche a feste,
1163. She mighte on him han loked at the leste;
1164. Not I not what, al dere y-nough a risshe,
1165. As he that nedes moste a cause fisshe.

1166. And she answerde, 'Swete, al were it so,
1167. What harm was that, sin I non yvel mene?
1168. For, by that god that boughte us bothe two,
1169. In alle thinge is myn entente clene.
1170. Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene;
1171. Wol ye the childish Ialous contrefete?
1172. Now were it worthy that ye were y-bete.'

1173. Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to syke,
1174. Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte his herte deyde;
1175. And seyde, 'Allas! Up-on my sorwes syke
1176. Have mercy, swete herte myn, Cryseyde!
1177. And if that, in tho wordes that I seyde,
1178. Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace;
1179. Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.'

1180. And she answerde, 'Of gilt misericorde!
1181. That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this;
1182. And ever-more on this night yow recorde,
1183. And beth wel war ye do no more amis.'
1184. 'Nay, dere herte myn,' quod he, 'y-wis.'
1185. 'And now,' quod she, 'that I have do yow smerte,
1186. Foryeve it me, myn owene swete herte.'

1187. This Troilus, with blisse of that supprysed,
1188. Put al in goddes hond, as he that mente
1189. No-thing but wel; and, sodeynly avysed,
1190. He hir in armes faste to him hente.
1191. And Pandarus, with a ful good entente,
1192. Leyde him to slepe, and seyde, 'If ye ben wyse,
1193. Swowneth not now, lest more folk aryse.'

1194. What mighte or may the sely larke seye,
1195. Whan that the sperhauk hath it in his foot?
1196. I can no more, but of thise ilke tweye,
1197. To whom this tale sucre be or soot,
1198. Though that I tarie a yeer, som-tyme I moot,
1199. After myn auctor, tellen hir gladnesse,
1200. As wel as I have told hir hevinesse.

1201. Criseyde, which that felte hir thus y-take,
1202. As writen clerkes in hir bokes olde,
1203. Right as an aspes leef she gan to quake,
1204. Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde.
1205. But Troilus, al hool of cares colde,
1206. Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene;
1207. Thus sondry peynes bringen folk in hevene.

1208. This Troilus in armes gan hir streyne,
1209. And seyde, 'O swete, as ever mote I goon,
1210. Now be ye caught, now is ther but we tweyne;
1211. Now yeldeth yow, for other boot is noon.'
1212. To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon,
1213. 'Ne hadde I er now, my swete herte dere,
1214. Ben yolde, y-wis, I were now not here!'

1215. O! Sooth is seyd, that heled for to be
1216. As of a fevre or othere greet syknesse,
1217. Men moste drinke, as men may often see,
1218. Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse,
1219. Men drinken often peyne and greet distresse;
1220. I mene it here, as for this aventure,
1221. That thourgh a peyne hath founden al his cure.

1222. And now swetnesse semeth more sweet,
1223. That bitternesse assayed was biforn;
1224. For out of wo in blisse now they flete;
1225. Non swich they felten, sith they were born;
1226. Now is this bet, than bothe two be lorn!
1227. For love of god, take every womman hede
1228. To werken thus, if it comth to the nede.

1229. Criseyde, al quit from every drede and tene,
1230. As she that iuste cause hadde him to triste,
1231. Made him swich feste, it Ioye was to sene,
1232. Whan she his trouthe and clene entente wiste.
1233. And as aboute a tree, with many a twiste,
1234. Bitrent and wryth the sote wode-binde,
1235. Gan eche of hem in armes other winde.

1236. And as the newe abaysshed nightingale,
1237. That stinteth first whan she biginneth to singe,
1238. Whan that she hereth any herde tale,
1239. Or in the hegges any wight steringe,
1240. And after siker dooth hir voys out-ringe;
1241. Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente,
1242. Opned hir herte and tolde him hir entente.

1243. And right as he that seeth his deeth y-shapen,
1244. And deye moot, in ought that he may gesse,
1245. And sodeynly rescous doth him escapen,
1246. And from his deeth is brought in sikernesse,
1247. For al this world, in swich present gladnesse
1248. Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete;
1249. With worse hap god lat us never mete!

1250. Hir armes smale, hir streyghte bak and softe,
1251. Hir sydes longe, fleshly, smothe, and whyte
1252. He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful ofte
1253. Hir snowish throte, hir brestes rounde and lyte;
1254. Thus in this hevene he gan him to delyte,
1255. And ther-with-al a thousand tyme hir kiste;
1256. That, what to done, for Ioye unnethe he wiste.

1257. Than seyde he thus, 'O, Love, O, Charitee,
1258. Thy moder eek, Citherea the swete,
1259. After thy-self next heried be she,
1260. Venus mene I, the wel-willy planete;
1261. And next that, Imeneus, I thee grete;
1262. For never man was to yow goddes holde
1263. As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde.

1264. 'Benigne Love, thou holy bond of thinges,
1265. Who-so wol grace, and list thee nought honouren,
1266. Lo, his desyr wol flee with-outen winges.
1267. For, noldestow of bountee hem socouren
1268. That serven best and most alwey labouren,
1269. Yet were al lost, that dar I wel seyn, certes,
1270. But-if thy grace passed our desertes.

1271. 'And for thou me, that coude leest deserve
1272. Of hem that nombred been un-to thy grace,
1273. Hast holpen, ther I lykly was to sterve,
1274. And me bistowed in so heygh a place
1275. That thilke boundes may no blisse pace,
1276. I can no more, but laude and reverence
1277. Be to thy bounte and thyn excellence!'

1278. And therwith-al Criseyde anoon he kiste,
1279. Of which, certeyn, she felte no disese,
1280. And thus seyde he, 'Now wolde god I wiste,
1281. Myn herte swete, how I yow mighte plese!
1282. What man,' quod he, 'was ever thus at ese
1283. As I, on whiche the faireste and the beste
1284. That ever I say, deyneth hir herte reste.

1285. 'Here may men seen that mercy passeth right;
1286. The experience of that is felt in me,
1287. That am unworthy to so swete a wight.
1288. But herte myn, of your benignitee,
1289. So thenketh, though that I unworthy be,
1290. Yet mot I nede amenden in som wyse,
1291. Right thourgh the vertu of your heyghe servyse.

1292. 'And for the love of god, my lady dere,
1293. Sin god hath wrought me for I shal yow serve,
1294. As thus I mene, that ye wol be my stere,
1295. To do me live, if that yow liste, or sterve,
1296. So techeth me how that I may deserve
1297. Your thank, so that I, thurgh myn ignoraunce,
1298. Ne do no-thing that yow be displesaunce.

1299. 'For certes, fresshe wommanliche wyf,
1300. This dar I seye, that trouthe and diligence,
1301. That shal ye finden in me al my lyf,
1302. Ne wol not, certeyn, breken your defence;
1303. And if I do, present or in absence,
1304. For love of god, lat slee me with the dede,
1305. If that it lyke un-to your womanhede.'

1306. 'Y-wis,' quod she, 'myn owne hertes list,
1307. My ground of ese, and al myn herte dere,
1308. Graunt mercy, for on that is al my trist;
1309. But late us falle awey fro this matere;
1310. For it suffyseth, this that seyd is here.
1311. And at o word, with-outen repentaunce,
1312. Wel-come, my knight, my pees, my suffisaunce!'

1313. Of hir delyt, or Ioyes oon the leste
1314. Were impossible to my wit to seye;
1315. But iuggeth, ye that han ben at the feste,
1316. Of swich gladnesse, if that hem liste pleye!
1317. I can no more, but thus thise ilke tweye
1318. That night, be-twixen dreed and sikernesse,
1319. Felten in love the grete worthinesse.

1320. O blisful night, of hem so longe y-sought,
1321. How blithe un-to hem bothe two thou were!
1322. Why ne hadde I swich on with my soule y-bought,
1323. Ye, or the leeste Ioye that was there?
1324. A-wey, thou foule daunger and thou fere,
1325. And lat hem in this hevene blisse dwelle,
1326. That is so heygh, that al ne can I telle!

1327. But sooth is, though I can not tellen al,
1328. As can myn auctor, of his excellence,
1329. Yet have I seyd, and, god to-forn, I shal
1330. In every thing al hoolly his sentence.
1331. And if that I, at loves reverence,
1332. Have any word in eched for the beste,
1333. Doth therwith-al right as your-selven leste.

1334. For myne wordes, here and every part,
1335. I speke hem alle under correccioun
1336. Of yow, that feling han in loves art,
1337. And putte it al in your discrecioun
1338. To encrese or maken diminucioun
1339. Of my langage, and that I yow bi-seche;
1340. But now to purpos of my rather speche.

1341. Thise ilke two, that ben in armes laft,
1342. So looth to hem a-sonder goon it were,
1343. That ech from other wende been biraft,
1344. Or elles, lo, this was hir moste fere,
1345. That al this thing but nyce dremes were;
1346. For which ful ofte ech of hem seyde, 'O swete,
1347. Clippe ich yow thus, or elles I it mete?'

1348. And, lord! So he gan goodly on hir see,
1349. That never his look ne bleynte from hir face,
1350. And seyde, 'O dere herte, may it be
1351. That it be sooth, that ye ben in this place?'
1352. 'Ye, herte myn, god thank I of his grace!'
1353. Quod tho Criseyde, and therwith-al him kiste,
1354. That where his spirit was, for Ioye he niste.

1355. This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen two
1356. Gan for to kisse, and seyde, 'O eyen clere,
1357. It were ye that wroughte me swich wo,
1358. Ye humble nettes of my lady dere!
1359. Though ther be mercy writen in your chere,
1360. God wot, the text ful hard is, sooth, to finde,
1361. How coude ye with-outen bond me binde?'

1362. Therwith he gan hir faste in armes take,
1363. And wel an hundred tymes gan he syke,
1364. Nought swiche sorwfull sykes as men make
1365. For wo, or elles whan that folk ben syke,
1366. But esy sykes, swiche as been to lyke,
1367. That shewed his affeccioun with-inne;
1368. Of swiche sykes coude he nought bilinne.

1369. Sone after this they speke of sondry thinges,
1370. As fil to purpos of this aventure,
1371. And pleyinge entrechaungeden hir ringes,
1372. Of which I can nought tellen no scripture;
1373. But wel I woot, a broche, gold and asure,
1374. In whiche a ruby set was lyk an herte,
1375. Criseyde him yaf, and stak it on his sherte.

1376. Lord! trowe ye, a coveitous, a wreccbe,
1377. That blameth love and holt of it despyt,
1378. That, of tho pens that he can mokre and kecche,
1379. Was ever yet y-yeve him swich delyt,
1380. As is in love, in oo poynt, in som plyt?
1381. Nay, doutelees, for also god me save,
1382. So parfit Ioye may no nigard have!

1383. They wol sey 'Yis,' but lord! So that they lye,
1384. Tho bisy wrecches, ful of wo and drede!
1385. They callen love a woodnesse or folye,
1386. But it shal falle hem as I shal yow rede;
1387. They shul forgo the whyte and eke the rede,
1388. And live in wo, ther god yeve hem mischaunce,
1389. And every lover in his trouthe avaunce!

1390. As wolde god, tho wrecches, that dispyse
1391. Servyse of love, hadde eres al-so longe
1392. As hadde Myda, ful of coveityse,
1393. And ther-to dronken hadde as hoot and stronge
1394. As Crassus dide for his affectis wronge,
1395. To techen hem that they ben in the vyce,
1396. And loveres nought, al-though they holde hem nyce!

1397. Thise ilke two, of whom that I yow seye,
1398. Whan that hir hertes wel assured were,
1399. Tho gonne they to speken and to pleye,
1400. And eek rehercen how, and whanne, and where,
1401. They knewe hem first, and every wo and fere
1402. That passed was; but al swich hevinesse,
1403. I thanke it god, was tourned to gladnesse.

1404. And ever-mo, whan that hem fel to speke
1405. Of any thing of swich a tyme agoon,
1406. With kissing al that tale sholde breke,
1407. And fallen in a newe Ioye anoon,
1408. And diden al hir might, sin they were oon,
1409. For to recoveren blisse and been at ese,
1410. And passed wo with Ioye countrepeyse.

1411. Reson wil not that I speke of sleep,
1412. For it accordeth nought to my matere;
1413. God woot, they toke of that ful litel keep,
1414. But lest this night, that was to hem so dere,
1415. Ne sholde in veyn escape in no manere,
1416. It was biset in Ioye and bisinesse
1417. Of al that souneth in-to gentilnesse.

1418. But whan the cok, comune astrologer,
1419. Gan on his brest to bete, and after crowe,
1420. And Lucifer, the dayes messager,
1421. Gan for to ryse, and out hir bemes throwe;
1422. And estward roos, to him that coude it knowe,
1423. Fortuna maior, than anoon Criseyde,
1424. With herte sore, to Troilus thus seyde: --

1425. 'Myn hertes lyf, my trist and my plesaunce,
1426. That I was born, allas! What me is wo,
1427. That day of us mot make desseveraunce!
1428. For tyme it is to ryse, and hennes go,
1429. Or elles I am lost for evermo!
1430. O night, allas! Why niltow over us hove,
1431. As longe as whanne Almena lay by Iove?

1432. 'O blake night, as folk in bokes rede,
1433. That shapen art by god this world to hyde
1434. At certeyn tymes with thy derke wede,
1435. That under that men mighte in reste abyde,
1436. Wel oughte bestes pleyne, and folk thee chyde,
1437. That there-as day with labour wolde us breste,
1438. That thou thus fleest, and deynest us nought reste!

1439. 'Thou dost, allas! To shortly thyn offyce,
1440. Thou rakel night, ther god, makere of kinde,
1441. Thee, for thyn hast and thyn unkinde vyce,
1442. So faste ay to our hemi-spere binde.
1443. That never-more under the ground thou winde!
1444. For now, for thou so hyest out of Troye,
1445. Have I forgon thus hastily my Ioye!'

1446. This Troilus, that with tho wordes felte,
1447. As thoughte him tho, for pietous distresse,
1448. The blody teres from his herte melte,
1449. As he that never yet swich hevinesse
1450. Assayed hadde, out of so greet gladnesse,
1451. Gan therwith-al Criseyde his lady dere
1452. In armes streyne, and seyde in this manere: --

1453. 'O cruel day, accusour of the Ioye
1454. That night and love han stole and faste y-wryen,
1455. A-cursed be thy coming in-to Troye,
1456. For every bore hath oon of thy bright yen!
1457. Envyous day, what list thee so to spyen?
1458. What hastow lost, why sekestow this place,
1459. Ther god thy lyght so quenche, for his grace?

1460. 'Allas! What han thise loveres thee agilt,
1461. Dispitous day? Thyn be the pyne of helle!
1462. For many a lovere hastow shent, and wilt;
1463. Thy pouring in wol no-wher lete hem dwelle.
1464. What proferestow thy light here for to selle?
1465. Go selle it hem that smale seles graven,
1466. We wol thee nought, us nedeth no day haven.'

1467. And eek the sonne Tytan gan he chyde,
1468. And seyde, 'O fool, wel may men thee dispyse,
1469. That hast the Dawing al night by thy syde,
1470. And suffrest hir so sone up fro thee ryse,
1471. For to disesen loveres in this wyse.
1472. What! Holde your bed ther, thou, and eek thy Morwe!
1473. I bidde god, so yeve yow bothe sorwe!'

1474. Therwith ful sore he sighte, and thus he seyde,
1475. 'My lady right, and of my wele or wo
1476. The welle and rote, O goodly myn, Criseyde,
1477. And shal I ryse, allas! And shal I go?
1478. Now fele I that myn herte moot a-two!
1479. For how sholde I my lyf an houre save,
1480. Sin that with yow is al the lyf I have?

1481. 'What shal I doon, for certes, I not how,
1482. Ne whanne, allas! I shal the tyme see,
1483. That in this plyt I may be eft with yow;
1484. And of my lyf, god woot, how that shal be,
1485. Sin that desyr right now so byteth me,
1486. That I am deed anoon, but I retourne.
1487. How sholde I longe, allas! Fro yow soiourne?

1488. 'But nathelees, myn owene lady bright,
1489. Yit were it so that I wiste outrely,
1490. That I, your humble servaunt and your knight,
1491. Were in your herte set so fermely
1492. As ye in myn, the which thing, trewely,
1493. Me lever were than thise worldes tweyne,
1494. Yet sholde I bet enduren al my peyne.'

1495. To that Cryseyde answerde right anoon,
1496. And with a syk she seyde, 'O herte dere,
1497. The game, y-wis, so ferforth now is goon,
1498. That first shal Phebus falle fro his spere,
1499. And every egle been the dowves fere,
1500. And every roche out of his place sterte,
1501. Er Troilus out of Criseydes herte!

1502. 'Ye he so depe in-with myn herte grave,
1503. That, though I wolde it turne out of my thought,
1504. As wisly verray god my soule save,
1505. To dyen in the peyne, I coude nought!
1506. And, for the love of god that us bath wrought,
1507. Lat in your brayn non other fantasye
1508. So crepe, that it cause me to dye!

1509. 'And that ye me wolde han as faste in minde
1510. As I have yow, that wolde I yow bi-seche;
1511. And, if I wiste soothly that to finde,
1512. God mighte not a poynt my Ioyes eche!
1513. But, herte myn, with-oute more speche,
1514. Beth to me trewe, or elles were it routhe;
1515. For I am thyn, by god and by my trouthe!

1516. 'Beth glad for-thy, and live in sikernesse;
1517. Thus seyde I never er this, ne shal to mo;
1518. And if to yow it were a gret gladnesse
1519. To turne ayein, soone after that ye go,
1520. As fayn wolde I as ye, it were so,
1521. As wisly god myn herte bringe at reste!'
1522. And him in armes took, and ofte keste.

1523. Agayns his wil, sin it mot nedes be,
1524. This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde,
1525. And in his armes took his lady free
1526. An hundred tyme, and on his wey him spedde,
1527. And with swich wordes as his herte bledde,
1528. He seyde, 'Farewel, mr dere herte swete,
1529. Ther god us graunte sounde and sone to mete!'

1530. To which no word for sorwe she answerde,
1531. So sore gan his parting hir destreyne;
1532. And Troilus un-to his palays ferde,
1533. As woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne;
1534. So hard him wrong of sharp desyr the peyne
1535. For to ben eft there he was in plesaunce,
1536. That it may never out of his remembraunce.

1537. Retorned to his real palais, sone
1538. He softe in-to his bed gan for to slinke,
1539. To slepe longe, as he was wont to done,
1540. But al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke,
1541. But sleep ne may ther in his herte sinke;
1542. Thenkinge how she, for whom desyr him brende,
1543. A thousand-fold was worth more than he wende.

1544. And in his thought gan up and doun to winde
1545. Hir wordes alle, and every countenaunce,
1546. And fermely impressen in his minde
1547. The leste poynt that to him was plesaunce;
1548. And verrayliche, of thilke remembraunce,
1549. Desyr al newe him brende, and lust to brede
1550. Gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede.

1551. Criseyde also, right in the same wyse,
1552. Of Troilus gan in hir herte shette
1553. His worthinesse, his lust, his dedes wyse,
1554. His gentilesse, and how she with him mette,
1555. Thonkinge love he so wel hir bisette;
1556. Desyring eft to have hir herte dere
1557. In swich a plyt, she dorste make him chere.

1558. Pandare, a-morwe which that comen was
1559. Un-to his nece, and gan hir fayre grete,
1560. Seyde, 'Al this night so reyned it, allas!
1561. That al my drede is that ye, nece swete,
1562. Han litel layser had to slepe and mete;
1563. Al night,' quod he, 'hath reyn so do me wake,
1564. That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.'

1565. And ner he com, and seyde, 'How stont it now
1566. This mery morwe, nece, how can ye fare?'
1567. Criseyde answerde, 'Never the bet for yow,
1568. Fox that ye been, god yeve youre herte care!
1569. God help me so, ye caused al this fare,
1570. Trow I,' quod she, 'for alle your wordes whyte;
1571. O! Who-so seeth yow knoweth yow ful lyte!'

1572. With that she gan hir face for to wrye
1573. With the shete, and wex for shame al reed;
1574. And Pandarus gan under for to prye,
1575. And seyde, 'Nece, if that I shal be deed,
1576. Have here a swerd, and smyteth of myn heed.'
1577. With that his arm al sodeynly he thriste
1578. Under hir nekke, and at the laste hir kiste.

1579. I passe al that which chargeth nought to seye,
1580. What! God foryaf his deeth, and she al-so
1581. Foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye,
1582. For other cause was ther noon than so.
1583. But of this thing right to the effect to go,
1584. Whan tyme was, hom til hir hous she wente,
1585. And Pandarus hath fully his entente.

1586. Now torne we ayein to Troilus,
1587. That resteles ful longe a-bedde lay,
1588. And prevely sente after Pandarus,
1589. To him to come in al the haste he may.
1590. He com anoon, nought ones seyde he 'nay,'
1591. And Troilus ful sobrely he grette,
1592. And doun upon his beddes syde him sette.

1593. This Troilus, with al the affeccioun
1594. Of frendes love that herte may devyse,
1595. To Pandarus on knees fil adoun,
1596. And er that he wolde of the place aryse,
1597. He gan him thonken in his beste wyse;
1598. An hondred sythe he gan the tyme blesse,
1599. That he was born, to bringe him fro distresse.

1600. He seyde, 'O frend of frendes the alderbeste
1601. That ever was, the sothe for to telle,
1602. Thou hast in hevene y-brought my soule at reste
1603. Fro Flegitoun, the fery flood of helle;
1604. That, though I mighte a thousand tymes selle,
1605. Upon a day, my lyf in thy servyse,
1606. It mighte nought a mote in that suffyse.

1607. 'The sonne, which that al the world may see,
1608. Saw never yet, my lyf, that dar I leye,
1609. So inly fayr and goodly as is she,
1610. Whos I am al, and shal, til that I deye;
1611. And, that I thus am hires, dar I seye,
1612. That thanked be the heighe worthinesse
1613. Of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse.

1614. 'Thus hastow me no litel thing y-yive,
1615. Fo which to thee obliged be for ay
1616. My lyf, and why? For thorugh thyn help I live;
1617. For elles deed hadde I be many a day.'
1618. And with that word doun in his bed he lay,
1619. And Pandarus ful sobrely him herde
1620. Til al was seyd, and than he thus answerde:

1621. 'My dere frend, if I have doon for thee
1622. In any cas, god wot, it is me leef;
1623. And am as glad as man may of it be,
1624. God help me so; but tak now a-greef
1625. That I shal seyn, be war of this myscheef,
1626. That, there-as thou now brought art in-to blisse,
1627. That thou thy-self ne cause it nought to misse.

1628. 'For of fortunes sharpe adversitee
1629. The worst kinde of infortune is this,
1630. A man to have ben in prosperitee,
1631. And it remembren, whan it passed is.
1632. Thou art wys y-nough, for-thy do nought amis;
1633. Be not to rakel, though thou sitte warme,
1634. For if thou be, certeyn, it wol thee harme.

1635. 'Thou art at ese, and holde the wel ther-inne.
1636. For also seur as reed is every fyr,
1637. As greet a craft is kepe wel as winne;
1638. Brydle alwey wel thy speche and thy desyr,
1639. For worldly Ioye halt not but by a wyr;
1640. That preveth wel, it brest alday so ofte;
1641. For-thy nede is to werke with it softe.'

1642. Quod Troilus, 'I hope, and god to-forn,
1643. My dere frend, that I shal so me bere,
1644. That in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn,
1645. Ne I nil not rakle as for to greven here;
1646. It nedeth not this matere ofte tere;
1647. For wistestow myn herte wel, Pandare,
1648. God woot, of this thou woldest litel care.'

1649. Tho gan he telle him of his glade night,
1650. And wher-of first his herte dredde, and how,
1651. And seyde, 'Freend, as I am trewe knight,
1652. And by that feyth I shal to god and yow,
1653. I hadde it never half so hote as now;
1654. And ay the more that desyr me byteth
1655. To love hir best, the more it me delyteth.

1656. 'I noot my-self not wisly what it is;
1657. But now I fele a newe qualitee,
1658. Ye, al another than I dide er this.'
1659. Pandare answerde, and seyde thus, that he
1660. That ones may in hevene blisse be,
1661. He feleth other weyes, dar I leye,
1662. Than thilke tyme he first herde of it seye.

1663. This is o word for al: this Troilus
1664. Was never ful to speke of this matere,
1665. And for to preysen un-to Pandarus
1666. The bountee of his righte lady dere,
1667. And Pandarus to thanke and maken chere.
1668. This tale ay was span-newe to biginne,
1669. Til that the night departed hem a-twinne.

1670. Sone after this, for that fortune it wolde,
1671. I-comen was the blisful tyme swete,
1672. That Troilus was warned that he sholde,
1673. Ther he was erst, Criseyde his lady mete;
1674. For which he felte his herte in Ioye flete;
1675. And feythfully gan alle the goddes herie;
1676. And lat see now if that he can be merie.

1677. And holden was the forme and al the wyse,
1678. Of hir cominge, and eek of his also,
1679. As it was erst, which nedeth nought devyse.
1680. But playnly to the effect right for to go,
1681. In Ioye and suerte Pandarus hem two
1682. A-bedde broughte, whan that hem bothe leste,
1683. And thus they ben in quiete and in reste.

1684. Nought nedeth it to yow, sin they ben met,
1685. To aske at me if that they blythe were;
1686. For if it erst was wel, tho was it bet
1687. A thousand-fold, this nedeth not enquere.
1688. A-gon was every sorwe and every fere;
1689. And bothe, y-wis, they hadde, and so they wende,
1690. As muche Ioye as herte may comprende.

1691. This is no litel thing of for to seye,
1692. This passeth every wit for to devyse;
1693. For eche of hem gan otheres lust obeye;
1694. Felicitee, which that thise clerkes wyse
1695. Commenden so, ne may not here suffyse.
1696. This Ioye may not writen been with inke,
1697. This passeth al that herte may bithinke.

1698. But cruel day, so wel-awey the stounde!
1699. Gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe,
1700. For whiche hem thoughte felen dethes wounde;
1701. So wo was hem, that changen gan hir hewe,
1702. And day they goonnen to dispyse al newe,
1703. Calling it traytour, envyous, and worse,
1704. And bitterly the dayes light they curse.

1705. Quod Troilus, 'Allas! Now am I war
1706. That Pirous and tho swifte stedes three,
1707. Whiche that drawen forth the sonnes char,
1708. Han goon som by-path in despyt of me;
1709. That maketh it so sone day to be;
1710. And, for the sonne him hasteth thus to ryse,
1711. Ne shal I never doon him sacrifyse!'

1712. But nedes day departe moste hem sone,
1713. And whanne hir speche doon was and hir chere,
1714. They twinne anoon as they were wont to done,
1715. And setten tyme of meting eft y-fere;
1716. And many a night they wroughte in this manere.
1717. And thus Fortune a tyme ladde in Ioye
1718. Criseyde, and eek this kinges sone of Troye.

1719. In suffisaunce, in blisse, and in singinges,
1720. This Troilus gan al his lyf to lede;
1721. He spendeth, Iusteth, maketh festeynges;
1722. He yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede,
1723. And held aboute him alwey, out of drede,
1724. A world of folk, as cam him wel of kinde,
1725. The fressheste and the beste he coude fynde;

1726. That swich a voys was of hym and a stevene
1727. Thorugh-out the world, of honour and largesse,
1728. That it up rong un-to the yate of hevene.
1729. And, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse,
1730. That in his herte he demede, as I gesse,
1731. That there nis lovere in this world at ese
1732. So wel as he, and thus gan love him plese.

1733. The godlihede or beautee which that kinde
1734. In any other lady hadde y-set
1735. Can not the mountaunce of a knot unbinde,
1736. A-boute his herte, of al Criseydes net.
1737. He was so narwe y-masked and y-knet,
1738. That it undon on any manere syde,
1739. That nil not been, for ought that may betyde.

1740. And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take
1741. This Pandarus, and in-to gardin lede,
1742. And swich a feste and swich a proces make
1743. Him of Criseyde, and of hir womanhede,
1744. And of hir beautee, that, with-outen drede,
1745. It was an hevene his wordes for to here;
1746. And thanne he wolde singe in this manere.

1747. 'Love, that of erthe and see hath governaunce,
1748. Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye,
1749. Love, that with an holsom alliaunce
1750. Halt peples ioyned, as him list hem gye,
1751. Love, that knetteth lawe of companye,
1752. And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle,
1753. Bind this acord, that I have told and telle;

1754. 'That that the world with feyth, which that is stable,
1755. Dyverseth so his stoundes concordinge,
1756. That elements that been so discordable
1757. Holden a bond perpetuely duringe,
1758. That Phebus mote his rosy day forth bringe,
1759. And that the mone hath lordship over the nightes,
1760. Al this doth Love; ay heried be his mightes!

1761. 'That, that the see, that gredy is to flowen,
1762. Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so
1763. His flodes, that so fersly they ne growen
1764. To drenchen erthe and al for ever-mo;
1765. And if that Love ought lete his brydel go,
1766. Al that now loveth a-sonder sholde lepe,
1767. And lost were al, that Love halt now to-hepe.

1768. 'So wolde god, that auctor is of kinde,
1769. That, with his bond, Love of his vertu liste
1770. To cerclen hertes alle, and faste binde,
1771. That from his bond no wight the wey out wiste.
1772. And hertes colde, hem wolde I that he twiste
1773. To make hem love, and that hem leste ay rewe
1774. On hertes sore, and kepe hem that ben trewe.'

1775. In alle nedes, for the tounes werre,
1776. He was, and ay the firste in armes dight;
1777. And certeynly, but-if that bokes erre,
1778. Save Ector, most y-drad of any wight;
1779. And this encrees of hardinesse and might
1780. Cam him of love, his ladies thank to winne,
1781. That altered his spirit so with-inne.

1782. In tyme of trewe, on haukinge wolde he ryde,
1783. Or elles hunten boor, bere, or lyoun;
1784. The smale bestes leet he gon bi-syde.
1785. And whan that he com rydinge in-to toun,
1786. Ful ofte his lady, from hir window doun,
1787. As fresh as faucon comen out of muwe,
1788. Ful redy was, him goodly to saluwe.

1789. And most of love and vertu was his speche,
1790. And in despyt hadde alle wrecchednesse;
1791. And doutelees, no nede was him biseche
1792. To honouren hem that hadde worthinesse,
1793. And esen hem that weren in distresse.
1794. And glad was he if any wight wel ferde,
1795. That lover was, whan he it wiste or herde.

1796. For sooth to seyn, he lost held every wight
1797. But-if he were in loves heigh servyse,
1798. I mene folk that oughte it been of right.
1799. And over al this, so wel coude he devyse
1800. Of sentement, and in so unkouth wyse
1801. Al his array, that every lover thoughte,
1802. That al was wel, what-so he seyde or wroughte.

1803. And though that he be come of blood royal,
1804. Him liste of pryde at no wight for to chase;
1805. Benigne he was to ech in general,
1806. For which he gat him thank in every place.
1807. Thus wolde love, y-heried be his grace,
1808. That Pryde, Envye, Ire, and Avaryce
1809. He gan to flee, and every other vyce.

1810. Thou lady bright, the doughter to Dione,
1811. Thy blinde and winged sone eek, daun Cupyde;
1812. Ye sustren nyne eek, that by Elicone
1813. In hil Parnaso listen for to abyde,
1814. That ye thus fer han deyned me to gyde,
1815. I can no more, but sin that ye wol wende,
1816. Ye heried been for ay, with-outen ende!

1817. Thourgh yow have I seyd fully in my song
1818. Theffect and Ioye of Troilus servyse,
1819. Al be that ther was som disese among,
1820. As to myn auctor listeth to devyse.
1821. My thridde book now ende ich in this wyse;
1822. And Troilus in luste and in quiete
1823. Is with Criseyde, his owne herte swete.
