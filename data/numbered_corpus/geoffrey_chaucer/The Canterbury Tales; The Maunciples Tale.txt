2. PROLOGUE TO THE MAUNCIPLES TALE

3. Heere folweth the Prologe of the Maunciples tale.

4. Woot ye nat where ther stant a litel toun,
5. Which that ycleped is Bobbe-up-and-doun
6. Under the Blee, in Caunterbury weye?
7. Ther gan oure Hooste for to jape and pleye,
8. And seyde, 'Sires, what, Dun is in the Myre!

9. Is ther no man for preyere ne for hyre,
10. That wole awake oure felawe al bihynde?
11. A theef myghte hym ful lightly robbe and bynde.
12. See how he nappeth, see how for Cokkes bones,
13. That he wol falle fro his hors atones.

14. Is that a Cook of London, with meschaunce?
15. Do hym com forth, he knoweth his penaunce,
16. For he shal telle a tale, by my fey,
17. Although it be nat worth a botel hey.
18. Awake, thou Cook,' quod he, 'God yeve thee sorwe,

19. What eyleth thee, to slepe by the morwe?
20. Hastow had fleen al nyght, or artow dronke?
21. Or hastow with som quene al nyght yswonke
22. So that thow mayst nat holden up thyn heed?'
23. This Cook that was ful pale, and no thyng reed,

24. Seyde to oure Hoost, 'So God my soule blesse,
25. As ther is falle on me swich hevynesse,
26. Noot I nat why, that me were levere slepe
27. Than the beste galon wyn in Chepe.'
28. 'Wel,' quod the Maunciple, 'if it may doon ese

29. To thee, Sire Cook, and to no wight displese
30. Which that heere rideth in this compaignye,
31. And that oure Hoost wole of his curteisye,
32. I wol as now excuse thee of thy tale,
33. For, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale.

34. Thyne eyen daswen eek, as that me thynketh,
35. And wel I woot, thy breeth ful soure stynketh.
36. That sheweth wel thou art nat wel disposed,
37. Of me, certeyn, thou shalt nat been yglosed.
38. See how he ganeth, lo, this dronken wight!

39. As though he wolde swolwe us anonright.
40. Hoold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kyn,
41. The devel of helle sette his foot therin.
42. Thy cursed breeth infecte wole us alle,
43. Fy, stynkyng swyn! fy, foule moothe thou falle!

44. A, taketh heede, sires, of this lusty man!
45. Now, sweete sire, wol ye justen atte fan?
46. Therto me thynketh ye been wel yshape,
47. I trowe that ye dronken han wyn-ape,
48. And that is, whan men pleyen with a straw.'

49. And with this speche the Cook wax wrooth and wraw,
50. And on the Manciple he gan nodde faste,
51. For lakke of speche, and doun the hors hym caste,
52. Where as he lay til that men up hym took;
53. This was a fair chyvachee of a Cook!

54. Allas, he nadde holde hym by his ladel!
55. And er that he agayn were in his sadel
56. Ther was greet showvyng bothe to and fro,
57. To lifte hym up, and muchel care and wo,
58. So unweeldy was this sory palled goost.

59. And to the Manciple thanne spak oure hoost,
60. 'By cause drynke hath dominacioun,
61. Upon this man, by my savacioun,
62. I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale.
63. For were it wyn, or oold or moysty ale,

64. That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,
65. And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose.
66. He hath also to do moore than ynough
67. To kepen hym and his capul out of slough,
68. And if he falle from his capul eftsoone,

69. Thanne shal we alle have ynogh to doone
70. In liftyng up his hevy dronken cors.
71. Telle on thy tale, of hym make I no fors;
72. But yet, Manciple, in feith thou art to nyce,
73. Thus openly repreve hym of his vice.

74. Another day he wole peraventure
75. Reclayme thee and brynge thee to lure.
76. I meene he speke wole of smale thynges,
77. As for to pynchen at thy rekenynges,
78. That were nat honeste, if it cam to preef.'

79. 'No,' quod the Manciple, 'that were a greet mescheef,
80. So myghte he lightly brynge me in the snare;
81. Yet hadde I levere payen for the mare,
82. Which that he rit on, than he sholde with me stryve
83. I wol nat wratthen hym, al so moot I thryve;

84. That that I speke, I seyde it in my bourde.
85. And wite ye what, I have heer in a gourde
86. A draghte of wyn, ye, of a ripe grape,
87. And right anon ye shul seen a good jape.
88. This Cook shal drynke therof if that I may,

89. Up peyne of deeth, he wol nat seye me nat.'
90. And certeynly, to tellen as it was,
91. Of this vessel the Cook drank faste; allas,
92. What neded hym? he drank ynough biforn!
93. And whan he hadde pouped in this horn,

94. To the Manciple he took the gourde agayn,
95. And of that drynke the Cook was wonder fayn,
96. And thanked hym in swich wise as he koude.
97. Thanne gan oure Hoost to laughen wonder loude,
98. And seyde, 'I se wel it is necessarie

99. Where that we goon, that drynke we with us carie.
100. For that wol turne rancour and disese
101. Tacord and love and many a wrong apese.
102. O thou Bacus, yblessed be thy name,
103. That so kanst turnen ernest into game!

104. Worship and thank be to thy deitee!
105. Of that mateere ye gete namoore of me,
106. Telle on thy tale, Manciple, I thee preye.'
107. 'Wel, sire,' quod he, 'now herkneth what I seye.'

108. THE MAUNCIPLES TALE

109. Heere bigynneth the Maunciples tale of the Crowe.

110. Whan Phebus dwelled heere in this world adoun,
111. As olde bookes maken mencioun,
112. He was the mooste lusty bachiler
113. In al this world, and eek the beste archer.
114. He slow Phitoun the serpent, as he lay

115. Slepynge agayn the sonne upon a day;
116. And many another noble worthy dede
117. He with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede.
118. Pleyen he koude on every mynstralcie,
119. And syngen, that it was a melodie

120. To heeren of his cleere voys the soun.
121. Certes, the kyng of Thebes, Amphioun,
122. That with his syngyng walled that citee,
123. Koude nevere syngen half so wel as hee.
124. Therto he was the semelieste man,

125. That is or was sith that the world bigan.
126. What nedeth it hise fetures to discryve?
127. For in this world was noon so fair on lyve.
128. He was therwith fulfild of gentillesse,
129. Of honour, and of parfit worthynesse.

130. This Phebus that was flour of bachilrie,
131. As wel in fredom as in chivalrie,
132. For his desport, in signe eek of victorie
133. Of Phitoun, so as telleth us the storie,
134. Was wont to beren in his hand a bowe.

135. Now hadde this Phebus in his hous a crowe,
136. Which in a cage he fostred many a day,
137. And taughte it speken as men teche a jay.
138. Whit was this crowe, as is a snow-whit swan,
139. And countrefete the speche of every man

140. He koude, whan he sholde telle a tale.
141. Therwith in al this world no nyghtngale
142. Ne koude, by an hondred thousand deel,
143. Syngen so wonder myrily and weel.
144. Now hadde this Phebus in his hous a wyf

145. Which that he lovede moore than his lyf;
146. And nyght and day dide evere his diligence
147. Hir for to plese and doon hire reverence.
148. Save oonly, if the sothe that I shal sayn,
149. Jalous he was, and wolde have kept hire fayn,

150. For hym were looth byjaped for to be-
151. And so is every wight in swich degree;
152. But al in ydel, for it availleth noght.
153. A good wyf that is clene of werk and thoght
154. Sholde nat been kept in noon awayt, certayn.

155. And trewely the labour is in vayn
156. To kepe a shrewe, for it wol nat bee.
157. This holde I for a verray nycetee,
158. To spille labour for to kepe wyves,
159. Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves.

160. But now to purpos, as I first bigan:
161. This worthy Phebus dooth al that he kan
162. To plesen hir, wenynge that swich plesaunce,
163. And for his manhede and his governaunce,
164. That no man sholde han put hym from hire grace.

165. But God it woot, ther may no man embrace
166. As to destreyne a thyng, which that nature
167. Hath natureelly set in a creature.
168. Taak any bryd, and put it in a cage,
169. And do al thyn entente and thy corage

170. To fostre it tendrely with mete and drynke,
171. Of alle deyntees that thou kanst bithynke;
172. And keepe it al so clenly as thou may,
173. Al though his cage of gold be nevere so gay,
174. Yet hath this bryd, by twenty thousand foold,

175. Levere in a forest that is rude and coold
176. Goon ete wormes, and swich wrecchednesse;
177. For evere this bryd wol doon his bisynesse
178. To escape out of his cage, whan he may.
179. His libertee this bryd desireth ay.

180. Lat take a cat, and fostre hym wel with milk,
181. And tendre flessh, and make his couche of silk,
182. And lat hym seen a mous go by the wal,
183. Anon he weyveth milk and flessh and al,
184. And every deyntee that is in that hous,

185. Swich appetit he hath to ete a mous.
186. Lo, heere hath lust his dominacioun,
187. And appetit fleemeth discrecioun.
188. A she wolf hath also a vileyns kynde,
189. The lewedeste wolf that she may fynde,

190. Or leest of reputacioun wol she take,
191. In tyme whan hir lust to han a make.
192. Alle thise ensamples speke I by thise men,
193. That been untrewe, and no thyng by wommen,
194. For men han evere a likerous appetit

195. On lower thyng to parfourne hire delit,
196. Than on hire wyves, be they nevere so faire,
197. Ne nevere so trewe, ne so debonaire.
198. Flessh is so newefangel, with meschaunce,
199. That we ne konne in no thyng han plesaunce

200. That sowneth into vertu any while.
201. This Phebus, which that thoghte upon no gile,
202. Deceyved was, for al his jolitee;
203. For under hym another hadde shee,
204. A man of litel reputacioun,

205. Nat worth to Phebus in comparisoun.
206. The moore harm is, it happeth ofte so,
207. Of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo.
208. And so bifel, whan Phebus was absent,
209. His wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent;

210. Hir lemman? certes, this is a knavyssh speche,
211. Foryeveth it me, and that I yow biseche.
212. The wise Plato seith, as ye may rede,
213. 'The word moot nede accorde with the dede.'
214. If men shal telle proprely a thyng,

215. The word moot cosyn be to the werkyng.
216. I am a boystous man, right thus seye I.
217. Ther nys no difference trewely
218. Bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree-
219. If of hire body dishoneste she bee-

220. And a povre wenche, oother than this,
221. If it so be they werke bothe amys,
222. But that the gentile in hire estaat above,
223. She shal be cleped his lady as in love,
224. And for that oother is a povre womman,

225. She shal be cleped his wenche, or his lemman;
226. And God it woot, myn owene deere brother,
227. Men leyn that oon as lowe as lith that oother.
228. Right so bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt
229. And an outlawe, or a theef erraunt,

230. The same I seye, ther is no difference.
231. To Alisaundre was toold this sentence,
232. That for the tiraunt is of gretter myght,
233. By force of meynee for to sleen dounright,
234. And brennen hous and hoom, and make al playn,

235. Lo, therfore is he cleped a capitayn!
236. And for the outlawe hath but smal meynee,
237. And may nat doon so greet an harm as he,
238. Ne brynge a contree to so greet mescheef,
239. Men clepen hym an outlawe or a theef.

240. But for I am a man noght textueel,
241. I wol noght telle of textes nevere a deel;
242. I wol go to my tale as I bigan.
243. Whan Phebus wyf had sente for hir lemman,
244. Anon they wroghten al hir lust volage.

245. The white crowe that heeng ay in the cage
246. Biheeld hire werk, and seyde nevere a word,
247. And whan that hoom was com Phebus the lord,
248. This crowe sang, 'Cokkow! Cokkow! Cokkow!'
249. 'What bryd!' quod Phebus, 'what song syngestow?

250. Ne were thow wont so myrily to synge
251. That to myn herte it was a rejoysynge
252. To heere thy voys? allas, what song is this?'
253. 'By God,' quod he, 'I synge nat amys.
254. Phebus,' quod he, 'for al thy worthynesse,

255. For al thy beautee and thy gentillesse,
256. For al thy song and al thy mynstralcye,
257. For al thy waityng, blered is thyn eye
258. With oon of litel reputacioun
259. Noght worth to thee, as in comparisoun

260. The montance of a gnat, so moote I thryve,
261. For on thy bed thy wyf I saugh hym swyve.'
262. What wol ye moore? the crowe anon hym tolde,
263. By sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde,
264. How that his wyf han doon hire lecherye,

265. Hym to greet shame and to greet vileynye,
266. And tolde hym ofte, he asugh it with hise eyen.
267. This Phebus gan aweyward for to wryen,
268. And thoughte his sorweful herte brast atwo,
269. His bowe he bente and sette ther inne a flo,

270. And in his ire his wyf thanne hath he slayn.
271. This is theffect, ther is namoore to sayn,
272. For sorwe of which he brak his mynstralcie,
273. Bothe harpe, and lute, and gyterne, and sautrie,
274. And eek he brak hise arwes and his bowe,

275. And after that thus spak he to the crowe.
276. 'Traitour,' quod he, 'with tonge of scorpioun,
277. Thou hast me broght to my confusioun,
278. Allas, that I was wroght! why nere I deed?
279. O deere wyf, O gemme of lustiheed,

280. That were to me so sad and eek so trewe,
281. Now listow deed with face pale of hewe,
282. Ful giltelees, that dorste I swere, ywys.
283. O rakel hand, to doon so foule amys!
284. O trouble wit, O ire recchelees!

285. That unavysed smyteth gilteles.
286. O wantrust, ful of fals suspecioun,
287. Where was thy wit and thy discrecioun?
288. O, every man, be war of rakelnesse,
289. Ne trowe no thyng withouten strong witnesse.

290. Smyt nat to soone, er that ye witen why,
291. And beeth avysed wel and sobrely,
292. Er ye doon any execucioun
293. Upon youre ire for suspecioun.
294. Allas, a thousand folk hath rakel ire

295. Fully fordoon, and broght hem in the mire!
296. Allas, for sorwe I wol myselven slee!'
297. And to the crowe, 'O false theef,' seyde he,
298. 'I wol thee quite anon thy false tale;
299. Thou songe whilom lyk a nyghtngale,

300. Now shaltow, false theef, thy song forgon,
301. And eek thy white fetheres everichon.
302. Ne nevere in al thy lyf ne shaltou speke,
303. Thus shal men on a traytour been awreke.
304. Thou and thyn ofspryng evere shul be blake,

305. Ne nevere sweete noyse shul ye make,
306. But evere crie agayn tempest and rayn,
307. In tokenynge that thurgh thee my wyf is slayn.'
308. And to the crowe he stirte, and that anon,
309. And pulled hise white fetheres everychon,

310. And made hym blak, and refte hym al his song,
311. And eek his speche, and out at dore hym slong,
312. Unto the devel-which I hym bitake!-
313. And for this caas been alle Crowes blake.
314. Lordynges, by this ensample I yow preye,

315. Beth war and taketh kepe what I seye:
316. Ne telleth nevere no man in youre lyf
317. How that another man hath dight his wyf;
318. He wol yow haten mortally, certeyn.
319. Daun Salomon, as wise clerkes seyn,

320. Techeth a man to kepen his tonge weel.
321. But as I seyde, I am noght textueel;
322. But nathelees, thus taughte me my dame;
323. 'My sone, thenk on the crowe, on Goddes name.
324. My sone, keepe wel thy tonge and keepe thy freend,

325. A wikked tonge is worse than a feend.
326. My sone, from a feend men may hem blesse.
327. My sone, God of his endelees goodnesse
328. Walled a tonge with teeth and lippes eke,
329. For man sholde hym avyse what he speeke.

330. My sone, ful ofte for to muche speche
331. Hath many a man been spilt, as clerkes teche.
332. But for litel speche, avysely,
333. Is no man shent, to speke generally.
334. My sone, thy tonge sholdestow restreyne

335. At alle tymes, but whan thou doost thy peyne
336. To speke of God in honour and in preyere;
337. The firste vertu sone, if thou wolt leere,
338. Is to restreyne and kepe wel thy tonge.
339. Thus lerne children, whan that they been yonge,

340. My sone, of muchel spekyng yvele avysed,
341. Ther lasse spekyng hadde ynough suffised,
342. Comth muchel harm-thus was me toold and taught.-
343. In muchel speche synne wanteth naught.
344. Wostow wherof a rakel tonge serveth?

345. Right as a swerd forkutteth and forkerveth
346. An arme atwo, my deere sone, right so
347. A tonge kutteth freendshipe al atwo.
348. A jangler is to God abhomynable;
349. Reed Salomon, so wys and honurable,

350. Reed David in hise psalmes, reed Senekke!
351. My sone, spek nat, but with thyn heed thou bekke;
352. Dissimule as thou were deef, it that thou heere
353. A jangler speke of perilous mateere.
354. The Flemyng seith, and lerne it if thee leste,

355. That litel janglyng causeth muchel reste.
356. My sone, if thou no wikked word hast seyd,
357. Thee thar nat drede for to be biwreyd;
358. But he that hath mysseyd, I dar wel sayn,
359. He may by no wey clepe his word agayn.

360. Thyng that is seyd is seyd, and forth it gooth;
361. Though hym repente, or be hym leef or looth,
362. He is his thral to whom that he hath sayd
363. A tale, of which he is now yvele apayd.
364. My sone, be war, and be noon auctour newe


365. Of tidynyges, wheither they been false or trewe,
366. Wherso thou com, amonges hye or lowe,
367. Kepe wel thy tonge, and thenk upon the Crowe.'

368. Heere is ended the Maunciples tale of the Crowe.
