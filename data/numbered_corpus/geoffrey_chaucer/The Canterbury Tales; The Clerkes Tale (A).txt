25. This worthy clerk benignely answerde,
26. 'Hooste,' quod he, 'I am under youre yerde.
27. Ye han of us as now the governance;
28. And therfore wol I do yow obeisance
29. As fer as resoun axeth, hardily.

62. THE CLERKES TALE

63. Heere bigynneth the tale of the Clerk of Oxenford.

64. Ther is, at the west syde of Ytaille,
65. Doun at the roote of Vesulus the colde,
66. A lusty playne, habundant of vitaille,
67. Where many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde
68. That founded were in tyme of fadres olde,
69. And many another delitable sighte,
70. And Saluces this noble contree highte.

71. A markys whilom lord was of that lond,
72. As were hise worthy eldres hym bifore,
73. And obeisant and redy to his hond
74. Were alle hise liges, bothe lasse and moore.
75. Thus in delit he lyveth, and hath doon yoore,
76. Biloved and drad thurgh favour of Fortune,
77. Bothe of hise lordes and of his commune.

78. Therwith he was, to speke as of lynage,
79. The gentilleste yborn of Lumbardye;
80. A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age,
81. And ful of honour and of curteisye,
82. Discreet ynogh his contree for to gye,
83. Save that in somme thynges that he was to blame,
84. And Walter was this yonge lordes name.

85. I blame hym thus, that he considereth noght
86. In tyme comynge what hym myghte bityde,
87. But in his lust present was al his thoght,
88. As for to hauke and hunte on every syde.
89. Wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde;
90. And eek he nolde,-and that was worst of alle-
91. Wedde no wyf, for noght that may bifalle.

92. Oonly that point his peple bar so soore,
93. That flokmeele on a day they to hym wente,
94. And oon of hem, that wisest was of loore,
95. Or elles that the lord best wolde assente,
96. That he sholde telle hym what his peple mente,
97. Or elles koude he shewe wel swich mateere,
98. He to the markys seyde as ye shul heere:

99. 'O noble Markys, youre humanitee
100. Asseureth us, and yeveth us hardinesse,
101. As ofte as tyme is of necessitee
102. That we to yow mowe telle oure hevynesse.
103. Accepteth, lord, now for youre gentillesse
104. That we with pitous herte unto yow pleyne,
105. And lat youre eres nat my voys desdeyne,

106. Al have I noght to doone in this mateere
107. Moore than another man hath in this place;
108. Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so deere,
109. Han alwey shewed me favour and grace,
110. I dar the bettre aske of yow a space
111. Of audience to shewen oure requeste,
112. And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow leste.

113. For certes, lord, so wel us liketh yow
114. And al youre werk, and evere han doon that we
115. Ne koude nat us-self devysen how
116. We myghte lyven in moore felicitee,
117. Save o thyng, lord, if it youre wille be,
118. That for to been a wedded man yow leste,
119. Thanne were youre peple in sovereyn hertes reste.

120. Boweth youre nekke under that blisful yok
121. Of soveraynetee, noght of servyse,
122. Which that men clepeth spousaille or wedlock;
123. And thenketh, lord, among youre thoghtes wyse
124. How that oure dayes passe in sondry wyse,
125. For thogh we slepe, or wake, or rome, or ryde,
126. Ay fleeth the tyme, it nyl no man abyde.

127. And thogh youre grene youthe floure as yit,
128. In crepeth age alwey, as stille as stoon,
129. And deeth manaceth every age, and smyt
130. In ech estaat, for ther escapeth noon;
131. And al so certein as we knowe echoon
132. That we shul deye, as uncerteyn we alle
133. Been of that day, whan deeth shal on us falle.

134. Accepteth thanne of us the trewe entente
135. That nevere yet refuseden thyn heeste;
136. And we wol, lord, if that ye wole assente,
137. Chese yow a wyf in short tyme atte leeste,
138. Born of the gentilleste and of the meeste
139. Of al this land, so that it oghte seme
140. Honour to God, and yow, as we kan deeme.

141. Delivere us out of al this bisy drede,
142. And taak a wyf for hye Goddes sake,
143. For if it so bifelle, as God forbede,
144. That thurgh your deeth your lyne sholde slake,
145. And that a straunge successour sholde take
146. Youre heritage, o wo were us alyve!
147. Wherfore we pray you hastily to wyve.'

148. Hir meeke preyere and hir pitous cheere
149. Made the markys herte han pitee.
150. 'Ye wol,' quod he, 'myn owene peple deere,
151. To that I nevere erst thoughte, streyne me.
152. I me rejoysed of my liberte,
153. That seelde tyme is founde in mariage.
154. Ther I was free, I moot been in servage.

155. But nathelees I se youre trewe entente,
156. And truste upon youre wit, and have doon at;
157. Wherfore of my free wyl I wole assente
158. To wedde me, as soone as evere I may.
159. But ther as ye han profred me this day
160. To chese me a wyf, I yow relesse
161. That choys, and prey yow of that profre cesse.

162. For God it woot, that children ofte been
163. Unlyk hir worthy eldres hem bifore.
164. Bountee comth al of God, nat of the streen,
165. Of which they been engendred and ybore.
166. I truste in Goddes bontee; and therfore
167. My mariage, and myn estaat and reste,
168. I hym bitake, he may doon as hym leste.

169. Lat me allone in chesynge of my wyf,
170. That charge upon my bak I wole endure;
171. But I yow preye, and charge upon youre lyf
172. That what wyf that I take, ye me assure
173. To worshipe hir, whil that hir lyf may dure,
174. In word and werk, bothe heere and everywheere,
175. As she an emperoures doghter weere.

176. And forthermoore, this shal ye swere, that ye
177. Agayn my choys shul neither grucche ne stryve,
178. For sith I shal forgoon my libertee
179. At youre requeste, as evere moot I thryve,
180. Ther as myn herte is set, ther wol I wyve!
181. And but ye wole assente in this manere,
182. I prey yow, speketh namoore of this matere.'

183. With hertely wyl they sworen and assenten
184. To al this thyng, ther seyde no wight nay,
185. Bisekynge hym of grace er that they wenten,
186. That he wolde graunten hem a certein day
187. Of his spousaille, as soone as evere he may,
188. For yet alwey the peple somwhat dredde
189. Lest that this markys no wyf wolde wedde.

190. He graunted hem a day, swich as hym leste,
191. On which he wolde be wedded sikerly,
192. And seyde he dide al this at hir requeste;
193. And they with humble entente, buxomly,
194. Knelynge upon hir knees ful reverently
195. Hym thonken alle, and thus they han an ende
196. Of hir entente, and hoom agayn they wende.

197. And heerupon he to hise officeres
198. Comaundeth for the feste to purveye,
199. And to hise privee knyghtes and squieres
200. Swich charge yaf, as hym liste on hem leye.
201. And they to his comandement obeye,
202. And ech of hem dooth al his diligence
203. To doon unto the feeste reverence:

204. Explicit prima pars.

205. Incipit secunda pars.

206. Noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable
207. Ther as this markys shoop his mariage,
208. Ther stood a throop, of site delitable,

209. In which that povre folk of that village
210. Hadden hir beestes and hir herbergage,
211. And of hir lobour tooke hir sustenance,
212. After that the erthe yaf hem habundance.

213. Amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man
214. Which that was holden povrest of hem alle;
215. (But hye God somtyme senden kan
216. His grace into a litel oxes stalle)
217. Janicula men of that throop hym calle.
218. A doghter hadde he, fair ynogh to sighte,
219. And Grisildis this yonge mayden highte.

220. But for to speke of vertuous beautee,
221. Thanne was she oon the faireste under sonne,
222. For povreliche yfostred up was she,
223. No likerous lust was thurgh hir herte yronne.
224. Wel ofter of the welle than of the tonne
225. She drank, and for she wolde vertu plese
226. She knew wel labour but noon ydel ese.

227. But thogh this mayde tendre were of age,
228. Yet in the brest of hire virginitee
229. Ther was enclosed rype and sad corage;
230. And in greet reverence and charitee
231. Hir olde povre fader fostred shee.
232. A fewe sheepe, spynnynge on feeld she kepte,
233. -She wolde noght been ydel, til she slepte.

234. And whan she homward cam, she wolde brynge
235. Wortes, or othere herbes tymes ofte,
236. The whiche she shredde and seeth for hir lyvynge,
237. And made hir bed ful harde and no thyng softe;
238. And ay she kepte hir fadres lyf on lofte
239. With everich obeisaunce and diligence
240. That child may doon to fadres reverence.

241. Upon Grisilde, this povre creature,
242. Ful ofte sithe this markys caste his eye,
243. As he on huntyng rood paraventure.
244. And whan it fil that he myghte hire espye,
245. He noght with wantowne lookyng of folye
246. Hise eyen caste on hir, but in sad wyse,
247. Upon hir chiere he wolde hym ofte avyse,

248. Commendynge in his herte hir wommanhede
249. And eek hir vertu, passynge any wight
250. Of so yong age, as wel in chiere as dede.
251. For thogh the peple hadde no greet insight
252. In vertu, he considered ful right
253. Hir bountee, and disposed that he wolde
254. Wedde hir oonly, if evere he wedde sholde.

255. The day of weddyng cam, but no wight kan
256. Telle what womman that it sholde be,
257. For which merveille wondred many a man,
258. And seyden, whan that they were in privetee,
259. 'Wol nat oure lord yet leve his vanytee?
260. Wol he nat wedde? allas, allas, the while!
261. Why wole he thus hymself and us bigile?'

262. But nathelees this markys hath doon make
263. Of gemmes set in gold and in asure
264. Brooches and rynges, for Grisildis sake,
265. And of hir clothyng took he the mesure,
266. By a mayde lyk to hir stature,
267. And eek of othere ornementes alle
268. That unto swich a weddyng sholde falle.

269. The time of undren of the same day
270. Approcheth, that this weddyng sholde be;
271. And al the paleys put was in array,
272. Bothe halle and chambres, ech in his degree;
273. Houses of office stuffed with plentee
274. Ther maystow seen, of deyntevous vitaille,
275. That may be founde as fer as last Ytaille.

276. This roial markys, richely arrayed,
277. Lordes and ladyes in his compaignye,
278. The whiche that to the feeste weren yprayed,
279. And of his retenue the bachelrye,
280. With many a soun of sondry melodye
281. Unto the village, of the which I tolde,
282. In this array the righte wey han holde.

283. Grisilde (of this, God woot, ful innocent,
284. That for hir shapen was al this array)
285. To fecchen water at a welle is went,
286. And cometh hoom as soone as ever she may;
287. For wel she hadde herd seyd, that thilke day
288. The markys sholde wedde, and if she myghte,
289. She wolde fayn han seyn som of that sighte.

290. She thoghte, 'I wole with othere maydens stonde,
291. That been my felawes, in oure dore, and se
292. The markysesse, and therfore wol I fonde
293. To doon at hoom as soone as it may be
294. The labour, which that longeth unto me,
295. And thanne I may at leyser hir biholde,
296. If she this wey unto the castel holde.'

297. And as she wolde over hir thresshfold gon
298. The markys cam and gan hire for to calle,
299. And she set doun hir water pot anon
300. Biside the thresshfold in an oxes stalle,
301. And doun up-on hir knes she gan to falle,
302. And with sad contenance kneleth stille,
303. Til she had herd what was the lordes will.

304. This thoghtful markys spak unto this mayde
305. Ful sobrely, and seyde in this manere,
306. 'Where is youre fader, O Grisildis?' he sayde,
307. And she with reverence in humble cheere
308. Answerde, 'Lord, he is al redy heere.'
309. And in she gooth, withouten lenger lette,
310. And to the markys she hir fader fette.

311. He by the hand thanne took this olde man,
312. And seyde thus, whan he hym hadde asyde,
313. 'Janicula, I neither may ne kan
314. Lenger the plesance of myn herte hyde;
315. If that thou vouchsauf, what so bityde,
316. Thy doghter wol I take, er that I wende,
317. As for my wyf unto hir lyves ende.

318. Thou lovest me, I woot it wel certeyn,
319. And art my feithful lige man ybore,
320. And all that liketh me, I dar wel seyn,
321. It liketh thee; and specially therfore
322. Tel me that poynt that I have seyd bifore,
323. If that thou wolt unto that purpos drawe,
324. To take me as for thy sone-in-lawe.'

325. This sodeyn cas this man astonyed so,
326. That reed he wax abayst and al quakyng
327. He stood, unnethes seyde he wordes mo,
328. But oonly thus, 'Lord,' quod he, 'my willynge
329. Is as ye wole, ne ayeyns youre likynge
330. I wol no thyng, ye be my lord so deere;
331. Right as yow lust governeth this mateere.'

332. 'Yet wol I,' quod this markys softely,
333. 'That in thy chambre I and thou and she
334. Have a collacioun, and wostow why?
335. For I wol axe, if it hir wille be
336. To be my wyf, and reule hir after me;
337. And al this shal be doon in thy presence,
338. I wol noght speke out of thyn audience.'

339. And in the chambre whil they were aboute
340. Hir tretys which as ye shal after heere,
341. The peple cam unto the hous withoute,
342. And wondred hem in how honeste manere
343. And tentifly she kepte hir fader deere.
344. But outrely Grisildis wondre myghte
345. For nevere erst ne saugh she swich a sighte.

346. No wonder is thogh that she were astoned
347. To seen so greet a grest come in that place;
348. She nevere was to swiche gestes woned,
349. For which she looked with ful pale face-
350. But shortly forth this tale for to chace,
351. Thise arn the wordes that the markys sayde
352. To this benigne verray feithful mayde.

353. 'Grisilde,' he seyde, 'ye shal wel understonde
354. It liketh to youre fader and to me
355. That I yow wedde, and eek it may so stonde,
356. As, I suppose, ye wol that it so be.
357. But thise demandes axe I first,' quod he,
358. 'That sith it shal be doon in hastif wyse,
359. Wol ye assente, or elles yow avyse?

360. I seye this, be ye redy with good herte
361. To al my lust, and that I frely may,
362. As me best thynketh, do yow laughe or smerte,
363. And nevere ye to grucche it nyght ne day,
364. And eek whan I sey ye, ne sey nat nay,
365. Neither by word, ne frownyng contenance?
366. Swere this, and heere I swere yow alliance.'

367. Wondrynge upon this word, quakynge for drede,
368. She seyde, 'Lord, undigne and unworthy
369. Am I to thilke honour, that ye me beede,
370. But as ye wole yourself, right so wol I.
371. And heere I swere, that nevere willyngly
372. In werk ne thoght I nyl yow disobeye,
373. For to be deed, though me were looth to deye.'

374. 'This is ynogh, Grisilde myn,' quod he,
375. And forth he gooth with a ful sobre cheere
376. Out at the dore, and after that cam she;
377. And to the peple he seyde in this manere,
378. 'This is my wyf,' quod he, 'that standeth heere;
379. Honoureth hir, and loveth hir, I preye,
380. Whoso me loveth; ther is namoore to seye.'

381. And for that nothyng of hir olde geere
382. She sholde brynge into his hous, he bad
383. That wommen sholde dispoillen hir right theere;-
384. Of which thise ladyes were nat right glad
385. To handle hir clothes, wherinne she was clad-
386. But nathelees, this mayde bright of hewe
387. Fro foot to heed they clothed han al newe.

388. Hir heris han they kembd, that lay untressed
389. Ful rudely, and with hir fyngres smale
390. A corone on hir heed they han ydressed,
391. And sette hir ful of nowches grete and smale.
392. Of hir array what sholde I make a tale?
393. Unnethe the peple hire knew for hir fairnesse
394. Whan she translated was in swich richesse.

395. This markys hath hir spoused with a ryng
396. Broght for the same cause, and thanne hir sette
397. Upon an hors, snow-whit and wel amblyng,
398. And to his paleys, er he lenger lette,
399. With joyful peple that hir ladde and mette
400. Convoyed hir; and thus the day they spende
401. In revel, til the sonne gan descende.

402. And shortly forth this tale for to chace,
403. I seye, that to this newe markysesse
404. God hath swich favour sent hir of his grace,
405. That it ne semed nat by liklynesse
406. That she was born and fed in rudenesse
407. As in a cote or in an oxe-stalle,
408. But norissed in an emperoures halle.

409. To every wight she woxen is so deere
410. And worshipful, that folk ther she was bore
411. And from hir birthe knewe hir yeer by yeere,
412. Unnethe trowed they, but dorste han swore
413. That she to Janicle, of which I spak bifore,
414. She doghter nere, for as by conjecture,
415. Hem thoughte she was another creature.

416. For though that evere vertuous was she,
417. She was encressed in swich excellence,
418. Of thewes goode, yset in heigh bountee,
419. And so discreet and fair of eloquence,
420. So benigne, and so digne of reverence,
421. And koude so the peples herte embrace,
422. That ech hir lovede, that looked on hir face.

423. Noght oonly of Saluces in the toun
424. Publiced was the bountee of hir name,
425. But eek biside in many a regioun,
426. If oon seide wel, another seyde the same;
427. So spradde of hir heighe bountee the fame
428. That men and wommen, as wel yonge as olde,
429. Goon to Saluce upon hir to biholde.

430. Thus Walter lowely, nay! but roially
431. Wedded with fortunat honestetee,
432. In Goddes pees lyveth ful esily
433. At hoom, and outward grace ynogh had he,
434. And for he saugh that under low degree
435. Was ofte vertu hid, the peple hym heelde
436. A prudent man, and that is seyn ful seelde.

437. Nat oonly this Grisildis thurgh hir wit
438. Koude al the feet of wyfly humblenesse,
439. But eek, whan that the cas required it,
440. The commune profit koude she redresse.
441. Ther nas discord, rancour, ne hevynesse
442. In al that land, that she ne koude apese,
443. And wisely brynge hem alle in reste and ese.

444. Though that hir housbonde absent were anon
445. If gentil men, or othere of hir contree
446. Were wrothe, she wolde bryngen hem aton.
447. So wise and rype wordes hadde she,
448. And juggementz of so greet equitee,
449. That she from hevene sent was, as men wende,
450. Peple to save and every wrong tamende.

451. Nat longe tyme after that this Grisild
452. Was wedded, she a doghter hath ybore-
453. Al had hir levere have born a man child;
454. Glad was this markys and the folk therfore,
455. For though a mayde child coome al bifore,
456. She may unto a knave child atteyne
457. By liklihede, syn she nys nat bareyne.


458. Explicit secunda pars.

459. Incipit tercia pars.

460. Ther fil, as it bifalleth tymes mo,
461. Whan that this child had souked but a throwe,
462. This markys in his herte longeth so
463. To tempte his wyf, hir sadnesse for to knowe,
464. That he ne myghte out of his herte throwe
465. This merveillous desir his wyf tassaye.
466. Nedelees, God woot, he thoghte hir for taffraye.

467. He hadde assayed hir ynogh bifore,
468. And foond hir evere good; what neded it
469. Hir for to tempte and alwey moore and moore?
470. Though som men preise it for a subtil wit,
471. But as for me, I seye that yvele it sit
472. To assaye a wyf, whan that it is no nede,
473. And putten hir in angwyssh and in drede.

474. For which this markys wroghte in this manere;
475. He cam allone a nyght, ther as she lay,
476. With stierne face and with ful trouble cheere,
477. And seyde thus, 'Grisilde,' quod he, 'that day
478. That I yow took out of your povere array,
479. And putte yow in estaat of heigh noblesse,
480. Ye have nat that forgeten, as I gesse.

481. I seye, Grisilde, this present dignitee
482. In which that I have put yow, as I trowe
483. Maketh yow nat foryetful for to be
484. That I yow took in povre estaat ful lowe
485. For any wele ye moot youreselven knowe.
486. Taak heede of every word that y yow seye,
487. Ther is no wight that hereth it but we tweye.

488. Ye woot yourself wel how that ye cam heere
489. Into this hous, it is nat longe ago.
490. And though to me that ye be lief and deere,
491. Unto my gentils ye be no thyng so.
492. They seyn, to hem it is greet shame and wo
493. For to be subgetz, and to been in servage,
494. To thee that born art of a smal village.

495. And namely, sith thy doghter was ybore,
496. Thise wordes han they spoken, doutelees;
497. But I desire, as I have doon bifore,
498. To lyve my lyf with hem in reste and pees.
499. I may nat in this caas be recchelees,
500. I moot doon with thy doghter for the beste,
501. Nat as I wolde, but as my peple leste.

502. And yet God woot, this is ful looth to me!
503. But nathelees, withoute youre wityng
504. I wol nat doon, but this wol I,' quod he,
505. 'That ye to me assente as in this thyng.
506. Shewe now youre pacience in youre werkyng,
507. That ye me highte and swore in youre village,
508. That day that maked was oure mariage.'

509. Whan she had herd al this, she noght ameved
510. Neither in word, or chiere, or countenaunce;
511. For as it semed she was nat agreved.
512. She seyde, 'Lord, al lyth in youre plesaunce,
513. My child, and I, with hertely obeisaunce
514. Been youres al, and ye mowe save and spille
515. Your owene thyng, werketh after youre wille.

516. Ther may no thyng, God so my soule save,
517. Liken to yow, that may displese me,
518. Ne I ne desire no thyng for to have,
519. Ne drede for to leese save oonly yee;
520. This wyl is in myn herte, and ay shal be;
521. No lengthe of tyme or deeth may this deface,
522. Ne chaunge my corage to another place.'

523. Glad was this markys of hir answeryng,
524. But yet he feyned as he were nat so.
525. Al drery was his cheere and his lookyng,
526. Whan that he sholde out of the chambre go.
527. Soone after this, a furlong wey or two,
528. He prively hath toold al his entente
529. Unto a man, and to his wyf hym sente.

530. A maner sergeant was this privee man,
531. The which that feithful ofte he founden hadde
532. In thynges grete, and eek swich folk wel kan
533. Doon execucioun on thynges badde.
534. The lord knew wel that he hym loved and dradde;-
535. And whan this sergeant wiste the lordes wille,
536. Into the chambre he stalked hym ful stille.

537. 'Madame,' he seyde, 'ye moote foryeve it me
538. Though I do thyng to which I am constreyned,
539. Ye been so wys, that ful wel knowe ye
540. That lordes heestes mowe nat been yfeyned,
541. They mowe wel been biwailled and compleyned,
542. But men moote nede unto hir lust obeye;
543. And so wol I, ther is namoore to seye.

544. This child I am comanded for to take.'
545. And spak namoore, but out the child he hente
546. Despitously, and gan a cheere make
547. As though he wolde han slayn it er he wente.
548. Grisildis moot al suffren and consente,
549. And as a lamb she sitteth meke and stille,
550. And leet this crueel sergeant doon his wille.

551. Suspecious was the diffame of this man,
552. Suspect his face, suspect his word also,
553. Suspect the tyme in which he this bigan.
554. Allas, hir doghter that she loved so!
555. She wende he wolde han slawen it right tho;
556. But nathelees she neither weep ne syked,
557. Consentynge hir to that the markys lyked.

558. But atte laste speken she bigan,
559. And mekely she to the sergeant preyde,
560. So as he was a worthy gentil man,
561. That she moste kisse hire child, er that it deyde,
562. And in hir barm this litel child she leyde,
563. With ful sad face, and gan the child to kisse,
564. And lulled it, and after gan it blisse.

565. And thus she seyde in hir benigne voys,
566. 'Fareweel, my child, I shal thee nevere see,
567. But sith I thee have marked with the croys
568. Of thilke fader blessed moote thou be,
569. That for us deyde upon a croys of tree.
570. Thy soule, litel child, I hym bitake,
571. For this nyght shaltow dyen for my sake.'

572. I trowe, that to a norice in this cas
573. It had been hard this reuthe for to se;
574. Wel myghte a mooder thanne han cryd `allas!'
575. But nathelees so sad and stidefast was she,
576. That she endured al adversitee,
577. And to the sergeant mekely she sayde,
578. 'Have heer agayn your litel yonge mayde.'

579. 'Gooth now,' quod she, 'and dooth my lordes heeste;
580. But o thyng wol I prey yow of youre grace,
581. That, but my lord forbad yow atte leeste,
582. Burieth this litel body in son place
583. That beestes ne no briddes it torace.'
584. But he no word wol to that purpos seye,
585. But took the child, and wente upon his weye.

586. This sergeant cam unto his lord ageyn,
587. And of Grisildis wordes and hir cheere
588. He tolde hym point for point, in short and pleyn,
589. And hym presenteth with his doghter deere.
590. Somwhat this lord hath routhe in his manere,
591. But nathelees his purpos heeld he stille,
592. As lordes doon whan they wol han hir wille;

593. And bad his sergeant, that he pryvely
594. Sholde this child ful softe wynde and wrappe,
595. With alle circumstances tendrely,
596. And carie it in a cofre or in a lappe,
597. But upon peyne his heed of for to swappe
598. That no man sholde knowe of his entente,
599. Ne whenne he cam, ne whider that he wente.

600. But at Boloigne to his suster deere,
601. That thilke tyme of Panik was Countesse,
602. He sholde it take, and shewe hir this mateere,
603. Bisekynge hir to doon hir bisynesse
604. This child to fostre in alle gentillesse,
605. And whos child that it was, he bad hire hyde
606. From every wight, for oght that may bityde.

607. The sergeant gooth, and hath fulfild this thyng,
608. But to this markys now retourne we,
609. For now gooth he ful faste ymaginyng,
610. If by his wyves cheere he myghte se
611. Or by hir word aperceyve that she
612. Were chaunged, but he nevere hir koude fynde,
613. But evere in oon ylike sad and kynde.

614. As glad, as humble, as bisy in servyse,
615. And eek in love, as she was wont to be,
616. Was she to hym in every maner wyse,
617. Ne of hir doghter noght a word spak she.
618. Noon accident for noon adversitee
619. Was seyn in hir, ne nevere hir doghter name
620. Ne nempned she, in ernest nor in game.
