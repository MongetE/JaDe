1. THE Cook of London, while the Reeve thus spake,
2. For joy he laugh'd and clapp'd him on the back:
3. 'Aha!' quoth he, 'for Christes passion,
4. This Miller had a sharp conclusion,
5. Upon this argument of herbergage.* *lodging
6. Well saide Solomon in his language,
7. Bring thou not every man into thine house,
8. For harbouring by night is perilous.
9. *Well ought a man avised for to be* *a man should take good heed*
10. Whom that he brought into his privity.
11. I pray to God to give me sorrow and care
12. If ever, since I highte* Hodge of Ware, *was called
13. Heard I a miller better *set a-work*; *handled
14. He had a jape* of malice in the derk. *trick
15. But God forbid that we should stinte* here, *stop
16. And therefore if ye will vouchsafe to hear
17. A tale of me, that am a poore man,
18. I will you tell as well as e'er I can
19. A little jape that fell in our city.'

20. Our Host answer'd and said; 'I grant it thee.
21. Roger, tell on; and look that it be good,
22. For many a pasty hast thou letten blood,
23. And many a Jack of Dover hast thou sold,
24. That had been twice hot and twice cold.
25. Of many a pilgrim hast thou Christe's curse,
26. For of thy parsley yet fare they the worse.
27. That they have eaten in thy stubble goose:
28. For in thy shop doth many a fly go loose.
29. Now tell on, gentle Roger, by thy name,
30. But yet I pray thee be not *wroth for game*; *angry with my jesting*
31. A man may say full sooth in game and play.'
32. 'Thou sayst full sooth,' quoth Roger, 'by my fay;
33. But sooth play quad play, as the Fleming saith,
34. And therefore, Harry Bailly, by thy faith,
35. Be thou not wroth, else we departe* here, *part company
36. Though that my tale be of an hostelere.* *innkeeper
37. But natheless, I will not tell it yet,
38. But ere we part, y-wis* thou shalt be quit.' *assuredly
39. And therewithal he laugh'd and made cheer,
40. And told his tale, as ye shall after hear.

41. THE TALE.


42. A prentice whilom dwelt in our city,
43. And of a craft of victuallers was he:
44. Galliard* he was, as goldfinch in the shaw**, *lively **grove
45. Brown as a berry, a proper short fellaw:
46. With lockes black, combed full fetisly.* *daintily
47. And dance he could so well and jollily,
48. That he was called Perkin Revellour.
49. He was as full of love and paramour,
50. As is the honeycomb of honey sweet;
51. Well was the wenche that with him might meet.
52. At every bridal would he sing and hop;
53. He better lov'd the tavern than the shop.
54. For when there any riding was in Cheap,
55. Out of the shoppe thither would he leap,
56. And, till that he had all the sight y-seen,
57. And danced well, he would not come again;
58. And gather'd him a meinie* of his sort, *company of fellows
59. To hop and sing, and make such disport:
60. And there they *sette steven* for to meet *made appointment*
61. To playen at the dice in such a street.
62. For in the towne was there no prentice
63. That fairer coulde cast a pair of dice
64. Than Perkin could; and thereto *he was free *he spent money liberally
65. Of his dispence, in place of privity.* where he would not be seen*
66. That found his master well in his chaffare,* *merchandise
67. For oftentime he found his box full bare.
68. For, soothely, a prentice revellour,
69. That haunteth dice, riot, and paramour,
70. His master shall it in his shop abie*, *suffer for
71. All* have he no part of the minstrelsy. *although
72. For theft and riot they be convertible,
73. All can they play on *gitern or ribible.* *guitar or rebeck*
74. Revel and truth, as in a low degree,
75. They be full wroth* all day, as men may see. *at variance

76. This jolly prentice with his master bode,
77. Till he was nigh out of his prenticehood,
78. All were he snubbed* both early and late, *rebuked
79. And sometimes led with revel to Newgate.
80. But at the last his master him bethought,
81. Upon a day when he his paper sought,
82. Of a proverb, that saith this same word;
83. Better is rotten apple out of hoard,
84. Than that it should rot all the remenant:
85. So fares it by a riotous servant;
86. It is well lesse harm to let him pace*, *pass, go
87. Than he shend* all the servants in the place. *corrupt
88. Therefore his master gave him a quittance,
89. And bade him go, with sorrow and mischance.
90. And thus this jolly prentice had his leve*: *desire
91. Now let him riot all the night, or leave*. *refrain
92. And, for there is no thief without a louke,
93. That helpeth him to wasten and to souk* *spend
94. Of that he bribe* can, or borrow may, *steal
95. Anon he sent his bed and his array
96. Unto a compere* of his owen sort, *comrade
97. That loved dice, and riot, and disport;
98. And had a wife, that held *for countenance* *for appearances*
99. A shop, and swived* for her sustenance. *prostituted herself
