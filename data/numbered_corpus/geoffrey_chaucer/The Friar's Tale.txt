1. This worthy limitour, this noble Frere,
2. He made always a manner louring cheer* *countenance
3. Upon the Sompnour; but for honesty* *courtesy
4. No villain word as yet to him spake he:
5. But at the last he said unto the Wife:
6. 'Dame,' quoth he, 'God give you right good life,
7. Ye have here touched, all so may I the,* *thrive
8. In school matter a greate difficulty.
9. Ye have said muche thing right well, I say;
10. But, Dame, here as we ride by the way,
11. Us needeth not but for to speak of game,
12. And leave authorities, in Godde's name,
13. To preaching, and to school eke of clergy.
14. But if it like unto this company,
15. I will you of a Sompnour tell a game;
16. Pardie, ye may well knowe by the name,
17. That of a Sompnour may no good be said;
18. I pray that none of you be *evil paid;* *dissatisfied*
19. A Sompnour is a runner up and down
20. With mandements* for fornicatioun, *mandates, summonses*
21. And is y-beat at every towne's end.'
22. Then spake our Host; 'Ah, sir, ye should be hend* *civil, gentle
23. And courteous, as a man of your estate;
24. In company we will have no debate:
25. Tell us your tale, and let the Sompnour be.'
26. 'Nay,' quoth the Sompnour, 'let him say by me
27. What so him list; when it comes to my lot,
28. By God, I shall him quiten* every groat! *pay him off
29. I shall him telle what a great honour
30. It is to be a flattering limitour
31. And his office I shall him tell y-wis'.
32. Our Host answered, 'Peace, no more of this.'
33. And afterward he said unto the frere,
34. 'Tell forth your tale, mine owen master dear.'


35. THE TALE.


36. Whilom* there was dwelling in my country *once on a time
37. An archdeacon, a man of high degree,
38. That boldely did execution,
39. In punishing of fornication,
40. Of witchecraft, and eke of bawdery,
41. Of defamation, and adultery,
42. Of churche-reeves,* and of testaments, *churchwardens
43. Of contracts, and of lack of sacraments,
44. And eke of many another manner* crime, *sort of
45. Which needeth not rehearsen at this time,
46. Of usury, and simony also;
47. But, certes, lechours did he greatest woe;
48. They shoulde singen, if that they were hent;* *caught
49. And smale tithers were foul y-shent,* *troubled, put to shame
50. If any person would on them complain;
51. There might astert them no pecunial pain.
52. For smalle tithes, and small offering,
53. He made the people piteously to sing;
54. For ere the bishop caught them with his crook,
55. They weren in the archedeacon's book;
56. Then had he, through his jurisdiction,
57. Power to do on them correction.

58. He had a Sompnour ready to his hand,
59. A slier boy was none in Engleland;
60. For subtlely he had his espiaille,* *espionage
61. That taught him well where it might aught avail.
62. He coulde spare of lechours one or two,
63. To teache him to four and twenty mo'.
64. For, - though this Sompnour wood* be as a hare, - *furious, mad
65. To tell his harlotry I will not spare,
66. For we be out of their correction,
67. They have of us no jurisdiction,
68. Ne never shall have, term of all their lives.

69. 'Peter; so be the women of the stives,'* *stews
70. Quoth this Sompnour, 'y-put out of our cure.'* *care

71. 'Peace, with mischance and with misaventure,'
72. Our Hoste said, 'and let him tell his tale.
73. Now telle forth, and let the Sompnour gale,* *whistle; bawl
74. Nor spare not, mine owen master dear.'

75. This false thief, the Sompnour (quoth the Frere),
76. Had always bawdes ready to his hand,
77. As any hawk to lure in Engleland,
78. That told him all the secrets that they knew, -
79. For their acquaintance was not come of new;
80. They were his approvers* privily. *informers
81. He took himself at great profit thereby:
82. His master knew not always what he wan.* *won
83. Withoute mandement, a lewed* man *ignorant
84. He could summon, on pain of Christe's curse,
85. And they were inly glad to fill his purse,
86. And make him greate feastes at the nale.* *alehouse
87. And right as Judas hadde purses smale,* *small
88. And was a thief, right such a thief was he,
89. His master had but half *his duety.* *what was owing him*
90. He was (if I shall give him his laud)
91. A thief, and eke a Sompnour, and a bawd.
92. And he had wenches at his retinue,
93. That whether that Sir Robert or Sir Hugh,
94. Or Jack, or Ralph, or whoso that it were
95. That lay by them, they told it in his ear.
96. Thus were the wench and he of one assent;
97. And he would fetch a feigned mandement,
98. And to the chapter summon them both two,
99. And pill* the man, and let the wenche go. *plunder, pluck
100. Then would he say, 'Friend, I shall for thy sake
101. Do strike thee out of oure letters blake;* *black
102. Thee thar* no more as in this case travail; *need
103. I am thy friend where I may thee avail.'
104. Certain he knew of bribers many mo'
105. Than possible is to tell in yeare's two:
106. For in this world is no dog for the bow,
107. That can a hurt deer from a whole know,
108. Bet* than this Sompnour knew a sly lechour, *better
109. Or an adult'rer, or a paramour:
110. And, for that was the fruit of all his rent,
111. Therefore on it he set all his intent.

112. And so befell, that once upon a day.
113. This Sompnour, waiting ever on his prey,
114. Rode forth to summon a widow, an old ribibe,
115. Feigning a cause, for he would have a bribe.
116. And happen'd that he saw before him ride
117. A gay yeoman under a forest side:
118. A bow he bare, and arrows bright and keen,
119. He had upon a courtepy* of green, *short doublet
120. A hat upon his head with fringes blake.* *black
121. 'Sir,' quoth this Sompnour, 'hail, and well o'ertake.'
122. 'Welcome,' quoth he, 'and every good fellaw;
123. Whither ridest thou under this green shaw?'* shade
124. Saide this yeoman; 'wilt thou far to-day?'
125. This Sompnour answer'd him, and saide, 'Nay.
126. Here faste by,' quoth he, 'is mine intent
127. To ride, for to raisen up a rent,
128. That longeth to my lorde's duety.'
129. 'Ah! art thou then a bailiff?' 'Yea,' quoth he.
130. He durste not for very filth and shame
131. Say that he was a Sompnour, for the name.
132. 'De par dieux,'  quoth this yeoman, 'leve* brother, *dear
133. Thou art a bailiff, and I am another.
134. I am unknowen, as in this country.
135. Of thine acquaintance I will praye thee,
136. And eke of brotherhood, if that thee list.* *please
137. I have gold and silver lying in my chest;
138. If that thee hap to come into our shire,
139. All shall be thine, right as thou wilt desire.'
140. 'Grand mercy,'* quoth this Sompnour, 'by my faith.' *great thanks
141. Each in the other's hand his trothe lay'th,
142. For to be sworne brethren till they dey.* *die
143. In dalliance they ride forth and play.

144. This Sompnour, which that was as full of jangles,* *chattering
145. As full of venom be those wariangles,* * butcher-birds 
146. And ev'r inquiring upon every thing,
147. 'Brother,' quoth he, 'where is now your dwelling,
148. Another day if that I should you seech?'* *seek, visit
149. This yeoman him answered in soft speech;
150. Brother,' quoth he, 'far in the North country,
151. Where as I hope some time I shall thee see
152. Ere we depart I shall thee so well wiss,* *inform
153. That of mine house shalt thou never miss.'
154. Now, brother,' quoth this Sompnour, 'I you pray,
155. Teach me, while that we ride by the way,
156. (Since that ye be a bailiff as am I,)
157. Some subtilty, and tell me faithfully
158. For mine office how that I most may win.
159. And *spare not* for conscience or for sin, *conceal nothing*
160. But, as my brother, tell me how do ye.'
161. Now by my trothe, brother mine,' said he,
162. As I shall tell to thee a faithful tale:
163. My wages be full strait and eke full smale;
164. My lord is hard to me and dangerous,* *niggardly
165. And mine office is full laborious;
166. And therefore by extortion I live,
167. Forsooth I take all that men will me give.
168. Algate* by sleighte, or by violence, *whether
169. From year to year I win all my dispence;
170. I can no better tell thee faithfully.'
171. Now certes,' quoth this Sompnour, 'so fare* I; *do
172. I spare not to take, God it wot,
173. *But if* it be too heavy or too hot. *unless*
174. What I may get in counsel privily,
175. No manner conscience of that have I.
176. N'ere* mine extortion, I might not live, *were it not for
177. For of such japes* will I not be shrive.** *tricks **confessed
178. Stomach nor conscience know I none;
179. I shrew* these shrifte-fathers** every one. *curse **confessors
180. Well be we met, by God and by St Jame.
181. But, leve brother, tell me then thy name,'
182. Quoth this Sompnour. Right in this meane while
183. This yeoman gan a little for to smile.

184. 'Brother,' quoth he, 'wilt thou that I thee tell?
185. I am a fiend, my dwelling is in hell,
186. And here I ride about my purchasing,
187. To know where men will give me any thing.
188. *My purchase is th' effect of all my rent* *what I can gain is my
189. Look how thou ridest for the same intent sole revenue*
190. To winne good, thou reckest never how,
191. Right so fare I, for ride will I now
192. Into the worlde's ende for a prey.'

193. 'Ah,' quoth this Sompnour, 'benedicite! what say y'?
194. I weened ye were a yeoman truly. *thought
195. Ye have a manne's shape as well as I
196. Have ye then a figure determinate
197. In helle, where ye be in your estate?'* *at home
198. 'Nay, certainly,' quoth he, there have we none,
199. But when us liketh we can take us one,
200. Or elles make you seem* that we be shape *believe
201. Sometime like a man, or like an ape;
202. Or like an angel can I ride or go;
203. It is no wondrous thing though it be so,
204. A lousy juggler can deceive thee.
205. And pardie, yet can I more craft* than he.' *skill, cunning
206. 'Why,' quoth the Sompnour, 'ride ye then or gon
207. In sundry shapes and not always in one?'
208. 'For we,' quoth he, 'will us in such form make.
209. As most is able our prey for to take.'
210. 'What maketh you to have all this labour?'
211. 'Full many a cause, leve Sir Sompnour,'
212. Saide this fiend. 'But all thing hath a time;
213. The day is short and it is passed prime,
214. And yet have I won nothing in this day;
215. I will intend* to winning, if I may, *apply myself
216. And not intend our thinges to declare:
217. For, brother mine, thy wit is all too bare
218. To understand, although I told them thee.
219. *But for* thou askest why laboure we: *because*
220. For sometimes we be Godde's instruments
221. And meanes to do his commandements,
222. When that him list, upon his creatures,
223. In divers acts and in divers figures:
224. Withoute him we have no might certain,
225. If that him list to stande thereagain.* *against it
226. And sometimes, at our prayer have we leave
227. Only the body, not the soul, to grieve:
228. Witness on Job, whom that we did full woe,
229. And sometimes have we might on both the two, -
230. This is to say, on soul and body eke,
231. And sometimes be we suffer'd for to seek
232. Upon a man and do his soul unrest
233. And not his body, and all is for the best,
234. When he withstandeth our temptation,
235. It is a cause of his salvation,
236. Albeit that it was not our intent
237. He should be safe, but that we would him hent.* *catch
238. And sometimes be we servants unto man,
239. As to the archbishop Saint Dunstan,
240. And to th'apostle servant eke was I.'
241. 'Yet tell me,' quoth this Sompnour, 'faithfully,
242. Make ye you newe bodies thus alway
243. Of th' elements?' The fiend answered, 'Nay:
244. Sometimes we feign, and sometimes we arise
245. With deade bodies, in full sundry wise,
246. And speak as reas'nably, and fair, and well,
247. As to the Pythoness did Samuel:
248. And yet will some men say it was not he.
249. I *do no force of* your divinity. *set no value upon*
250. But one thing warn I thee, I will not jape,* jest
251. Thou wilt *algates weet* how we be shape: *assuredly know*
252. Thou shalt hereafterward, my brother dear,
253. Come, where thee needeth not of me to lear.* *learn
254. For thou shalt by thine own experience
255. *Conne in a chair to rede of this sentence,* *learn to understand
256. Better than Virgil, while he was alive, what I have said*
257. Or Dante also.  Now let us ride blive,* *briskly
258. For I will holde company with thee,
259. Till it be so that thou forsake me.'
260. 'Nay,' quoth this Sompnour, 'that shall ne'er betide.
261. I am a yeoman, that is known full wide;
262. My trothe will I hold, as in this case;
263. For though thou wert the devil Satanas,
264. My trothe will I hold to thee, my brother,
265. As I have sworn, and each of us to other,
266. For to be true brethren in this case,
267. And both we go *abouten our purchase.* *seeking what we
268. Take thou thy part, what that men will thee give, may pick up*
269. And I shall mine, thus may we bothe live.
270. And if that any of us have more than other,
271. Let him be true, and part it with his brother.'
272. 'I grante,' quoth the devil, 'by my fay.'
273. And with that word they rode forth their way,
274. And right at th'ent'ring of the towne's end,
275. To which this Sompnour shope* him for to wend,** *shaped **go
276. They saw a cart, that charged was with hay,
277. Which that a carter drove forth on his way.
278. Deep was the way, for which the carte stood:
279. The carter smote, and cried as he were wood,* *mad
280. 'Heit Scot! heit Brok! what, spare ye for the stones?
281. The fiend (quoth he) you fetch body and bones,
282. As farforthly* as ever ye were foal'd, *sure
283. So muche woe as I have with you tholed.* *endured 
284. The devil have all, horses, and cart, and hay.'
285. The Sompnour said, 'Here shall we have a prey,'
286. And near the fiend he drew, *as nought ne were,* *as if nothing
287. Full privily, and rowned* in his ear: were the matter*
288. 'Hearken, my brother, hearken, by thy faith, *whispered
289. Hearest thou not, how that the carter saith?
290. Hent* it anon, for he hath giv'n it thee, *seize
291. Both hay and cart, and eke his capels* three.' *horses 
292. 'Nay,' quoth the devil, 'God wot, never a deal,* whit
293. It is not his intent, trust thou me well;
294. Ask him thyself, if thou not trowest* me, *believest
295. Or elles stint* a while and thou shalt see.' *stop
296. The carter thwack'd his horses on the croup,
297. And they began to drawen and to stoop.
298. 'Heit now,' quoth he; 'there, Jesus Christ you bless,
299. And all his handiwork, both more and less!
300. That was well twight,* mine owen liart,** boy, *pulled **grey
301. I pray God save thy body, and Saint Loy!
302. Now is my cart out of the slough, pardie.'
303. 'Lo, brother,' quoth the fiend, 'what told I thee?
304. Here may ye see, mine owen deare brother,
305. The churl spake one thing, but he thought another.
306. Let us go forth abouten our voyage;
307. Here win I nothing upon this carriage.'

308. When that they came somewhat out of the town,
309. This Sompnour to his brother gan to rown;
310. 'Brother,' quoth he, 'here wons* an old rebeck, *dwells
311. That had almost as lief to lose her neck.
312. As for to give a penny of her good.
313. I will have twelvepence, though that she be wood,* *mad
314. Or I will summon her to our office;
315. And yet, God wot, of her know I no vice.
316. But for thou canst not, as in this country,
317. Winne thy cost, take here example of me.'
318. This Sompnour clapped at the widow's gate:
319. 'Come out,' he said, 'thou olde very trate;* *trot 
320. I trow thou hast some friar or priest with thee.'
321. 'Who clappeth?' said this wife; 'benedicite,
322. God save you, Sir, what is your sweete will?'
323. 'I have,' quoth he, 'of summons here a bill.
324. Up* pain of cursing, looke that thou be *upon
325. To-morrow before our archdeacon's knee,
326. To answer to the court of certain things.'
327. 'Now Lord,' quoth she, 'Christ Jesus, king of kings,
328. So wis1y* helpe me, *as I not may.* *surely *as I cannot*
329. I have been sick, and that full many a day.
330. I may not go so far,' quoth she, 'nor ride,
331. But I be dead, so pricketh it my side.
332. May I not ask a libel, Sir Sompnour,
333. And answer there by my procuratour
334. To such thing as men would appose* me?' *accuse
335. 'Yes,' quoth this Sompnour, 'pay anon, let see,
336. Twelvepence to me, and I will thee acquit.
337. I shall no profit have thereby but lit:* *little
338. My master hath the profit and not I.
339. Come off, and let me ride hastily;
340. Give me twelvepence, I may no longer tarry.'

341. 'Twelvepence!' quoth she; 'now lady Sainte Mary
342. So wisly* help me out of care and sin, *surely
343. This wide world though that I should it win,
344. No have I not twelvepence within my hold.
345. Ye know full well that I am poor and old;
346. *Kithe your almes* upon me poor wretch.' *show your charity*
347. 'Nay then,' quoth he, 'the foule fiend me fetch,
348. If I excuse thee, though thou should'st be spilt.'* *ruined
349. 'Alas!' quoth she, 'God wot, I have no guilt.'
350. 'Pay me,' quoth he, 'or, by the sweet Saint Anne,
351. As I will bear away thy newe pan
352. For debte, which thou owest me of old, -
353. When that thou madest thine husband cuckold, -
354. I paid at home for thy correction.'
355. 'Thou liest,' quoth she, 'by my salvation;
356. Never was I ere now, widow or wife,
357. Summon'd unto your court in all my life;
358. Nor never I was but of my body true.
359. Unto the devil rough and black of hue
360. Give I thy body and my pan also.'
361. And when the devil heard her curse so
362. Upon her knees, he said in this mannere;
363. 'Now, Mabily, mine owen mother dear,
364. Is this your will in earnest that ye say?'
365. 'The devil,' quoth she, 'so fetch him ere he dey,* *die
366. And pan and all, but* he will him repent.' *unless
367. 'Nay, olde stoat,* that is not mine intent,' *polecat
368. Quoth this Sompnour, 'for to repente me
369. For any thing that I have had of thee;
370. I would I had thy smock and every cloth.'
371. 'Now, brother,' quoth the devil, 'be not wroth;
372. Thy body and this pan be mine by right.
373. Thou shalt with me to helle yet tonight,
374. Where thou shalt knowen of our privity* *secrets
375. More than a master of divinity.'

376. And with that word the foule fiend him hent.* *seized
377. Body and soul, he with the devil went,
378. Where as the Sompnours have their heritage;
379. And God, that maked after his image
380. Mankinde, save and guide us all and some,
381. And let this Sompnour a good man become.
382. Lordings, I could have told you (quoth this Frere),
383. Had I had leisure for this Sompnour here,
384. After the text of Christ, and Paul, and John,
385. And of our other doctors many a one,
386. Such paines, that your heartes might agrise,* *be horrified
387. Albeit so, that no tongue may devise,* - *relate
388. Though that I might a thousand winters tell, -
389. The pains of thilke* cursed house of hell *that
390. But for to keep us from that cursed place
391. Wake we, and pray we Jesus, of his grace,
392. So keep us from the tempter, Satanas.
393. Hearken this word, beware as in this case.
394. The lion sits *in his await* alway *on the watch* 
395. To slay the innocent, if that he may.
396. Disposen aye your heartes to withstond
397. The fiend that would you make thrall and bond;
398. He may not tempte you over your might,
399. For Christ will be your champion and your knight;
400. And pray, that this our Sompnour him repent
401. Of his misdeeds ere that the fiend him hent.* *seize
