1. The firste stock-father of gentleness,
2. What man desireth gentle for to be,
3. Must follow his trace, and all his wittes dress,

9. True of his word, sober, pious, and free,

13. He is not gentle, though he riche seem,
14. All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.
15. Vice may well be heir to old richess,
16. But there may no man, as men may well see,
17. Bequeath his heir his virtuous nobless;
18. That is appropried to no degree,
19. But to the first Father in majesty,
20. Which makes his heire him that doth him queme,
21. All wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.
