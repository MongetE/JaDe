1. Since I from Love escaped am so fat,
2. I ne'er think to be in his prison ta'en;
3. Since I am free, I count him not a bean.

4. He may answer, and saye this and that;
5. I do no force, I speak right as I mean;
6. Since I from Love escaped am so fat.
7. Love hath my name struck out of his slat,
8. And he is struck out of my bookes clean,
9. For ever more; there is none other mean;
10. Since I from Love escaped am so fat.
