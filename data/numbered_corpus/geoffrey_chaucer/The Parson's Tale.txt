31. This Parson him answered all at ones;

76. THE TALE. 


77. [The Parson begins his 'little treatise' -(which, if given at
78. length, would extend to about thirty of these pages, and which
79. cannot by any stretch of courtesy or fancy be said to merit the
80. title of a 'Tale') in these words: -]

81. Our sweet Lord God of Heaven, that no man will perish, but
82. will that we come all to the knowledge of him, and to the
83. blissful life that is perdurable [everlasting], admonishes us by
84. the prophet Jeremiah, that saith in this wise: 'Stand upon the
85. ways, and see and ask of old paths, that is to say, of old
86. sentences, which is the good way, and walk in that way, and ye
87. shall find refreshing for your souls,'  &c. Many be the
88. spiritual ways that lead folk to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
89. reign of glory; of which ways there is a full noble way, and full
90. convenable, which may not fail to man nor to woman, that
91. through sin hath misgone from the right way of Jerusalem
92. celestial; and this way is called penitence. Of which men should
93. gladly hearken and inquire with all their hearts, to wit what is
94. penitence, and whence it is called penitence, and in what
95. manner, and in how many manners, be the actions or workings
96. of penitence, and how many species there be of penitences, and
97. what things appertain and behove to penitence, and what things
98. disturb penitence.

99. [Penitence is described, on the authority of Saints Ambrose,
100. Isidore, and Gregory, as the bewailing of sin that has been
101. wrought, with the purpose never again to do that thing, or any
102. other thing which a man should bewail; for weeping and not
103. ceasing to do the sin will not avail - though it is to be hoped
104. that after every time that a man falls, be it ever so often, he may
105. find grace to arise through penitence. And repentant folk that
106. leave their sin ere sin leave them, are accounted by Holy Church
107. sure of their salvation, even though the repentance be at the last
108. hour. There are three actions of penitence; that a man be
109. baptized after he has sinned; that he do no deadly sin after
110. receiving baptism; and that he fall into no venial sins from day
111. to day. 'Thereof saith St Augustine, that penitence of good and
112. humble folk is the penitence of every day.' The species of
113. penitence are three: solemn, when a man is openly expelled
114. from Holy Church in Lent, or is compelled by Holy Church to
115. do open penance for an open sin openly talked of in the
116. country; common penance, enjoined by priests in certain cases,
117. as to go on pilgrimage naked or barefoot; and privy penance,
118. which men do daily for private sins, of which they confess
119. privately and receive private penance. To very perfect penitence
120. are behoveful and necessary three things: contrition of heart,
121. confession of mouth, and satisfaction; which are fruitful
122. penitence against delight in thinking, reckless speech, and
123. wicked sinful works.

124. Penitence may be likened to a tree, having its root in contrition,
125. biding itself in the heart as a tree-root does in the earth; out of
126. this root springs a stalk, that bears branches and leaves of
127. confession, and fruit of satisfaction. Of this root also springs a
128. seed of grace, which is mother of all security, and this seed is
129. eager and hot; and the grace of this seed springs of God,
130. through remembrance on the day of judgment and on the pains
131. of hell. The heat of this seed is the love of God, and the desire
132. of everlasting joy; and this heat draws the heart of man to God,
133. and makes him hate his sin. Penance is the tree of life to them
134. that receive it. In penance or contrition man shall understand
135. four things: what is contrition; what are the causes that move a
136. man to contrition; how he should be contrite; and what
137. contrition availeth to the soul. Contrition is the heavy and
138. grievous sorrow that a man receiveth in his heart for his sins,
139. with earnest purpose to confess and do penance, and never
140. more to sin. Six causes ought to move a man to contrition: 1.
141. He should remember him of his sins; 2. He should reflect that
142. sin putteth a man in great thraldom, and all the greater the
143. higher is the estate from which he falls; 3. He should dread the
144. day of doom and the horrible pains of hell; 4. The sorrowful
145. remembrance of the good deeds that man hath omitted to do
146. here on earth, and also the good that he hath lost, ought to
147. make him have contrition; 5. So also ought the remembrance of
148. the passion that our Lord Jesus Christ suffered for our sins; 6.
149. And so ought the hope of three things, that is to say,
150. forgiveness of sin, the gift of grace to do well, and the glory of
151. heaven with which God shall reward man for his good deeds. -
152. All these points the Parson illustrates and enforces at length;
153. waxing especially eloquent under the third head, and plainly
154. setting forth the sternly realistic notions regarding future
155. punishments that were entertained in the time of Chaucer:-] 

156. Certes, all the sorrow that a man might make from the
157. beginning of the world, is but a little thing, at retard of [in
158. comparison with] the sorrow of hell. The cause why that Job
159. calleth hell the land of darkness;  understand, that he calleth
160. it land or earth, for it is stable and never shall fail, and dark, for
161. he that is in hell hath default [is devoid] of light natural; for
162. certes the dark light, that shall come out of the fire that ever
163. shall burn, shall turn them all to pain that be in hell, for it
164. sheweth them the horrible devils that them torment. Covered
165. with the darkness of death; that is to say, that he that is in hell
166. shall have default of the sight of God; for certes the sight of
167. God is the life perdurable [everlasting]. The darkness of death,
168. be the sins that the wretched man hath done, which that disturb
169. [prevent] him to see the face of God, right as a dark cloud doth
170. between us and the sun. Land of misease, because there be three
171. manner of defaults against three things that folk of this world
172. have in this present life; that is to say, honours, delights, and
173. riches. Against honour have they in hell shame and confusion:
174. for well ye wot, that men call honour the reverence that man
175. doth to man; but in hell is no honour nor reverence; for certes
176. no more reverence shall be done there to a king than to a knave
177. [servant]. For which God saith by the prophet Jeremiah; 'The
178. folk that me despise shall be in despite.' Honour is also called
179. great lordship. There shall no wight serve other, but of harm
180. and torment. Honour is also called great dignity and highness;
181. but in hell shall they be all fortrodden [trampled under foot] of
182. devils. As God saith, 'The horrible devils shall go and come
183. upon the heads of damned folk;' and this is, forasmuch as the
184. higher that they were in this present life, the more shall they be
185. abated [abased] and defouled in hell. Against the riches of this
186. world shall they have misease [trouble, torment] of poverty, and
187. this poverty shall be in four things: in default [want] of treasure;
188. of which David saith, 'The rich folk that embraced and oned
189. [united] all their heart to treasure of this world, shall sleep in the
190. sleeping of death, and nothing shall they find in their hands of
191. all their treasure.' And moreover, the misease of hell shall be in
192. default of meat and drink. For God saith thus by Moses, 'They
193. shall be wasted with hunger, and the birds of hell shall devour
194. them with bitter death, and the gall of the dragon shall be their
195. drink, and the venom of the dragon their morsels.' And
196. furthermore, their misease shall be in default of clothing, for
197. they shall be naked in body, as of clothing, save the fire in
198. which they burn, and other filths; and naked shall they be in
199. soul, of all manner virtues, which that is the clothing of the soul.
200. Where be then the gay robes, and the soft sheets, and the fine
201. shirts? Lo, what saith of them the prophet Isaiah, that under
202. them shall be strewed moths, and their covertures shall be of
203. worms of hell. And furthermore, their misease shall be in default
204. of friends, for he is not poor that hath good friends: but there is
205. no friend; for neither God nor any good creature shall be friend
206. to them, and evereach of them shall hate other with deadly hate.
207. The Sons and the daughters shall rebel against father and
208. mother, and kindred against kindred, and chide and despise each
209. other, both day and night, as God saith by the prophet Micah.
210. And the loving children, that whom loved so fleshly each other,
211. would each of them eat the other if they might. For how should
212. they love together in the pains of hell, when they hated each
213. other in the prosperity of this life? For trust well, their fleshly
214. love was deadly hate; as saith the prophet David; 'Whoso
215. loveth wickedness, he hateth his own soul:' and whoso hateth
216. his own soul, certes he may love none other wight in no
217. manner: and therefore in hell is no solace nor no friendship, but
218. ever the more kindreds that be in hell, the more cursing, the
219. more chiding, and the more deadly hate there is among them.
220. And furtherover, they shall have default of all manner delights;
221. for certes delights be after the appetites of the five wits
222. [senses]; as sight, hearing, smelling, savouring [tasting], and
223. touching. But in hell their sight shall be full of darkness and of
224. smoke, and their eyes full of tears; and their hearing full of
225. waimenting [lamenting] and grinting [gnashing] of teeth, as
226. saith Jesus Christ; their nostrils shall be full of stinking; and, as
227. saith Isaiah the prophet, their savouring [tasting] shall be full of
228. bitter gall; and touching of all their body shall be covered with
229. fire that never shall quench, and with worms that never shall
230. die, as God saith by the mouth of Isaiah. And forasmuch as they
231. shall not ween that they may die for pain, and by death flee from
232. pain, that may they understand in the word of Job, that saith,
233. 'There is the shadow of death.' Certes a shadow hath the
234. likeness of the thing of which it is shadowed, but the shadow is
235. not the same thing of which it is shadowed: right so fareth the
236. pain of hell; it is like death, for the horrible anguish; and why?
237. for it paineth them ever as though they should die anon; but
238. certes they shall not die. For, as saith Saint Gregory, 'To
239. wretched caitiffs shall be given death without death, and end
240. without end, and default without failing; for their death shall
241. always live, and their end shall evermore begin, and their default
242. shall never fail.' And therefore saith Saint John the Evangelist,
243. 'They shall follow death, and they shall not find him, and they
244. shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.' And eke Job
245. saith, that in hell is no order of rule. And albeit that God hath
246. created all things in right order, and nothing without order, but
247. all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that
248. be damned be not in order, nor hold no order. For the earth
249. shall bear them no fruit (for, as the prophet David saith, 'God
250. shall destroy the fruit of the earth, as for them'): nor water shall
251. give them no moisture, nor the air no refreshing, nor the fire no
252. light. For as saith Saint Basil, 'The burning of the fire of this
253. world shall God give in hell to them that be damned, but the
254. light and the clearness shall be given in heaven to his children;
255. right as the good man giveth flesh to his children, and bones to
256. his hounds.' And for they shall have no hope to escape, saith
257. Job at last, that there shall horror and grisly dread dwell without
258. end. Horror is always dread of harm that is to come, and this
259. dread shall ever dwell in the hearts of them that be damned.
260. And therefore have they lost all their hope for seven causes.
261. First, for God that is their judge shall be without mercy to them;
262. nor they may not please him; nor none of his hallows [saints];
263. nor they may give nothing for their ransom; nor they have no
264. voice to speak to him; nor they may not flee from pain; nor they
265. have no goodness in them that they may shew to deliver them
266. from pain.

267. [Under the fourth head, of good works, the Parson says: -]

268. The courteous Lord Jesus Christ will that no good work be lost,
269. for in somewhat it shall avail. But forasmuch as the good works
270. that men do while they be in good life be all amortised [killed,
271. deadened] by sin following, and also since all the good works
272. that men do while they be in deadly sin be utterly dead, as for to
273. have the life perdurable [everlasting], well may that man that no
274. good works doth, sing that new French song, J'ai tout perdu -
275. mon temps et mon labour . For certes, sin bereaveth a man
276. both the goodness of nature, and eke the goodness of grace.
277. For soothly the grace of the Holy Ghost fareth like fire, that
278. may not be idle; for fire faileth anon as it forleteth [leaveth] its
279. working, and right so grace faileth anon as it forleteth its
280. working. Then loseth the sinful man the goodness of glory, that
281. only is to good men that labour and work. Well may he be sorry
282. then, that oweth all his life to God, as long as he hath lived, and
283. also as long as he shall live, that no goodness hath to pay with
284. his debt to God, to whom he oweth all his life: for trust well he
285. shall give account, as saith Saint Bernard, of all the goods that
286. have been given him in his present life, and how he hath them
287. dispended, insomuch that there shall not perish an hair of his
288. head, nor a moment of an hour shall not perish of his time, that
289. he shall not give thereof a reckoning.

290. [Having treated of the causes, the Parson comes to the manner,
291. of contrition - which should be universal and total, not merely
292. of outward deeds of sin, but also of wicked delights and
293. thoughts and words; 'for certes Almighty God is all good, and
294. therefore either he forgiveth all, or else right naught.' Further,
295. contrition should be 'wonder sorrowful and anguishous,' and
296. also continual, with steadfast purpose of confession and
297. amendment. Lastly, of what contrition availeth, the Parson says,
298. that sometimes it delivereth man from sin; that without it neither
299. confession nor satisfaction is of any worth; that it 'destroyeth
300. the prison of hell, and maketh weak and feeble all the strengths
301. of the devils, and restoreth the gifts of the Holy Ghost and of all
302. good virtues, and cleanseth the soul of sin, and delivereth it
303. from the pain of hell, and from the company of the devil, and
304. from the servage [slavery] of sin, and restoreth it to all goods
305. spiritual, and to the company and communion of Holy Church.'
306. He who should set his intent to these things, would no longer be
307. inclined to sin, but would give his heart and body to the service
308. of Jesus Christ, and thereof do him homage. 'For, certes, our
309. Lord Jesus Christ hath spared us so benignly in our follies, that
310. if he had not pity on man's soul, a sorry song might we all sing.'

311. The Second Part of the Parson's Tale or Treatise opens with an
312. explanation of what is confession - which is termed 'the
313. second part of penitence, that is, sign of contrition;' whether it
314. ought needs be done or not; and what things be convenable to
315. true confession. Confession is true shewing of sins to the priest,
316. without excusing, hiding, or forwrapping [disguising] of
317. anything, and without vaunting of good works. 'Also, it is
318. necessary to understand whence that sins spring, and how they
319. increase, and which they be.' From Adam we took original sin;
320. 'from him fleshly descended be we all, and engendered of vile
321. and corrupt matter;' and the penalty of Adam's transgression
322. dwelleth with us as to temptation, which penalty is called
323. concupiscence. 'This concupiscence, when it is wrongfully
324. disposed or ordained in a man, it maketh him covet, by covetise
325. of flesh, fleshly sin by sight of his eyes, as to earthly things, and
326. also covetise of highness by pride of heart.' The Parson
327. proceeds to shew how man is tempted in his flesh to sin; how,
328. after his natural concupiscence, comes suggestion of the devil,
329. that is to say the devil's bellows, with which he bloweth in man
330. the fire of con cupiscence; and how man then bethinketh him
331. whether he will do or no the thing to which he is tempted. If he
332. flame up into pleasure at the thought, and give way, then is he
333. all dead in soul; 'and thus is sin accomplished, by temptation, by
334. delight, and by consenting; and then is the sin actual.' Sin is
335. either venial, or deadly; deadly, when a man loves any creature
336. more than Jesus Christ our Creator, venial, if he love Jesus
337. Christ less than he ought. Venial sins diminish man's love to
338. God more and more, and may in this wise skip into deadly sin;
339. for many small make a great. 'And hearken this example: A
340. great wave of the sea cometh sometimes with so great a
341. violence, that it drencheth [causes to sink] the ship: and the
342. same harm do sometimes the small drops, of water that enter
343. through a little crevice in the thurrok [hold, bilge], and in the
344. bottom of the ship, if men be so negligent that they discharge
345. them not betimes. And therefore, although there be difference
346. betwixt these two causes of drenching, algates [in any case] the
347. ship is dreint [sunk]. Right so fareth it sometimes of deadly sin,'
348. and of venial sins when they multiply in a man so greatly as to
349. make him love worldly things more than God. The Parson then
350. enumerates specially a number of sins which many a man
351. peradventure deems no sins, and confesses them not, and yet
352. nevertheless they are truly sins: - ]

353. This is to say, at every time that a man eateth and drinketh more
354. than sufficeth to the sustenance of his body, in certain he doth
355. sin; eke when he speaketh more than it needeth, he doth sin; eke
356. when he heareth not benignly the complaint of the poor; eke
357. when he is in health of body, and will not fast when other folk
358. fast, without cause reasonable; eke when he sleepeth more than
359. needeth, or when he cometh by that occasion too late to church,
360. or to other works of charity; eke when he useth his wife without
361. sovereign desire of engendrure, to the honour of God, or for the
362. intent to yield his wife his debt of his body; eke when he will not
363. visit the sick, or the prisoner, if he may; eke if he love wife, or
364. child, or other worldly thing, more than reason requireth; eke if
365. he flatter or blandish more than he ought for any necessity; eke
366. if he minish or withdraw the alms of the poor; eke if he apparail
367. [prepare] his meat more deliciously than need is, or eat it too
368. hastily by likerousness [gluttony]; eke if he talk vanities in the
369. church, or at God's service, or that he be a talker of idle words
370. of folly or villainy, for he shall yield account of them at the day
371. of doom; eke when he behighteth [promiseth] or assureth to do
372. things that he may not perform; eke when that by lightness of
373. folly he missayeth or scorneth his neighbour; eke when he hath
374. any wicked suspicion of thing, that he wot of it no
375. soothfastness: these things, and more without number, be sins,
376. as saith Saint Augustine.

377. [No earthly man may eschew all venial sins; yet may he refrain
378. him, by the burning love that he hath to our Lord Jesus Christ,
379. and by prayer and confession, and other good works, so that it
380. shall but little grieve. 'Furthermore, men may also refrain and
381. put away venial sin, by receiving worthily the precious body of
382. Jesus Christ; by receiving eke of holy water; by alms-deed; by
383. general confession of Confiteor at mass, and at prime, and at
384. compline [evening service]; and by blessing of bishops and
385. priests, and by other good works.' The Parson then proceeds to
386. weightier matters:- ]

387. Now it is behovely [profitable, necessary] to tell which be
388. deadly sins, that is to say, chieftains of sins; forasmuch as all
389. they run in one leash, but in diverse manners. Now be they
390. called chieftains, forasmuch as they be chief, and of them spring
391. all other sins. The root of these sins, then, is pride, the general
392. root of all harms. For of this root spring certain branches: as ire,
393. envy, accidie  or sloth, avarice or covetousness (to common
394. understanding), gluttony, and lechery: and each of these sins
395. hath his branches and his twigs, as shall be declared in their
396. chapters following. And though so be, that no man can tell
397. utterly the number of the twigs, and of the harms that come of
398. pride, yet will I shew a part of them, as ye shall understand.
399. There is inobedience, vaunting, hypocrisy, despite, arrogance,
400. impudence, swelling of hearte, insolence, elation, impatience,
401. strife, contumacy, presumption, irreverence, pertinacity, vain-
402. glory and many another twig that I cannot tell nor declare. . . .]

403. And yet [moreover] there is a privy species of pride that waiteth
404. first to be saluted ere he will salute, all [although] be he less
405. worthy than that other is; and eke he waiteth [expecteth] or
406. desireth to sit or to go above him in the way, or kiss the pax,
407.  or be incensed, or go to offering before his neighbour, and
408. such semblable [like] things, against his duty peradventure, but
409. that he hath his heart and his intent in such a proud desire to be
410. magnified and honoured before the people. Now be there two
411. manner of prides; the one of them is within the heart of a man,
412. and the other is without. Of which soothly these foresaid things,
413. and more than I have said, appertain to pride that is within the
414. heart of a man and there be other species of pride that be
415. without: but nevertheless, the one of these species of pride is
416. sign of the other, right as the gay levesell [bush] at the tavern is
417. sign of the wine that is in the cellar. And this is in many things:
418. as in speech and countenance, and outrageous array of clothing;
419. for certes, if there had been no sin in clothing, Christ would not
420. so soon have noted and spoken of the clothing of that rich man
421. in the gospel. And Saint Gregory saith, that precious clothing is
422. culpable for the dearth [dearness] of it, and for its softness, and
423. for its strangeness and disguising, and for the superfluity or for
424. the inordinate scantness of it; alas! may not a man see in our
425. days the sinful costly array of clothing, and namely [specially] in
426. too much superfluity, or else in too disordinate scantness? As to
427. the first sin, in superfluity of clothing, which that maketh it so
428. dear, to the harm of the people, not only the cost of the
429. embroidering, the disguising, indenting or barring, ounding,
430. paling,  winding, or banding, and semblable [similar] waste
431. of cloth in vanity; but there is also the costly furring [lining or
432. edging with fur] in their gowns, so much punching of chisels to
433. make holes, so much dagging [cutting] of shears, with the
434. superfluity in length of the foresaid gowns, trailing in the dung
435. and in the mire, on horse and eke on foot, as well of man as of
436. woman, that all that trailing is verily (as in effect) wasted,
437. consumed, threadbare, and rotten with dung, rather than it is
438. given to the poor, to great damage of the foresaid poor folk,
439. and that in sundry wise: this is to say, the more that cloth is
440. wasted, the more must it cost to the poor people for the
441. scarceness; and furthermore, if so be that they would give such
442. punched and dagged clothing to the poor people, it is not
443. convenient to wear for their estate, nor sufficient to boot [help,
444. remedy] their necessity, to keep them from the distemperance
445. [inclemency] of the firmament. Upon the other side, to speak of
446. the horrible disordinate scantness of clothing, as be these cutted
447. slops or hanselines [breeches] , that through their shortness
448. cover not the shameful member of man, to wicked intent alas!
449. some of them shew the boss and the shape of the horrible
450. swollen members, that seem like to the malady of hernia, in the
451. wrapping of their hosen, and eke the buttocks of them, that fare
452. as it were the hinder part of a she-ape in the full of the moon.
453. And more over the wretched swollen members that they shew
454. through disguising, in departing [dividing] of their hosen in
455. white and red, seemeth that half their shameful privy members
456. were flain [flayed]. And if so be that they depart their hosen in
457. other colours, as is white and blue, or white and black, or black
458. and red, and so forth; then seemeth it, by variance of colour,
459. that the half part of their privy members be corrupt by the fire
460. of Saint Anthony, or by canker, or other such mischance. And
461. of the hinder part of their buttocks it is full horrible to see, for
462. certes, in that part of their body where they purge their stinking
463. ordure, that foul part shew they to the people proudly in despite
464. of honesty [decency], which honesty Jesus Christ and his friends
465. observed to shew in his life. Now as of the outrageous array of
466. women, God wot, that though the visages of some of them
467. seem full chaste and debonair [gentle], yet notify they, in their
468. array of attire, likerousness and pride. I say not that honesty
469. [reasonable and appropriate style] in clothing of man or woman
470. unconvenable but, certes, the superfluity or disordinate scarcity
471. of clothing is reprovable. Also the sin of their ornament, or of
472. apparel, as in things that appertain to riding, as in too many
473. delicate horses, that be holden for delight, that be so fair, fat,
474. and costly; and also in many a vicious knave, [servant] that is
475. sustained because of them; in curious harness, as in saddles,
476. cruppers, peytrels, [breast-plates] and bridles, covered with
477. precious cloth and rich bars and plates of gold and silver. For
478. which God saith by Zechariah the prophet, 'I will confound the
479. riders of such horses.' These folk take little regard of the riding
480. of God's Son of heaven, and of his harness, when he rode upon
481. an ass, and had no other harness but the poor clothes of his
482. disciples; nor we read not that ever he rode on any other beast.
483. I speak this for the sin of superfluity, and not for reasonable
484. honesty [seemliness], when reason it requireth. And moreover,
485. certes, pride is greatly notified in holding of great meinie
486. [retinue of servants], when they be of little profit or of right no
487. profit, and namely [especially] when that meinie is felonous
488. [violent ] and damageous [harmful] to the people by hardiness
489. [arrogance] of high lordship, or by way of office; for certes,
490. such lords sell then their lordship to the devil of hell, when they
491. sustain the wickedness of their meinie. Or else, when these folk
492. of low degree, as they that hold hostelries, sustain theft of their
493. hostellers, and that is in many manner of deceits: that manner of
494. folk be the flies that follow the honey, or else the hounds that
495. follow the carrion. Such foresaid folk strangle spiritually their
496. lordships; for which thus saith David the prophet, 'Wicked
497. death may come unto these lordships, and God give that they
498. may descend into hell adown; for in their houses is iniquity and
499. shrewedness, [impiety] and not God of heaven.' And certes, but
500. if [unless] they do amendment, right as God gave his benison
501. [blessing] to Laban by the service of Jacob, and to Pharaoh by
502. the service of Joseph; right so God will give his malison
503. [condemnation] to such lordships as sustain the wickedness of
504. their servants, but [unless] they come to amendment. Pride of
505. the table apaireth [worketh harm] eke full oft; for, certes, rich
506. men be called to feasts, and poor folk be put away and rebuked;
507. also in excess of divers meats and drinks, and namely [specially]
508. such manner bake-meats and dish-meats burning of wild fire,
509. and painted and castled with paper, and semblable [similar]
510. waste, so that it is abuse to think. And eke in too great
511. preciousness of vessel, [plate] and curiosity of minstrelsy, by
512. which a man is stirred more to the delights of luxury, if so be
513. that he set his heart the less upon our Lord Jesus Christ, certain
514. it is a sin; and certainly the delights might be so great in this
515. case, that a man might lightly [easily] fall by them into deadly
516. sin.

517. [The sins that arise of pride advisedly and habitually are deadly;
518. those that arise by frailty unadvised suddenly, and suddenly
519. withdraw again, though grievous, are not deadly. Pride itself
520. springs sometimes of the goods of nature, sometimes of the
521. goods of fortune, sometimes of the goods of grace; but the
522. Parson, enumerating and examining all these in turn, points out
523. how little security they possess and how little ground for pride
524. they furnish, and goes on to enforce the remedy against pride -
525. which is humility or meekness, a virtue through which a man
526. hath true knowledge of himself, and holdeth no high esteem of
527. himself in regard of his deserts, considering ever his frailty.]

528. Now be there three manners [kinds] of humility; as humility in
529. heart, and another in the mouth, and the third in works. The
530. humility in the heart is in four manners: the one is, when a man
531. holdeth himself as nought worth before God of heaven; the
532. second is, when he despiseth no other man; the third is, when he
533. recketh not though men hold him nought worth; the fourth is,
534. when he is not sorry of his humiliation. Also the humility of
535. mouth is in four things: in temperate speech; in humility of
536. speech; and when he confesseth with his own mouth that he is
537. such as he thinketh that he is in his heart; another is, when he
538. praiseth the bounte [goodness] of another man and nothing
539. thereof diminisheth. Humility eke in works is in four manners:
540. the first is, when he putteth other men before him; the second is,
541. to choose the lowest place of all; the third is, gladly to assent to
542. good counsel; the fourth is, to stand gladly by the award
543. [judgment] of his sovereign, or of him that is higher in degree:
544. certain this is a great work of humility.

545. [The Parson proceeds to treat of the other cardinal sins, and
546. their remedies: (2.) Envy, with its remedy, the love of God
547. principally and of our neighbours as ourselves: (3.) Anger, with
548. all its fruits in revenge, rancour, hate, discord, manslaughter,
549. blasphemy, swearing, falsehood, flattery, chiding and reproving,
550. scorning, treachery, sowing of strife, doubleness of tongue,
551. betraying of counsel to a man's disgrace, menacing, idle words,
552. jangling, japery or buffoonery, &c. - and its remedy in the
553. virtues called mansuetude, debonairte, or gentleness, and
554. patience or sufferance: (4.) Sloth, or 'Accidie,' which comes
555. after the sin of Anger, because Envy blinds the eyes of a man,
556. and Anger troubleth a man, and Sloth maketh him heavy,
557. thoughtful, and peevish. It is opposed to every estate of man -
558. as unfallen, and held to work in praising and adoring God; as
559. sinful, and held to labour in praying for deliverance from sin;
560. and as in the state of grace, and held to works of penitence. It
561. resembles the heavy and sluggish condition of those in hell; it
562. will suffer no hardness and no penance; it prevents any
563. beginning of good works; it causes despair of God's mercy,
564. which is the sin against the Holy Ghost; it induces somnolency
565. and neglect of communion in prayer with God; and it breeds
566. negligence or recklessness, that cares for nothing, and is the
567. nurse of all mischiefs, if ignorance is their mother. Against
568. Sloth, and these and other branches and fruits of it, the remedy
569. lies in the virtue of fortitude or strength, in its various species of
570. magnanimity or great courage; faith and hope in God and his
571. saints; surety or sickerness, when a man fears nothing that can
572. oppose the good works he has under taken; magnificence, when
573. he carries out great works of goodness begun; constancy or
574. stableness of heart; and other incentives to energy and laborious
575. service: (5.) Avarice, or Covetousness, which is the root of all
576. harms, since its votaries are idolaters, oppressors and enslavers
577. of men, deceivers of their equals in business, simoniacs,
578. gamblers, liars, thieves, false swearers, blasphemers, murderers,
579. and sacrilegious. Its remedy lies in compassion and pity largely
580. exercised, and in reasonable liberality - for those who spend on
581. 'fool-largesse,' or ostentation of worldly estate and luxury,
582. shall receive the malison [condemnation] that Christ shall give
583. at the day of doom to them that shall be damned: (6.) Gluttony;
584. - of which the Parson treats so briefly that the chapter may be
585. given in full: - ]

586. After Avarice cometh Gluttony, which is express against the
587. commandment of God. Gluttony is unmeasurable appetite to eat
588. or to drink; or else to do in aught to the unmeasurable appetite
589. and disordered covetousness [craving] to eat or drink. This sin
590. corrupted all this world, as is well shewed in the sin of Adam
591. and of Eve. Look also what saith Saint Paul of gluttony:
592. 'Many,' saith he, 'go, of which I have oft said to you, and now
593. I say it weeping, that they be enemies of the cross of Christ, of
594. which the end is death, and of which their womb [stomach] is
595. their God and their glory;' in confusion of them that so savour
596. [take delight in] earthly things. He that is usant [accustomed,
597. addicted] to this sin of gluttony, he may no sin withstand, he
598. must be in servage [bondage] of all vices, for it is the devil's
599. hoard, [lair, lurking-place] where he hideth him in and resteth.
600. This sin hath many species. The first is drunkenness, that is the
601. horrible sepulture of man's reason: and therefore when a man is
602. drunken, he hath lost his reason; and this is deadly sin. But
603. soothly, when that a man is not wont to strong drink, and
604. peradventure knoweth not the strength of the drink, or hath
605. feebleness in his head, or hath travailed [laboured], through
606. which he drinketh the more, all [although] be he suddenly
607. caught with drink, it is no deadly sin, but venial. The second
608. species of gluttony is, that the spirit of a man waxeth all
609. troubled for drunkenness, and bereaveth a man the discretion of
610. his wit. The third species of gluttony is, when a man devoureth
611. his meat, and hath no rightful manner of eating. The fourth is,
612. when, through the great abundance of his meat, the humours of
613. his body be distempered. The fifth is, forgetfulness by too much
614. drinking, for which a man sometimes forgetteth by the morrow
615. what be did at eve. In other manner be distinct the species of
616. gluttony, after Saint Gregory. The first is, for to eat or drink
617. before time. The second is, when a man getteth him too delicate
618. meat or drink. The third is, when men take too much over
619. measure [immoderately]. The fourth is curiosity [nicety] with
620. great intent [application, pains] to make and apparel [prepare]
621. his meat. The fifth is, for to eat too greedily. These be the five
622. fingers of the devil's hand, by which he draweth folk to the sin.

623. Against gluttony the remedy is abstinence, as saith Galen; but
624. that I hold not meritorious, if he do it only for the health of his
625. body. Saint Augustine will that abstinence be done for virtue,
626. and with patience. Abstinence, saith he, is little worth, but if
627. [unless] a man have good will thereto, and but it be enforced by
628. patience and by charity, and that men do it for God's sake, and
629. in hope to have the bliss in heaven. The fellows of abstinence be
630. temperance, that holdeth the mean in all things; also shame, that
631. escheweth all dishonesty [indecency, impropriety], sufficiency,
632. that seeketh no rich meats nor drinks, nor doth no force of [sets
633. no value on] no outrageous apparelling of meat; measure
634. [moderation] also, that restraineth by reason the unmeasurable
635. appetite of eating; soberness also, that restraineth the outrage of
636. drink; sparing also, that restraineth the delicate ease to sit long
637. at meat, wherefore some folk stand of their own will to eat,
638. because they will eat at less leisure.

639. [At great length the Parson then points out the many varieties of
640. the sin of (7.) Lechery, and its remedy in chastity and
641. continence, alike in marriage and in widowhood; also in the
642. abstaining from all such indulgences of eating, drinking, and
643. sleeping as inflame the passions, and from the company of all
644. who may tempt to the sin. Minute guidance is given as to the
645. duty of confessing fully and faithfully the circumstances that
646. attend and may aggravate this sin; and the Treatise then passes
647. to the consideration of the conditions that are essential to a true
648. and profitable confession of sin in general. First, it must be in
649. sorrowful bitterness of spirit; a condition that has five signs -
650. shamefastness, humility in heart and outward sign, weeping with
651. the bodily eyes or in the heart, disregard of the shame that
652. might curtail or garble confession, and obedience to the penance
653. enjoined. Secondly, true confession must be promptly made, for
654. dread of death, of increase of sinfulness, of forgetfulness of
655. what should be confessed, of Christ's refusal to hear if it be put
656. off to the last day of life; and this condition has four terms; that
657. confession be well pondered beforehand, that the man
658. confessing have comprehended in his mind the number and
659. greatness of his sins and how long he has lain in sin, that he be
660. contrite for and eschew his sins, and that he fear and flee the
661. occasions for that sin to which he is inclined. - What follows
662. under this head is of some interest for the light which it throws
663. on the rigorous government wielded by the Romish Church in
664. those days -]

665. Also thou shalt shrive thee of all thy sins to one man, and not a
666. parcel [portion] to one man, and a parcel to another; that is to
667. understand, in intent to depart [divide] thy confession for shame
668. or dread; for it is but strangling of thy soul. For certes Jesus
669. Christ is entirely all good, in him is none imperfection, and
670. therefore either he forgiveth all perfectly, or else never a deal
671. [not at all]. I say not that if thou be assigned to thy penitencer
672.  for a certain sin, that thou art bound to shew him all the
673. remnant of thy sins, of which thou hast been shriven of thy
674. curate, but if it like thee [unless thou be pleased] of thy
675. humility; this is no departing [division] of shrift. And I say not,
676. where I speak of division of confession, that if thou have license
677. to shrive thee to a discreet and an honest priest, and where thee
678. liketh, and by the license of thy curate, that thou mayest not
679. well shrive thee to him of all thy sins: but let no blot be behind,
680. let no sin be untold as far as thou hast remembrance. And when
681. thou shalt be shriven of thy curate, tell him eke all the sins that
682. thou hast done since thou wert last shriven. This is no wicked
683. intent of division of shrift. Also, very shrift [true confession]
684. asketh certain conditions. First, that thou shrive thee by thy
685. free will, not constrained, nor for shame of folk, nor for malady
686. [sickness], or such things: for it is reason, that he that
687. trespasseth by his free will, that by his free will he confess his
688. trespass; and that no other man tell his sin but himself; nor he
689. shall not nay nor deny his sin, nor wrath him against the priest
690. for admonishing him to leave his sin. The second condition is,
691. that thy shrift be lawful, that is to say, that thou that shrivest
692. thee, and eke the priest that heareth thy confession, be verily in
693. the faith of Holy Church, and that a man be not despaired of the
694. mercy of Jesus Christ, as Cain and Judas were. And eke a man
695. must accuse himself of his own trespass, and not another: but he
696. shall blame and wite [accuse] himself of his own malice and of
697. his sin, and none other: but nevertheless, if that another man be
698. occasion or else enticer of his sin, or the estate of the person be
699. such by which his sin is aggravated, or else that be may not
700. plainly shrive him but [unless] he tell the person with which he
701. hath sinned, then may he tell, so that his intent be not to
702. backbite the person, but only to declare his confession. Thou
703. shalt not eke make no leasings [falsehoods] in thy confession
704. for humility, peradventure, to say that thou hast committed and
705. done such sins of which that thou wert never guilty. For Saint
706. Augustine saith, 'If that thou, because of humility, makest a
707. leasing on thyself, though thou were not in sin before, yet art
708. thou then in sin through thy leasing.' Thou must also shew thy
709. sin by thine own proper mouth, but [unless] thou be dumb, and
710. not by letter; for thou that hast done the sin, thou shalt have the
711. shame of the confession. Thou shalt not paint thy confession
712. with fair and subtle words, to cover the more thy sin; for then
713. beguilest thou thyself, and not the priest; thou must tell it
714. plainly, be it never so foul nor so horrible. Thou shalt eke shrive
715. thee to a priest that is discreet to counsel thee; and eke thou
716. shalt not shrive thee for vain-glory, nor for hypocrisy, nor for
717. no cause but only for the doubt [fear] of Jesus' Christ and the
718. health of thy soul. Thou shalt not run to the priest all suddenly,
719. to tell him lightly thy sin, as who telleth a jape [jest] or a tale,
720. but advisedly and with good devotion; and generally shrive thee
721. oft; if thou oft fall, oft arise by confession. And though thou
722. shrive thee oftener than once of sin of which thou hast been
723. shriven, it is more merit; and, as saith Saint Augustine, thou
724. shalt have the more lightly [easily] release and grace of God,
725. both of sin and of pain. And certes, once a year at the least way,
726. it is lawful to be houseled,  for soothly once a year all
727. things in the earth renovelen [renew themselves].

728. [Here ends the Second Part of the Treatise; the Third Part,
729. which contains the practical application of the whole, follows
730. entire, along with the remarkable 'Prayer of Chaucer,' as it
731. stands in the Harleian Manuscript:-]

732. De Tertia Parte Poenitentiae. [Of the third part of penitence]

733. Now have I told you of very [true] confession, that is the
734. second part of penitence: The third part of penitence is
735. satisfaction, and that standeth generally in almsdeed and bodily
736. pain. Now be there three manner of almsdeed: contrition of
737. heart, where a man offereth himself to God; the second is, to
738. have pity of the default of his neighbour; the third is, in giving
739. of good counsel and comfort, ghostly and bodily, where men
740. have need, and namely [specially] sustenance of man's food.
741. And take keep [heed] that a man hath need of these things
742. generally; he hath need of food, of clothing, and of herberow
743. [lodging], he hath need of charitable counsel and visiting in
744. prison and malady, and sepulture of his dead body. And if thou
745. mayest not visit the needful with thy person, visit them by thy
746. message and by thy gifts. These be generally alms or works of
747. charity of them that have temporal riches or discretion in
748. counselling. Of these works shalt thou hear at the day of doom.
749. This alms shouldest thou do of thine own proper things, and
750. hastily [promptly], and privily [secretly] if thou mayest; but
751. nevertheless, if thou mayest not do it privily, thou shalt not
752. forbear to do alms, though men see it, so that it be not done for
753. thank of the world, but only for thank of Jesus Christ. For, as
754. witnesseth Saint Matthew, chap. v., 'A city may not be hid that
755. is set on a mountain, nor men light not a lantern and put it
756. under a bushel, but men set it on a candlestick, to light the men
757. in the house; right so shall your light lighten before men, that
758. they may see your good works, and glorify your Father that is
759. in heaven.'

760. Now as to speak of bodily pain, it is in prayer, in wakings,
761. [watchings] in fastings, and in virtuous teachings. Of orisons ye
762. shall understand, that orisons or prayers is to say a piteous will
763. of heart, that redresseth it in God, and expresseth it by word
764. outward, to remove harms, and to have things spiritual and
765. durable, and sometimes temporal things. Of which orisons,
766. certes in the orison of the Pater noster hath our Lord Jesus
767. Christ enclosed most things. Certes, it is privileged of three
768. things in its dignity, for which it is more digne [worthy] than
769. any other prayer: for Jesus Christ himself made it: and it is
770. short, for [in order] it should be coude the more lightly, [be
771. more easily conned or learned] and to withhold [retain] it the
772. more easy in heart, and help himself the oftener with this orison;
773. and for a man should be the less weary to say it; and for a man
774. may not excuse him to learn it, it is so short and so easy: and
775. for it comprehendeth in itself all good prayers. The exposition
776. of this holy prayer, that is so excellent and so digne, I betake
777. [commit] to these masters of theology; save thus much will I
778. say, when thou prayest that God should forgive thee thy guilts,
779. as thou forgivest them that they guilt to thee, be full well ware
780. that thou be not out of charity. This holy orison aminisheth
781. [lesseneth] eke venial sin, and therefore it appertaineth specially
782. to penitence. This prayer must be truly said, and in very faith,
783. and that men pray to God ordinately, discreetly, and devoutly;
784. and always a man shall put his will to be subject to the will of
785. God. This orison must eke be said with great humbleness and
786. full pure, and honestly, and not to the annoyance of any man or
787. woman. It must eke be continued with the works of charity. It
788. availeth against the vices of the soul; for, assaith Saint Jerome,
789. by fasting be saved the vices of the flesh, and by prayer the
790. vices of the soul

791. After this thou shalt understand, that bodily pain stands in
792. waking [watching]. For Jesus Christ saith 'Wake and pray, that
793. ye enter not into temptation.' Ye shall understand also, that
794. fasting stands in three things: in forbearing of bodily meat and
795. drink, and in forbearing of worldly jollity, and in forbearing of
796. deadly sin; this is to say, that a man shall keep him from deadly
797. sin in all that he may. And thou shalt understand eke, that God
798. ordained fasting; and to fasting appertain four things: largeness
799. [generosity] to poor folk; gladness of heart spiritual; not to be
800. angry nor annoyed nor grudge [murmur] for he fasteth; and also
801. reasonable hour for to eat by measure; that is to say, a man
802. should not eat in untime [out of time], nor sit the longer at his
803. meal for [because] he fasteth. Then shalt thou understand, that
804. bodily pain standeth in discipline, or teaching, by word, or by
805. writing, or by ensample. Also in wearing of hairs [haircloth] or
806. of stamin [coarse hempen cloth], or of habergeons [mail-shirts]
807.  on their naked flesh for Christ's sake; but ware thee well
808. that such manner penance of thy flesh make not thine heart
809. bitter or angry, nor annoyed of thyself; for better is to cast away
810. thine hair than to cast away the sweetness of our Lord Jesus
811. Christ. And therefore saith Saint Paul, 'Clothe you, as they that
812. be chosen of God in heart, of misericorde [with compassion],
813. debonairte [gentleness], sufferance [patience], and such manner
814. of clothing,' of which Jesus Christ is more apaid [better
815. pleased] than of hairs or of hauberks. Then is discipline eke in
816. knocking of thy breast, in scourging with yards [rods], in
817. kneelings, in tribulations, in suffering patiently wrongs that be
818. done to him, and eke in patient sufferance of maladies, or losing
819. of worldly catel [chattels], or of wife, or of child, or of other
820. friends.

821. Then shalt thou understand which things disturb penance, and
822. this is in four things; that is dread, shame, hope, and wanhope,
823. that is, desperation. And for to speak first of dread, for which
824. he weeneth that he may suffer no penance, thereagainst is
825. remedy for to think that bodily penance is but short and little at
826. the regard of [in comparison with] the pain of hell, that is so
827. cruel and so long, that it lasteth without end. Now against the
828. shame that a man hath to shrive him, and namely [specially]
829. these hypocrites, that would be holden so perfect, that they
830. have no need to shrive them; against that shame should a man
831. think, that by way of reason he that hath not been ashamed to
832. do foul things, certes he ought not to be ashamed to do fair
833. things, and that is confession. A man should eke think, that God
834. seeth and knoweth all thy thoughts, and all thy works; to him
835. may nothing be hid nor covered. Men should eke remember
836. them of the shame that is to come at the day of doom, to them
837. that be not penitent and shriven in this present life; for all the
838. creatures in heaven, and in earth, and in hell, shall see apertly
839. [openly] all that he hideth in this world.

840. Now for to speak of them that be so negligent and slow to
841. shrive them; that stands in two manners. The one is, that he
842. hopeth to live long, and to purchase [acquire] much riches for
843. his delight, and then he will shrive him: and, as he sayeth, he
844. may, as him seemeth, timely enough come to shrift: another is,
845. the surquedrie [presumption ] that he hath in Christ's
846. mercy. Against the first vice, he shall think that our life is in no
847. sickerness, [security] and eke that all the riches in this world be
848. in adventure, and pass as a shadow on the wall; and, as saith St
849. Gregory, that it appertaineth to the great righteousness of God,
850. that never shall the pain stint [cease] of them, that never would
851. withdraw them from sin, their thanks [with their goodwill], but
852. aye continue in sin; for that perpetual will to do sin shall they
853. have perpetual pain. Wanhope [despair] is in two manners [of
854. two kinds]. The first wanhope is, in the mercy of God: the other
855. is, that they think they might not long persevere in goodness.
856. The first wanhope cometh of that he deemeth that he sinned so
857. highly and so oft, and so long hath lain in sin, that he shall not
858. be saved. Certes against that cursed wanhope should he think,
859. that the passion of Jesus Christ is more strong for to unbind,
860. than sin is strong for to bind. Against the second wanhope he
861. shall think, that as oft as he falleth, he may arise again by
862. penitence; and though he never so long hath lain in sin, the
863. mercy of Christ is always ready to receive him to mercy.
864. Against the wanhope that he thinketh he should not long
865. persevere in goodness, he shall think that the feebleness of the
866. devil may nothing do, but [unless] men will suffer him; and eke
867. he shall have strength of the help of God, and of all Holy
868. Church, and of the protection of angels, if him list.

869. Then shall men understand, what is the fruit of penance; and
870. after the word of Jesus Christ, it is the endless bliss of heaven,
871. where joy hath no contrariety of woe nor of penance nor
872. grievance; there all harms be passed of this present life; there as
873. is the sickerness [security] from the pain of hell; there as is the
874. blissful company, that rejoice them evermore each of the other's
875. joy; there as the body of man, that whilom was foul and dark, is
876. more clear than the sun; there as the body of man that whilom
877. was sick and frail, feeble and mortal, is immortal, and so strong
878. and so whole, that there may nothing apair [impair, injure] it;
879. there is neither hunger, nor thirst, nor cold, but every soul
880. replenished with the sight of the perfect knowing of God. This
881. blissful regne [kingdom] may men purchase by poverty spiritual,
882. and the glory by lowliness, the plenty of joy by hunger and
883. thirst, the rest by travail, and the life by death and mortification
884. of sin; to which life He us bring, that bought us with his
885. precious blood! Amen.
