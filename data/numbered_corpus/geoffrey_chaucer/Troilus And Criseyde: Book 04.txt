4. That semeth trewest, whan she wol bygyle,

6. That she hem hent and blent, traytour comune;
7. And whan a wight is from hir wheel y-throwe,
8. Than laugheth she, and maketh him the mowe.

9. From Troilus she gan hir brighte face
10. Awey to wrythe, and took of him non hede,
11. But caste him clene out of his lady grace,
12. And on hir wheel she sette up Diomede;
13. For which right now myn herte ginneth blede,
14. And now my penne, allas! With which I wryte,
15. Quaketh for drede of that I moot endyte.

16. For how Criseyde Troilus forsook,
17. Or at the leste, how that she was unkinde,
18. Mot hennes-forth ben matere of my book,

29. Of Troilus be fully shewed here.

30. Explicit prohemium.

31. Incipit Quartus Liber.

32. Ligginge in ost, as I have seyd er this,
33. The Grekes stronge, aboute Troye toun,
34. Bifel that, whan that Phebus shyning is
35. Up-on the brest of Hercules Lyoun,
36. That Ector, with ful many a bold baroun,
37. Caste on a day with Grekes for to fighte,
38. As he was wont to greve hem what he mighte.

39. Not I how longe or short it was bitwene
40. This purpos and that day they fighte mente;
41. But on a day wel armed, bright and shene,
42. Ector, and many a worthy wight out wente,
43. With spere in hond and bigge bowes bente;
44. And in the herd, with-oute lenger lette,
45. Hir fomen in the feld anoon hem mette.

46. The longe day, with speres sharpe y-grounde,
47. With arwes, dartes, swerdes, maces felle,
48. They fighte and bringen hors and man to grounde,
49. And with hir axes out the braynes quelle.
50. But in the laste shour, sooth for to telle,
51. The folk of Troye hem-selven so misledden,
52. That with the worse at night homward they fledden.

53. At whiche day was taken Antenor,
54. Maugre Polydamas or Monesteo,
55. Santippe, Sarpedon, Polynestor,
56. Polyte, or eek the Troian daun Ripheo,
57. And othere lasse folk, as Phebuseo.
58. So that, for harm, that day the folk of Troye
59. Dredden to lese a greet part of hir Ioye.

60. Of Pryamus was yeve, at Greek requeste,
61. A tyme of trewe, and tho they gonnen trete,
62. Hir prisoneres to chaungen, moste and leste,
63. And for the surplus yeven sommes grete.
64. This thing anoon was couth in every strete,
65. Bothe in thassege, in toune, and every-where,
66. And with the firste it cam to Calkas ere.

67. Whan Calkas knew this tretis sholde holde,
68. In consistorie, among the Grekes, sone
69. He gan in thringe forth, with lordes olde,
70. And sette him there-as he was wont to done;
71. And with a chaunged face hem bad a bone,
72. For love of god, to don that reverence,
73. To stinte noyse, and yeve him audience.

74. Thanne seyde he thus, 'Lo! Lordes myne, I was
75. Troian, as it is knowen out of drede;
76. And, if that yow remembre, I am Calkas,
77. That alderfirst yaf comfort to your nede,

83. Ye han er this wel herd it me devyse;
84. This knowe ye, my lordes, as I leve.
85. And for the Grekes weren me so leve,
86. I com my-self in my propre persone,
87. To teche in this how yow was best to done;

88. 'Havinge un-to my tresour ne my rente
89. Right no resport, to respect of your ese.
90. Thus al my good I loste and to yow wente,
91. Wening in this you, lordes, for to plese.
92. But al that los ne doth me no disese.
93. I vouche-sauf, as wisly have I Ioye,
94. For you to lese al that I have in Troye,

95. 'Save of a doughter, that I lafte, allas!
96. Slepinge at hoom, whanne out of Troye I sterte.
97. O sterne, O cruel fader that I was!
98. How mighte I have in that so hard an herte?
99. Allas! I ne hadde y-brought hir in hir sherte!
100. For sorwe of which I wol not live to morwe,
101. But-if ye lordes rewe up-on my sorwe.

102. 'For, by that cause I say no tyme er now
103. Hir to delivere, I holden have my pees;
104. But now or never, if that it lyke yow,
105. I may hir have right sone, doutelees.
106. O help and grace! Amonges al this prees,

109. 'Ye have now caught and fetered in prisoun
110. Troians y-nowe; and if your willes be,
111. My child with oon may have redempcioun.
112. Now for the love of god and of bountee,
113. Oon of so fele, allas! So yeve him me.
114. What nede were it this preyere for to werne,
115. Sin ye shul bothe han folk and toun as yerne?

116. 'On peril of my lyf, I shal nat lye,
117. Appollo hath me told it feithfully;
118. I have eek founde it be astronomye,
119. By sort, and by augurie eek trewely,
120. And dar wel seye, the tyme is faste by,
121. That fyr and flaumbe on al the toun shal sprede;
122. And thus shal Troye turne to asshen dede.

123. 'For certeyn, Phebus and Neptunus bothe,
124. That makeden the walles of the toun,
125. Ben with the folk of Troye alwey so wrothe,
126. That thei wol bringe it to confusioun,
127. Right in despyt of king Lameadoun.
128. By-cause he nolde payen hem hir hyre,
129. The toun of Troye shal ben set on-fyre.'

130. Telling his tale alwey, this olde greye,
131. Humble in speche, and in his lokinge eke,
132. The salte teres from his eyen tweye
133. Ful faste ronnen doun by eyther cheke.
134. So longe he gan of socour hem by-seke
135. That, for to hele him of his sorwes sore,
136. They yave him Antenor, with-oute more.

137. But who was glad y-nough but Calkas tho?
138. And of this thing ful sone his nedes leyde
139. On hem that sholden for the tretis go,
140. And hem for Antenor ful ofte preyde
141. To bringen hoom king Toas and Criseyde;
142. And whan Pryam his save-garde sente,
143. Thembassadours to Troye streyght they wente.

144. The cause y-told of hir cominge, the olde
145. Pryam the king ful sone in general
146. Let here-upon his parlement to holde,
147. Of which the effect rehersen yow I shal.
148. Thembassadours ben answered for fynal,
149. Theschaunge of prisoners and al this nede
150. Hem lyketh wel, and forth in they procede.

151. This Troilus was present in the place,
152. Whan axed was for Antenor Criseyde,
153. For which ful sone chaungen gan his face,
154. As he that with tho wordes wel neigh deyde.
155. But nathelees, he no word to it seyde,
156. Lest men sholde his affeccioun espye;
157. With mannes herte he gan his sorwes drye.

158. And ful of anguissh and of grisly drede
159. Abood what lordes wolde un-to it seye;
160. And if they wolde graunte, as god forbede,
161. Theschaunge of hir, than thoughte he thinges tweye,
162. First, how to save hir honour, and what weye
163. He mighte best theschaunge of hir withstonde;
164. Ful faste he caste how al this mighte stonde.

165. Love him made al prest to doon hir byde,
166. And rather dye than she sholde go;
167. But resoun seyde him, on that other syde,
168. 'With-oute assent of hir ne do not so,
169. Lest for thy werk she wolde be thy fo,
170. And seyn, that thorugh thy medling is y-blowe
171. Your bother love, there it was erst unknowe.'

172. For which he gan deliberen, for the beste,
173. That though the lordes wolde that she wente,
174. He wolde lat hem graunte what hem leste,
175. And telle his lady first what that they mente.
176. And whan that she had seyd him hir entente,
177. Ther-after wolde he werken also blyve,
178. Though al the world ayein it wolde stryve.

179. Ector, which that wel the Grekes herde,
180. For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde,
181. Gan it withstonde, and sobrely answerde: --
182. 'Sires, she nis no prisoner,' he seyde;
183. 'I noot on yow who that this charge leyde,
184. But, on my part, ye may eft-sone hem telle,
185. We usen here no wommen for to selle.'

186. The noyse of peple up-stirte thanne at ones,
187. As breme as blase of straw y-set on fyre;
188. For infortune it wolde, for the nones,
189. They sholden hir confusioun desyre.
190. 'Ector,' quod they, 'what goost may yow enspyre
191. This womman thus to shilde and doon us lese
192. Daun Antenor? -- a wrong wey now ye chese --

193. 'That is so wys, and eek so bold baroun,
194. And we han nede to folk, as men may see;
195. He is eek oon, the grettest of this toun;
196. O Ector, lat tho fantasyes be!
197. O king Priam,' quod they, 'thus seggen we,
198. That al our voys is to for-gon Criseyde;'
199. And to deliveren Antenor they preyde.

200. O Iuvenal, lord! Trewe is thy sentence,
201. That litel witen folk what is to yerne
202. That they ne finde in hir desyr offence;
203. For cloud of errour let hem not descerne
204. What best is; and lo, here ensample as yerne.
205. This folk desiren now deliveraunce
206. Of Antenor, that broughte hem to mischaunce!

207. For he was after traytour to the toun
208. Of Troye; allas! They quitte him out to rathe;
209. O nyce world, lo, thy discrecioun!
210. Criseyde, which that never dide hem skathe,
211. Shal now no lenger in hir blisse bathe;
212. But Antenor, he shal com hoom to toune,
213. And she shal out; thus seyden here and howne.

214. For which delibered was by parlement
215. For Antenor to yelden out Criseyde,
216. And it pronounced by the president,
217. Al-theigh that Ector 'nay' ful ofte preyde.
218. And fynaly, what wight that it with-seyde,
219. It was for nought, it moste been, and sholde;
220. For substaunce of the parlement it wolde.

221. Departed out of parlement echone,
222. This Troilus, with-oute wordes mo,
223. Un-to his chaumbre spedde him faste allone,
224. But-if it were a man of his or two,
225. The whiche he bad out faste for to go,
226. By-cause he wolde slepen, as he seyde,
227. And hastely up-on his bed him leyde.

228. And as in winter leves been biraft,
229. Eche after other, til the tree be bare,
230. So that ther nis but bark and braunche y-laft,
231. Lyth Troilus, biraft of ech wel-fare,
232. Y-bounden in the blake bark of care,
233. Disposed wood out of his wit to breyde,
234. So sore him sat the chaunginge of Criseyde.

235. He rist him up, and every dore he shette
236. And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man
237. Up-on his beddes syde a-doun him sette,
238. Ful lyk a deed image pale and wan;
239. And in his brest the heped wo bigan
240. Out-breste, and he to werken in this wyse
241. In his woodnesse, as I shal yow devyse.

242. Right as the wilde bole biginneth springe
243. Now here, now there, y-darted to the herte,
244. And of his deeth roreth in compleyninge,
245. Right so gan he aboute the chaumbre sterte,
246. Smyting his brest ay with his festes smerte;
247. His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde
248. Ful ofte he swapte, him-selven to confounde.

249. His eyen two, for pitee of his herte,
250. Out stremeden as swifte welles tweye;
251. The heighe sobbes of his sorwes smerte
252. His speche him refte, unnethes mighte he seye,
253. 'O deeth, allas! Why niltow do me deye?
254. A-cursed be the day which that nature
255. Shoop me to ben a lyves creature!'

256. But after, whan the furie and the rage
257. Which that his herte twiste and faste threste,
258. By lengthe of tyme somwhat gan asswage,
259. Up-on his bed he leyde him doun to reste;
260. But tho bigonne his teres more out-breste,
261. That wonder is, the body may suffyse
262. To half this wo, which that I yow devyse.

263. Than seyde he thus, 'Fortune! Allas the whyle!
264. What have I doon, what have I thus a-gilt?
265. How mightestow for reuthe me bigyle?
266. Is ther no grace, and shal I thus be spilt?
267. Shal thus Criseyde awey, for that thou wilt?
268. Allas! How maystow in thyn herte finde
269. To been to me thus cruel and unkinde?

270. 'Have I thee nought honoured al my lyve,
271. As thou wel wost, above the goddes alle?
272. Why wiltow me fro Ioye thus depryve?
273. O Troilus, what may men now thee calle
274. But wrecche of wrecches, out of honour falle
275. In-to miserie, in which I wol biwayle
276. Criseyde, allas! Til that the breeth me fayle?

277. 'Allas, Fortune! If that my lyf in Ioye
278. Displesed hadde un-to thy foule envye,
279. Why ne haddestow my fader, king of Troye,
280. By-raft the lyf, or doon my bretheren dye,
281. Or slayn my-self, that thus compleyne and crye,
282. I, combre-world, that may of no-thing serve,
283. But ever dye, and never fully sterve?

284. 'If that Criseyde allone were me laft,
285. Nought roughte I whider thou woldest me stere;
286. And hir, allas! Than hastow me biraft.
287. But ever-more, lo! This is thy manere,
288. To reve a wight that most is to him dere,
289. To preve in that thy gerful violence.
290. Thus am I lost, ther helpeth no defence!

291. 'O verray lord of love, O god, allas!
292. That knowest best myn herte and al my thought,
293. What shal my sorwful lyf don in this cas
294. If I for-go that I so dere have bought?
295. Sin ye Cryseyde and me han fully brought
296. In-to your grace, and bothe our hertes seled,
297. How may ye suffre, allas! It be repeled?

298. 'What I may doon, I shal, whyl I may dure
299. On lyve in torment and in cruel peyne,
300. This infortune or this disaventure,
301. Allone as I was born, y-wis, compleyne;
302. Ne never wil I seen it shyne or reyne;
303. But ende I wil, as Edippe, in derknesse
304. My sorwful lyf, and dyen in distresse.

305. 'O wery goost, that errest to and fro,
306. Why niltow fleen out of the wofulleste
307. Body, that ever mighte on grounde go?
308. O soule, lurkinge in this wo, unneste,
309. Flee forth out of myn herte, and lat it breste,
310. And folwe alwey Criseyde, thy lady dere;
311. Thy righte place is now no lenger here!

312. 'O wofulle eyen two, sin your disport
313. Was al to seen Criseydes eyen brighte,
314. What shal ye doon but, for my discomfort,
315. Stonden for nought, and wepen out your sighte?
316. Sin she is queynt, that wont was yow to lighte,

318. Y-formed, sin your vertue is a-weye.

319. 'O my Criseyde, O lady sovereyne
320. Of thilke woful soule that thus cryeth,

322. Allas, no wight; but when myn herte dyeth,

326. 'O ye loveres, that heighe upon the wheel
327. Ben set of Fortune, in good aventure,
328. God leve that ye finde ay love of steel,
329. And longe mot your lyf in Ioye endure!
330. But whan ye comen by my sepulture,
331. Remembreth that your felawe resteth there;
332. For I lovede eek, though I unworthy were.

333. 'O olde, unholsom, and mislyved man,
334. Calkas I mene, allas! What eyleth thee
335. To been a Greek, sin thou art born Troian?
336. O Calkas, which that wilt my bane be,
337. In cursed tyme was thou born for me!
338. As wolde blisful Iove, for his Ioye,
339. That I thee hadde, where I wolde, in Troye!'

340. A thousand sykes, hottere than the glede,

342. Medled with pleyntes newe, his wo to fede,
343. For which his woful teres never stente;
344. And shortly, so his peynes him to-rente,
345. And wex so mat, that Ioye nor penaunce

347. Pandare, which that in the parlement
348. Hadde herd what every lord and burgeys seyde,
349. And how ful graunted was, by oon assent,
350. For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde,
351. Gan wel neigh wood out of his wit to breyde,
352. So that, for wo, he niste what he mente;
353. But in a rees to Troilus he wente.

354. A certeyn knight, that for the tyme kepte
355. The chaumbre-dore, un-dide it him anoon;
356. And Pandare, that ful tendreliche wepte,
357. In-to the derke chaumbre, as stille as stoon,
358. Toward the bed gan softely to goon,
359. So confus, that he niste what to seye;
360. For verray wo his wit was neigh aweye.

361. And with his chere and loking al to-torn,
362. For sorwe of this, and with his armes folden,
363. He stood this woful Troilus biforn,
364. And on his pitous face he gan biholden;
365. But lord, so often gan his herte colden,
366. Seing his freend in wo, whos hevinesse

368. This woful wight, this Troilus, that felte

375. But at the laste this woful Troilus,
376. Ney deed for smert, gan bresten out to rore,
377. And with a sorwful noyse he seyde thus,
378. Among his sobbes and his sykes sore,
379. 'Lo! Pandare, I am deed, with-outen more.
380. Hastow nought herd at parlement,' he seyde,
381. 'For Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?'

382. This Pandarus, ful deed and pale of hewe,
383. Ful pitously answerde and seyde, 'Yis!
384. As wisly were it fals as it is trewe,
385. That I have herd, and wot al how it is.
386. O mercy, god, who wolde have trowed this?
387. Who wolde have wend that, in so litel a throwe,

389. 'For in this world ther is no creature,

392. But who may al eschewe, or al devyne?
393. Swich is this world; for-thy I thus defyne,

396. 'But tel me this, why thou art now so mad
397. To sorwen thus? Why lystow in this wyse,

400. But I, that never felte in my servyse

403. 'And over al this, as thou wel wost thy-selve,

430. Absence of hir shal dryve hir out of herte.'

431. Thise wordes seyde he for the nones alle,
432. To helpe his freend, lest he for sorwe deyde.
433. For douteles, to doon his wo to falle,
434. He roughte not what unthrift that he seyde.
435. But Troilus, that neigh for sorwe deyde,
436. Tok litel hede of al that ever he mente;
437. Oon ere it herde, at the other out it wente:

438. But at the laste answerde and seyde, 'Freend,
439. This lechecraft, or heled thus to be,
440. Were wel sitting, if that I were a feend,
441. To traysen hir that trewe is unto me!
442. I pray god, lat this consayl never y-thee;
443. But do me rather sterve anon-right here
444. Er I thus do as thou me woldest lere.

445. 'She that I serve, y-wis, what so thou seye,
446. To whom myn herte enhabit is by right,
447. Shal han me holly hires til that I deye.
448. For, Pandarus, sin I have trouthe hir hight,
449. I wol not been untrewe for no wight;
450. But as hir man I wol ay live and sterve,
451. And never other creature serve.

452. 'And ther thou seyst, thou shalt as faire finde
453. As she, lat be, make no comparisoun
454. To creature y-formed here by kinde.
455. O leve Pandare, in conclusioun,
456. I wol not be of thyn opinioun,
457. Touching al this; for whiche I thee biseche,
458. So hold thy pees; thou sleest me with thy speche.

459. 'Thow biddest me I sholde love an-other
460. Al freshly newe, and lat Criseyde go!
461. It lyth not in my power, leve brother.
462. And though I mighte, I wolde not do so.
463. But canstow pleyen raket, to and fro,
464. Netle in, dokke out, now this, now that, Pandare?
465. Now foule falle hir, for thy wo that care!

466. 'Thow farest eek by me, thou Pandarus,
467. As he, that whan a wight is wo bi-goon,
468. He cometh to him a pas, and seyth right thus,
469. "Thenk not on smert, and thou shalt fele noon."
470. Thou most me first transmuwen in a stoon,
471. And reve me my passiounes alle,
472. Er thou so lightly do my wo to falle.

473. 'The deeth may wel out of my brest departe
474. The lyf, so longe may this sorwe myne;
475. But fro my soule shal Criseydes darte
476. Out never-mo; but doun with Proserpyne,
477. Whan I am deed, I wol go wone in pyne;
478. And ther I wol eternaly compleyne
479. My wo, and how that twinned be we tweyne.

480. 'Thow hast here maad an argument, for fyn,
481. How that it sholde a lasse peyne be
482. Criseyde to for-goon, for she was myn,
483. And live in ese and in felicitee.
484. Why gabbestow, that seydest thus to me
485. That "him is wors that is fro wele y-throwe,
486. Than he hadde erst non of that wele y-knowe?"

487. 'But tel me now, sin that thee thinketh so light
488. To chaungen so in love, ay to and fro,
489. Why hastow not don bisily thy might
490. To chaungen hir that doth thee al thy wo?
491. Why niltow lete hir fro thyn herte go?
492. Why niltow love an-other lady swete,
493. That may thyn herte setten in quiete?

494. 'If thou hast had in love ay yet mischaunce,
495. And canst it not out of thyn herte dryve,
496. I, that livede in lust and in plesaunce
497. With hir as muche as creature on-lyve,
498. How sholde I that foryete, and that so blyve?
499. O where hastow ben hid so longe in muwe,
500. That canst so wel and formely arguwe?

501. 'Nay, nay, god wot, nought worth is al thy reed,
502. For which, for what that ever may bifalle,
503. With-outen wordes mo, I wol be deed.
504. O deeth, that endere art of sorwes alle,
505. Com now, sin I so ofte after thee calle,
506. For sely is that deeth, soth for to seyne,
507. That, ofte y-cleped, cometh and endeth peyne.

508. 'Wel wot I, whyl my lyf was in quiete,
509. Er thou me slowe, I wolde have yeven hyre;
510. But now thy cominge is to me so swete,
511. That in this world I no-thing so desyre.
512. O deeth, sin with this sorwe I am a-fyre,
513. Thou outher do me anoon yn teres drenche,
514. Or with thy colde strook myn hete quenche!

515. 'Sin that thou sleest so fele in sondry wyse
516. Ayens hir wil, unpreyed, day and night,
517. Do me, at my requeste, this servyse,
518. Delivere now the world, so dostow right,
519. Of me, that am the wofulleste wight
520. That ever was; for tyme is that I sterve,
521. Sin in this world of right nought may I serve.'

522. This Troilus in teres gan distille,
523. As licour out of alambyk ful faste;
524. And Pandarus gan holde his tunge stille,
525. And to the ground his eyen doun he caste.
526. But nathelees, thus thoughte he at the laste,
527. 'What, parde, rather than my felawe deye,
528. Yet shal I som-what more un-to him seye:'

529. And seyde, 'Freend, sin thou hast swich distresse,
530. And sin thee list myn arguments to blame,
531. Why nilt thy-selven helpen doon redresse,
532. And with thy manhod letten al this grame?
533. Go ravisshe hir ne canstow not for shame!
534. And outher lat hir out of toune fare,
535. Or hold hir stille, and leve thy nyce fare.

536. 'Artow in Troye, and hast non hardiment
537. To take a womman which that loveth thee,
538. And wolde hir-selven been of thyn assent?
539. Now is not this a nyce vanitee?
540. Rys up anoon, and lat this weping be,
541. And kyth thou art a man, for in this houre
542. I wil be deed, or she shal bleven oure.'

543. To this answerde him Troilus ful softe,
544. And seyde, 'Parde, leve brother dere,
545. Al this have I my-self yet thought ful ofte,
546. And more thing than thou devysest here.
547. But why this thing is laft, thou shalt wel here;
548. And whan thou me hast yeve an audience,
549. Ther-after mayst thou telle al thy sentence.

550. 'First, sin thou wost this toun hath al this werre
551. For ravisshing of wommen so by might,
552. It sholde not be suffred me to erre,
553. As it stant now, ne doon so gret unright.
554. I sholde han also blame of every wight,
555. My fadres graunt if that I so withstode,
556. Sin she is chaunged for the tounes goode.

557. 'I have eek thought, so it were hir assent,
558. To aske hir at my fader, of his grace;
559. Than thenke I, this were hir accusement,
560. Sin wel I woot I may hir not purchace.
561. For sin my fader, in so heigh a place
562. As parlement, hath hir eschaunge enseled,
563. He nil for me his lettre be repeled.

564. 'Yet drede I most hir herte to pertourbe
565. With violence, if I do swich a game;
566. For if I wolde it openly distourbe,
567. It moste been disclaundre to hir name.
568. And me were lever deed than hir defame,
569. As nolde god but-if I sholde have
570. Hir honour lever than my lyf to save!

571. 'Thus am I lost, for ought that I can see;
572. For certeyn is, sin that I am hir knight,
573. I moste hir honour levere han than me
574. In every cas, as lovere oughte of right.
575. Thus am I with desyr and reson twight;
576. Desyr for to destourben hir me redeth,
577. And reson nil not, so myn herte dredeth.'

578. Thus wepinge that he coude never cesse,
579. He seyde, 'Allas! How shal I, wrecche, fare?
580. For wel fele I alwey my love encresse,
581. And hope is lasse and lasse alwey, Pandare!
582. Encressen eek the causes of my care;
583. So wel-a-wey, why nil myn herte breste?
584. For, as in love, ther is but litel reste.'

585. Pandare answerde, 'Freend, thou mayst, for me,
586. Don as thee list; but hadde ich it so hote,
587. And thyn estat, she sholde go with me;
588. Though al this toun cryede on this thing by note,
589. I nolde sette at al that noyse a grote.
590. For when men han wel cryed, than wol they roune;
591. A wonder last but nyne night never in toune.

592. 'Devyne not in reson ay so depe
593. Ne curteysly, but help thy-self anoon;
594. Bet is that othere than thy-selven wepe,
595. And namely, sin ye two been al oon.
596. Rys up, for by myn heed, she shal not goon;
597. And rather be in blame a lyte y-founde
598. Than sterve here as a gnat, with-oute wounde.

599. 'It is no shame un-to yow, ne no vyce
600. Hir to with-holden, that ye loveth most.
601. Paraunter, she mighte holden thee for nyce
602. To lete hir go thus to the Grekes ost.
603. Thenk eek Fortune, as wel thy-selven wost,
604. Helpeth hardy man to his enpryse,
605. And weyveth wrecches, for hir cowardyse.

606. 'And though thy lady wolde a litel hir greve,
607. Thou shalt thy pees ful wel here-after make,
608. But as for me, certayn, I can not leve
609. That she wolde it as now for yvel take.
610. Why sholde than for ferd thyn herte quake?
611. Thenk eek how Paris hath, that is thy brother,
612. A love; and why shaltow not have another?

613. 'And Troilus, o thing I dar thee swere,
614. That if Criseyde, whiche that is thy leef,
615. Now loveth thee as wel as thou dost here,
616. God helpe me so, she nil nat take a-greef,
617. Though thou do bote a-noon in this mischeef.
618. And if she wilneth fro thee for to passe,
619. Thanne is she fals; so love hir wel the lasse.

620. 'For-thy tak herte, and thenk, right as a knight,
621. Thourgh love is broken alday every lawe.
622. Kyth now sumwhat thy corage and thy might,
623. Have mercy on thy-self, for any awe.
624. Lat not this wrecched wo thin herte gnawe,
625. But manly set the world on sixe and sevene;
626. And, if thou deye a martir, go to hevene.

627. 'I wol my-self be with thee at this dede,
628. Though ich and al my kin, up-on a stounde,
629. Shulle in a strete as dogges liggen dede,
630. Thourgh-girt with many a wyd and blody wounde.
631. In every cas I wol a freend be founde.
632. And if thee list here sterven as a wrecche,
633. A-dieu, the devel spede him that it recche!'

634. This Troilus gan with tho wordes quiken,
635. And seyde, 'Freend, graunt mercy, ich assente;
636. But certaynly thou mayst not me so priken,
637. Ne peyne noon ne may me so tormente,
638. That, for no cas, it is not myn entente,
639. At shorte wordes, though I dyen sholde,
640. To ravisshe hir, but-if hir-self it wolde.'

641. 'Why, so mene I,' quod Pandarus, 'al this day.
642. But tel me than, hastow hir wil assayed,
643. That sorwest thus?' And he answerde, 'Nay.'
644. 'Wher-of artow,' quod Pandare, 'than a-mayed,
645. That nost not that she wol ben y-vel apayed
646. To ravisshe hir, sin thou hast not ben there,
647. But-if that Iove tolde it in thyn ere?

648. 'For-thy rys up, as nought ne were, anoon,
649. And wash thy face, and to the king thou wende,
650. Or he may wondren whider thou art goon.
651. Thou most with wisdom him and othere blende;
652. Or, up-on cas, he may after thee sende
653. Er thou be war; and shortly, brother dere,
654. Be glad, and lat me werke in this matere.

655. 'For I shal shape it so, that sikerly
656. Thou shalt this night som tyme, in som manere,
657. Com speke with thy lady prevely,
658. And by hir wordes eek, and by hir chere,
659. Thou shalt ful sone aperceyve and wel here
660. Al hir entente, and in this cas the beste;
661. And fare now wel, for in this point I reste.'

662. The swifte Fame, whiche that false thinges
663. Egal reporteth lyk the thinges trewe,
664. Was thorugh-out Troye y-fled with preste winges
665. Fro man to man, and made this tale al newe,
666. How Calkas doughter, with hir brighte hewe,
667. At parlement, with-oute wordes more,
668. I-graunted was in chaunge of Antenore.

669. The whiche tale anoon-right as Criseyde
670. Had herd, she, which that of hir fader roughte,
671. As in this cas, right nought, ne whanne he deyde,
672. Ful bisily to Iuppiter bisoughte
673. Yeve hem mischaunce that this tretis broughte.
674. But shortly, lest thise tales sothe were,
675. She dorste at no wight asken it, for fere.

676. As she that hadde hir herte and al hir minde
677. On Troilus y-set so wonder faste,
678. That al this world ne mighte hir love unbinde,
679. Ne Troilus out of hir herte caste;
680. She wol ben his, whyl that hir lyf may laste.
681. And thus she brenneth bothe in love and drede,
682. So that she niste what was best to rede.

683. But as men seen in toune, and al aboute,
684. That wommen usen frendes to visyte,
685. So to Criseyde of wommen com a route
686. For pitous Ioye, and wenden hir delyte;
687. And with hir tales, dere y-nough a myte,
688. These wommen, whiche that in the cite dwelle,
689. They sette hem doun, and seyde as I shal telle.

690. Quod first that oon, 'I am glad, trewely,
691. By-cause of yow, that shal your fader see.'
692. A-nother seyde, 'Y-wis, so nam not I,
693. For al to litel hath she with us be.'
694. Quod tho the thridde, 'I hope, y-wis, that she
695. Shal bringen us the pees on every syde,
696. That, whan she gooth, almighty god hir gyde!'

697. Tho wordes and tho wommanisshe thinges,
698. She herde hem right as though she thennes were;
699. For, god it wot, hir herte on other thing is,
700. Although the body sat among hem there.
701. Hir advertence is alwey elles-where;
702. For Troilus ful faste hir soule soughte;
703. With-outen word, alwey on him she thoughte.

704. Thise wommen, that thus wenden hir to plese,
705. Aboute nought gonne alle hir tales spende;
706. Swich vanitee ne can don hir non ese,
707. As she that, al this mene whyle. brende
708. Of other passioun than that they wende,
709. So that she felte almost hir herte deye
710. For wo, and wery of that companye.

711. For which no lenger mighte she restreyne
712. Hir teres, so they gonnen up to welle,
713. That yaven signes of the bitter peyne
714. In whiche hir spirit was, and moste dwelle;
715. Remembring hir, fro heven unto which helle
716. She fallen was, sith she forgoth the sighte
717. Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte.

718. And thilke foles sittinge hir aboute
719. Wenden, that she wepte and syked sore
720. By-cause that she sholde out of that route
721. Departe, and never pleye with hem more.
722. And they that hadde y-knowen hir of yore
723. Seye hir so wepe, and thoughte it kindenesse,
724. And eche of hem wepte eek for hir destresse;

725. And bisily they gonnen hir conforten
726. Of thing, god wot, on which she litel thoughte;
727. And with hir tales wenden hir disporten,
728. And to be glad they often hir bisoughte.
729. But swich an ese ther-with they hir wroughte
730. Right as a man is esed for to fele,
731. For ache of heed, to clawen him on his hele!

732. But after al this nyce vanitee
733. They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle.
734. Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee,
735. In-to hir chaumbre up wente out of the halle,
736. And on hir bed she gan for deed to falle,
737. In purpos never thennes for to ryse;
738. And thus she wroughte, as I shal yow devyse.

739. Hir ounded heer, that sonnish was of hewe,
740. She rente, and eek hir fingres longe and smale
741. She wrong ful ofte, and bad god on hir rewe,
742. And with the deeth to doon bote on hir bale.
743. Hir hewe, whylom bright, that tho was pale,
744. Bar witnes of hir wo and hir constreynte;
745. And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hir compleynte:

746. 'Alas!' quod she, 'out of this regioun
747. I, woful wrecche and infortuned wight,
748. And born in corsed constellacioun,
749. Mot goon, and thus departen fro my knight;
750. Wo worth, allas! That ilke dayes light
751. On which I saw him first with eyen tweyne,
752. That causeth me, and I him, al this peyne!'

753. Therwith the teres from hir eyen two
754. Doun fille, as shour in Aperill ful swythe;
755. Hir whyte brest she bet, and for the wo
756. After the deeth she cryed a thousand sythe,
757. Sin he that wont hir wo was for to lythe,
758. She mot for-goon; for which disaventure
759. She held hir-self a forlost creature.

760. She seyde, 'How shal he doon, and I also?
761. How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne?
762. O dere herte eek, that I love so,
763. Who shal that sorwe sleen that ye ben inne?
764. O Calkas, fader, thyn be al this sinne!
765. O moder myn, that cleped were Argyve,
766. Wo worth that day that thou me bere on lyve!

767. 'To what fyn sholde I live and sorwen thus?
768. How sholde a fish with-oute water dure?
769. What is Criseyde worth, from Troilus?
770. How sholde a plaunte or lyves creature
771. Live, with-oute his kinde noriture?
772. For which ful oft a by-word here I seye,
773. That "rotelees, mot grene sone deye."

774. 'I shal don thus, sin neither swerd ne darte
775. Dar I non handle, for the crueltee,
776. That ilke day that I from yow departe,
777. If sorwe of that nil not my bane be,
778. Than shal no mete or drinke come in me
779. Til I my soule out of my breste unshethe;
780. And thus my-selven wol I do to dethe.

781. 'And, Troilus, my clothes everichoon
782. Shul blake been, in tokeninge, herte swete,
783. That I am as out of this world agoon,
784. That wont was yow to setten in quiete;
785. And of myn ordre, ay til deeth me mete,
786. The observaunce ever, in your absence,
787. Shal sorwe been, compleynte, and abstinence.

788. 'Myn herte and eek the woful goost ther-inne
789. Biquethe I, with your spirit to compleyne
790. Eternally, for they shal never twinne.
791. For though in erthe y-twinned be we tweyne,
792. Yet in the feld of pitee, out of peyne,
793. That hight Elysos, shul we been y-fere,
794. As Orpheus and Erudice, his fere.

795. 'Thus, herte myn, for Antenor, allas!
796. I sone shal be chaunged, as I wene.
797. But how shul ye don in this sorwful cas,
798. How shal youre tendre herte this sustene?
799. But herte myn, for-yet this sorwe and tene,
800. And me also; for, soothly for to seye,
801. So ye wel fare, I recche not to deye.'

802. How mighte it ever y-red ben or y-songe,
803. The pleynte that she made in hir distresse?
804. I noot; but, as for me, my litel tonge,
805. If I discreven wolde hir hevinesse,
806. It sholde make hir sorwe seme lesse
807. Than that it was, and childishly deface
808. Hir heigh compleynte, and therfore I it pace.

809. Pandare, which that sent from Troilus
810. Was to Criseyde, as ye han herd devyse,
811. That for the beste it was accorded thus,
812. And he ful glad to doon him that servyse,
813. Un-to Criseyde, in a ful secree wyse,
814. Ther-as she lay in torment and in rage,
815. Com hir to telle al hoolly his message,

816. And fond that she hir-selven gan to trete
817. Ful pitously; for with hir salte teres
818. Hir brest, hir face, y-bathed was ful wete;
819. The mighty tresses of hir sonnish heres,
820. Unbroyden, hangen al aboute hir eres;
821. Which yaf him verray signal of martyre
822. Of deeth, which that hir herte gan desyre.

823. Whan she him saw, she gan for sorwe anoon
824. Hir tery face a-twixe hir armes hide,
825. For which this Pandare is so wo bi-goon,
826. That in the hous he mighte unnethe abyde,
827. As he that pitee felte on every syde.
828. For if Criseyde hadde erst compleyned sore,
829. Tho gan she pleyne a thousand tymes more.

830. And in hir aspre pleynte than she seyde,
831. 'Pandare first of Ioyes mo than two

849. I trowe, y-wis, from hevene teres reyne,
850. For pitee of myn aspre and cruel peyne!    '

851. 'And thou, my suster, ful of discomfort,'
852. Quod Pandarus, 'what thenkestow to do?
853. Why ne hastow to thy-selven som resport,
854. Why woltow thus thy-selve, allas, for-do?
855. Leef al this werk and tak now hede to
856. That I shal seyn, and herkne, of good entente,
857. This, which by me thy Troilus thee sente.'

858. Torned hir tho Criseyde, a wo makinge
859. So greet that it a deeth was for to see: --
860. 'Allas!' quod she, 'what wordes may ye bringe?
861. What wol my dere herte seyn to me,
862. Which that I drede never-mo to see?
863. Wol he have pleynte or teres, er I wende?
864. I have y-nowe, if he ther-after sende!'

865. She was right swich to seen in hir visage
866. As is that wight that men on bere binde;
867. Hir face, lyk of Paradys the image,
868. Was al y-chaunged in another kinde.
869. The pleye, the laughtre men was wont to finde
870. On hir, and eek hir Ioyes everychone,
871. Ben fled, and thus lyth now Criseyde allone.

872. Aboute hir eyen two a purpre ring
873. Bi-trent, in sothfast tokninge of hir peyne,
874. That to biholde it was a dedly thing,
875. For which Pandare mighte not restreyne
876. The teres from his eyen for to reyne.
877. But nathelees, as he best mighte, he seyde
878. From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde.

879. 'Lo, nece, I trowe ye han herd al how
880. The king, with othere lordes, for the beste,
881. Hath mad eschaunge of Antenor and yow,
882. That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste.
883. But how this cas doth Troilus moleste,
884. That may non erthely mannes tonge seye;
885. For verray wo his wit is al aweye.

886. 'For which we han so sorwed, he and I,
887. That in-to litel bothe it hadde us slawe;
888. But thurgh my conseil this day, fynally,
889. He somwhat is fro weping now with-drawe.
890. And semeth me that he desyreth fawe
891. With yow to been al night, for to devyse
892. Remede in this, if ther were any wyse.

893. 'This, short and pleyne, theffect of my message,
894. As ferforth as my wit can comprehende.
895. For ye, that been of torment in swich rage,
896. May to no long prologe as now entende;
897. And her-upon ye may answere him sende.
898. And, for the love of god, my nece dere,
899. So leef this wo er Troilus be here.'

900. 'Gret is my wo,' quod she, and sighte sore,
901. As she that feleth dedly sharp distresse;
902. 'But yet to me his sorwe is muchel more,
903. That love him bet than he him-self, I gesse.
904. Allas! For me hath he swich hevinesse?
905. Can he for me so pitously compleyne?
906. Y-wis, his sorwe doubleth al my peyne.

907. 'Grevous to me, god wot, is for to twinne,'
908. Quod she, 'but yet it hardere is to me
909. To seen that sorwe which that he is inne;
910. For wel wot I, it wol my bane be;
911. And deye I wol in certayn,' tho quod she;
912. 'But bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me threteth,
913. Dryve out that goost which in myn herte beteth.'

914. Thise wordes seyd, she on hir armes two
915. Fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitously.
916. Quod Pandarus, 'Allas! Why do ye so,
917. Syn wel ye woot the tyme is faste by,
918. That he shal come? Arys up hastely,
919. That he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde,
920. But ye wol have him wood out of his minde!

921. 'For wiste he that ye ferde in this manere,
922. He wolde him-selve slee; and if I wende
923. To han this fare, he sholde not come here
924. For al the good that Pryam may despende.
925. For to what fyn he wolde anoon pretende,
926. That knowe I wel; and for-thy yet I seye,
927. So leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deye.

928. 'And shapeth yow his sorwe for to abregge,
929. And nought encresse, leve nece swete;
930. Beth rather to him cause of flat than egge,
931. And with som wysdom ye his sorwes bete.
932. What helpeth it to wepen ful a strete,
933. Or though ye bothe in salte teres dreynte?
934. Bet is a tyme of cure ay than of pleynte.

935. 'I mene thus; whan I him hider bringe,
936. Sin ye ben wyse, and bothe of oon assent,
937. So shapeth how distourbe your goinge,
938. Or come ayen, sone after ye be went.
939. Wommen ben wyse in short avysement;
940. And lat sen how your wit shal now avayle;
941. And what that I may helpe, it shal not fayle.'

942. 'Go,' quod Criseyde, 'and uncle, trewely,
943. I shal don al my might, me to restreyne
944. From weping in his sighte, and bisily,
945. Him for to glade, I shal don al my peyne,
946. And in myn herte seken every veyne;
947. If to this soor ther may be founden salve,
948. It shal not lakken, certain, on myn halve.'

949. Goth Pandarus, and Troilus he soughte,
950. Til in a temple he fond him allone,
951. As he that of his lyf no lenger roughte;
952. But to the pitouse goddes everichone
953. Ful tendrely he preyde, and made his mone,
954. To doon him sone out of this world to pace;
955. For wel he thoughte ther was non other grace.

956. And shortly, al the sothe for to seye,
957. He was so fallen in despeyr that day,
958. That outrely he shoop him for to deye.
959. For right thus was his argument alwey:
960. He seyde, he nas but loren, waylawey!
961. 'For al that comth, comth by necessitee;
962. Thus to be lorn, it is my destinee.

963. 'For certaynly, this wot I wel,' he seyde,
964. 'That for-sight of divyne purveyaunce
965. Hath seyn alwey me to for-gon Criseyde,
966. Sin god seeth every thing, out of doutaunce,
967. And hem disponeth, thourgh his ordenaunce,
968. In hir merytes sothly for to be,
969. As they shul comen by predestinee.

970. 'But nathelees, allas! Whom shal I leve?
971. For ther ben grete clerkes many oon,
972. That destinee thorugh argumentes preve;
973. And som men seyn that nedely ther is noon;
974. But that free chois is yeven us everichoon.
975. O, welaway! So sleye arn clerkes olde,
976. That I not whos opinion I may holde.

977. 'For som men seyn, if god seth al biforn,
978. Ne god may not deceyved ben, pardee,
979. Than moot it fallen, though men hadde it sworn,
980. That purveyaunce hath seyn bifore to be.
981. Wherfor I seye, that from eterne if he
982. Hath wist biforn our thought eek as our dede,
983. We have no free chois, as these clerkes rede.

984. 'For other thought nor other dede also
985. Might never be, but swich as purveyaunce,
986. Which may not ben deceyved never-mo,
987. Hath feled biforn, with-outen ignoraunce.
988. For if ther mighte been a variaunce
989. To wrythen out fro goddes purveyinge,
990. Ther nere no prescience of thing cominge;

991. 'But it were rather an opinioun
992. Uncerteyn, and no stedfast forseinge;
993. And certes, that were an abusioun,
994. That god shuld han no parfit cleer witinge
995. More than we men that han doutous weninge.
996. But swich an errour up-on god to gesse
997. Were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse.

998. 'Eek this is an opinioun of somme
999. That han hir top ful heighe and smothe y-shore;
1000. They seyn right thus, that thing is not to come
1001. For that the prescience hath seyn bifore
1002. That it shal come; but they seyn that therfore
1003. That it shal come, therfore the purveyaunce
1004. Wot it biforn with-outen ignoraunce;

1005. 'And in this manere this necessitee
1006. Retorneth in his part contrarie agayn.
1007. For needfully bihoveth it not to be
1008. That thilke thinges fallen in certayn
1009. That ben purveyed; but nedely, as they seyn,
1010. Bihoveth it that thinges, whiche that falle,
1011. That they in certayn ben purveyed alle.

1012. 'I mene as though I laboured me in this,
1013. To enqueren which thing cause of which thing be;
1014. As whether that the prescience of god is
1015. The certayn cause of the necessitee
1016. Of thinges that to comen been, pardee;
1017. Or if necessitee of thing cominge
1018. Be cause certeyn of the purveyinge.

1019. 'But now ne enforce I me nat in shewinge
1020. How the ordre of causes stant; but wel wot I,
1021. That it bihoveth that the bifallinge
1022. Of thinges wist biforen certeynly
1023. Be necessarie, al seme it not ther-by
1024. That prescience put falling necessaire
1025. To thing to come, al falle it foule or faire.

1026. 'For if ther sit a man yond on a see,
1027. Than by necessitee bihoveth it
1028. That, certes, thyn opinioun soth be,
1029. That wenest or coniectest that he sit;
1030. And ferther-over now ayenward yit,
1031. Lo, right so it is of the part contrarie,
1032. As thus; (now herkne, for I wol not tarie):

1033. 'I seye, that if the opinioun of thee
1034. Be sooth, for that he sit, than seye I this,
1035. That he mot sitten by necessitee;
1036. And thus necessitee in either is.
1037. For in him nede of sittinge is, y-wis,
1038. And in thee nede of sooth; and thus, forsothe,
1039. Ther moot necessitee ben in yow bothe.

1040. 'But thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore,
1041. That thyn opinioun of sitting soth is;
1042. But rather, for the man sit ther bifore,
1043. Therfore is thyn opinioun sooth, y-wis.
1044. And I seye, though the cause of sooth of this
1045. Comth of his sitting, yet necessitee
1046. Is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee.

1047. 'Thus on this same wyse, out of doutaunce,
1048. I may wel maken, as it semeth me,
1049. My resoninge of goddes purveyaunce,
1050. And of the thinges that to comen be;
1051. By whiche reson men may wel y-see,
1052. That thilke thinges that in erthe falle,
1053. That by necessitee they comen alle.

1054. 'For al-though that, for thing shal come, y-wis,
1055. Therfore is it purveyed, certaynly,
1056. Nat that it comth for it purveyed is:
1057. Yet nathelees, bihoveth it nedfully,
1058. That thing to come be purveyed, trewely;
1059. Or elles, thinges that purveyed be,
1060. That they bityden by necessitee.

1061. 'And this suffyseth right y-now, certeyn,
1062. For to destroye our free chois every del. --
1063. But now is this abusion, to seyn,
1064. That fallinge of the thinges temporel
1065. Is cause of goddes prescience eternel.
1066. Now trewely, that is a fals sentence,
1067. That thing to come sholde cause his prescience.

1068. 'What mighte I wene, and I hadde swich a thought,
1069. But that god purveyth thing that is to come
1070. For that it is to come, and elles nought?
1071. So mighte I wene that thinges alle and some,
1072. That whylom been bifalle and over-come,
1073. Ben cause of thilke sovereyn purveyaunce,
1074. That for-wot al with-outen ignoraunce.

1075. 'And over al this, yet seye I more herto,
1076. That right as whan I woot ther is a thing,
1077. Y-wis, that thing mot nedefully be so;
1078. Eek right so, whan I woot a thing coming,
1079. So mot it come; and thus the bifalling
1080. Of thinges that ben wist bifore the tyde,
1081. They mowe not been eschewed on no syde.'

1082. Than seyde he thus, 'Almighty Iove in trone,
1083. That wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse,
1084. Rewe on my sorwe, or do me deye sone,
1085. Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.'
1086. And whyl he was in al this hevinesse,
1087. Disputinge with him-self in this matere,
1088. Com Pandare in, and seyde as ye may here.

1089. 'O mighty god,' quod Pandarus, 'in trone,
1090. Ey! Who seigh ever a wys man faren so?
1091. Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done?
1092. Hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo?
1093. What, parde, yet is not Criseyde a-go!
1094. Why list thee so thy-self for-doon for drede,
1095. That in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede?

1096. 'Hastow not lived many a yeer biforn
1097. With-outen hir, and ferd ful wel at ese?
1098. Artow for hir and for non other born?
1099. Hath kinde thee wroughte al-only hir to plese?
1100. Lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese.
1101. That, in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces,
1102. Right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces.

1103. 'And yet this is a wonder most of alle,
1104. Why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit,
1105. Touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle,
1106. Ne if she can hir-self distorben it.
1107. Thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit.
1108. A man may al by tyme his nekke bede
1109. Whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede.

1110. 'For-thy take hede of that that I shal seye;
1111. I have with hir y-spoke and longe y-be,
1112. So as accorded was bitwixe us tweye.
1113. And ever-mor me thinketh thus, that she
1114. Hath som-what in hir hertes prevetee,
1115. Wher-with she can, if I shal right arede,
1116. Distorbe al this, of which thou art in drede.

1117. 'For which my counseil is, whan it is night,
1118. Thou to hir go, and make of this an ende;
1119. And blisful Iuno, thourgh hir grete mighte,
1120. Shal, as I hope, hir grace un-to us sende.
1121. Myn herte seyth, "Certeyn, she shal not wende;"
1122. And for-thy put thyn herte a whyle in reste;
1123. And hold this purpos, for it is the beste.'

1124. This Troilus answerde, and sighte sore,
1125. 'Thou seyst right wel, and I wil do right so;'
1126. And what him liste, he seyde un-to it more.
1127. And whan that it was tyme for to go,
1128. Ful prevely him-self, with-outen mo,
1129. Un-to hir com, as he was wont to done;
1130. And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone.

1131. Soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete,
1132. So gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste,
1133. That neither of hem other mighte grete,
1134. But hem in armes toke and after kiste.
1135. The lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste
1136. Wher that he was, ne mighte o word out-bringe,
1137. As I seyde erst, for wo and for sobbinge.

1138. Tho woful teres that they leten falle
1139. As bittre weren, out of teres kinde,
1140. For peyne, as is ligne aloes or galle.
1141. So bittre teres weep nought, as I finde,
1142. The woful Myrra through the bark and rinde.
1143. That in this world ther nis so hard an herte,
1144. That nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte.

1145. But whan hir woful wery gostes tweyne
1146. Retorned been ther-as hem oughte dwelle,
1147. And that som-what to wayken gan the peyne
1148. By lengthe of pleynte, and ebben gan the welle
1149. Of hire teres, and the herte unswelle,
1150. With broken voys, al hoors for-shright, Criseyde
1151. To Troilus thise ilke wordes seyde:

1152. 'O Iove, I deye, and mercy I beseche!
1153. Help, Troilus!' And ther-with-al hir face
1154. Upon his brest she leyde, and loste speche;
1155. Hir woful spirit from his propre place,
1156. Right with the word, alwey up poynt to pace.
1157. And thus she lyth with hewes pale and grene,
1158. That whylom fresh and fairest was to sene.

1159. This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde,
1160. Clepinge hir name, (and she lay as for deed,
1161. With-oute answere, and felte hir limes colde,
1162. Hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed),
1163. This sorwful man can now noon other reed,
1164. But ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste;
1165. Wher him was wo, god and him-self it wiste!

1166. He rist him up, and long streight he hir leyde;
1167. For signe of lyf, for ought he can or may,
1168. Can he noon finde in no-thing on Criseyde,
1169. For which his song ful ofte is 'weylaway!'
1170. But whan he saugh that specheles she lay,
1171. With sorwful voys and herte of blisse al bare,
1172. He seyde how she was fro this world y-fare!

1173. So after that he longe hadde hir compleyned,
1174. His hondes wrong, and seyde that was to seye,
1175. And with his teres salte hir brest bireyned,
1176. He gan tho teris wypen of ful dreye,
1177. And pitously gan for the soule preye,
1178. And seyde, 'O lord, that set art in thy trone,
1179. Rewe eek on me, for I shal folwe hir sone!'

1180. She cold was and with-outen sentement,
1181. For aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon;
1182. And this was him a preignant argument
1183. That she was forth out of this world agoon;
1184. And whan he seigh ther was non other woon,
1185. He gan hir limes dresse in swich manere
1186. As men don hem that shul be leyd on bere.

1187. And after this, with sterne and cruel herte,
1188. His swerd a-noon out of his shethe he twighte,
1189. Him-self to sleen, how sore that him smerte,
1190. So that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte,
1191. Ther-as the doom of Mynos wolde it dighte;
1192. Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde,
1193. That in this world he lenger liven sholde.

1194. Thanne seyde he thus, fulfild of heigh desdayn,
1195. 'O cruel Iove, and thou, Fortune adverse,
1196. This al and som, that falsly have ye slayn
1197. Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse,
1198. Fy on your might and werkes so diverse!
1199. Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne;
1200. Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne.

1201. 'For I this world, sin ye han slayn hir thus,
1202. Wol lete, and folowe hir spirit lowe or hye;
1203. Shal never lover seyn that Troilus
1204. Dar not, for fere, with his lady dye;
1205. For certeyn, I wol bere hir companye.
1206. But sin ye wol not suffre us liven here,
1207. Yet suffreth that our soules ben y-fere.

1208. 'And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo,
1209. And thou, Pryam, and bretheren al y-fere,
1210. And thou, my moder, farwel! For I go;
1211. And Attropos, make redy thou my bere!
1212. And thou, Criseyde, o swete herte dere,
1213. Receyve now my spirit!' wolde he seye,
1214. With swerd at herte, al redy for to deye

1215. But as god wolde, of swough ther-with she abreyde,
1216. And gan to syke, and 'Troilus' she cryde;
1217. And he answerde, 'Lady myn Criseyde,
1218. Live ye yet?' and leet his swerd doun glyde.
1219. 'Ye, herte myn, that thanked be Cupyde!'
1220. Quod she, and ther-with-al she sore sighte;
1221. And he bigan to glade hir as he mighte;

1222. Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte,
1223. And hir to glade he dide al his entente;
1224. For which hir goost, that flikered ay on-lofte,
1225. In-to hir woful herte ayein it wente.
1226. But at the laste, as that hir eyen glente
1227. A-syde, anoon she gan his swerd aspye,
1228. As it lay bare, and gan for fere crye,

1229. And asked him, why he it hadde out-drawe?
1230. And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde,
1231. And how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe.
1232. For which Criseyde up-on him gan biholde,
1233. And gan him in hir armes faste folde,
1234. And seyde, 'O mercy, god, lo, which a dede!
1235. Allas! How neigh we were bothe dede!

1236. 'Thanne if I ne hadde spoken, as grace was,
1237. Ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?' quod she.
1238. 'Ye, douteless;' and she answerde, 'Allas!
1239. For, by that ilke lord that made me,
1240. I nolde a forlong wey on-lyve han be,
1241. After your deeth, to han been crouned quene
1242. Of al the lond the sonne on shyneth shene.

1243. 'But with this selve swerd, which that here is,
1244. My-selve I wolde han slayn!' -- quod she tho;
1245. 'But ho, for we han right y-now of this,
1246. And late us ryse and streight to bedde go
1247. And there lat ys speken of oure wo.
1248. For, by the morter which that I see brenne,
1249. Knowe I ful wel that day is not fer henne.'

1250. Whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde,
1251. Nought was it lyk tho nightes here-biforn;
1252. For pitously ech other gan biholde,
1253. As they that hadden al hir blisse y-lorn,
1254. Biwaylinge ay the day that they were born.
1255. Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde
1256. To Troilus these ilke wordes seyde: --

1257. 'Lo, herte myn, wel wot ye this,' quod she,
1258. 'That if a wight alwey his wo compleyne,
1259. And seketh nought how holpen for to be,
1260. It nis but folye and encrees of peyne;
1261. And sin that here assembled be we tweyne
1262. To finde bote of wo that we ben inne,
1263. It were al tyme sone to biginne.

1264. 'I am a womman, as ful wel ye woot,
1265. And as I am avysed sodeynly,
1266. So wol I telle yow, whyl it is hoot.
1267. Me thinketh thus, that nouther ye nor I

1269. For there is art y-now for to redresse
1270. That yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse.

1271. 'Sooth is, the wo, the whiche that we ben inne,
1272. For ought I woot, for no-thing elles is
1273. But for the cause that we sholden twinne.
1274. Considered al, ther nis no-more amis.
1275. But what is thanne a remede un-to this,
1276. But that we shape us sone for to mete?
1277. This al and som, my dere herte swete.

1278. 'Now that I shal wel bringen it aboute
1279. To come ayein, sone after that I go,
1280. Ther-of am I no maner thing in doute.
1281. For dredeles, with-inne a wouke or two,
1282. I shal ben here; and, that it may be so
1283. By alle right, and in a wordes fewe,
1284. I shal yow wel an heep of weyes shewe.

1285. 'For which I wol not make long sermoun,
1286. For tyme y-lost may not recovered be;
1287. But I wol gon to my conclusioun,
1288. And to the beste, in ought that I can see.
1289. And, for the love of god, for-yeve it me
1290. If I speke ought ayein your hertes reste;
1291. For trewely, I speke it for the beste;

1299. 'Now herkneth this, ye han wel understonde,
1300. My goinge graunted is by parlement
1301. So ferforth, that it may not be with-stonde
1302. For al this world, as by my Iugement.
1303. And sin ther helpeth noon avysement
1304. To letten it, lat it passe out of minde;
1305. And lat us shape a bettre wey to finde.

1306. 'The sothe is, that the twinninge of us tweyne
1307. Wol us disese and cruelliche anoye.
1308. But him bihoveth som-tyme han a peyne,

1310. And sin I shal no ferthere out of Troye

1322. And whanne, allas? By god, lo, right anoon,
1323. Er dayes ten, this dar I saufly seyn.
1324. And thanne at erste shul we been so fayn,
1325. So as we shulle to-gederes ever dwelle,
1326. That al this world ne mighte our blisse telle.

1327. 'I see that ofte, ther-as we ben now,
1328. That for the beste, our counseil for to hyde,
1329. Ye speke not with me, nor I with yow

1331. May ye not ten dayes thanne abyde,
1332. For myn honour, in swich an aventure?
1333. Y-wis, ye mowen elles lite endure!

1334. 'Ye knowe eek how that al my kin is here,

1341. 'Why trowe ye my fader in this wyse
1342. Coveiteth so to see me, but for drede
1343. Lest in this toun that folkes me dispyse
1344. By-cause of him, for his unhappy dede?
1345. What woot my fader what lyf that I lede?
1346. For if he wiste in Troye how wel I fare,
1347. Us neded for my wending nought to care.

1348. 'Ye seen that every day eek, more and more,
1349. Men trete of pees; and it supposed is,
1350. That men the quene Eleyne shal restore,
1351. And Grekes us restore that is mis.
1352. So though ther nere comfort noon but this,
1353. That men purposen pees on every syde,
1354. Ye may the bettre at ese of herte abyde.

1355. 'For if that it be pees, myn herte dere,

1362. 'And though so be that pees ther may be noon,
1363. Yet hider, though ther never pees ne were,
1364. I moste come; for whider sholde I goon,
1365. Or how mischaunce sholde I dwelle there
1366. Among tho men of armes ever in fere?
1367. For which, as wisly god my soule rede,
1368. I can not seen wher-of ye sholden drede.

1369. 'Have here another wey, if it so be
1370. That al this thing ne may yow not suffyse.
1371. My fader, as ye knowen wel, pardee,
1372. Is old, and elde is ful of coveityse,
1373. And I right now have founden al the gyse,
1374. With-oute net, wher-with I shal him hente;
1375. And herkeneth how, if that ye wole assente.

1376. 'Lo, Troilus, men seyn that hard it is
1377. The wolf ful, and the wether hool to have;
1378. This is to seyn, that men ful ofte, y-wis,
1379. Mot spenden part, the remenant for to save.
1380. For ay with gold men may the herte grave
1381. Of him that set is up-on coveityse;
1382. And how I mene, I shal it yow devyse.

1383. 'The moeble which that I have in this toun
1384. Un-to my fader shal I take, and seye,
1385. That right for trust and for savacioun
1386. It sent is from a freend of his or tweye,
1387. The whiche freendes ferventliche him preye
1388. To senden after more, and that in hye,
1389. Whyl that this toun stant thus in Iupartye.

1390. 'And that shal been an huge quantitee,
1391. Thus shal I seyn, but, lest it folk aspyde,
1392. This may be sent by no wight but by me;
1393. I shal eek shewen him, if pees bityde,
1394. What frendes that ich have on every syde
1395. Toward the court, to doon the wrathe pace
1396. Of Priamus, and doon him stonde in grace.

1397. 'So what for o thing and for other, swete,
1398. I shal him so enchaunten with my sawes,
1399. That right in hevene his sowle is, shal he mete!
1400. For al Appollo, or his clerkes lawes,
1401. Or calculinge avayleth nought three hawes;
1402. Desyr of gold shal so his sowle blende,
1403. That, as me lyst, I shal wel make an ende.

1404. 'And if he wolde ought by his sort it preve
1405. If that I lye, in certayn I shal fonde
1406. Distorben him, and plukke him by the sleve,
1407. Makinge his sort, and beren him on honde,
1408. He hath not wel the goddes understonde.
1409. For goddes speken in amphibologyes,
1410. And, for o sooth they tellen twenty lyes.

1411. 'Eek drede fond first goddes, I suppose,
1412. Thus shal I seyn, and that his cowarde herte
1413. Made him amis the goddes text to glose,
1414. Whan he for ferde out of his Delphos sterte.
1415. And but I make him sone to converte,
1416. And doon my reed with-inne a day or tweye,
1417. I wol to yow oblige me to deye.'

1418. And treweliche, as writen wel I finde,
1419. That al this thing was seyd of good entente;
1420. And that hir herte trewe was and kinde
1421. Towardes him, and spak right as she mente,
1422. And that she starf for wo neigh, whan she wente,
1423. And was in purpos ever to be trewe;
1424. Thus writen they that of hir werkes knewe.

1425. This Troilus, with herte and eres spradde,
1426. Herde al this thing devysen to and fro;
1427. And verraylich him semed that he hadde
1428. The selve wit; but yet to lete hir go
1429. His herte misforyaf him ever-mo.
1430. But fynally, he gan his herte wreste
1431. To trusten hir, and took it for the beste.

1432. For which the grete furie of his penaunce
1433. Was queynt with hope, and ther-with hem bitwene
1434. Bigan for Ioye the amorouse daunce.
1435. And as the briddes, whan the sonne is shene,
1436. Delyten in hir song in leves grene,
1437. Right so the wordes that they spake y-fere
1438. Delyted hem, and made hir hertes clere.

1439. But natheles, the wending of Criseyde,
1440. For al this world, may nought out of his minde;
1441. For which ful ofte he pitously hir preyde,
1442. That of hir heste he might hir trewe finde,
1443. And seyde hire, 'Certes, if ye be unkinde,
1444. And but ye come at day set in-to Troye,
1445. Ne shal I never have hele, honour, ne Ioye.

1446. 'For al-so sooth as sonne up-rist on morwe,
1447. And, god! So wisly thou me, woful wrecche,
1448. To reste bringe out of this cruel sorwe,
1449. I wol my-selven slee if that ye drecche.
1450. But of my deeth though litel be to recche,
1451. Yet, er that ye me cause so to smerte,
1452. Dwel rather here, myn owene swete herte!

1453. 'For trewely, myn owene lady dere,
1454. Tho sleightes yet that I have herd yow stere
1455. Ful shaply been to failen alle y-fere.
1456. For thus men seyn, "That oon thenketh the bere,
1457. But al another thenketh his ledere."
1458. Your sire is wys, and seyd is, out of drede,
1459. "Men may the wyse at-renne, and not at-rede."

1460. 'It is ful hard to halten unespyed
1461. Bifore a crepul, for he can the craft;
1462. Your fader is in sleighte as Argus yed;
1463. For al be that his moeble is him biraft,
1464. His olde sleighte is yet so with him laft,
1465. Ye shal not blende him for your womanhede,
1466. Ne feyne a-right, and that is al my drede.

1467. 'I noot if pees shal ever-mo bityde;
1468. But, pees or no, for ernest ne for game,
1469. I woot, sin Calkas on the Grekis syde
1470. Hath ones been, and lost so foule his name,
1471. He dar no more come here ayein for shame;
1472. For which that weye, for ought I can espye,
1473. To trusten on, nis but a fantasye.

1474. 'Ye shal eek seen, your fader shal yow glose
1475. To been a wyf, and as he can wel preche,
1476. He shal som Grek so preyse and wel alose,
1477. That ravisshen he shal yow with his speche,
1478. Or do yow doon by force as he shal teche.
1479. And Troilus, of whom ye nil han routhe,
1480. Shal causeles so sterven in his trouthe!

1481. 'And over al this, your fader shal despyse
1482. Us alle, and seyn this citee nis but lorn;
1483. And that thassege never shal aryse,
1484. For-why the Grekes han it alle sworn
1485. Til we be slayn, and doun our walles torn.
1486. And thus he shal yow with his wordes fere,
1487. That ay drede I, that ye wol bleve there.

1488. 'Ye shul eek seen so many a lusty knight
1489. A-mong the Grekes, ful of worthinesse,
1490. And eche of hem with herte, wit, and might
1491. To plesen yow don al his besinesse,
1492. That ye shul dullen of the rudenesse
1493. Of us sely Troianes, but-if routhe
1494. Remorde yow, or vertue of your trouthe.

1495. 'And this to me so grevous is to thinke,
1496. That fro my brest it wol my soule rende;
1497. Ne dredeles, in me ther may not sinke
1498. A good opinioun, if that ye wende;
1499. For-why your faderes sleighte wol us shende.
1500. And if ye goon, as I have told yow yore,
1501. So thenk I nam but deed, with-oute more.

1502. 'For which, with humble, trewe, and pitous herte,
1503. A thousand tymes mercy I yow preye;
1504. So reweth on myn aspre peynes smerte,
1505. And doth somwhat, as that I shal yow seye,

1507. And thenk that folye is, whan man may chese,
1508. For accident his substaunce ay to lese.

1509. 'I mene this, that sin we mowe er day
1510. Wel stele away, and been to-gider so,
1511. What wit were it to putten in assay,
1512. In cas ye sholden to your fader go,
1513. If that ye mighte come ayein or no?
1514. Thus mene I, that it were a gret folye
1515. To putte that sikernesse in Iupertye.

1516. 'And vulgarly to speken of substaunce
1517. Of tresour, may we bothe with us lede
1518. Y-nough to live in honour and plesaunce,
1519. Til in-to tyme that we shal ben dede;
1520. And thus we may eschewen al this drede.
1521. For everich other wey ye can recorde,
1522. Myn herte, y-wis, may not ther-with acorde.

1523. 'And hardily, ne dredeth no poverte,
1524. For I have kin and freendes elles-where

1527. But been honured whyl we dwelten there.
1528. And go we anoon, for, as in myn entente,
1529. This is the beste, if that ye wole assente.'

1530. Criseyde, with a syk, right in this wyse
1531. Answerde, 'Y-wis, my dere herte trewe,
1532. We may wel stele away, as ye devyse,
1533. And finde swich unthrifty weyes newe;
1534. But afterward, ful sore it wol us rewe.

1568. That ye ne dorste come ayein for shame!
1569. And er that ye Iuparten so your name,

1572. 'What trowe ye the peple eek al aboute
1573. Wolde of it seye? It is ful light to arede.
1574. They wolden seye, and swere it, out of doute,
1575. That love ne droof yow nought to doon this dede,
1576. But lust voluptuous and coward drede.
1577. Thus were al lost, y-wis, myn herte dere,

1579. 'And also thenketh on myn honestee,

1581. And with what filthe it spotted sholde be,
1582. If in this forme I sholde with yow wende.
1583. Ne though I livede un-to the worldes ende,
1584. My name sholde I never ayeinward winne;
1585. Thus were I lost, and that were routhe and sinne.

1586. 'And for-thy slee with reson al this hete;

1588. Eek "Who-so wol han leef, he lief mot lete;"
1589. Thus maketh vertue of necessitee
1590. By pacience, and thenk that lord is he

1600. 'And now, so this be sooth,' quod Troilus,
1601. 'I shal wel suffre un-to the tenthe day,
1602. Sin that I see that nede it moot be thus.
1603. But, for the love of god, if it be may,
1604. So lat us stele prively away;

1607. 'O mercy, god, what lyf is this?' quod she;
1608. 'Allas, ye slee me thus for verray tene!
1609. I see wel now that ye mistrusten me;
1610. For by your wordes it is wel y-sene.
1611. Now, for the love of Cynthia the shene,
1612. Mistrust me not thus causeles, for routhe;

1621. 'For if ye wiste how sore it doth me smerte,
1622. Ye wolde cesse of this; for god, thou wost,
1623. The pure spirit wepeth in myn herte,
1624. To see yow wepen that I love most,
1625. And that I moot gon to the Grekes ost.

1628. 'But certes, I am not so nyce a wight
1629. That I ne can imaginen a wey

1631. For who may holde thing that wol a-way?
1632. My fader nought, for al his queynte pley.
1633. And by my thrift, my wending out of Troye
1634. Another day shal torne us alle to Ioye.

1635. 'For-thy, with al myn herte I yow beseke,
1636. If that yow list don ought for my preyere,
1637. And for the love which that I love yow eke,

1641. Myn herte, which that is at point to breste.

1642. 'And over al this I pray yow,' quod she tho,
1643. 'Myn owene hertes soothfast suffisaunce,

1656. To this answerde Troilus and seyde,
1657. 'Now god, to whom ther nis no cause y-wrye,
1658. Me glade, as wis I never un-to Criseyde,
1659. Sin thilke day I saw hir first with ye,
