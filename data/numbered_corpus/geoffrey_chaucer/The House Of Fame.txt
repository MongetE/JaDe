1. BOOK I    Incipit liber primus.

2. God turne us every dreem to gode!
3. For hit is wonder, be the rode,
4. To my wit, what causeth swevens
5. Either on morwes, or on evens;
6. And why the effect folweth of somme,
7. And of somme hit shal never come;
8. Why that is an avisioun,
9. And this a revelacioun,
10. Why this a dreem, why that a sweven,
11. And nat to every man liche even;
12. Why this a fantom, these oracles,
13. I noot; but who-so of these miracles
14. The causes knoweth bet than I,
15. Devyne he; for I certeinly
16. Ne can hem noght, ne never thinke
17. To besily my wit to swinke,
18. To knowe of hir signifiaunce
19. The gendres, neither the distaunce
20. Of tymes of hem, ne the causes,
21. For-why this more than that cause is;
22. As if folkes complexiouns
23. Make hem dreme of reflexiouns;
24. Or ellis thus, as other sayn,
25. For to greet feblenesse of brayn,
26. By abstinence, or by seeknesse,
27. Prison, stewe, or greet distresse;
28. Or elles by disordinaunce
29. Of naturel acustomaunce,
30. That som man is to curious
31. In studie, or melancolious,
32. Or thus, so inly ful of drede,
33. That no man may him bote bede;
34. Or elles, that devocioun
35. Of somme, and contemplacioun
36. Causeth swiche dremes ofte;
37. Or that the cruel lyf unsofte
38. Which these ilke lovers leden
39. That hopen over muche or dreden,
40. That purely hir impressiouns
41. Causeth hem avisiouns;
42. Or if that spirites have the might
43. To make folk to dreme a-night
44. Or if the soule, of propre kinde
45. Be so parfit, as men finde,
46. That hit forwot that is to come,
47. And that hit warneth alle and somme
48. Of everiche of hir aventures
49. Be avisiouns, or by figures,
50. But that our flesh ne hath no might
51. To understonden hit aright,
52. For hit is warned to derkly; --
53. But why the cause is, noght wot I.
54. Wel worthe, of this thing, grete clerkes,
55. That trete of this and other werkes;
56. For I of noon opinioun
57. Nil as now make mensioun,
58. But only that the holy rode
59. Turne us every dreem to gode!
60. For never, sith that I was born,
61. Ne no man elles, me biforn,
62. Mette, I trowe stedfastly,
63. So wonderful a dreem as I
64. The tenthe day dide of Decembre,
65. The which, as I can now remembre,
66. I wol yow tellen every del,

67. The Invocation

68. But at my ginninge, trusteth wel,
69. I wol make invocacioun,
70. With special devocioun,
71. Unto the god of slepe anoon,
72. That dwelleth in a cave of stoon
73. Upon a streem that cometh fro Lete,
74. That is a flood of helle unswete;
75. Besyde a folk men clepe Cimerie,
76. Ther slepeth ay this god unmerie
77. With his slepy thousand sones
78. That alway for to slepe hir wone is --
79. And to this god, that I of rede,
80. Prey I, that he wol me spede
81. My sweven for to telle aright,
82. If every dreem stonde in his might.
83. And he, that mover is of al
84. That is and was, and ever shal,
85. So yive hem Ioye that hit here
86. Of alle that they dreme to-yere,
87. And for to stonden alle in grace
88. Of hir loves, or in what place
89. That hem wer levest for to stonde,
90. And shelde hem fro poverte and shonde,
91. And fro unhappe and eche disese,
92. And sende hem al that may hem plese,
93. That take hit wel, and scorne hit noght,
94. Ne hit misdemen in her thoght
95. Through malicious entencioun.
96. And who-so, through presumpcioun,
97. Or hate or scorne, or through envye,
98. Dispyt, or Iape, or vilanye,
99. Misdeme hit, preye I Iesus god
100. That (dreme he barfoot, dreme he shod),
101. That every harm that any man
102. Hath had, sith that the world began,
103. Befalle him therof, or he sterve,
104. And graunte he mote hit ful deserve,
105. Lo! with swich a conclusioun
106. As had of his avisioun
107. Cresus, that was king of Lyde,
108. That high upon a gebet dyde!
109. This prayer shal he have of me;
110. I am no bet in charite!
111. Now herkneth, as I have you seyd,
112. What that I mette or I abreyd.

113. The Dream

114. Of Decembre the tenthe day,
115. Whan hit was night, to slepe I lay
116. Right ther as I was wont to done,
117. And fil on slepe wonder sone,
118. As he that wery was for-go
119. On pilgrimage myles two
120. To the corseynt Leonard,
121. To make lythe of that was hard.
122. But as I sleep, me mette I was
123. Within a temple y-mad of glas;
124. In whiche ther were mo images
125. Of gold, stondinge in sondry stages,
126. And mo riche tabernacles,
127. And with perre mo pinacles,
128. And mo curious portreytures,
129. And queynte maner of figures
130. Of olde werke, then I saw ever.
131. For certeynly, I niste never
132. Wher that I was, but wel wiste I,
133. Hit was of Venus redely,
134. The temple; for, in portreyture,
135. I sawgh anoon-right hir figure
136. Naked fletinge in a see.
137. And also on hir heed, parde,
138. Hir rose-garlond whyt and reed,
139. And hir comb to kembe hir heed,
140. Hir dowves, and daun Cupido
141. Hir blinde sone, and Vulcano,
142. That in his face was ful broun.
143. But as I romed up and doun,
144. I fond that on a wal ther was
145. Thus writen, on a table of bras:
146. `I wol now singe, if that I can,
147. The armes, and al-so the man,
148. That first cam, through his destinee,
149. Fugitif of Troye contree,
150. In Itaile, with ful moche pyne,
151. Unto the strondes of Lavyne.'
152. And tho began the story anoon,
153. As I shal telle yow echoon.
154. First saw I the destruccioun
155. Of Troye, through the Greek Sinoun,
156. That with his false forsweringe,
157. And his chere and his lesinge
158. Made the hors broght into Troye,
159. Thorgh which Troyens loste al hir Ioye.
160. And after this was grave, allas!
161. How Ilioun assailed was
162. And wonne, and King Priam y-slayn,
163. And Polites his sone, certayn,
164. Dispitously, of dan Pirrus.
165. And next that saw I how Venus,
166. Whan that she saw the castel brende,
167. Doun fro the hevene gan descende,
168. And bad hir sone Eneas flee;
169. And how he fledde, and how that he
170. Escaped was from al the pres,
171. And took his fader, Anchises,
172. And bar him on his bakke away,
173. Cryinge, `Allas, and welaway!'
174. The whiche Anchises in his honde
175. Bar the goddes of the londe,
176. Thilke that unbrende were.
177. And I saw next, in alle this fere,
178. How Creusa, daun Eneas wyf,
179. Which that he lovede as his lyf,
180. And hir yonge sone Iulo,
181. And eek Ascanius also,
182. Fledden eek with drery chere,
183. That hit was pitee for to here;
184. And in a forest, as they wente,
185. At a turninge of a wente,
186. How Creusa was y-lost, allas!
187. That deed, but noot I how, she was;
188. How he hir soughte, and how hir gost
189. Bad him to flee the Grekes ost,
190. And seyde he most unto Itaile,
191. As was his destinee, sauns faille;
192. That hit was pitee for to here,
193. Whan hir spirit gan appere,
194. The wordes that she to him seyde,
195. And for to kepe hir sone him preyde.
196. Ther saw I graven eek how he,
197. His fader eek, and his meynee,
198. With his shippes gan to sayle
199. Toward the contree of Itaile,
200. As streight as that they mighte go.
201. Ther saw I thee, cruel Iuno,
202. That art daun Iupiteres wyf,
203. That hast y-hated, al thy lyf,
204. Al the Troyanisshe blood,
205. Renne and crye, as thou were wood,
206. On Eolus, the god of windes,
207. To blowen out, of alle kindes,
208. So loude, that he shulde drenche
209. Lord and lady, grome and wenche,
210. Of al the Troyan nacioun,
211. Withoute any savacioun.
212. Ther saw I swich tempeste aryse,
213. That every herte mighte agryse,
214. To see hit peynted on the walle.
215. Ther saw I graven eek withalle,
216. Venus, how ye, my lady dere,
217. Wepinge with ful woful chere,
218. Prayen Iupiter an hye
219. To save and kepe that navye
220. Of the Troyan Eneas,
221. Sith that he hir sone was.
222. Ther saw I Ioves Venus kisse,
223. And graunted of the tempest lisse.
224. Ther saw I how the tempest stente,
225. And how with alle pyne he wente,
226. And prevely took arrivage
227. In the contree of Cartage;
228. And on the morwe, how that he
229. And a knight, hight Achatee,
230. Metten with Venus that day,
231. Goinge in a queynt array,
232. As she had ben an hunteresse,
233. With wind blowinge upon hir tresse;
234. How Eneas gan him to pleyne,
235. Whan that he knew hir, of his peyne;
236. And how his shippes dreynte were,
237. Or elles lost, he niste where;
238. How she gan him comforte tho,
239. And bad him to Cartage go,
240. And ther he shulde his folk finde
241. That in the see were left behinde.
242. And, shortly of this thing to pace,
243. She made Eneas so in grace
244. Of Dido, quene of that contree,
245. That, shortly for to tellen, she
246. Becam his love, and leet him do
247. That that wedding longeth to.
248. What shulde I speke more queynte,
249. Or peyne me my wordes peynte,
250. To speke of love? hit wol not be;
251. I can not of that facultee.
252. And eek to telle the manere
253. How they aqueynteden in-fere,
254. Hit were a long proces to telle,
255. And over long for yow to dwelle.
256. Ther sawgh I grave how Eneas
257. Tolde Dido every cas,
258. That him was tid upon the see.
259. And after grave was, how shee
260. Made of him, shortly, at oo word,
261. Hir lyf, hir love, hir luste, hir lord;
262. And dide him al the reverence,
263. And leyde on him al the dispence,
264. That any woman mighte do,
265. Weninge hit had al be so,
266. As he hir swoor; and her-by demed
267. That he was good, for he swich semed.
268. Allas! what harm doth apparence,
269. Whan hit is fals in existence!
270. For he to hir a traitour was;
271. Wherfor she slow hir-self, allas!
272. Lo, how a woman doth amis,
273. To love him that unknowen is!
274. For, by Crist, lo! thus hit fareth;
275. `Hit is not al gold, that glareth.'
276. For, al-so brouke I wel myn heed,
277. Ther may be under goodliheed
278. Kevered many a shrewed vyce;
279. Therfor be no wight so nyce,
280. To take a love only for chere,
281. For speche, or for frendly manere;
282. For this shal every woman finde
283. That som man, of his pure kinde,
284. Wol shewen outward the faireste,
285. Til he have caught that what him leste;
286. And thanne wol he causes finde,
287. And swere how that she is unkinde,
288. Or fals, or prevy, or double was.
289. Al this seye I by Eneas
290. And Dido, and hir nyce lest,
291. That lovede al to sone a gest;
292. Therfor I wol seye a proverbe,
293. That `he that fully knoweth therbe
294. May saufly leye hit to his ye';
295. Withoute dreed, this is no lye.
296. But let us speke of Eneas,
297. How he betrayed hir, allas!
298. And lefte hir ful unkindely.
299. So whan she saw al-utterly,
300. That he wolde hir of trouthe faile,
301. And wende fro hir to Itaile,
302. She gan to wringe hir hondes two.
303. `Allas!' quod she, `what me is wo!
304. Allas! is every man thus trewe,
305. That every yere wolde have a newe,
306. If hit so longe tyme dure,
307. Or elles three, peraventure?
308. As thus: of oon he wolde have fame
309. In magnifying of his name;
310. Another for frendship, seith he;
311. And yet ther shal the thridde be,
312. That shal be taken for delyt,
313. Lo, or for singular profyt.'
314. In swiche wordes gan to pleyne
315. Dido of hir grete peyne,
316. As me mette redely;
317. Non other auctour alegge I.
318. `Allas!' quod she, `my swete herte,
319. Have pitee on my sorwes smerte,
320. And slee me not! go noght away!
321. O woful Dido, wel away!'
322. Quod she to hir-selve tho.
323. `O Eneas! what wil ye do?
324. O that your love, ne your bonde,
325. That ye han sworn with your right honde,
326. Ne my cruel deeth,' quod she,
327. 'May holde yow still heer with me!
328. O, haveth of my deeth pitee!
329. Y-wis, my dere herte, ye
330. Knowen ful wel that never yit,
331. As fer-forth as I hadde wit,
332. Agilte I yow in thoght ne deed.
333. 0, have ye men swich goodliheed
334. In speche, and never a deel of trouthe?
335. Allas, that ever hadde routhe
336. Any woman on any man!
337. Now see I wel, and telle can,
338. We wrecched wimmen conne non art;
339. For certeyn, for the more part,
340. Thus we be served everichone.
341. How sore that ye men conne grone,
342. Anoon as we have yow receyved!
343. Certeinly we ben deceyved;
344. For, though your love laste a sesoun,
345. Wayte upon the conclusioun,
346. And eek how that ye determynen,
347. And for the more part diffynen.
348. `O, welawey that I was born!
349. For through yow is my name lorn,
350. And alle myn actes red and songe
351. Over al this lond, on every tonge.
352. O wikke Fame! for ther nis
353. Nothing so swift, lo, as she is!
354. O, sooth is, every thing is wist,
355. Though hit be kevered with the mist.
356. Eek, thogh I mighte duren ever,
357. That I have doon, rekever I never,
358. That I ne shal be seyd, allas,
359. Y-shamed be through Eneas,
360. And that I shal thus Iuged be --
361. `Lo, right as she hath doon, now she
362. Wol do eftsones, hardily;'
363. Thus seyth the peple prevely.' --
364. But that is doon, nis not to done;
365. Al hir compleynt ne al hir mone,
366. Certeyn, availeth hir not a stre.
367. And when she wiste sothly he
368. Was forth unto his shippes goon,
369. She in hir chambre wente anoon,
370. And called on hir suster Anne,
371. And gan hir to compleyne thanne;
372. And seyde, that she cause was
373. That she first lovede Eneas,
374. And thus counseilled hir therto.
375. But what! when this was seyd and do,
376. She roof hir-selve to the herte,
377. And deyde through the wounde smerte.
378. But al the maner how she deyde,
379. And al the wordes that she seyde,
380. Who-so to knowe hit hath purpos,
381. Reed Virgile in Eneidos
382. Or the Epistle of Ovyde,
383. What that she wroot or that she dyde;
384. And nere hit to long to endyte,
385. By god, I wolde hit here wryte.
386. But, welaway! the harm, the routhe,
387. That hath betid for swich untrouthe,
388. As men may ofte in bokes rede,
389. And al day seen hit yet in dede,
390. That for to thenken hit, a tene is.
391. Lo, Demophon, duk of Athenis,
392. How he forswor him ful falsly,
393. And trayed Phillis wikkedly,
394. That kinges doghter was of Trace,
395. And falsly gan his terme pace;
396. And when she wiste that he was fals,
397. She heng hir-self right by the hals,
398. For he had do hir swich untrouthe;
399. Lo! was not this a wo and routhe?
400. Eek lo! how fals and reccheles
401. Was to Breseida Achilles,
402. And Paris to Enone;
403. And Iason to Isiphile;
404. And eft Iason to Medea;
405. And Ercules to Dyanira;
406. For he left hir for Iole,
407. That made him cacche his deeth, parde.
408. How fals eek was he, Theseus;
409. That, as the story telleth us,
410. How he betrayed Adriane;
411. The devel be his soules bane!
412. For had he laughed, had he loured,
413. He moste have be al devoured,
414. If Adriane ne had y-be!
415. And, for she had of him pitee,
416. She made him fro the dethe escape,
417. And he made hir a ful fals Iape;
418. For aftir this, within a whyle
419. He lefte hir slepinge in an yle,
420. Deserte alone, right in the see,
421. And stal away, and leet hir be;
422. And took hir suster Phedra tho
423. With him, and gan to shippe go.
424. And yet he had y-sworn to here,
425. On al that ever he mighte swere,
426. That, so she saved him his lyf,
427. He wolde have take hir to his wyf;
428. For she desired nothing elles,
429. In certein, as the book us telles.
430. But to excusen Eneas
431. Fulliche of al his greet trespas,
432. The book seyth, Mercurie, sauns faile,
433. Bad him go into Itaile,
434. And leve Auffrykes regioun,
435. And Dido and hir faire toun.
436. Tho saw I grave, how to Itaile
437. Daun Eneas is go to saile;
438. And how the tempest al began,
439. And how he loste his steresman,
440. Which that the stere, or he took keep,
441. Smot over-bord, lo! as he sleep.
442. And also saw I how Sibyle
443. And Eneas, besyde an yle,
444. To helle wente, for to see
445. His fader, Anchises the free.
446. How he ther fond Palinurus,
447. And Dido, and eek Deiphebus;
448. And every tourment eek in helle
449. Saw he, which is long to telle.
450. Which who-so willeth for to knowe,
451. He most rede many a rowe
452. On Virgile or on Claudian,
453. Or Daunte, that hit telle can.
454. Tho saw I grave al tharivaile
455. That Eneas had in Itaile;
456. And with King Latine his tretee,
457. And alle the batailles that he
458. Was at him-self, and eek his knightes,
459. Or he had al y-wonne his rightes;
460. And how he Turnus refte his lyf,
461. And wan Lavyna to his wyf;
462. And al the mervelous signals
463. Of the goddes celestials;
464. How, maugre Iuno, Eneas,
465. For al hir sleighte and hir compas,
466. Acheved al his aventure;
467. For Iupiter took of him cure
468. At the prayere of Venus;
469. The whiche I preye alwey save us,
470. And us ay of our sorwes lighte!
471. Whan I had seyen al this sighte
472. In this noble temple thus,
473. `A, Lord!' thoughte I, `that madest us,
474. Yet saw I never swich noblesse
475. Of images, ne swich richesse,
476. As I saw graven in this chirche;
477. But not woot I who dide hem wirche,
478. Ne wher I am, ne in what contree.
479. But now wol I go out and see,
480. Right at the wiket, if I can
481. See o-wher stering any man,
482. That may me telle wher I am.'
483. When I out at the dores cam,
484. I faste aboute me beheld.
485. Then saw I but a large feld,
486. As fer as that I mighte see,
487. Withouten toun, or hous, or tree,
488. Or bush, or gras, or ered lond;
489. For al the feld nas but of sond
490. As smal as man may see yet lye
491. In the desert of Libye;
492. Ne I to maner creature,
493. That is y-formed by nature,
494. Ne saw, me for to rede or wisse.
495. `O Crist,' thoughte I, `that art in blisse,
496. Fro fantom and illusioun
497. Me save!' and with devocioun
498. Myn yen to the heven I caste.
499. Tho was I war, lo! at the laste,
500. That faste be the sonne, as hye
501. As kenne mighte I with myn ye,
502. Me thoughte I saw an egle sore,
503. But that hit semed moche more
504. Then I had any egle seyn.
505. But this as sooth as deeth, certeyn,
506. Hit was of golde, and shoon so bright,
507. That never saw men such a sighte,
508. But-if the heven hadde y-wonne
509. Al newe of golde another sonne;
510. So shoon the egles fethres brighte,

535. The Dream.

536. This egle, of which I have yow told,
537. That shoon with fethres as of gold,
538. Which that so hye gan to sore,
539. I gan beholde more and more,
540. To see hir the beautee and the wonder;
541. But never was ther dint of thonder,
542. Ne that thing that men calle foudre,
543. That smoot somtyme a tour to poudre,
544. And in his swifte coming brende,
545. That so swythe gan descende,
546. As this foul, whan hit behelde
547. That I a-roume was in the felde;
548. And with his grimme pawes stronge,
549. Within his sharpe nayles longe,
550. Me, fleinge, at a swappe he hente,
551. And with his sours agayn up wente,
552. Me caryinge in his clawes starke
553. As lightly as I were a larke,
554. How high I can not telle yow,
555. For I cam up, I niste how.
556. For so astonied and a-sweved
557. Was every vertu in my heved,
558. What with his sours and with my drede,
559. That al my feling gan to dede;
560. For-why hit was to greet affray.
561. Thus I longe in his clawes lay,
562. Til at the laste he to me spak
563. In mannes vois, and seyde, `Awak!
564. And be not so a-gast, for shame!'
565. And called me tho by my name,
566. And, for I sholde the bet abreyde --
567. Me mette -- `Awak,' to me he seyde,
568. Right in the same vois and stevene
569. That useth oon I coude nevene;
570. And with that vois, soth for to sayn,
571. My minde cam to me agayn;
572. For hit was goodly seyd to me,
573. So nas hit never wont to be.
574. And herewithal I gan to stere,
575. And he me in his feet to bere,
576. Til that he felte that I had hete,
577. And felte eek tho myn herte bete.
578. And tho gan he me to disporte,
579. And with wordes to comforte,
580. And sayde twyes, `Seynte Marie!
581. Thou art noyous for to carie,
582. And nothing nedeth hit, parde!
583. For al-so wis god helpe me
584. As thou non harm shalt have of this;
585. And this cas, that betid thee is,
586. Is for thy lore and for thy prow; --
587. Let see! darst thou yet loke now?
588. Be ful assured, boldely,
589. I am thy frend.' And therwith I
590. Gan for to wondren in my minde.
591. `O god,' thoughte I, `that madest kinde,
592. Shal I non other weyes dye?
593. Wher Ioves wol me stellifye,
594. Or what thing may this signifye?
595. I neither am Enok, ne Elye,
596. Ne Romulus, ne Ganymede
597. That was y-bore up, as men rede,
598. To hevene with dan Iupiter,
599. And maad the goddes boteler.'
600. Lo! this was tho my fantasye!
601. But he that bar me gan espye
602. That I so thoghte, and seyde this: --
603. `Thou demest of thy-self amis;
604. For Ioves is not ther-aboute --
605. I dar wel putte thee out of doute --
606. To make of thee as yet a sterre.
607. But er I bere thee moche ferre,
608. I wol thee telle what I am,
609. And whider thou shalt, and why I cam
610. To done this, so that thou take
611. Good herte, and not for fere quake.'
612. `Gladly,' quod I. -- `Now wel,' quod he: --
613. `First I, that in my feet have thee,
614. Of which thou hast a feer and wonder,
615. Am dwellinge with the god of thonder,
616. Which that men callen Iupiter,
617. That dooth me flee ful ofte fer
618. To do al his comaundement.
619. And for this cause he hath me sent
620. To thee: now herke, by thy trouthe!
621. Certeyn, he hath of thee routhe,
622. That thou so longe trewely
623. Hast served so ententifly
624. His blinde nevew Cupido,
625. And fair Venus goddesse also,
626. Withoute guerdoun ever yit,
627. And nevertheles has set thy wit --
628. Although that in thy hede ful lyte is --
629. To make bokes, songes, dytees,
630. In ryme, or elles in cadence,
631. As thou best canst, in reverence
632. Of Love, and of his servants eke,
633. That have his servise soght, and seke;
634. And peynest thee to preyse his art,
635. Althogh thou haddest never part;
636. Wherfor, al-so god me blesse,
637. Ioves halt hit greet humblesse
638. And vertu eek, that thou wolt make
639. A-night ful ofte thyn heed to ake,
640. In thy studie so thou wrytest,
641. And ever-mo of love endytest,
642. In honour of him and preysinges,
643. And in his foIkes furtheringes,
644. And in hir matere al devysest,
645. And noght him nor his folk despysest,
646. Although thou mayst go in the daunce
647. Of hem that him list not avaunce.
648. `Wherfor, as I seyde, y-wis,
649. Iupiter considereth this,
650. And also, beau sir, other thinges;
651. That is, that thou hast no tydinges
652. Of Loves folk, if they be glade,
653. Ne of noght elles that god made;
654. And noght only fro fer contree
655. That ther no tyding comth to thee,
656. But of thy verray neyghebores,
657. That dwellen almost at thy dores,
658. Thou herest neither that ne this;
659. For whan thy labour doon al is,
660. And hast y-maad thy rekeninges,
661. In stede of reste and newe thinges,
662. Thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon;
663. And, also domb as any stoon,
664. Thou sittest at another boke,
665. Til fully daswed is thy loke,
666. And livest thus as an hermyte,
667. Although thyn abstinence is lyte.
668. `And therfor Ioves, through his grace,
669. Wol that I bere thee to a place,
670. Which that hight THE HOUS OF FAME,
671. To do thee som disport and game,
672. In som recompensacioun
673. Of labour and devocioun
674. That thou has had, lo! causeles,
675. To Cupido, the reccheles!
676. And thus this god, thorgh his meryte,
677. Wol with som maner thing thee quyte,
678. So that thou wolt be of good chere.
679. For truste wel, that thou shalt here,
680. When we be comen ther I seye,
681. Mo wonder thinges, dar I leye:
682. Of Loves folke mo tydinges,
683. Both soth-sawes and lesinges;
684. And mo loves newe begonne,
685. And longe y-served loves wonne,
686. And mo loves casuelly
687. That been betid, no man wot why,
688. But as a blind man stert an hare;
689. And more Iolytee and fare,
690. Whyl that they finde love of stele,
691. As thinketh hem, and over-al wele;
692. Mo discords, mo Ielousyes,
693. Mo murmurs, and mo novelryes,
694. And mo dissimulaciouns;
695. And feyned reparaciouns;
696. And mo berdes in two houres

703. Then on instruments ben cordes;
704. And eke of loves mo eschaunges
705. Than ever cornes were in graunges;
706. Unnethe maistow trowen this?' --
707. Quod he. `No, helpe me god so wis!' --
708. Quod I. `No? why?' quod he. `For hit
709. Were impossible, to my wit,
710. Though that Fame hadde al the pyes
711. In al a realme, and al the spyes,
712. How that yet she shulde here al this,
713. Or they espye hit.' `O yis, yis!'
714. Quod he to me, `that can I preve
715. By resoun, worthy for to leve,
716. So that thou yeve thyn advertence
717. To understonde my sentence.
718. `First shalt thou heren wher she dwelleth,
719. And so thyn owne book hit telleth;
720. Hir paleys stant, as I shal seye,
721. Right even in middes of the weye
722. Betwixen hevene, erthe, and see;
723. That, what-so-ever in al these three
724. Is spoken, in privee or aperte,
725. The way therto is so overte,
726. And stant eek in so Iuste a place,
727. That every soun mot to hit pace,
728. Or what so comth fro any tonge,
729. Be hit rouned, red, or songe,
730. Or spoke in seurtee or in drede,
731. Certein, hit moste thider nede.
732. `Now herkne wel; for-why I wille
733. Tellen thee a propre skile,
734. And worthy demonstracioun
735. In myn imagynacioun.
736. `Geffrey, thou wost right wel this,
737. That every kindly thing that is,
738. Hath a kindly stede ther he
739. May best in hit conserved be;
740. Unto which place every thing,
741. Through his kindly enclyning,
742. Moveth for to come to,
743. Whan that hit is awey therfro;
744. As thus; lo, thou mayst al day see
745. That any thing that hevy be,
746. As stoon or leed, or thing of wighte,
747. And ber hit never so hye on highte,
748. Lat goo thyn hand, hit falleth doun.
749. `Right so seye I by fyre or soun,
750. Or smoke, or other thinges lighte,
751. Alwey they seke upward on highte;
752. Whyl ech of hem is at his large,
753. Light thing up, and dounward charge.
754. `And for this cause mayst thou see,
755. That every river to the see
756. Enclyned is to go, by kinde.
757. And by these skilles, as I finde,
758. Hath fish dwellinge in floode and see,
759. And trees eek in erthe be.
760. Thus every thing, by this resoun,
761. Hath his propre mansioun,
762. To which hit seketh to repaire,
763. As ther hit shulde not apaire.
764. Lo, this sentence is knowen couthe
765. Of every philosophres mouthe,
766. As Aristotle and dan Platon,
767. And other clerkes many oon;
768. And to confirme my resoun,
769. Thou wost wel this, that speche is soun,
770. Or elles no man mighte hit here;
771. Now herkne what I wol thee lere.
772. `Soun is noght but air y-broken,
773. And every speche that is spoken,
774. Loud or privee, foul or fair,
775. In his substaunce is but air;
776. For as flaumbe is but lighted smoke,
777. Right so soun is air y-broke.
778. But this may be in many wyse,
779. Of which I wil thee two devise,
780. As soun that comth of pype or harpe.
781. For whan a pype is blowen sharpe,
782. The air is twist with violence,
783. And rent; lo, this is my sentence;
784. Eke, whan men harpe-stringes smyte,
785. Whether hit be moche or lyte,
786. Lo, with the strook the air to-breketh;
787. Right so hit breketh whan men speketh.
788. Thus wost thou wel what thing is speche.
789. `Now hennesforth I wol thee teche,
790. How every speche, or noise, or soun,
791. Through his multiplicacioun,
792. Thogh hit were pyped of a mouse,
793. Moot nede come to Fames House.
794. I preve hit thus -- tak hede now --
795. Be experience; for if that thou
796. Throwe on water now a stoon,
797. Wel wost thou, hit wol make anoon
798. A litel roundel as a cercle,
799. Paraventer brood as a covercle;
800. And right anoon thou shalt see weel,
801. That wheel wol cause another wheel,
802. And that the thridde, and so forth, brother,
803. Every cercle causinge other,
804. Wyder than himselve was;
805. And thus, fro roundel to compas,
806. Ech aboute other goinge,
807. Caused of othres steringe,
808. And multiplying ever-mo,
809. Til that hit be so fer ygoo
810. That hit at bothe brinkes be.
811. Al-thogh thou mowe hit not y-see,
812. Above, hit goth yet alway under,
813. Although thou thenke hit a gret wonder.
814. And who-so seith of trouthe I varie,
815. Bid him proven the contrarie.
816. And right thus every word, y-wis,
817. That loude or privee spoken is,
818. Moveth first an air aboute,
819. And of this moving, out of doute,
820. Another air anoon is meved,
821. As I have of the water preved,
822. That every cercle causeth other.
823. Right so of air, my leve brother;
824. Everich air in other stereth
825. More and more, and speche up bereth,
826. Or vois, or noise, or word, or soun,
827. Ay through multiplicacioun,
828. Til hit be atte House of Fame; --
829. Tak hit in ernest or in game.
830. `Now have I told, if thou have minde,
831. How speche or soun, of pure kinde,
832. Enclyned is upward to meve;
833. This, mayst thou fele, wel I preve.
834. And that the mansioun, y-wis,
835. That every thing enclyned to is,
836. Hath his kindeliche stede:
837. That sheweth hit, withouten drede,
838. That kindely the mansioun
839. Of every speche, of every soun,
840. Be hit either foul or fair,
841. Hath his kinde place in air.
842. And sin that every thing, that is
843. Out of his kinde place, y-wis,
844. Moveth thider for to go
845. If hit a-weye be therfro,
846. As I before have preved thee,
847. Hit seweth, every soun, pardee,
848. Moveth kindeIy to pace
849. Al up into his kindely place.
850. And this place of which I telle,
851. Ther as Fame list to dwelle,
852. Is set amiddes of these three,
853. Heven, erthe, and eek the see,
854. As most conservatif the soun.
855. Than is this the conclusioun,
856. That every speche of every man,
857. As I thee telle first began,
858. Moveth up on high to pace
859. Kindely to Fames place.
860. `Telle me this feithfully,
861. Have I not preved thus simply,
862. Withouten any subtiltee
863. Of speche, or gret prolixitee
864. Of termes of philosophye,
865. Of figures of poetrye,
866. Or colours of rethoryke?
867. Pardee, hit oghte thee to lyke;
868. For hard langage and hard matere
869. Is encombrous for to here
870. At ones; Wost thou not wel this?'
871. And I answerde, and seyde,`Yis.'
872. `A ha!' quod he, `lo, so I can,
873. Lewedly to a lewed man
874. Speke, and shewe him swiche skiles,
875. That he may shake hem by the biles,
876. So palpable they shulden be.
877. But tel me this, now pray I thee,
878. How thinkth thee my conclusioun?'
879. Quod he. `A good persuasioun,'
880. Quod I, `hit is; and lyk to be
881. Right so as thou hast preved me.'
882. `By god,' quod he, `and as I leve,
883. Thou shalt have yit, or hit be eve,
884. Of every word of this sentence
885. A preve, by experience;
886. And with thyn eres heren wel
887. Top and tail, and everydel,
888. That every word that spoken is
889. Comth into Fames Hous, y-wis,
890. As I have seyd; what wilt thou more?'
891. And with this word upper to sore
892. He gan, and seyde, `Be Seynt Iame!
893. Now wil we speken al of game.' --
894. `How farest thou?' quod he to me,
895. `Wel,' quod I. `Now see,' quod he,
896. `By thy trouthe, yond adoun,
897. Wher that thou knowest any toun,
898. Or hous, or any other thing.
899. And whan thou hast of ought knowing,
900. Loke that thou warne me,
901. And I anoon shal telle thee
902. How fer that thou art now therfro.'
903. And I adoun gan loken tho,
904. And beheld feldes and plaines,
905. And now hilles, and now mountaines,
906. Now valeys, and now forestes,
907. And now, unethes, grete bestes;
908. Now riveres, now citees,
909. Now tounes, and now grete trees,
910. Now shippes saillinge in the see.
911. But thus sone in a whyle he
912. Was flowen fro the grounde so hye,
913. That al the world, as to myn ye,
914. No more semed than a prikke;
915. Or elles was the air so thikke
916. That I ne mighte not discerne.
917. With that he spak to me as yerne,
918. And seyde: `Seestow any toun
919. Or ought thou knowest yonder doun?'
920. I seyde, `Nay.' `No wonder nis,'
921. Quod he, `for half so high as this
922. Nas Alexander Macedo;
923. Ne the king, dan Scipio.
924. That saw in dreme, at point devys,
925. Helle and erthe, and paradys;
926. Ne eek the wrecche Dedalus,
927. Ne his child, nyce Icarus,
928. That fleigh so highe that the hete
929. His winges malt, and he fel wete
930. In-mid the see, and ther he dreynte,
931. For whom was maked moch compleynte.
932. `Now turn upward,' quod he, `thy face,
933. And behold this large place,
934. This air; but loke thou ne be
935. Adrad of hem that thou shalt see;
936. For in this regioun, certein,
937. Dwelleth many a citezein,
938. Of which that speketh dan Plato.
939. These ben the eyrish bestes, lo!'
940. And so saw I al that meynee
941. Bothe goon and also flee.
942. `Now,' quod he tho, `cast up thyn ye;
943. See yonder, lo, the Galaxye,
944. Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,
945. For hit is whyt: and somme, parfey,
946. Callen hit Watlinge Strete:
947. That ones was y-brent with hete,
948. Whan the sonnes sone, the rede,
949. That highte Pheton, wolde lede
950. Algate his fader cart, and gye.
951. The cart-hors gonne wel espye
952. That he ne coude no governaunce,
953. And gonne for to lepe and launce,
954. And beren him now up, now doun,
955. Til that he saw the Scorpioun,
956. Which that in heven a signe is yit,
957. And he, for ferde, loste his wit,
958. Of that, and leet the reynes goon
959. Of his hors; and they anoon
960. Gonne up to mounte, and doun descende
961. Til bothe the eyr and erthe brende;
962. Til Iupiter, lo, atte laste,
963. Him slow, and fro the carte caste.
964. Lo, is it not a greet mischaunce,
965. To lete a fole han governaunce
966. Of thing that he can not demeine?'
967. And with this word, soth for to seyne,
968. He gan alway upper to sore,
969. And gladded me ay more and more,
970. So feithfully to me spak he.
971. Tho gan I loken under me,
972. And beheld the eyrish bestes,
973. Cloudes, mistes, and tempestes,
974. Snowes, hailes, reines, windes,
975. And thengendring in hir kindes,
976. And al the wey through whiche I cam;
977. `O god,' quod I, `that made Adam,
978. Moche is thy might and thy noblesse!'
979. And tho thoughte I upon Boece,
980. That writ, `a thought may flee so hye,
981. With fetheres of Philosophye,
982. To passen everich element;
983. And whan he hath so fer y-went,
984. Than may be seen, behind his bak,
985. Cloud, and al that I of spak.'
986. Tho gan I wexen in a were,
987. And seyde, `I woot wel I am here;
988. But wher in body or in gost
989. I noot, y-wis; but god, thou wost!'
990. For more cleer entendement
991. Nadde he me never yit y-sent.
992. And than thoughte I on Marcian,
993. And eek on Anleclaudian,
994. That sooth was hir descripcioun
995. Of al the hevenes regioun,
996. As fer as that I saw the preve;
997. Therfor I can hem now beleve.
998. With that this egle gan to crye:
999. `Lat be,' quod he, `thy fantasye;
1000. Wilt thou lere of sterres aught?'
1001. `Nay, certeinly,' quod I, `right naught;
1002. `And why? for I am now to old.'
1003. `Elles I wolde thee have told,'
1004. Quod he, `the sterres names, lo,

1125. Of hous and site; and al the wyse
1126. How I gan to this place aproche
1127. That stood upon so high a roche,
1128. Hyer stant ther noon in Spaine.
1129. But up I clomb with alle paine,
1130. And though to climbe hit greved me,
1131. Yit I ententif was to see,

1136. But that hit shoon ful more clere;
1137. But of what congeled matere
1138. Hit was, I niste redely.
1139. But at the laste espyed I,
1140. And found that hit was, every deel,
1141. A roche of yse, and not of steel.
1142. Thoughte I, `By Seynt Thomas of Kent!

1158. But men seyn, `What may ever laste?'
1159. Tho gan I in myn herte caste,
1160. That they were molte awey with hete,
1161. And not awey with stormes bete.
1162. For on that other syde I sey

1164. How hit was writen ful of names
1165. Of folk that hadden grete fames
1166. Of olde tyme, and yit they were

1173. Of a castel, that stood on hy,

1175. That hete mighte hit not deface.
1176. Tho gan I up the hille to goon,

1481. And English Gaufride eek, y-wis;
1482. And ech of these, as have I Ioye,
1483. Was besy for to bere up Troye.
1484. So hevy ther-of was the fame,
1485. That for to bere hit was no game.
1486. But yit I gan ful wel espye,
1487. Betwix hem was a litil envye.
1488. Oon seyde, Omere made lyes,
1489. Feyninge in his poetryes,
1490. And was to Grekes favorable;
1491. Therfor held he hit but fable.
1492. Tho saugh I stonde on a pileer,
1493. That was of tinned yren cleer,
1494. That Latin poete, dan Virgyle,
1495. That bore hath up a longe whyle
1496. The fame of Pius Eneas.
1497. And next him on a piler was,
1498. Of coper, Venus clerk, Ovyde,
1499. That hath y-sowen wonder wyde
1500. The grete god of Loves name.
1501. And ther he bar up wel his fame,
1502. Upon his piler, also hye
1503. As I might see hit with myn ye:
1504. For-why this halle, of whiche I rede
1505. Was woxe on highte, lengthe and brede,
1506. Wel more, by a thousand del,
1507. Than hit was erst, that saugh I wel.
1508. Tho saugh I, on a piler by,

1511. And on his shuldres bar up than,
1512. As highe as that I mighte see,
1513. The fame of Iulius and Pompee.
1514. And by him stoden alle these clerkes,
1515. That writen of Romes mighty werkes,
1516. That, if I wolde hir names telle,
1517. Al to longe most I dwelle.
1518. And next him on a piler stood
1519. Of soulfre, lyk as he were wood,
1520. Dan Claudian, the soth to telle,
1521. That bar up al the fame of helle,
1522. Of Pluto, and of Proserpyne,
1523. That quene is of the derke pyne.
1524. What shulde I more telle of this?
1525. The halle was al ful, y-wis,
1526. Of hem that writen olde gestes,
1527. As ben on trees rokes nestes;
1528. But hit a ful confus matere
1529. Were al the gestes for to here,
1530. That they of write, and how they highte.
1531. But whyl that I beheld this sighte,
1532. I herde a noise aprochen blyve,
1533. That ferde as been don in an hyve,
1534. Agen her tyme of out-fleyinge;
1535. Right swiche a maner murmuringe,
1536. For al the world, hit semed me.
1537. Tho gan I loke aboute and see,
1538. That ther come entring in the halle
1539. A right gret company with-alle,
1540. And that of sondry regiouns,
1541. Of alleskinnes condiciouns,
1542. That dwelle in erthe under the mone,
1543. Pore and ryche. And also sone
1544. As they were come into the halle,
1545. They gonne doun on knees falle
1546. Before this ilke noble quene,
1547. And seyde, `Graunte us, lady shene,
1548. Ech of us, of thy grace, a bone!'
1549. And somme of hem she graunted sone,
1550. And somme she werned wel and faire;
1551. And somme she graunted the contraire
1552. Of hir axing utterly,
1553. But thus I seye yow trewely,
1554. What hir cause was, I niste.
1555. For of this folk, ful wel I wiste,
1556. They hadde good fame ech deserved,
1557. Althogh they were diversly served;
1558. Right as hir suster, dame Fortune,
1559. Is wont to serven in comune.
1560. Now herkne how she gan to paye
1561. That gonne hir of hir grace praye;
1562. And yit, lo, al this companye
1563. Seyden sooth, and noght a lye.
1564. `Madame,' seyden they, `we be
1565. Folk that heer besechen thee,
1566. That thou graunte us now good fame,
1567. And let our werkes han that name;
1568. In ful recompensacioun
1569. Of good werk, give us good renoun.'
1570. `I werne yow hit,' quod she anoon,
1571. `Ye gete of me good fame noon,
1572. By god! and therfor go your wey.'
1573. `Alas,' quod they, `and welaway!
1574. Telle us, what may your cause be?'
1575. `For me list hit noght,' quod she;
1576. `No wight shal speke of yow, y-wis,
1577. Good ne harm, ne that ne this.'
1578. And with that word she gan to calle
1579. Hir messanger, that was in halle,
1580. And bad that he shulde faste goon,
1581. Up peyne to be blind anoon,
1582. For Eolus, the god of winde; --
1583. `In Trace ther ye shul him finde,
1584. And bid him bringe his clarioun,
1585. That is ful dyvers of his soun,
1586. And hit is cleped Clere Laude,

1588. Hem that me list y-preised be:
1589. And also bid him how that he

1591. That highte Sclaundre in every toun,
1592. With which he wont is to diffame
1593. Hem that me list, and do hem shame.'
1594. This messanger gan faste goon,
1595. And found wher, in a cave of stoon,
1596. In a contree that highte Trace,
1597. This Eolus, with harde grace,
1598. Held the windes in distresse,
1599. And gan hem under him to presse,
1600. That they gonne as beres rore,
1601. He bond and pressed hem so sore.
1602. This messanger gan faste crye,
1603. `Rys up,' quod he, `and faste hye,
1604. Til that thou at my lady be;
1605. And tak thy clarions eek with thee,
1606. And speed the forth.' And he anon
1607. Took to a man, that hight Triton,
1608. His clariouns to bere tho,
1609. And leet a certeyn wind to go,
1610. That blew so hidously and hye,
1611. That hit ne lefte not a skye
1612. In al the welken longe an brood.
1613. This Eolus no-wher abood
1614. Til he was come at Fames feet,
1615. And eek the man that Triton heet;
1616. And ther he stood, as still as stoon.
1617. And her-withal ther com anoon
1618. Another huge companye
1619. Of gode folk, and gunne crye,
1620. `Lady, graunte us now good fame,
1621. And lat our werkes han that name
1622. Now, in honour of gentilesse,
1623. And also god your soule blesse!
1624. For we han wel deserved hit,
1625. Therfore is right that we ben quit.'
1626. `As thryve I,' quod she, `ye shal faile,
1627. Good werkes shal yow noght availe
1628. To have of me good fame as now.
1629. But wite ye what? Y graunte yow,
1630. That ye shal have a shrewed fame
1631. And wikked loos, and worse name,
1632. Though ye good loos have wel deserved.
1633. Now go your wey, for ye be served;
1634. And thou, dan Eolus, let see!
1635. Tak forth thy trumpe anon,' quod she,
1636. `That is y-cleped Sclaunder light,
1637. And blow her loos, that every wight
1638. Speke of hem harm and shrewednesse,
1639. In stede of good and worthinesse.
1640. For thou shalt trumpe al the contraire
1641. Of that they han don wel or faire.'
1642. `Alas,' thoughte I, `what aventures
1643. Han these sory creatures!
1644. For they, amonges al the pres,
1645. Shul thus be shamed, gilteles!
1646. But what! hit moste nedes be.'
1647. What did this Eolus, but he
1648. Tok out his blakke trumpe of bras,
1649. That fouler than the devil was,
1650. And gan this trumpe for to blowe,
1651. As al the world shulde overthrowe;
1652. That through-out every regioun
1653. Wente this foule trumpes soun,
1654. As swift as pelet out of gonne,
1655. Whan fyr is in the poudre ronne.
1656. And swiche a smoke gan out-wende
1657. Out of his foule trumpes ende,
1658. Blak, blo, grenissh, swartish reed,
1659. As doth wher that men melte leed,
1660. Lo, al on high fro the tuel!
1661. And therto oo thing saugh I wel,
1662. That, the ferther that hit ran,
1663. The gretter wexen hit began,
1664. As doth the river from a welle,
1665. And hit stank as the pit of helle.
1666. Alas, thus was hir shame y-ronge,
1667. And giltelees, on every tonge.
1668. Tho com the thridde companye,
1669. And gunne up to the dees to hye,
1670. And doun on knees they fille anon,
1671. And seyde, `We ben everichon
1672. Folk that han ful trewely
1673. Deserved fame rightfully,
1674. And pray yow, hit mot be knowe,
1675. Right as hit is, and forth y-blowe.'
1676. `I graunte,' quod she, `for me list
1677. That now your gode werk be wist;
1678. And yet ye shul han better loos,
1679. Right in dispyt of alle your foos,

1685. That through the world hir fame go
1686. Al esely, and not to faste,
1687. That hit be knowen atte laste.'
1688. `Ful gladly, lady myn,' he seyde;
1689. And out his trumpe of golde he brayde
1690. Anon, and sette hit to his mouthe,
1691. And blew hit est, and west, and southe,
1692. And north, as loude as any thunder,
1693. That every wight hadde of hit wonder,
1694. So brode hit ran, or than hit stente,
1695. And, certes, al the breeth that wente
1696. Out of his trumpes mouthe smelde
1697. As men a pot-ful bawme helde
1698. Among a basket ful of roses;
1699. This favour dide he til hir loses.
1700. And right with this I gan aspye,
1701. Ther com the ferthe companye --
1702. But certeyn they were wonder fewe --
1703. And gonne stonden in a rewe,
1704. And seyden, `Certes, lady brighte,
1705. We han don wel with al our mighte;
1706. But we ne kepen have no fame.
1707. Hyd our werkes and our name,

1710. And for no maner other thing.'
1711. `I graunte yow al your asking,'
1712. Quod she; `let your werk be deed.'
1713. With that aboute I clew myn heed,
1714. And saugh anoon the fifte route
1715. That to this lady gonne loute,
1716. And doun on knes anoon to falle;
1717. And to hir tho besoughten alle
1718. To hyde hit gode werkes eek,
1719. And seyde, they yeven noght a leek
1720. For fame, ne for swich renoun;
1721. For they, for contemplacioun
1722. And goddes love, hadde y-wrought;
1723. Ne of fame wolde they nought.
1724. `What?' quod she, `and be ye wood?
1725. And wene ye for to do good,
1726. And for to have of that no fame?
1727. Have ye dispyt to have my name?
1728. Nay, ye shul liven everichoon!
1729. Blow thy trumpe and that anoon,'
1730. Quod she, `thou Eolus, I hote,
1731. And ring this folkes werk by note,
1732. That al the world may of hit here.'
1733. And he gan blowe hir loos so clere
1734. In his golden clarioun
1735. That through the world wente the soun,
1736. Also kenely, and eek so softe;
1737. But atte laste hit was on-lofte.
1738. Thoo com the sexte companye,

1777. And blow as they han axed me,

1780. This Eolus gan hit so blowe
1781. That through the world hit was y-knowe.
1782. Tho come the seventh route anoon,
1783. And fel on knees everichoon,
1784. And seyde, `Lady, graunte us sone

1813. He gan to blasen out a soun,
1814. As loude as belweth wind in helle.
1815. And eek therwith, the sooth to telle,
1816. This soun was al so ful of Iapes,
1817. As ever mowes were in apes.
1818. And that wente al the world aboute,

1853. `Madame,' quod he, `sooth to telle,
1854. I am that ilke shrewe, y-wis,
1855. That brende the temple of Isidis
1856. In Athenes, lo, that citee.'
1857. `And wherfor didest thou so?' quod she.
1858. `By my thrift,' quod he, `madame,
1859. I wolde fayn han had a fame,
1860. As other folk hadde in the toun,
1861. Al-thogh they were of greet renoun
1862. For hir vertu and for hir thewes;
1863. Thoughte I, as greet a fame han shrewes,
1864. Thogh hit be but for shrewednesse,
1865. As gode folk han for goodnesse;
1866. And sith I may not have that oon,
1867. That other nil I noght for-goon.
1868. And for to gette of Fames hyre,
1869. The temple sette I al a-fyre.

1881. Me thoughte goodly to me spak,
1882. And seyde, `Frend, what is thy name?
1883. Artow come hider to han fame?'
1884. `Nay, for-sothe, frend!' quod I;
1885. I cam noght hider, graunt mercy!
1886. For no swich cause, by my heed!
1887. Suffyceth me, as I were deed,
1888. That no wight have my name in honde.
1889. I woot my-self best how I stonde;
1890. For what I drye or what I thinke,
1891. I wol my-selven al hit drinke,
1892. Certeyn, for the more part,
1893. As ferforth as I can myn art.'
1894. `But what dost thou here than?' quod he.
1895. Quod I, `that wol I tellen thee,

1918. `Whiche be, lo, these tydinges,
1919. That thou now thus hider bringes,
1920. That thou hast herd?' quod he to me;
1921. `But now, no fors; for wel I see

1928. Out of the castel, soth to seye.
1929. Tho saugh I stonde in a valeye,

1942. And the noyse which that I herde,
1943. For al the world right so hit ferde,
1944. As doth the routing of the stoon
1945. That from thengyn is leten goon.
1946. And al this hous, of whiche I rede,
1947. Was made of twigges, falwe, rede,
1948. And grene eek, and som weren whyte,
1949. Swiche as men to these cages thwyte,
1950. Or maken of these paniers,
1951. Or elles hottes or dossers;
1952. That, for the swough and for the twigges,
1953. This hous was also ful of gigges,
1954. And also ful eek a chirkinges,
1955. And of many other werkinges;
1956. And eek this hous hath of entrees
1957. As fele as of leves been on trees
1958. In somer, whan they grene been;
1959. And on the roof men may yit seen
1960. A thousand holes, and wel mo,
1961. To leten wel the soun out go.
1962. And by day, in every tyde,
1963. Ben al the dores open wyde,
1964. And by night, echoon unshette;
1965. Ne porter ther is non to lette
1966. No maner tydings in to pace;
1967. Ne never reste is in that place,
1968. That hit nis fild ful of tydinges,
1969. Other loude, or of whispringes;
1970. And, over alle the houses angles,
1971. Is ful of rouninges and of Iangles
1972. Of werre, of pees, of mariages,
1973. Of reste, of labour, of viages,
1974. Of abood, of deeth, of lyfe,
1975. Of love, of hate, acorde, of stryfe,
1976. Of loos, of lore, and of winninges,
1977. Of hele, of sekenesse, of bildinges,
1978. Of faire windes, of tempestes,
1979. Of qualme of folk, and eek of bestes;
1980. Of dyvers transmutaciouns
1981. Of estats, and eek of regiouns;
1982. Of trust, of drede, of Ielousye,
1983. Of wit, of winninge, of folye;
1984. Of plentee, and of greet famyne,
1985. Of chepe, of derth, and of ruyne;
1986. Of good or mis governement,
1987. Of fyr, of dyvers accident.
1988. And lo, this hous, of whiche I wryte,
1989. Siker be ye, hit nas not lyte;
1990. For hit was sixty myle of lengthe;
1991. Al was the timber of no strengthe,
1992. Yet hit is founded to endure
1993. Whyl that hit list to Aventure,
1994. That is the moder of tydinges,
1995. As the see of welles and springes, --
1996. And hit was shapen lyk a cage.
1997. `Certes,' quod I, `in al myn age,
1998. Ne saugh I swich a hous as this.'
1999. And as I wondred me, y-wis,
2000. Upon this hous, tho war was I
2001. How that myn egle, faste by,
2002. Was perched hye upon a stoon;
2003. And I gan streighte to him goon,
2004. And seyde thus: `I preye thee
2005. That thou a whyl abyde me
2006. For goddes love, and let me seen
2007. What wondres in this place been;
2008. For yit, paraventure, I may lere
2009. Som good ther-on, or sumwhat here
2010. That leef me were, or that I wente.'
2011. `Peter! that is myn entente,'
2012. Quod he to me; `therfor I dwelle;
2013. But certein, oon thing I thee telle,
2014. That, but I bringe thee ther-inne,
2015. Ne shalt thou never cunne ginne
2016. To come in-to hit, out of doute,
2017. So faste hit whirleth, lo, aboute.
2018. But sith that Ioves, of his grace,
2019. As I have seyd, wol thee solace
2020. Fynally with swiche thinges,
2021. Uncouthe sightes and tydinges,
2022. To passe with thyn hevinesse;
2023. Suche routhe hath he of thy distresse,
2024. That thou suffrest debonairly --
2025. And wost thy-selven utterly
2026. Disesperat of alle blis,
2027. Sith that Fortune hath maad a-mis
2028. The fruit of al thyn hertes reste
2029. Languisshe and eek in point to breste --
2030. That he, through his mighty meryte,
2031. Wol do thee ese, al be hit lyte,
2032. And yaf expres commaundement,
2033. To whiche I am obedient,
2034. To furthre thee with al my might,
2035. And wisse and teche thee aright
2036. Wher thou maist most tydinges here;
2037. Shaltow anoon heer many oon lere.'
2038. With this worde he, right anoon,
2039. Hente me up bitwene his toon,
2040. And at a windowe in me broghte,
2041. That in this hous was, as me thoghte --
2042. And ther-withal, me thoughte hit stente,
2043. And no-thing hit aboute wente --
2044. And me sette in the flore adoun.
2045. But which a congregacioun
2046. Of folk, as I saugh rome aboute
2047. Some within and some withoute,
2048. Nas never seen, ne shal ben eft;
2049. That, certes, in the world nis left
2050. So many formed by Nature,
2051. Ne deed so many a creature;
2052. That wel unnethe, in that place,
2053. Hadde I oon foot-brede of space;
2054. And every wight that I saugh there
2055. Rouned ech in others ere
2056. A newe tyding prevely,
2057. Or elles tolde al openly
2058. Right thus, and seyde: `Nost not thou
2059. That is betid, lo, late or now?'
2060. `No,' quod the other, `tel me what;' --
2061. And than he tolde him this and that,
2062. And swoor ther-to that hit was sooth --
2063. `Thus hath he seyd,'-- and `Thus he dooth' --
2064. `Thus shal hit be,' -- `Thus herde I seye' --
2065. `That shal he found' -- `That dar I leye:' --
2066. That al the folk that is a-lyve
2067. Ne han the cunning to discryve
2068. The thinges that I herde there,
2069. What aloude, and what in ere.
2070. But al the wonder-most was this: --
2071. Whan oon had herd a thing, y-wis,
2072. He com forth to another wight,
2073. And gan him tellen, anoon-right,
2074. The same that to him was told,
2075. Or hit a furlong-way was old,
2076. But gan somwhat for to eche
2077. To this tyding in this speche
2078. More than hit ever was.
2079. And nat so sone departed nas
2080. That he fro him, that he ne mette
2081. With the thridde; and, or he lette
2082. Any stounde, he tolde him als;
2083. Were the tyding sooth or fals,
2084. Yit wolde he telle hit nathelees,
2085. And evermo with more encrees
2086. Than hit was erst. Thus north and southe
2087. Went every word fro mouth to mouthe,
2088. And that encresing ever-mo,
2089. As fyr is wont to quikke and go
2090. From a sparke spronge amis,
2091. Til al a citee brent up is.
2092. And whan that was ful y-spronge,
2093. And woxen more on every tonge
2094. Than ever hit was, hit wente anoon
2095. Up to a windowe, out to goon;
2096. Or, but hit mighte out ther pace,
2097. Hit gan out crepe at som crevace,
2098. And fleigh forth faste for the nones.
2099. And somtyme saugh I tho, at ones,
2100. A lesing and a sad soth-sawe,
2101. That gonne of aventure drawe
2102. Out at a windowe for to pace;
2103. And, when they metten in that place,
2104. They were a-chekked bothe two,
2105. And neither of hem moste out go;
2106. For other so they gonne croude,
2107. Til eche of hem gan cryen loude,
2108. `Lat me go first!' -- `Nay, but let me!
2109. And here I wol ensuren thee
2110. With the nones that thou wolt do so,
2111. That I shal never fro thee go,
2112. But be thyn owne sworen brother!
2113. We wil medle us ech with other,
2114. That no man, be he never so wrothe,
2115. Shal han that oon of two, but bothe
2116. At ones, al beside his leve,
2117. Come we a-morwe or on eve,
2118. Be we cryed or stille y-rouned.'
2119. Thus saugh I fals and sooth compouned
2120. Togeder flee for oo tydinge.
2121. Thus out at holes gonne wringe
2122. Every tyding streight to Fame;
2123. And she gan yeven eche his name,
2124. After hir disposicioun,
2125. And yaf hem eek duracioun,
2126. Some to wexe and wane sone,
2127. As dooth the faire, whyte mone,
2128. And leet hem gon. Ther might I seen
2129. Wenged wondres faste fleen,
2130. Twenty thousand in a route,
2131. As Eolus hem blew aboute.
2132. And, lord! this hous, in alle tymes,
2133. Was ful of shipmen and pilgrymes,
2134. With scrippes bret-ful of lesinges,
2135. Entremedled with tydinges,
2136. And eek alone by hem-selve.
2137. O, many a thousand tymes twelve
2138. Saugh I eek of these pardoneres,
2139. Currours, and eek messangeres,
2140. With boistes crammed ful of lyes
2141. As ever vessel was with lyes.
2142. And as I alther-fastest wente
2143. Aboute, and dide al myn entente
2144. Me for to pleye and for to lere,
2145. And eek a tyding for to here,
2146. That I had herd of som contree
2147. That shal not now be told for me; --
2148. For hit no nede is, redely;
2149. Folk can singe hit bet than I;
2150. For al mot out, other late or rathe,
2151. Alle the sheves in the lathe; --
2152. I herde a gret noise withalle
2153. In a corner of the halle,
2154. Ther men of love tydings tolde,
2155. And I gan thiderward beholde;
2156. For I saugh renninge every wight,
2157. As faste as that they hadden might;
2158. And everich cryed, `What thing is that?'
2159. And som seyde, `I not never what,'
2160. And whan they were alle on an hepe,
2161. Tho behinde gonne up lepe,
2162. And clamben up on othere faste,
2163. And up the nose and hye caste,
2164. And troden faste on othere heles,
2165. And stampe, as men don after eles.
2166. Atte laste I saugh a man,
2167. Which that I nevene naught ne can;
2168. But he semed for to be
2169. A man of greet auctoritee...
