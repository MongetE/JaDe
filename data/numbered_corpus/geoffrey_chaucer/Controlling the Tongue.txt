1. My son, keep well thy tongue, and keep thy friend.
2. A wicked tongue is worse than a fiend;
3. My son, from a fiend men may them bless.
4. My son, God of his endless goodness
5. Walled a tongue with teeth and lips eke,
6. For man should him avise what he speak.
7. My son, full oft, for too much speech
8. Hath many a man been spilt, as clerkes teach;
9. But for little speech avisely
10. Is no man shent, to speak generally.
11. My son, thy tongue shouldst thou restrain
12. At all time, but when thou dost thy pain
13. To speak of God, in honour and prayer.
14. The first virtue, son, if thou wilt lere,
15. Is to restrain and keep well thy tongue;
16. Thus learn children when that they been young.
17. My son, of muckle speaking evil-avised,
18. Where less speaking had enough sufficed,
19. Cometh muckle harm; thus was me told and taught.
20. In muckle speech sin wanteth nought.
21. Wost thou whereof a rakel tongue serveth?
22. Right as a sword forcutteth and forcarveth
23. An arm a-two, my dear son, right so
24. A tongue cutteth friendship all a-two.
