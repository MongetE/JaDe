1. WHEN said was this miracle, every man
2. As sober* was, that wonder was to see,                     *serious
3. Till that our Host to japen* he began,                *talk lightly
4. And then *at erst* he looked upon me,          *for the first time*
5. And saide thus; 'What man art thou?' quoth he;
6. 'Thou lookest as thou wouldest find an hare,
7. For ever on the ground I see thee stare.

8. 'Approache near, and look up merrily.
9. Now ware you, Sirs, and let this man have place.
10. He in the waist is shapen as well as I; 
11. This were a puppet in an arm t'embrace
12. For any woman small and fair of face.
13. He seemeth elvish* by his countenance,               *surly, morose
14. For unto no wight doth he dalliance.

15. 'Say now somewhat, since other folk have said;
16. Tell us a tale of mirth, and that anon.'
17. 'Hoste,' quoth I, 'be not evil apaid,*                *dissatisfied
18. For other tale certes can* I none,                            *know
19. Eut of a rhyme I learned yore* agone.'                        *long
20. 'Yea, that is good,' quoth he; 'now shall we hear
21. Some dainty thing, me thinketh by thy cheer.'

22. THE TALE 


23. The First Fit*                                         *part

24. Listen, lordings, in good intent,
25. And I will tell you verrament*                               *truly
26. Of mirth and of solas,*                            *delight, solace
27. All of a knight was fair and gent,*                         *gentle
28. In battle and in tournament,
29. His name was Sir Thopas.

30. Y-born he was in far country,
31. In Flanders, all beyond the sea,
32. At Popering  in the place;
33. His father was a man full free,
34. And lord he was of that country,
35. As it was Godde's grace. 

36. Sir Thopas was a doughty swain,
37. White was his face as paindemain, 
38. His lippes red as rose.
39. His rode* is like scarlet in grain,                     *complexion
40. And I you tell in good certain
41. He had a seemly nose.

42. His hair, his beard, was like saffroun,
43. That to his girdle reach'd adown,
44. His shoes of cordewane:
45. Of Bruges were his hosen brown;
46. His robe was of ciclatoun,
47. That coste many a jane.

48. He coulde hunt at the wild deer,
49. And ride on hawking *for rivere*                     *by the river*
50. With gray goshawk on hand: 
51. Thereto he was a good archere,
52. Of wrestling was there none his peer,
53. Where any ram  should stand.

54. Full many a maiden bright in bow'r
55. They mourned for him par amour,
56. When them were better sleep;
57. But he was chaste, and no lechour,
58. And sweet as is the bramble flow'r
59. That beareth the red heep.*                                    *hip

60. And so it fell upon a day,
61. For sooth as I you telle may,
62. Sir Thopas would out ride;
63. He worth* upon his steede gray,                            *mounted
64. And in his hand a launcegay,*                           *spear 
65. A long sword by his side.

66. He pricked through a fair forest,
67. Wherein is many a wilde beast,
68. Yea, bothe buck and hare;
69. And as he pricked north and east,
70. I tell it you, him had almest                               *almost
71. Betid* a sorry care.                                      *befallen

72. There sprange herbes great and small,
73. The liquorice and the setewall,*                          *valerian
74. And many a clove-gilofre, 
75. And nutemeg to put in ale,
76. Whether it be moist* or stale,                                 *new
77. Or for to lay in coffer.

78. The birdes sang, it is no nay,
79. The sperhawk* and the popinjay,**        *sparrowhawk **parrot 
80. That joy it was to hear;
81. The throstle-cock made eke his lay,
82. The woode-dove upon the spray
83. She sang full loud and clear.

84. Sir Thopas fell in love-longing
85. All when he heard the throstle sing,
86. And *prick'd as he were wood;*                       *rode as if he
87. His faire steed in his pricking were mad*
88. So sweated, that men might him wring,
89. His sides were all blood.

90. Sir Thopas eke so weary was
91. For pricking on the softe grass,
92. So fierce was his corage,*                     *inclination, spirit
93. That down he laid him in that place,
94. To make his steed some solace,
95. And gave him good forage.

96. 'Ah, Saint Mary, ben'dicite,
97. What aileth thilke* love at me                                *this
98. To binde me so sore?
99. Me dreamed all this night, pardie,
100. An elf-queen shall my leman* be,                          *mistress
101. And sleep under my gore.*                                    *shirt

102. An elf-queen will I love, y-wis,*                        *assuredly
103. For in this world no woman is
104. Worthy to be my make*                                         *mate
105. In town;
106. All other women I forsake,
107. And to an elf-queen I me take
108. By dale and eke by down.' 

109. Into his saddle he clomb anon,
110. And pricked over stile and stone
111. An elf-queen for to spy,
112. Till he so long had ridden and gone,
113. That he found in a privy wonne*                              *haunt
114. The country of Faery,
115. So wild;
116. For in that country was there none
117. That to him durste ride or gon,
118. Neither wife nor child.

119. Till that there came a great giaunt,
120. His name was Sir Oliphaunt,
121. A perilous man of deed;
122. He saide, 'Child,* by Termagaunt,                    *young man
123. *But if* thou prick out of mine haunt,                      *unless
124. Anon I slay thy steed
125. With mace.
126. Here is the Queen of Faery,
127. With harp, and pipe, and symphony,
128. Dwelling in this place.'

129. The Child said, 'All so may I the,*                         *thrive
130. To-morrow will I meete thee,
131. When I have mine armor;
132. And yet I hope, *par ma fay,*                         *by my faith*
133. That thou shalt with this launcegay
134. Abyen* it full sore;                                    *suffer for
135. Thy maw*                                         *belly
136. Shall I pierce, if I may,
137. Ere it be fully prime of day,
138. For here thou shalt be slaw.'*                               *slain

139. Sir Thopas drew aback full fast;
140. This giant at him stones cast
141. Out of a fell staff sling:
142. But fair escaped Child Thopas,
143. And all it was through Godde's grace,
144. And through his fair bearing. 

145. Yet listen, lordings, to my tale,
146. Merrier than the nightingale,
147. For now I will you rown,*                                  *whisper
148. How Sir Thopas, with sides smale,*                      *small 
149. Pricking over hill and dale,
150. Is come again to town.

151. His merry men commanded he
152. To make him both game and glee;
153. For needes must he fight
154. With a giant with heades three,
155. For paramour and jollity
156. Of one that shone full bright.

157. '*Do come,*' he saide, 'my minstrales                      *summon*
158. And gestours* for to telle tales.                    *story-tellers
159. Anon in mine arming,
160. Of romances that be royales, 
161. Of popes and of cardinales,
162. And eke of love-longing.'

163. They fetch'd him first the sweete wine,
164. And mead eke in a maseline,*                         *drinking-bowl
165. And royal spicery; of maple wood 
166. Of ginger-bread that was full fine,
167. And liquorice and eke cumin,
168. With sugar that is trie.*                                  *refined

169. He didde,* next his white lere,**                    *put on **skin
170. Of cloth of lake* fine and clear,                       *fine linen
171. A breech and eke a shirt;
172. And next his shirt an haketon,*                            *cassock
173. And over that an habergeon,*                          *coat of mail
174. For piercing of his heart;

175. And over that a fine hauberk,*                        *plate-armour
176. Was all y-wrought of Jewes'* werk,                      *magicians'
177. Full strong it was of plate;
178. And over that his coat-armour,*                   *knight's surcoat
179. As white as is the lily flow'r, 
180. In which he would debate.*                                   *fight

181. His shield was all of gold so red
182. And therein was a boare's head,
183. A charboucle* beside;                               *carbuncle 
184. And there he swore on ale and bread,
185. How that the giant should be dead,
186. Betide whatso betide.

187. His jambeaux* were of cuirbouly,                         *boots
188. His sworde's sheath of ivory,
189. His helm of latoun* bright,                                  *brass
190. His saddle was of rewel  bone,
191. His bridle as the sunne shone,
192. Or as the moonelight.

193. His speare was of fine cypress,
194. That bodeth war, and nothing peace;
195. The head full sharp y-ground.
196. His steede was all dapple gray,
197. It went an amble in the way
198. Full softely and round
199. In land.

200. Lo, Lordes mine, here is a fytt;
201. If ye will any more of it,
202. To tell it will I fand.*                                       *try


203. The Second Fit


204. Now hold your mouth for charity,
205. Bothe knight and lady free,
206. And hearken to my spell;*                                *tale 
207. Of battle and of chivalry,
208. Of ladies' love and druerie,*                            *gallantry
209. Anon I will you tell.

210. Men speak of romances of price*                     * worth, esteem
211. Of Horn Child, and of Ipotis,
212. Of Bevis, and Sir Guy, 
213. Of Sir Libeux,  and Pleindamour,
214. But Sir Thopas, he bears the flow'r
215. Of royal chivalry.

216. His goode steed he all bestrode,
217. And forth upon his way he glode,*                            *shone
218. As sparkle out of brand;*                                    *torch
219. Upon his crest he bare a tow'r,
220. And therein stick'd a lily flow'r; 
221. God shield his corse* from shand!**                    *body **harm

222. And, for he was a knight auntrous,*                    *adventurous
