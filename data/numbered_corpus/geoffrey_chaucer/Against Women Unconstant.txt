1. Madame, for youre newefangelnesse,
2. Many a servant have ye put out of grace.
3. I take my leve of your unstedefastnesse,
4. For wel I woot, whil ye have lives space,
5. Ye can not love ful half yeer in a place,
6. To newe thing youre lust is ay so keene;
7. In stede of blew, thus may ye were al greene.Right as a mirour nothing may enpresse,
8. But, lightly as it cometh, so mote it pace,
9. So fareth youre love, youre werkes bereth witnesse.
10. Ther is no faith that may your herte enbrace;
11. But, as a wedercok, that turneth his face
12. With every wind, ye fare, and this is seene;
13. In stede of blew, thus may ye were al greene.
14. Ye might be shrined, for youre brothelnesse,
15. Bet that Dalida, Criseide or Candace;
16. For ever in chaunging stant youre sikernesse;
17. That tache may no wight fro yuor herte arace.
18. If ye lese oon, ye can wel twain purchace;
19. Al light for somer, ye woot wel what I mene,
20. In stede of blew, thus may ye were al greene.
