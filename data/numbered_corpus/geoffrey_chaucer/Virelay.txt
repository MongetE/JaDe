1. Alone walking
2. In thought plaining,
3. And sore sighing;
4. All desolate,
5. Me rememb'ring
6. Of my living;
7. My death wishing
8. Both early and late.

9. Infortunate
10. Is so my fate,
11. That, wot ye what?
12. Out of measure
13. My life I hate;
14. Thus desperate,
15. In such poor estate,
16. Do I endure.

17. Of other cure
18. Am I not sure;
19. Thus to endure
20. Is hard, certain;
21. Such is my ure,
22. I you ensure;
23. What creature
24. May have more pain?

25. My truth so plain
26. Is taken in vain,
27. And great disdain
28. In remembrance;
29. Yet I full fain
30. Would me complain,
31. Me to abstain
32. From this penance.

33. But, in substance,
34. None alleggeance
35. Of my grievance
36. Can I not find;
37. Right so my chance,
38. With displeasance,
39. Doth me advance;
40. And thus an end.
