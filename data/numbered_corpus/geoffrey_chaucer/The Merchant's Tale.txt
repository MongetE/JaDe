1. 'Weeping and wailing, care and other sorrow,
2. I have enough, on even and on morrow,'
3. Quoth the Merchant, 'and so have other mo',
4. That wedded be; I trow* that it be so;                     *believe
5. For well I wot it fareth so by me.
6. I have a wife, the worste that may be,
7. For though the fiend to her y-coupled were,
8. She would him overmatch, I dare well swear.
9. Why should I you rehearse in special
10. Her high malice? she is *a shrew at all.*           *thoroughly, in
11. There is a long and large difference everything wicked*
12. Betwixt Griselda's greate patience,
13. And of my wife the passing cruelty.
14. Were I unbounden, all so may I the,*                        *thrive
15. I woulde never eft* come in the snare.                       *again
16. We wedded men live in sorrow and care;
17. Assay it whoso will, and he shall find
18. That I say sooth, by Saint Thomas of Ind,
19. As for the more part; I say not all, -
20. God shielde* that it shoulde so befall.                     *forbid
21. Ah! good Sir Host, I have y-wedded be
22. These moneths two, and more not, pardie;
23. And yet I trow* that he that all his life                  *believe
24. Wifeless hath been, though that men would him rive*          *wound
25. Into the hearte, could in no mannere
26. Telle so much sorrow, as I you here
27. Could tellen of my wife's cursedness.'*                 *wickedness

28. 'Now,' quoth our Host, 'Merchant, so God you bless,
29. Since ye so muche knowen of that art,
30. Full heartily I pray you tell us part.'
31. 'Gladly,' quoth he; 'but of mine owen sore,
32. For sorry heart, I telle may no more.'


33. THE TALE.


34. Whilom there was dwelling in Lombardy
35. A worthy knight, that born was at Pavie,
36. In which he liv'd in great prosperity;
37. And forty years a wifeless man was he,
38. And follow'd aye his bodily delight
39. On women, where as was his appetite,
40. As do these fooles that be seculeres.
41. And, when that he was passed sixty years,
42. Were it for holiness, or for dotage,
43. I cannot say, but such a great corage*                 *inclination
44. Hadde this knight to be a wedded man,
45. That day and night he did all that he can
46. To espy where that he might wedded be;
47. Praying our Lord to grante him, that he
48. Mighte once knowen of that blissful life
49. That is betwixt a husband and his wife,
50. And for to live under that holy bond
51. With which God firste man and woman bond.
52. 'None other life,' said he, 'is worth a bean;
53. For wedlock is so easy, and so clean,
54. That in this world it is a paradise.'
55. Thus said this olde knight, that was so wise.
56. And certainly, as sooth* as God is king,                      *true
57. To take a wife it is a glorious thing,
58. And namely* when a man is old and hoar,                 *especially
59. Then is a wife the fruit of his treasor;
60. Then should he take a young wife and a fair,
61. On which he might engender him an heir,
62. And lead his life in joy and in solace;*            *mirth, delight
63. Whereas these bachelors singen 'Alas!'
64. When that they find any adversity
65. In love, which is but childish vanity.
66. And truely it sits* well to be so,                 *becomes, befits
67. That bachelors have often pain and woe:
68. On brittle ground they build, and brittleness
69. They finde when they *weene sickerness:*          *think that there
70. They live but as a bird or as a beast, is security*
71. In liberty, and under no arrest;*                   *check, control
72. Whereas a wedded man in his estate
73. Liveth a life blissful and ordinate,
74. Under the yoke of marriage y-bound;
75. Well may his heart in joy and bliss abound.
76. For who can be so buxom* as a wife?                       *obedient
77. Who is so true, and eke so attentive
78. To keep* him, sick and whole, as is his make?**        *care for **mate
79. For weal or woe she will him not forsake:
80. She is not weary him to love and serve,
81. Though that he lie bedrid until he sterve.*                    *die
82. And yet some clerkes say it is not so;
83. Of which he, Theophrast, is one of tho:*                     *those
84. *What force* though Theophrast list for to lie?       *what matter*

85. 'Take no wife,' quoth he,  'for husbandry,*              *thrift
86. As for to spare in household thy dispence;
87. A true servant doth more diligence
88. Thy good to keep, than doth thine owen wife,
89. For she will claim a half part all her life.
90. And if that thou be sick, so God me save,
91. Thy very friendes, or a true knave,*                       *servant
92. Will keep thee bet than she, that *waiteth aye         *ahways waits to
93. After thy good,* and hath done many a day.' inherit your property*
94. This sentence, and a hundred times worse,
95. Writeth this man, there God his bones curse.
96. But take no keep* of all such vanity,                       *notice
97. Defy* Theophrast, and hearken to me.                      *distrust

98. A wife is Godde's gifte verily;
99. All other manner giftes hardily,*                            *truly
100. As handes, rentes, pasture, or commune,*               *common land
101. Or mebles,* all be giftes of fortune,                *furniture 
102. That passen as a shadow on the wall:
103. But dread* thou not, if plainly speak I shall,               *doubt
104. A wife will last, and in thine house endure,
105. Well longer than thee list, paraventure.*                  *perhaps
106. Marriage is a full great sacrament;
107. He which that hath no wife, I hold him shent;*              *ruined
108. He liveth helpless, and all desolate
109. (I speak of folk *in secular estate*):                 *who are not
110. And hearken why, I say not this for nought, - of the clergy*
111. That woman is for manne's help y-wrought.
112. The highe God, when he had Adam maked,
113. And saw him all alone belly naked,
114. God of his greate goodness saide then,
115. Let us now make a help unto this man
116. Like to himself; and then he made him Eve.
117. Here may ye see, and hereby may ye preve,*                   *prove
118. That a wife is man s help and his comfort,
119. His paradise terrestre and his disport.
120. So buxom* and so virtuous is she,              *obedient, complying
121. They muste needes live in unity;
122. One flesh they be, and one blood, as I guess,
123. With but one heart in weal and in distress.
124. A wife? Ah! Saint Mary, ben'dicite,
125. How might a man have any adversity
126. That hath a wife? certes I cannot say
127. The bliss the which that is betwixt them tway,
128. There may no tongue it tell, or hearte think.
129. If he be poor, she helpeth him to swink;*                   *labour
130. She keeps his good, and wasteth never a deal;*                *whit
131. All that her husband list, her liketh* well;              *pleaseth
132. She saith not ones Nay, when he saith Yea;
133. 'Do this,' saith he; 'All ready, Sir,' saith she.
134. O blissful order, wedlock precious!
135. Thou art so merry, and eke so virtuous,
136. And so commended and approved eke,
137. That every man that holds him worth a leek
138. Upon his bare knees ought all his life
139. To thank his God, that him hath sent a wife;
140. Or elles pray to God him for to send
141. A wife, to last unto his life's end.
142. For then his life is set in sickerness,*                  *security
143. He may not be deceived, as I guess,
144. So that he work after his wife's rede;*                    *counsel
145. Then may he boldely bear up his head,
146. They be so true, and therewithal so wise.
147. For which, if thou wilt worken as the wise,
148. Do alway so as women will thee rede. *                     *counsel
149. Lo how that Jacob, as these clerkes read,
150. By good counsel of his mother Rebecc'
151. Bounde the kiddes skin about his neck;
152. For which his father's benison* he wan.                *benediction
153. Lo Judith, as the story telle can,
154. By good counsel she Godde's people kept,
155. And slew him, Holofernes, while he slept.
156. Lo Abigail, by good counsel, how she
157. Saved her husband Nabal, when that he
158. Should have been slain. And lo, Esther also
159. By counsel good deliver'd out of woe
160. The people of God, and made him, Mardoche,
161. Of Assuere enhanced* for to be.                *advanced in dignity
162. There is nothing *in gree superlative*           *of higher esteem*
163. (As saith Senec) above a humble wife.
164. Suffer thy wife's tongue, as Cato bit;*                        *bid
165. She shall command, and thou shalt suffer it,
166. And yet she will obey of courtesy.
167. A wife is keeper of thine husbandry:
168. Well may the sicke man bewail and weep,
169. There as there is no wife the house to keep.
170. I warne thee, if wisely thou wilt wirch,*                     *work
171. Love well thy wife, as Christ loveth his church:
172. Thou lov'st thyself, if thou lovest thy wife.
173. No man hateth his flesh, but in his life
174. He fost'reth it; and therefore bid I thee
175. Cherish thy wife, or thou shalt never the.*                 *thrive
176. Husband and wife, what *so men jape or play,*        *although men joke
177. Of worldly folk holde the sicker* way; and jeer* *certain
178. They be so knit there may no harm betide,
179. And namely* upon the wife's side.                      * especially

180. For which this January, of whom I told,
181. Consider'd hath within his dayes old,
182. The lusty life, the virtuous quiet,
183. That is in marriage honey-sweet.
184. And for his friends upon a day he sent
185. To tell them the effect of his intent.
186. With face sad,* his tale he hath them told:         *grave, earnest
187. He saide, 'Friendes, I am hoar and old,
188. And almost (God wot) on my pitte's* brink,                 *grave's
189. Upon my soule somewhat must I think.
190. I have my body foolishly dispended,
191. Blessed be God that it shall be amended;
192. For I will be certain a wedded man,
193. And that anon in all the haste I can,
194. Unto some maiden, fair and tender of age;
195. I pray you shape* for my marriage               * arrange, contrive
196. All suddenly, for I will not abide:
197. And I will fond* to espy, on my side,                          *try
198. To whom I may be wedded hastily.
199. But forasmuch as ye be more than,
200. Ye shalle rather* such a thing espy
201. Than I, and where me best were to ally.
202. But one thing warn I you, my friendes dear,
203. I will none old wife have in no mannere:
204. She shall not passe sixteen year certain.
205. Old fish and younge flesh would I have fain.
206. Better,' quoth he, 'a pike than a pickerel,*            *young pike
207. And better than old beef is tender veal.
208. I will no woman thirty year of age,
209. It is but beanestraw and great forage.
210. And eke these olde widows (God it wot)
211. They conne* so much craft on Wade's boat,                  *know
212. *So muche brooke harm when that them lest,*        *they can do so much
213. That with them should I never live in rest. harm when they wish*
214. For sundry schooles make subtle clerkes;
215. Woman of many schooles half a clerk is.
216. But certainly a young thing men may guy,*                    *guide
217. Right as men may warm wax with handes ply.*             *bend,mould
218. Wherefore I say you plainly in a clause,
219. I will none old wife have, right for this cause.
220. For if so were I hadde such mischance,
221. That I in her could have no pleasance,
222. Then should I lead my life in avoutrie,*                  *adultery
223. And go straight to the devil when I die.
224. Nor children should I none upon her getten:
225. Yet *were me lever* houndes had me eaten           *I would rather*
226. Than that mine heritage shoulde fall
227. In strange hands: and this I tell you all.
228. I doubte not I know the cause why
229. Men shoulde wed: and farthermore know I
230. There speaketh many a man of marriage
231. That knows no more of it than doth my page,
232. For what causes a man should take a wife.
233. If he ne may not live chaste his life,
234. Take him a wife with great devotion,
235. Because of lawful procreation
236. Of children, to th' honour of God above,
237. And not only for paramour or love;
238. And for they shoulde lechery eschew,
239. And yield their debte when that it is due:
240. Or for that each of them should help the other
241. In mischief,* as a sister shall the brother,               *trouble
242. And live in chastity full holily.
243. But, Sires, by your leave, that am not I,
244. For, God be thanked, I dare make avaunt,*                    *boast
245. I feel my limbes stark* and suffisant                       *strong
246. To do all that a man belongeth to:
247. I wot myselfe best what I may do.
248. Though I be hoar, I fare as doth a tree,
249. That blossoms ere the fruit y-waxen* be;                     *grown
250. The blossomy tree is neither dry nor dead;
251. I feel me now here hoar but on my head.
252. Mine heart and all my limbes are as green
253. As laurel through the year is for to seen.*                    *see
254. And, since that ye have heard all mine intent,
255. I pray you to my will ye would assent.'

256. Diverse men diversely him told
257. Of marriage many examples old;
258. Some blamed it, some praised it, certain;
259. But at the haste, shortly for to sayn
260. (As all day* falleth altercation             *constantly, every day
261. Betwixte friends in disputation),
262. There fell a strife betwixt his brethren two,
263. Of which that one was called Placebo,
264. Justinus soothly called was that other.

265. Placebo said; 'O January, brother,
266. Full little need have ye, my lord so dear,
267. Counsel to ask of any that is here:
268. But that ye be so full of sapience,
269. That you not liketh, for your high prudence,
270. To waive* from the word of Solomon.                *depart, deviate
271. This word said he unto us every one;
272. Work alle thing by counsel, - thus said he, -
273. And thenne shalt thou not repente thee
274. But though that Solomon spake such a word,
275. Mine owen deare brother and my lord,
276. So wisly* God my soule bring at rest,                       *surely
277. I hold your owen counsel is the best.
278. For, brother mine, take of me this motive; *    *advice, encouragement
279. I have now been a court-man all my life,
280. And, God it wot, though I unworthy be,
281. I have standen in full great degree
282. Aboute lordes of full high estate;
283. Yet had I ne'er with none of them debate;
284. I never them contraried truely.
285. I know well that my lord can* more than I;                   *knows
286. What that he saith I hold it firm and stable,
287. I say the same, or else a thing semblable.
288. A full great fool is any counsellor
289. That serveth any lord of high honour
290. That dare presume, or ones thinken it;
291. That his counsel should pass his lorde's wit.
292. Nay, lordes be no fooles by my fay.
293. Ye have yourselfe shewed here to day
294. So high sentence,* so holily and well          *judgment, sentiment
295. That I consent, and confirm *every deal*           *in every point*
296. Your wordes all, and your opinioun
297. By God, there is no man in all this town
298. Nor in Itale, could better have y-said.
299. Christ holds him of this counsel well apaid.*            *satisfied
300. And truely it is a high courage
301. Of any man that stopen* is in age,                    *advanced 
302. To take a young wife, by my father's kin;
303. Your hearte hangeth on a jolly pin.
304. Do now in this matter right as you lest,
305. For finally I hold it for the best.'

306. Justinus, that aye stille sat and heard,
307. Right in this wise to Placebo answer'd.
308. 'Now, brother mine, be patient I pray,
309. Since ye have said, and hearken what I say.
310. Senec, among his other wordes wise,
311. Saith, that a man ought him right well advise,*           *consider
312. To whom he gives his hand or his chattel.
313. And since I ought advise me right well
314. To whom I give my good away from me,
315. Well more I ought advise me, pardie,
316. To whom I give my body: for alway
317. I warn you well it is no childe's play
318. To take a wife without advisement.
319. Men must inquire (this is mine assent)
320. Whe'er she be wise, or sober, or dronkelew,*        *given to drink
321. Or proud, or any other ways a shrew,
322. A chidester,* or a waster of thy good,                     *a scold
323. Or rich or poor; or else a man is wood.*                       *mad
324. Albeit so, that no man finde shall
325. None in this world, that *trotteth whole in all,*          *is sound in
326. No man, nor beast, such as men can devise,* every point* *describe
327. But nathehess it ought enough suffice
328. With any wife, if so were that she had
329. More goode thewes* than her vices bad:                  * qualities
330. And all this asketh leisure to inquere.
331. For, God it wot, I have wept many a tear
332. Full privily, since I have had a wife.
333. Praise whoso will a wedded manne's life,
334. Certes, I find in it but cost and care,
335. And observances of all blisses bare.
336. And yet, God wot, my neighebours about,
337. And namely* of women many a rout,**           *especially **company
338. Say that I have the moste steadfast wife,
339. And eke the meekest one, that beareth life.
340. But I know best where wringeth* me my shoe,                *pinches
341. Ye may for me right as you like do
342. Advise you, ye be a man of age,
343. How that ye enter into marriage;
344. And namely* with a young wife and a fair,              * especially
345. By him that made water, fire, earth, air,
346. The youngest man that is in all this rout*                 *company
347. Is busy enough to bringen it about
348. To have his wife alone, truste me:
349. Ye shall not please her fully yeares three,
350. This is to say, to do her full pleasance.
351. A wife asketh full many an observance.
352. I pray you that ye be not *evil apaid.'*               *displeased*

353. 'Well,' quoth this January, 'and hast thou said?
354. Straw for thy Senec, and for thy proverbs,
355. I counte not a pannier full of herbs
356. Of schoole termes; wiser men than thou,
357. As thou hast heard, assented here right now
358. To my purpose: Placebo, what say ye?'
359. 'I say it is a cursed* man,' quoth he,         *ill-natured, wicked
360. 'That letteth* matrimony, sickerly.'                     *hindereth
361. And with that word they rise up suddenly,
362. And be assented fully, that he should
363. Be wedded when him list, and where he would.

364. High fantasy and curious business
365. From day to day gan in the soul impress*        *imprint themselves
366. Of January about his marriage
367. Many a fair shape, and many a fair visage
368. There passed through his hearte night by night.
369. As whoso took a mirror polish'd bright,
370. And set it in a common market-place,
371. Then should he see many a figure pace
372. By his mirror; and in the same wise
373. Gan January in his thought devise
374. Of maidens, which that dwelte him beside:
375. He wiste not where that he might abide.*          *stay, fix his choice
376. For if that one had beauty in her face,
377. Another stood so in the people's grace
378. For her sadness* and her benignity,                     *sedateness
379. That of the people greatest voice had she:
380. And some were rich and had a badde name.
381. But natheless, betwixt earnest and game,
382. He at the last appointed him on one,
383. And let all others from his hearte gon,
384. And chose her of his own authority;
385. For love is blind all day, and may not see.
386. And when that he was into bed y-brought,
387. He pourtray'd in his heart and in his thought
388. Her freshe beauty, and her age tender,
389. Her middle small, her armes long and slender,
390. Her wise governance, her gentleness,
391. Her womanly bearing, and her sadness.*                  *sedateness
392. And when that he *on her was condescended,*          *had selected her*
393. He thought his choice might not be amended;
394. For when that he himself concluded had,
395. He thought each other manne' s wit so bad,
396. That impossible it were to reply
397. Against his choice; this was his fantasy.
398. His friendes sent he to, at his instance,
399. And prayed them to do him that pleasance,
400. That hastily they would unto him come;
401. He would abridge their labour all and some:
402. Needed no more for them to go nor ride,
403. *He was appointed where he would abide.*       *he had definitively

404. Placebo came, and eke his friendes soon, made his choice*
405. And *alderfirst he bade them all a boon,*        *first of all he asked
406. That none of them no arguments would make a favour of them*
407. Against the purpose that he had y-take:
408. Which purpose was pleasant to God, said he,
409. And very ground of his prosperity.
410. He said, there was a maiden in the town,
411. Which that of beauty hadde great renown;
412. All* were it so she were of small degree,                 *although
413. Sufficed him her youth and her beauty;
414. Which maid, he said, he would have to his wife,
415. To lead in ease and holiness his life;
416. And thanked God, that he might have her all,
417. That no wight with his blisse parte* shall;           *have a share
418. And prayed them to labour in this need,
419. And shape that he faile not to speed:
420. For then, he said, his spirit was at ease.
421. 'Then is,' quoth he, 'nothing may me displease,
422. Save one thing pricketh in my conscience,
423. The which I will rehearse in your presence.
424. I have,' quoth he, 'heard said, full yore* ago,               *long
425. There may no man have perfect blisses two,
426. This is to say, on earth and eke in heaven.
427. For though he keep him from the sinne's seven,
428. And eke from every branch of thilke tree,
429. Yet is there so perfect felicity,
430. And so great *ease and lust,* in marriage,       *comfort and pleasure*
431. That ev'r I am aghast,* now in mine age            *ashamed, afraid
432. That I shall head now so merry a life,
433. So delicate, withoute woe or strife,
434. That I shall have mine heav'n on earthe here.
435. For since that very heav'n is bought so dear,
436. With tribulation and great penance,
437. How should I then, living in such pleasance
438. As alle wedded men do with their wives,
439. Come to the bliss where Christ *etern on live is?*   *lives eternally*
440. This is my dread;* and ye, my brethren tway,                 *doubt
441. Assoile* me this question, I you pray.'            *resolve, answer

442. Justinus, which that hated his folly,
443. Answer'd anon right in his japery;*           *mockery, jesting way
444. And, for he would his longe tale abridge,
445. He woulde no authority* allege,                      *written texts
446. But saide; 'Sir, so there be none obstacle
447. Other than this, God of his high miracle,
448. And of his mercy, may so for you wirch,*                      *work
449. That, ere ye have your rights of holy church,
450. Ye may repent of wedded manne's life,
451. In which ye say there is no woe nor strife:
452. And elles God forbid, *but if* he sent                      *unless
453. A wedded man his grace him to repent
454. Well often, rather than a single man.
455. And therefore, Sir, *the beste rede I can,* *this is the best counsel
456. Despair you not, but have in your memory, that I know*
457. Paraventure she may be your purgatory;
458. She may be Godde's means, and Godde's whip;
459. And then your soul shall up to heaven skip
460. Swifter than doth an arrow from a bow.
461. I hope to God hereafter ye shall know
462. That there is none so great felicity
463. In marriage, nor ever more shall be,
464. That you shall let* of your salvation;                      *hinder
465. So that ye use, as skill is and reason,
466. The lustes* of your wife attemperly,**          *pleasures **moderately
467. And that ye please her not too amorously,
468. And that ye keep you eke from other sin.
469. My tale is done, for my wit is but thin.
470. Be not aghast* hereof, my brother dear,            *aharmed, afraid
471. But let us waden out of this mattere,
472. The Wife of Bath, if ye have understand,
473. Of marriage, which ye have now in hand,
474. Declared hath full well in little space;
475. Fare ye now well, God have you in his grace.'

476. And with this word this Justin' and his brother
477. Have ta'en their leave, and each of them of other.
478. And when they saw that it must needes be,
479. They wroughte so, by sleight and wise treaty,
480. That she, this maiden, which that *Maius hight,*        *was named May*
481. As hastily as ever that she might,
482. Shall wedded be unto this January.
483. I trow it were too longe you to tarry,
484. If I told you of every *script and band*             *written bond*
485. By which she was feoffed in his hand;
486. Or for to reckon of her rich array
487. But finally y-comen is the day
488. That to the churche bothe be they went,
489. For to receive the holy sacrament,
490. Forth came the priest, with stole about his neck,
491. And bade her be like Sarah and Rebecc'
492. In wisdom and in truth of marriage;
493. And said his orisons, as is usage,
494. And crouched* them, and prayed God should them bless,          *crossed
495. And made all sicker* enough with holiness.                 *certain

496. Thus be they wedded with solemnity;
497. And at the feaste sat both he and she,
498. With other worthy folk, upon the dais.
499. All full of joy and bliss is the palace,
500. And full of instruments, and of vitaille, *         *victuals, food
501. The moste dainteous* of all Itale.                        *delicate
502. Before them stood such instruments of soun',
503. That Orpheus, nor of Thebes Amphioun,
504. Ne made never such a melody.
505. At every course came in loud minstrelsy,
506. That never Joab trumped for to hear,
507. Nor he, Theodomas, yet half so clear
508. At Thebes, when the city was in doubt.
509. Bacchus the wine them skinked* all about.               *poured 
510. And Venus laughed upon every wight
511. (For January was become her knight,
512. And woulde both assaye his courage
513. In liberty, and eke in marriage),
514. And with her firebrand in her hand about
515. Danced before the bride and all the rout.
516. And certainly I dare right well say this,
517. Hymeneus, that god of wedding is,
518. Saw never his life so merry a wedded man.
519. Hold thou thy peace, thou poet Marcian,
520. That writest us that ilke* wedding merry                      *same
521. Of her Philology and him Mercury,
522. And of the songes that the Muses sung;
523. Too small is both thy pen, and eke thy tongue
524. For to describen of this marriage.
525. When tender youth hath wedded stooping age,
526. There is such mirth that it may not be writ;
527. Assay it youreself, then may ye wit*                          *know
528. If that I lie or no in this mattere.

529. Maius, that sat with so benign a cheer,*               *countenance
530. Her to behold it seemed faerie;
531. Queen Esther never look'd with such an eye
532. On Assuere, so meek a look had she;
533. I may you not devise all her beauty;
534. But thus much of her beauty tell I may,
535. That she was hike the bright morrow of May
536. Full filled of all beauty and pleasance.
537. This January is ravish'd in a trance,
538. At every time he looked in her face;
539. But in his heart he gan her to menace,
540. That he that night in armes would her strain
541. Harder than ever Paris did Helene.
542. But natheless yet had he great pity
543. That thilke night offende her must he,
544. And thought, 'Alas, O tender creature,
545. Now woulde God ye mighte well endure
546. All my courage, it is so sharp and keen;
547. I am aghast* ye shall it not sustene.                       *afraid
548. But God forbid that I did all my might.
549. Now woulde God that it were waxen night,
550. And that the night would lasten evermo'.
551. I would that all this people were y-go.'*                *gone away
552. And finally he did all his labour,
553. As he best mighte, saving his honour,
554. To haste them from the meat in subtle wise.

555. The time came that reason was to rise;
556. And after that men dance, and drinke fast,
557. And spices all about the house they cast,
558. And full of joy and bliss is every man,
559. All but a squire, that highte Damian,
560. Who carv'd before the knight full many a day;
561. He was so ravish'd on his lady May,
562. That for the very pain he was nigh wood;*                      *mad
563. Almost he swelt* and swooned where he stood,               *fainted
564. So sore had Venus hurt him with her brand,
565. As that she bare it dancing in her hand.
566. And to his bed he went him hastily;
567. No more of him as at this time speak I;
568. But there I let him weep enough and plain,*                 *bewail
569. Till freshe May will rue upon his pain.
570. O perilous fire, that in the bedstraw breedeth!
571. O foe familiar,* that his service bedeth!**    *domestic  **offers
572. O servant traitor, O false homely hewe,*             *servant 
573. Like to the adder in bosom shy untrue,
574. God shield us alle from your acquaintance!
575. O January, drunken in pleasance
576. Of marriage, see how thy Damian,
577. Thine owen squier and thy boren* man,                    *born 
578. Intendeth for to do thee villainy:*             *dishonour, outrage
579. God grante thee thine *homehy foe* t' espy.    *enemy in the household*
580. For in this world is no worse pestilence
581. Than homely foe, all day in thy presence.

582. Performed hath the sun his arc diurn,*                       *daily
583. No longer may the body of him sojourn
584. On the horizon, in that latitude:
585. Night with his mantle, that is dark and rude,
586. Gan overspread the hemisphere about:
587. For which departed is this *lusty rout*          *pleasant company*
588. From January, with thank on every side.
589. Home to their houses lustily they ride,
590. Where as they do their thinges as them lest,
591. And when they see their time they go to rest.
592. Soon after that this hasty* January                          *eager
593. Will go to bed, he will no longer tarry.
594. He dranke hippocras, clarre, and vernage 
595. Of spices hot, to increase his courage;
596. And many a lectuary* had he full fine,                      *potion
597. Such as the cursed monk Dan Constantine
598. Hath written in his book *de Coitu;*        *of sexual intercourse*
599. To eat them all he would nothing eschew:
600. And to his privy friendes thus said he:
601. 'For Godde's love, as soon as it may be,
602. Let *voiden all* this house in courteous wise.'        *everyone leave*
603. And they have done right as he will devise.
604. Men drinken, and the travers* draw anon;                  *curtains
605. The bride is brought to bed as still as stone;
606. And when the bed was with the priest y-bless'd,
607. Out of the chamber every wight him dress'd,
608. And January hath fast in arms y-take
609. His freshe May, his paradise, his make.*                      *mate
610. He lulled her, he kissed her full oft;
611. With thicke bristles of his beard unsoft,
612. Like to the skin of houndfish,* sharp as brere**       *dogfish **briar
613. (For he was shav'n all new in his mannere),
614. He rubbed her upon her tender face,
615. And saide thus; 'Alas! I must trespace
616. To you, my spouse, and you greatly offend,
617. Ere time come that I will down descend.
618. But natheless consider this,' quoth he,
619. 'There is no workman, whatsoe'er he be,
620. That may both worke well and hastily:
621. This will be done at leisure perfectly.
622. It is *no force* how longe that we play;                *no matter*
623. In true wedlock coupled be we tway;
624. And blessed be the yoke that we be in,
625. For in our actes may there be no sin.
626. A man may do no sinne with his wife,
627. Nor hurt himselfe with his owen knife;
628. For we have leave to play us by the law.'

629. Thus labour'd he, till that the day gan daw,
630. And then he took a sop in fine clarre,
631. And upright in his bedde then sat he.
632. And after that he sang full loud and clear,
633. And kiss'd his wife, and made wanton cheer.
634. He was all coltish, full of ragerie *                   *wantonness
635. And full of jargon as a flecked pie.
636. The slacke skin about his necke shaked,
637. While that he sang, so chanted he and craked.*            *quavered
638. But God wot what that May thought in her heart,
639. When she him saw up sitting in his shirt
640. In his night-cap, and with his necke lean:
641. She praised not his playing worth a bean.
642. Then said he thus; 'My reste will I take
643. Now day is come, I may no longer wake;
644. And down he laid his head and slept till prime.
645. And afterward, when that he saw his time,
646. Up rose January, but freshe May
647. Helde her chamber till the fourthe day,
648. As usage is of wives for the best.
649. For every labour some time must have rest,
650. Or elles longe may he not endure;
651. This is to say, no life of creature,
652. Be it of fish, or bird, or beast, or man.

653. Now will I speak of woeful Damian,
654. That languisheth for love, as ye shall hear;
655. Therefore I speak to him in this manneare.
656. I say. 'O silly Damian, alas!
657. Answer to this demand, as in this case,
658. How shalt thou to thy lady, freshe May,
659. Telle thy woe? She will alway say nay;
660. Eke if thou speak, she will thy woe bewray; *               *betray
661. God be thine help, I can no better say.
662. This sicke Damian in Venus' fire
663. So burned that he died for desire;
664. For which he put his life *in aventure,*                  *at risk*
665. No longer might he in this wise endure;
666. But privily a penner* gan he borrow,                  *writing-case
667. And in a letter wrote he all his sorrow,
668. In manner of a complaint or a lay,
669. Unto his faire freshe lady May.
670. And in a purse of silk, hung on his shirt,
671. He hath it put, and laid it at his heart.

672. The moone, that at noon was thilke* day                       *that
673. That January had wedded freshe May,
674. In ten of Taure, was into Cancer glided;
675. So long had Maius in her chamber abided,
676. As custom is unto these nobles all.
677. A bride shall not eaten in the ball
678. Till dayes four, or three days at the least,
679. Y-passed be; then let her go to feast.
680. The fourthe day complete from noon to noon,
681. When that the highe masse was y-done,
682. In halle sat this January, and May,
683. As fresh as is the brighte summer's day.
684. And so befell, how that this goode man
685. Remember'd him upon this Damian.
686. And saide; 'Saint Mary, how may this be,
687. That Damian attendeth not to me?
688. Is he aye sick? or how may this betide?'
689. His squiers, which that stoode there beside,
690. Excused him, because of his sickness,
691. Which letted* him to do his business:                     *hindered
692. None other cause mighte make him tarry.
693. 'That me forthinketh,'* quoth this January         *grieves, causes
694. 'He is a gentle squier, by my truth; uneasiness
695. If that he died, it were great harm and ruth.
696. He is as wise, as discreet, and secre',*            *secret, trusty
697. As any man I know of his degree,
698. And thereto manly and eke serviceble,
699. And for to be a thrifty man right able.
700. But after meat, as soon as ever I may
701. I will myself visit him, and eke May,
702. To do him all the comfort that I can.'
703. And for that word him blessed every man,
704. That of his bounty and his gentleness
705. He woulde so comforten in sickness
706. His squier, for it was a gentle deed.

707. 'Dame,' quoth this January, 'take good heed,
708. At after meat, ye with your women all
709. (When that ye be in chamb'r out of this hall),
710. That all ye go to see this Damian:
711. Do him disport, he is a gentle man;
712. And telle him that I will him visite,
713. *Have I nothing but rested me a lite:*         *when only I have rested
714. And speed you faste, for I will abide me a little*
715. Till that ye sleepe faste by my side.'
716. And with that word he gan unto him call
717. A squier, that was marshal of his hall,
718. And told him certain thinges that he wo'ld.
719. This freshe May hath straight her way y-hold,
720. With all her women, unto Damian.
721. Down by his beddes side sat she than,*                        *then
722. Comforting him as goodly as she may.
723. This Damian, when that his time he say,*                       *saw
724. In secret wise his purse, and eke his bill,
725. In which that he y-written had his will,
726. Hath put into her hand withoute more,
727. Save that he sighed wondrous deep and sore,
728. And softely to her right thus said he:
729. 'Mercy, and that ye not discover me:
730. For I am dead if that this thing be kid.'*         *discovered 
731. The purse hath she in her bosom hid,
732. And went her way; ye get no more of me;
733. But unto January come is she,
734. That on his bedde's side sat full soft.
735. He took her, and he kissed her full oft,
736. And laid him down to sleep, and that anon.
737. She feigned her as that she muste gon
738. There as ye know that every wight must need;
739. And when she of this bill had taken heed,
740. She rent it all to cloutes* at the last,                 *fragments
741. And in the privy softely it cast.
742. Who studieth* now but faire freshe May?              *is thoughtful
743. Adown by olde January she lay,
744. That slepte, till the cough had him awaked:
745. Anon he pray'd her strippe her all naked,
746. He would of her, he said, have some pleasance;
747. And said her clothes did him incumbrance.
748. And she obey'd him, be her *lefe or loth.*       *willing or unwilling*
749. But, lest that precious* folk be with me wroth,         *over-nice 
750. How that he wrought I dare not to you tell,
751. Or whether she thought it paradise or hell;
752. But there I let them worken in their wise
753. Till evensong ring, and they must arise.

754. Were it by destiny, or aventure,*                          * chance
755. Were it by influence, or by nature,
756. Or constellation, that in such estate
757. The heaven stood at that time fortunate
758. As for to put a bill of Venus' works
759. (For alle thing hath time, as say these clerks),
760. To any woman for to get her love,
761. I cannot say; but greate God above,
762. That knoweth that none act is causeless,
763. *He deem* of all, for I will hold my peace.         *let him judge*
764. But sooth is this, how that this freshe May
765. Hath taken such impression that day
766. Of pity on this sicke Damian,
767. That from her hearte she not drive can
768. The remembrance for *to do him ease.*                   *to satisfy
769. 'Certain,' thought she, 'whom that this thing displease his desire*
770. I recke not, for here I him assure,
771. To love him best of any creature,
772. Though he no more haddee than his shirt.'
773. Lo, pity runneth soon in gentle heart.
774. Here may ye see, how excellent franchise*               *generosity
775. In women is when they them *narrow advise.*          *closely consider*
776. Some tyrant is, - as there be many a one, -
777. That hath a heart as hard as any stone,
778. Which would have let him sterven* in the place                 *die
779. Well rather than have granted him her grace;
780. And then rejoicen in her cruel pride.
781. And reckon not to be a homicide.
782. This gentle May, full filled of pity,
783. Right of her hand a letter maked she,
784. In which she granted him her very grace;
785. There lacked nought, but only day and place,
786. Where that she might unto his lust suffice:
787. For it shall be right as he will devise.
788. And when she saw her time upon a day
789. To visit this Damian went this May,
790. And subtilly this letter down she thrust
791. Under his pillow, read it if him lust.*                    *pleased
792. She took him by the hand, and hard him twist
793. So secretly, that no wight of it wist,
794. And bade him be all whole; and forth she went
795. To January, when he for her sent.
796. Up rose Damian the nexte morrow,
797. All passed was his sickness and his sorrow.
798. He combed him, he proined  him and picked,
799. He did all that unto his lady liked;
800. And eke to January he went as low
801. As ever did a dogge for the bow.
802. He is so pleasant unto every man
803. (For craft is all, whoso that do it can),
804. Every wight is fain to speak him good;
805. And fully in his lady's grace he stood.
806. Thus leave I Damian about his need,
807. And in my tale forth I will proceed.

808. Some clerke* holde that felicity                 *writers, scholars
809. Stands in delight; and therefore certain he,
810. This noble January, with all his might
811. In honest wise as longeth* to a knight,                  *belongeth
812. Shope* him to live full deliciously:            *prepared, arranged
813. His housing, his array, as honestly*          *honourably, suitably
814. To his degree was maked as a king's.
815. Amonges other of his honest things
816. He had a garden walled all with stone;
817. So fair a garden wot I nowhere none.
818. For out of doubt I verily suppose
819. That he that wrote the Romance of the Rose 
820. Could not of it the beauty well devise;*                  *describe
821. Nor Priapus  mighte not well suffice,
822. Though he be god of gardens, for to tell
823. The beauty of the garden, and the well*                   *fountain
824. That stood under a laurel always green.
825. Full often time he, Pluto, and his queen
826. Proserpina, and all their faerie,
827. Disported them and made melody
828. About that well, and danced, as men told.
829. This noble knight, this January old
830. Such dainty* had in it to walk and play,                  *pleasure
831. That he would suffer no wight to bear the key,
832. Save he himself, for of the small wicket
833. He bare always of silver a cliket,*                            *key
834. With which, when that him list, he it unshet.*              *opened
835. And when that he would pay his wife's debt,
836. In summer season, thither would he go,
837. And May his wife, and no wight but they two;
838. And thinges which that were not done in bed,
839. He in the garden them perform'd and sped.
840. And in this wise many a merry day
841. Lived this January and fresh May,
842. But worldly joy may not always endure
843. To January, nor to no creatucere.

844. O sudden hap! O thou fortune unstable!
845. Like to the scorpion so deceivable,*                     *deceitful
846. That fhatt'rest with thy head when thou wilt sting;
847. Thy tail is death, through thine envenoming.
848. O brittle joy! O sweete poison quaint!*                    *strange
849. O monster, that so subtilly canst paint
850. Thy giftes, under hue of steadfastness,
851. That thou deceivest bothe *more and less!*        *great and small*
852. Why hast thou January thus deceiv'd,
853. That haddest him for thy full friend receiv'd?
854. And now thou hast bereft him both his eyen,
855. For sorrow of which desireth he to dien.
856. Alas! this noble January free,
857. Amid his lust* and his prosperity                         *pleasure
858. Is waxen blind, and that all suddenly.
859. He weeped and he wailed piteously;
860. And therewithal the fire of jealousy
861. (Lest that his wife should fall in some folly)
862. So burnt his hearte, that he woulde fain,
863. That some man bothe him and her had slain;
864. For neither after his death, nor in his life,
865. Ne would he that she were no love nor wife,
866. But ever live as widow in clothes black,
867. Sole as the turtle that hath lost her make.*                  *mate
868. But at the last, after a month or tway,
869. His sorrow gan assuage, soothe to say.
870. For, when he wist it might none other be,
871. He patiently took his adversity:
872. Save out of doubte he may not foregon
873. That he was jealous evermore-in-one:*                  *continually
874. Which jealousy was so outrageous,
875. That neither in hall, nor in none other house,
876. Nor in none other place never the mo'
877. He woulde suffer her to ride or go,
878. *But if* that he had hand on her alway.                     *unless
879. For which full often wepte freshe May,
880. That loved Damian so burningly
881. That she must either dien suddenly,
882. Or elles she must have him as her lest:*                   *pleased
883. She waited* when her hearte woulde brest.**       *expected **burst
884. Upon that other side Damian
885. Becomen is the sorrowfullest man
886. That ever was; for neither night nor day
887. He mighte speak a word to freshe May,
888. As to his purpose, of no such mattere,
889. *But if* that January must it hear,                        *unless*
890. That had a hand upon her evermo'.
891. But natheless, by writing to and fro,
892. And privy signes, wist he what she meant,
893. And she knew eke the fine* of his intent.                 *end, aim

894. O January, what might it thee avail,
895. Though thou might see as far as shippes sail?
896. For as good is it blind deceiv'd to be,
897. As be deceived when a man may see.
898. Lo, Argus, which that had a hundred eyen, 
899. For all that ever he could pore or pryen,
900. Yet was he blent;* and, God wot, so be mo',               *deceived
901. That *weene wisly* that it be not so:           *think confidently*
902. Pass over is an ease, I say no more.
903. This freshe May, of which I spake yore,*                *previously
904. In warm wax hath *imprinted the cliket*        *taken an impression
905. That January bare of the small wicket of the key*
906. By which into his garden oft he went;
907. And Damian, that knew all her intent,
908. The cliket counterfeited privily;
909. There is no more to say, but hastily
910. Some wonder by this cliket shall betide,
911. Which ye shall hearen, if ye will abide.

912. O noble Ovid, sooth say'st thou, God wot,
913. What sleight is it, if love be long and hot,
914. That he'll not find it out in some mannere?
915. By Pyramus and Thisbe may men lear;*                         *learn
916. Though they were kept full long and strait o'er all,
917. They be accorded,* rowning** through a wall,       *agreed	 **whispering
918. Where no wight could have found out such a sleight.
919. But now to purpose; ere that dayes eight
920. Were passed of the month of July, fill*                  *it befell
921. That January caught so great a will,
922. Through egging* of his wife, him for to play              *inciting
923. In his garden, and no wight but they tway,
924. That in a morning to this May said he: 
925. 'Rise up, my wife, my love, my lady free;
926. The turtle's voice is heard, mine owen sweet;
927. The winter is gone, with all his raines weet.*                 *wet
928. Come forth now with thine *eyen columbine*        *eyes like the doves*
929. Well fairer be thy breasts than any wine.
930. The garden is enclosed all about;
931. Come forth, my white spouse; for, out of doubt,
932. Thou hast me wounded in mine heart, O wife:
933. No spot in thee was e'er in all thy life.
934. Come forth, and let us taken our disport;
935. I choose thee for my wife and my comfort.'
936. Such olde lewed* wordes used he.                 *foolish, ignorant
937. On Damian a signe made she,
938. That he should go before with his cliket.
939. This Damian then hath opened the wicket,
940. And in he start, and that in such mannere
941. That no wight might him either see or hear;
942. And still he sat under a bush. Anon
943. This January, as blind as is a stone,
944. With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo',
945. Into this freshe garden is y-go,
946. And clapped to the wicket suddenly.
947. 'Now, wife,' quoth he, 'here is but thou and I;
948. Thou art the creature that I beste love:
949. For, by that Lord that sits in heav'n above,
950. Lever* I had to dien on a knife,                            *rather
951. Than thee offende, deare true wife.
952. For Godde's sake, think how I thee chees,*                   *chose
953. Not for no covetise* doubteless,                     * covetousness
954. But only for the love I had to thee.
955. And though that I be old, and may not see,
956. Be to me true, and I will tell you why.
957. Certes three thinges shall ye win thereby:
958. First, love of Christ, and to yourself honour,
959. And all mine heritage, town and tow'r.
960. I give it you, make charters as you lest;
961. This shall be done to-morrow ere sun rest,
962. So wisly* God my soule bring to bliss!                      *surely
963. I pray you, on this covenant me kiss.
964. And though that I be jealous, wite* me not;                  *blame
965. Ye be so deep imprinted in my thought,
966. That when that I consider your beauty,
967. And therewithal *th'unlikely eld* of me,           *dissimilar age*
968. I may not, certes, though I shoulde die,
969. Forbear to be out of your company,
970. For very love; this is withoute doubt:
971. Now kiss me, wife, and let us roam about.'

972. This freshe May, when she these wordes heard,
973. Benignely to January answer'd;
974. But first and forward she began to weep:
975. 'I have,' quoth she, 'a soule for to keep
976. As well as ye, and also mine honour,
977. And of my wifehood thilke* tender flow'r                 *that same
978. Which that I have assured in your hond,
979. When that the priest to you my body bond:
980. Wherefore I will answer in this mannere,
981. With leave of you mine owen lord so dear.
982. I pray to God, that never dawn the day
983. That I *no sterve,* as foul as woman may,              *do not die*
984. If e'er I do unto my kin that shame,
985. Or elles I impaire so my name,
986. That I bee false; and if I do that lack,
987. Do strippe me, and put me in a sack,
988. And in the nexte river do me drench:*                        *drown
989. I am a gentle woman, and no wench.
990. Why speak ye thus? but men be e'er untrue,
991. And women have reproof of you aye new.
992. Ye know none other dalliance, I believe,
993. But speak to us of untrust and repreve.'*                  *reproof

994. And with that word she saw where Damian
995. Sat in the bush, and coughe she began;
996. And with her finger signe made she,
997. That Damian should climb upon a tree
998. That charged was with fruit; and up he went:
999. For verily he knew all her intent,
1000. And every signe that she coulde make,
1001. Better than January her own make.*                            *mate
1002. For in a letter she had told him all
1003. Of this matter, how that he worke shall.
1004. And thus I leave him sitting in the perry,*              *pear-tree
1005. And January and May roaming full merry.

1006. Bright was the day, and blue the firmament;
1007. Phoebus of gold his streames down had sent
1008. To gladden every flow'r with his warmness;
1009. He was that time in Geminis, I guess,
1010. But little from his declination
1011. Of Cancer, Jove's exaltation.
1012. And so befell, in that bright morning-tide,
1013. That in the garden, on the farther side,
1014. Pluto, that is the king of Faerie,
1015. And many a lady in his company
1016. Following his wife, the queen Proserpina, -
1017. Which that he ravished out of Ethna,
1018. While that she gather'd flowers in the mead
1019. (In Claudian ye may the story read,
1020. How in his grisly chariot he her fet*), -                 *fetched
1021. This king of Faerie adown him set
1022. Upon a bank of turfes fresh and green,
1023. And right anon thus said he to his queen.
1024. 'My wife,' quoth he, 'there may no wight say nay, -
1025. Experience so proves it every day, -
1026. The treason which that woman doth to man.
1027. Ten hundred thousand stories tell I can
1028. Notable of your untruth and brittleness *              *inconstancy
1029. O Solomon, richest of all richess,
1030. Full fill'd of sapience and worldly glory,
1031. Full worthy be thy wordes of memory
1032. To every wight that wit and reason can. *                    *knows
1033. Thus praised he yet the bounte* of man:                   *goodness
1034. 'Among a thousand men yet found I one,
1035. But of all women found I never none.' 
1036. Thus said this king, that knew your wickedness;
1037. And Jesus, Filius Sirach,  as I guess,
1038. He spake of you but seldom reverence.
1039. A wilde fire and corrupt pestilence
1040. So fall upon your bodies yet to-night!
1041. Ne see ye not this honourable knight?
1042. Because, alas! that he is blind and old,
1043. His owen man shall make him cuckold.
1044. Lo, where he sits, the lechour, in the tree.
1045. Now will I granten, of my majesty,
1046. Unto this olde blinde worthy knight,
1047. That he shall have again his eyen sight,
1048. When that his wife will do him villainy;
1049. Then shall be knowen all her harlotry,
1050. Both in reproof of her and other mo'.'
1051. 'Yea, Sir,' quoth Proserpine,' and will ye so?
1052. Now by my mother Ceres' soul I swear
1053. That I shall give her suffisant answer,
1054. And alle women after, for her sake;
1055. That though they be in any guilt y-take,
1056. With face bold they shall themselves excuse,
1057. And bear them down that woulde them accuse.
1058. For lack of answer, none of them shall dien.

1059. All* had ye seen a thing with both your eyen,             *although
1060. Yet shall *we visage it* so hardily,                  *confront it*
1061. And weep, and swear, and chide subtilly,
1062. That ye shall be as lewed* as be geese.       *ignorant, confounded
1063. What recketh me of your authorities?
1064. I wot well that this Jew, this Solomon,
1065. Found of us women fooles many one:
1066. But though that he founde no good woman,
1067. Yet there hath found many another man
1068. Women full good, and true, and virtuous;
1069. Witness on them that dwelt in Christes house;
1070. With martyrdom they proved their constance.
1071. The Roman gestes  make remembrance
1072. Of many a very true wife also.
1073. But, Sire, be not wroth, albeit so,
1074. Though that he said he found no good woman,
1075. I pray you take the sentence* of the man:        *opinion, real meaning
1076. He meant thus, that in *sovereign bounte*         *perfect goodness
1077. Is none but God, no, neither *he nor she.*          *man nor woman*
1078. Hey, for the very God that is but one,
1079. Why make ye so much of Solomon?
1080. What though he made a temple, Godde's house?
1081. What though he were rich and glorious?
1082. So made he eke a temple of false goddes;
1083. How might he do a thing that more forbode* is?           *forbidden
1084. Pardie, as fair as ye his name emplaster,* *plaster over, 'whitewash'
1085. He was a lechour, and an idolaster,*                      *idohater
1086. And in his eld he very* God forsook.                      *the true
1087. And if that God had not (as saith the book)
1088. Spared him for his father's sake, he should
1089. Have lost his regne* rather** than he would.          *kingdom **sooner
1090. I *sette not of* all the villainy                      *value not*
1091. That he of women wrote, a butterfly.
1092. I am a woman, needes must I speak,
1093. Or elles swell until mine hearte break.
1094. For since he said that we be jangleresses,*             *chatterers
1095. As ever may I brooke* whole my tresses,                   *preserve
1096. I shall not spare for no courtesy
1097. To speak him harm, that said us villainy.'
1098. 'Dame,' quoth this Pluto, 'be no longer wroth;
1099. I give it up: but, since I swore mine oath
1100. That I would grant to him his sight again,
1101. My word shall stand, that warn I you certain:
1102. I am a king; it sits* me not to lie.'              *becomes, befits
1103. 'And I,' quoth she, 'am queen of Faerie.
1104. Her answer she shall have, I undertake,
1105. Let us no more wordes of it make.
1106. Forsooth, I will no longer you contrary.'

1107. Now let us turn again to January,
1108. That in the garden with his faire May
1109. Singeth well merrier than the popinjay:*                    *parrot
1110. 'You love I best, and shall, and other none.'
1111. So long about the alleys is he gone,
1112. Till he was come to *that ilke perry,*         *the same pear-tree*
1113. Where as this Damian satte full merry
1114. On high, among the freshe leaves green.
1115. This freshe May, that is so bright and sheen,
1116. Gan for to sigh, and said, 'Alas my side!
1117. Now, Sir,' quoth she, 'for aught that may betide,
1118. I must have of the peares that I see,
1119. Or I must die, so sore longeth me
1120. To eaten of the smalle peares green;
1121. Help, for her love that is of heaven queen!
1122. I tell you well, a woman in my plight 
1123. May have to fruit so great an appetite,
1124. That she may dien, but* she of it have. '                   *unless
1125. 'Alas!' quoth he, 'that I had here a knave*                *servant
1126. That coulde climb; alas! alas!' quoth he,
1127. 'For I am blind.' 'Yea, Sir, *no force,'* quoth she;       *no matter*
1128. 'But would ye vouchesafe, for Godde's sake,
1129. The perry in your armes for to take
1130. (For well I wot that ye mistruste me),
1131. Then would I climbe well enough,' quoth she,
1132. 'So I my foot might set upon your back.'
1133. 'Certes,' said he, 'therein shall be no lack,
1134. Might I you helpe with mine hearte's blood.'
1135. He stooped down, and on his back she stood,
1136. And caught her by a twist,* and up she go'th.          *twig, bough
1137. (Ladies, I pray you that ye be not wroth,
1138. I cannot glose,* I am a rude man):                   *mince matters
1139. And suddenly anon this Damian
1140. Gan pullen up the smock, and in he throng.*            *rushed 
1141. And when that Pluto saw this greate wrong,
1142. To January he gave again his sight,
1143. And made him see as well as ever he might.
1144. And when he thus had caught his sight again,
1145. Was never man of anything so fain:
1146. But on his wife his thought was evermo'.
1147. Up to the tree he cast his eyen two,
1148. And saw how Damian his wife had dress'd,
1149. In such mannere, it may not be express'd,
1150. *But if* I woulde speak uncourteously.                     *unless*
1151. And up he gave a roaring and a cry,
1152. As doth the mother when the child shall die;
1153. 'Out! help! alas! harow!' he gan to cry;
1154. 'O stronge, lady, stowre!  what doest thou?'

1155. And she answered: 'Sir, what aileth you?
1156. Have patience and reason in your mind,
1157. I have you help'd on both your eyen blind.
1158. On peril of my soul, I shall not lien,
1159. As me was taught to helpe with your eyen,
1160. Was nothing better for to make you see,
1161. Than struggle with a man upon a tree:
1162. God wot, I did it in full good intent.'
1163. 'Struggle!' quoth he, 'yea, algate* in it went.       *whatever way
1164. God give you both one shame's death to dien!
1165. He swived* thee; I saw it with mine eyen;         *enjoyed carnally
1166. And elles be I hanged by the halse.'*                         *neck
1167. 'Then is,' quoth she, 'my medicine all false;
1168. For certainly, if that ye mighte see,
1169. Ye would not say these wordes unto me.
1170. Ye have some glimpsing,* and no perfect sight.'         *glimmering
1171. 'I see,' quoth he, 'as well as ever I might,
1172. (Thanked be God!) with both mine eyen two,
1173. And by my faith me thought he did thee so.'
1174. 'Ye maze,* ye maze, goode Sir,' quoth she;         *rave, are confused
1175. 'This thank have I for I have made you see:
1176. Alas!' quoth she, 'that e'er I was so kind.'
1177. 'Now, Dame,' quoth he, 'let all pass out of mind;
1178. Come down, my lefe,* and if I have missaid,                   *love
1179. God help me so, as I am *evil apaid.*                *dissatisfied*
1180. But, by my father's soul, I ween'd have seen
1181. How that this Damian had by thee lain,
1182. And that thy smock had lain upon his breast.'
1183. 'Yea, Sir,' quoth she, 'ye may *ween as ye lest:*         *think as you
1184. But, Sir, a man that wakes out of his sleep, please*
1185. He may not suddenly well take keep*                         *notice
1186. Upon a thing, nor see it perfectly,
1187. Till that he be adawed* verily.                           *awakened
1188. Right so a man, that long hath blind y-be,
1189. He may not suddenly so well y-see,
1190. First when his sight is newe come again,
1191. As he that hath a day or two y-seen.
1192. Till that your sight establish'd be a while,
1193. There may full many a sighte you beguile.
1194. Beware, I pray you, for, by heaven's king,
1195. Full many a man weeneth to see a thing,
1196. And it is all another than it seemeth;
1197. He which that misconceiveth oft misdeemeth.'
1198. And with that word she leapt down from the tree.
1199. This January, who is glad but he?
1200. He kissed her, and clipped* her full oft,                 *embraced
1201. And on her womb he stroked her full soft;
1202. And to his palace home he hath her lad.*                       *led
1203. Now, goode men, I pray you to be glad.
1204. Thus endeth here my tale of January,
1205. God bless us, and his mother, Sainte Mary.
