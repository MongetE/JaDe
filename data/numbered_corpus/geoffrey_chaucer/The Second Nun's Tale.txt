1. The minister and norice* unto vices,                         *nurse
2. Which that men call in English idleness,
3. The porter at the gate is of delices;*                    *delights
4. T'eschew, and by her contrar' her oppress, -
5. That is to say, by lawful business,* -       *occupation, activity
6. Well oughte we to *do our all intent*             *apply ourselves*
7. Lest that the fiend through idleness us hent.*               *seize

8. For he, that with his thousand cordes sly
9. Continually us waiteth to beclap,*                  *entangle, bind
10. When he may man in idleness espy,
11. He can so lightly catch him in his trap,
12. Till that a man be hent* right by the lappe,**         *seize **hem
13. He is not ware the fiend hath him in hand;
14. Well ought we work, and idleness withstand.

15. And though men dreaded never for to die,
16. Yet see men well by reason, doubteless,
17. That idleness is root of sluggardy,
18. Of which there cometh never good increase;
19. And see that sloth them holdeth in a leas,*              *leash 
20. Only to sleep, and for to eat and drink,
21. And to devouren all that others swink.*                     *labour

22. And, for to put us from such idleness,
23. That cause is of so great confusion,
24. I have here done my faithful business,
25. After the Legend, in translation
26. Right of thy glorious life and passion, -
27. Thou with thy garland wrought of rose and lily,
28. Thee mean I, maid and martyr, Saint Cecilie.

29. And thou, thou art the flow'r of virgins all,
30. Of whom that Bernard list so well to write, 
31. To thee at my beginning first I call;
32. Thou comfort of us wretches, do me indite
33. Thy maiden's death, that won through her merite
34. Th' eternal life, and o'er the fiend victory,
35. As man may after readen in her story.

36. Thou maid and mother, daughter of thy Son,
37. Thou well of mercy, sinful soules' cure,
38. In whom that God of bounte chose to won;*                    *dwell
39. Thou humble and high o'er every creature,
40. Thou nobilest, *so far forth our nature,* *as far as our nature admits*
41. That no disdain the Maker had of kind,*                     *nature
42. His Son in blood and flesh to clothe and wind.*               *wrap

43. Within the cloister of thy blissful sides
44. Took manne's shape th' eternal love and peace,
45. That of *the trine compass* Lord and guide is         *the trinity*
46. Whom earth, and sea, and heav'n, *out of release,*         *unceasingly
47. *Aye hery;* and thou, Virgin wemmeless,*   *forever praise* *immaculate
48. Bare of thy body, and dweltest maiden pure,
49. The Creator of every creature.

50. Assembled is in thee magnificence 
51. With mercy, goodness, and with such pity,
52. That thou, that art the sun of excellence,
53. Not only helpest them that pray to thee,
54. But oftentime, of thy benignity,
55. Full freely, ere that men thine help beseech,
56. Thou go'st before, and art their lives' leech.*       *healer, saviour.

57. Now help, thou meek and blissful faire maid,
58. Me, flemed* wretch, in this desert of gall;          *banished, outcast
59. Think on the woman Cananee that said
60. That whelpes eat some of the crumbes all
61. That from their Lorde's table be y-fall;
62. And though that I, unworthy son of Eve,
63. Be sinful, yet accepte my believe.*                          *faith

64. And, for that faith is dead withoute werkes,
65. For to worke give me wit and space,
66. That I be *quit from thennes that most derk is;*   *freed from the most
67. O thou, that art so fair and full of grace, dark place (Hell)*
68. Be thou mine advocate in that high place,
69. Where as withouten end is sung Osanne,
70. Thou Christe's mother, daughter dear of Anne.

71. And of thy light my soul in prison light,
72. That troubled is by the contagion
73. Of my body, and also by the weight
74. Of earthly lust and false affection;
75. O hav'n of refuge, O salvation
76. Of them that be in sorrow and distress,
77. Now help, for to my work I will me dress.

78. Yet pray I you, that reade what I write, 
79. Forgive me that I do no diligence
80. This ilke* story subtilly t' indite.                          *same
81. For both have I the wordes and sentence
82. Of him that at the sainte's reverence
83. The story wrote, and follow her legend;
84. And pray you that you will my work amend.

85. First will I you the name of Saint Cecilie
86. Expound, as men may in her story see.
87. It is to say in English, Heaven's lily,
88. For pure chasteness of virginity;
89. Or, for she whiteness had of honesty,*                      *purity
90. And green of conscience, and of good fame
91. The sweete savour, Lilie was her name.

92. Or Cecilie is to say, the way of blind;
93. For she example was by good teaching;
94. Or else Cecilie, as I written find,
95. Is joined by a manner conjoining
96. Of heaven and Lia,  and herein figuring
97. The heaven is set for thought of holiness,
98. And Lia for her lasting business.

99. Cecilie may eke be said in this mannere,
100. Wanting of blindness, for her greate light
101. Of sapience, and for her thewes* clear.                  *qualities
102. Or elles, lo, this maiden's name bright
103. Of heaven and Leos  comes, for which by right
104. Men might her well the heaven of people call,
105. Example of good and wise workes all;

106. For Leos people in English is to say;
107. And right as men may in the heaven see
108. The sun and moon, and starres every way,
109. Right so men ghostly,* in this maiden free,            *spiritually
110. Sawen of faith the magnanimity,
111. And eke the clearness whole of sapience,
112. And sundry workes bright of excellence.

113. And right so as these philosophers write,
114. That heav'n is swift and round, and eke burning,
115. Right so was faire Cecilie the white
116. Full swift and busy in every good working,
117. And round and whole in good persevering, 
118. And burning ever in charity full bright;
119. Now have I you declared *what she hight.*        *why she had her name*

120. This maiden bright Cecile, as her life saith,
121. Was come of Romans, and of noble kind,
122. And from her cradle foster'd in the faith
123. Of Christ, and bare his Gospel in her mind:
124. She never ceased, as I written find,
125. Of her prayere, and God to love and dread,
126. Beseeching him to keep her maidenhead.

127. And when this maiden should unto a man
128. Y-wedded be, that was full young of age,
129. Which that y-called was Valerian,
130. And come was the day of marriage,
131. She, full devout and humble in her corage,*                  *heart
132. Under her robe of gold, that sat full fair,
133. Had next her flesh y-clad her in an hair.*       *garment of hair-cloth

134. And while the organs made melody,
135. To God alone thus in her heart sang she;
136. 'O Lord, my soul and eke my body gie*                        *guide
137. Unwemmed,* lest that I confounded be.'                 *unblemished
138. And, for his love that died upon the tree,
139. Every second or third day she fast',
140. Aye bidding* in her orisons full fast.                     *praying

141. The night came, and to bedde must she gon
142. With her husband, as it is the mannere;
143. And privily she said to him anon;
144. 'O sweet and well-beloved spouse dear,
145. There is a counsel,* an'** ye will it hear,            *secret **if
146. Which that right fain I would unto you say,
147. So that ye swear ye will it not bewray.'*                   *betray

148. Valerian gan fast unto her swear
149. That for no case nor thing that mighte be,
150. He never should to none bewrayen her;
151. And then at erst* thus to him saide she;        *for the first time
152. 'I have an angel which that loveth me,
153. That with great love, whether I wake or sleep,
154. Is ready aye my body for to keep;

155. 'And if that he may feelen, *out of dread,*         *without doubt*
156. That ye me touch or love in villainy,
157. He right anon will slay you with the deed,
158. And in your youthe thus ye shoulde die.
159. And if that ye in cleane love me gie,'*                      *guide
160. He will you love as me, for your cleanness,
161. And shew to you his joy and his brightness.'

162. Valerian, corrected as God wo'ld,
163. Answer'd again, 'If I shall truste thee,
164. Let me that angel see, and him behold;
165. And if that it a very angel be,
166. Then will I do as thou hast prayed me;
167. And if thou love another man, forsooth
168. Right with this sword then will I slay you both.'

169. Cecile answer'd anon right in this wise;
170. 'If that you list, the angel shall ye see,
171. So that ye trow* Of Christ, and you baptise;                  *know
172. Go forth to Via Appia,' quoth she,
173. That from this towne stands but miles three,
174. And to the poore folkes that there dwell
175. Say them right thus, as that I shall you tell,

176. 'Tell them, that I, Cecile, you to them sent
177. To shewe you the good Urban the old,
178. For secret needes,* and for good intent;                  *business
179. And when that ye Saint Urban have behold,
180. Tell him the wordes which I to you told
181. And when that he hath purged you from sin,
182. Then shall ye see that angel ere ye twin*                   *depart

183. Valerian is to the place gone;
184. And, right as he was taught by her learning
185. He found this holy old Urban anon
186. Among the saintes' burials louting;*           *lying concealed 
187. And he anon, withoute tarrying,
188. Did his message, and when that he it told,
189. Urban for joy his handes gan uphold.

190. The teares from his eyen let he fall;
191. 'Almighty Lord, O Jesus Christ,'
192. Quoth he, 'Sower of chaste counsel, herd* of us all;          *shepherd
193. The fruit of thilke* seed of chastity                         *that
194. That thou hast sown in Cecile, take to thee
195. Lo, like a busy bee, withoute guile,
196. Thee serveth aye thine owen thrall* Cicile,                *servant

197. 'For thilke spouse, that she took *but now,*               *lately*
198. Full like a fierce lion, she sendeth here,
199. As meek as e'er was any lamb to owe.'
200. And with that word anon there gan appear
201. An old man, clad in white clothes clear,
202. That had a book with letters of gold in hand,
203. And gan before Valerian to stand.

204. Valerian, as dead, fell down for dread,
205. When he him saw; and he up hent* him tho,**           *took **there
206. And on his book right thus he gan to read;
207. 'One Lord, one faith, one God withoute mo',
208. One Christendom, one Father of all also,
209. Aboven all, and over all everywhere.'
210. These wordes all with gold y-written were.

211. When this was read, then said this olde man,
212. 'Believ'st thou this or no? say yea or nay.'
213. 'I believe all this,' quoth Valerian,
214. 'For soother* thing than this, I dare well say,              *truer
215. Under the Heaven no wight thinke may.'
216. Then vanish'd the old man, he wist not where
217. And Pope Urban him christened right there.

218. Valerian went home, and found Cecilie
219. Within his chamber with an angel stand;
220. This angel had of roses and of lily
221. Corones* two, the which he bare in hand,                    *crowns
222. And first to Cecile, as I understand,
223. He gave the one, and after gan he take
224. The other to Valerian her make.*                     *mate, husband

225. 'With body clean, and with unwemmed* thought,     *unspotted, blameless
226. Keep aye well these corones two,' quoth he;
227. 'From Paradise to you I have them brought,
228. Nor ever more shall they rotten be,
229. Nor lose their sweet savour, truste me,
230. Nor ever wight shall see them with his eye,
231. But he be chaste, and hate villainy.

232. 'And thou, Valerian, for thou so soon
233. Assented hast to good counsel, also
234. Say what thee list,* and thou shalt have thy boon.'**    *wish **desire
235. 'I have a brother,' quoth Valerian tho,*                      *then
236. 'That in this world I love no man so;
237. I pray you that my brother may have grace
238. To know the truth, as I do in this place.'

239. The angel said, 'God liketh thy request,
240. And bothe, with the palm of martyrdom,
241. Ye shalle come unto this blissful rest.'
242. And, with that word, Tiburce his brother came.
243. And when that he the savour undernome*                   *perceived
244. Which that the roses and the lilies cast,
245. Within his heart he gan to wonder fast;

246. And said; 'I wonder, this time of the year,
247. Whence that sweete savour cometh so
248. Of rose and lilies, that I smelle here;
249. For though I had them in mine handes two,
250. The savour might in me no deeper go;
251. The sweete smell, that in my heart I find,
252. Hath changed me all in another kind.'

253. Valerian said, 'Two crownes here have we,
254. Snow-white and rose-red, that shine clear,
255. Which that thine eyen have no might to see;
256. And, as thou smellest them through my prayere,
257. So shalt thou see them, leve* brother dear,                *beloved
258. If it so be thou wilt withoute sloth
259. Believe aright, and know the very troth. '

260. Tiburce answered, 'Say'st thou this to me
261. In soothness, or in dreame hear I this?'
262. 'In dreames,' quoth Valorian, 'have we be
263. Unto this time, brother mine, y-wis
264. But now *at erst* in truth our dwelling is.'       *for the first time*
265. How know'st thou this,' quoth Tiburce; 'in what wise?'
266. Quoth Valerian, 'That shall I thee devise*                *describe

267. 'The angel of God hath me the truth y-taught,
268. Which thou shalt see, if that thou wilt reny*             *renounce
269. The idols, and be clean, and elles nought.'
270. [And of the miracle of these crownes tway
271. Saint Ambrose in his preface list to say;
272. Solemnely this noble doctor dear
273. Commendeth it, and saith in this mannere

274. 'The palm of martyrdom for to receive,
275. Saint Cecilie, full filled of God's gift,
276. The world and eke her chamber gan to weive;*               *forsake
277. Witness Tiburce's and Cecilie's shrift,*                *confession
278. To which God of his bounty woulde shift
279. Corones two, of flowers well smelling,
280. And made his angel them the crownes bring.

281. 'The maid hath brought these men to bliss above;
282. The world hath wist what it is worth, certain,
283. Devotion of chastity to love.'] 
284. Then showed him Cecilie all open and plain,
285. That idols all are but a thing in vain,
286. For they be dumb, and thereto* they be deave;**       *therefore **deaf
287. And charged him his idols for to leave.

288. 'Whoso that troweth* not this, a beast he is,'           *believeth
289. Quoth this Tiburce, 'if that I shall not lie.'
290. And she gan kiss his breast when she heard this,
291. And was full glad he could the truth espy:
292. 'This day I take thee for mine ally.'*               *chosen friend
293. Saide this blissful faire maiden dear;
294. And after that she said as ye may hear.

295. 'Lo, right so as the love of Christ,' quoth she,
296. 'Made me thy brother's wife, right in that wise
297. Anon for mine ally here take I thee,
298. Since that thou wilt thine idoles despise.
299. Go with thy brother now and thee baptise,
300. And make thee clean, so that thou may'st behold
301. The angel's face, of which thy brother told.'

302. Tiburce answer'd, and saide, 'Brother dear,
303. First tell me whither I shall, and to what man?'
304. 'To whom?' quoth he, 'come forth with goode cheer,
305. I will thee lead unto the Pope Urban.'
306. 'To Urban? brother mine Valerian,'
307. Quoth then Tiburce; 'wilt thou me thither lead?
308. Me thinketh that it were a wondrous deed.

309. 'Meanest thou not that Urban,' quoth he tho,*                 *then
310. 'That is so often damned to be dead,
311. And wons* in halkes** always to and fro,          *dwells **corners
312. And dare not ones putte forth his head?
313. Men should him brennen* in a fire so red,                     *burn
314. If he were found, or if men might him spy:
315. And us also, to bear him company.

316. 'And while we seeke that Divinity
317. That is y-hid in heaven privily,
318. Algate* burnt in this world should we be.'            *nevertheless
319. To whom Cecilie answer'd boldely;
320. 'Men mighte dreade well and skilfully*                  *reasonably
321. This life to lose, mine owen deare brother,
322. If this were living only, and none other.

323. 'But there is better life in other place,
324. That never shall be loste, dread thee nought;
325. Which Godde's Son us tolde through his grace
326. That Father's Son which alle thinges wrought;
327. And all that wrought is with a skilful* thought,        *reasonable
328. The Ghost,* that from the Father gan proceed,          *Holy Spirit
329. Hath souled* them, withouten any drede.**     *endowed them with a soul
330. **doubt
331. By word and by miracle, high God's Son,
332. When he was in this world, declared here.
333. That there is other life where men may won.'*                *dwell
334. To whom answer'd Tiburce, 'O sister dear,
335. Saidest thou not right now in this mannere,
336. There was but one God, Lord in soothfastness,*               *truth
337. And now of three how may'st thou bear witness?'

338. 'That shall I tell,' quoth she, 'ere that I go.
339. Right as a man hath sapiences* three,             *mental faculties
340. Memory, engine,* and intellect also,                      *wit 
341. So in one being of divinity
342. Three persones there maye right well be.'
343. Then gan she him full busily to preach
344. Of Christe's coming, and his paines teach,

345. And many pointes of his passion;
346. How Godde's Son in this world was withhold*               *employed
347. To do mankinde plein* remission,                              *full
348. That was y-bound in sin and cares cold.*             *wretched 
349. All this thing she unto Tiburce told,
350. And after that Tiburce, in good intent,
351. With Valerian to Pope Urban he went.

352. That thanked God, and with glad heart and light
353. He christen'd him, and made him in that place
354. Perfect in his learning, and Godde's knight.
355. And after this Tiburce got such grace,
356. That every day he saw in time and space
357. Th' angel of God, and every manner boon*           *request, favour
358. That be God asked, it was sped* full anon.         *granted, successful

359. It were full hard by order for to sayn
360. How many wonders Jesus for them wrought,
361. But at the last, to telle short and plain,
362. The sergeants of the town of Rome them sought,
363. And them before Almach the Prefect brought,
364. Which them apposed,* and knew all their intent,         *questioned
365. And to th'image of Jupiter them sent.

366. And said, 'Whoso will not do sacrifice,
367. Swap* off his head, this is my sentence here.'              *strike
368. Anon these martyrs, *that I you devise,*       *of whom I tell you*
369. One Maximus, that was an officere
370. Of the prefect's, and his corniculere 
371. Them hent,* and when he forth the saintes lad,**          *seized **led
372. Himself he wept for pity that he had.

373. When Maximus had heard the saintes lore,*       *doctrine, teaching
374. He got him of the tormentores* leave,                    *torturers
375. And led them to his house withoute more;
376. And with their preaching, ere that it were eve,
377. They gonnen* from the tormentors to reave,**   *began **wrest, root out
378. And from Maxim', and from his folk each one,
379. The false faith, to trow* in God alone.                    *believe

380. Cecilia came, when it was waxen night,
381. With priestes, that them christen'd *all in fere;*       *in a company*
382. And afterward, when day was waxen light,
383. Cecile them said with a full steadfast cheer,*                *mien
384. 'Now, Christe's owen knightes lefe* and dear,              *beloved
385. Cast all away the workes of darkness,
386. And arme you in armour of brightness.

387. Ye have forsooth y-done a great battaile,
388. Your course is done, your faith have ye conserved; 
389. O to the crown of life that may not fail;
390. The rightful Judge, which that ye have served
391. Shall give it you, as ye have it deserved.'
392. And when this thing was said, as I devise,* relate
393. Men led them forth to do the sacrifice.

394. But when they were unto the place brought
395. To telle shortly the conclusion,
396. They would incense nor sacrifice right nought
397. But on their knees they sette them adown,
398. With humble heart and sad* devotion,                     *steadfast
399. And loste both their heades in the place;
400. Their soules wente to the King of grace.

401. This Maximus, that saw this thing betide,
402. With piteous teares told it anon right,
403. That he their soules saw to heaven glide
404. With angels, full of clearness and of light
405. Andt with his word converted many a wight.
406. For which Almachius *did him to-beat*               *see note *
407. With whip of lead, till he his life gan lete.*                *quit

408. Cecile him took, and buried him anon
409. By Tiburce and Valerian softely,
410. Within their burying-place, under the stone.
411. And after this Almachius hastily
412. Bade his ministers fetchen openly
413. Cecile, so that she might in his presence
414. Do sacrifice, and Jupiter incense.*                *burn incense to

415. But they, converted at her wise lore,*                    *teaching
416. Wepte full sore, and gave full credence
417. Unto her word, and cried more and more;
418. 'Christ, Godde's Son, withoute difference,
419. Is very God, this is all our sentence,*                    *opinion
420. That hath so good a servant him to serve
421. Thus with one voice we trowe,* though we sterve.**       *believe **die

422. Almachius, that heard of this doing,
423. Bade fetch Cecilie, that he might her see;
424. And alderfirst,* lo, this was his asking;             *first of all
425. 'What manner woman arte thou?' quoth he,
426. 'I am a gentle woman born,' quoth she.
427. 'I aske thee,' quoth he,'though it thee grieve,
428. Of thy religion and of thy believe.'

429. 'Ye have begun your question foolishly,'
430. Quoth she, 'that wouldest two answers conclude
431. In one demand? ye aske lewedly.'*                       *ignorantly
432. Almach answer'd to that similitude,
433. 'Of whence comes thine answering so rude?'
434. 'Of whence?' quoth she, when that she was freined,*          *asked
435. 'Of conscience, and of good faith unfeigned.'

436. Almachius saide; 'Takest thou no heed
437. Of my power?' and she him answer'd this;
438. 'Your might,' quoth she, 'full little is to dread;
439. For every mortal manne's power is
440. But like a bladder full of wind, y-wis;*                 *certainly
441. For with a needle's point, when it is blow',
442. May all the boast of it be laid full low.'

443. 'Full wrongfully begunnest thou,' quoth he,
444. 'And yet in wrong is thy perseverance.
445. Know'st thou not how our mighty princes free
446. Have thus commanded and made ordinance,
447. That every Christian wight shall have penance,*         *punishment
448. But if that he his Christendom withsay,*                      *deny
449. And go all quit, if he will it renay?'*                   *renounce

450. 'Your princes erren, as your nobley* doth,'               *nobility
451. Quoth then Cecile, 'and with a *wood sentence*       *mad judgment*
452. Ye make us guilty, and it is not sooth:*                      *true
453. For ye that knowe well our innocence,
454. Forasmuch as we do aye reverence
455. To Christ, and for we bear a Christian name,
456. Ye put on us a crime and eke a blame.

457. 'But we that knowe thilke name so
458. For virtuous, we may it not withsay.'
459. Almach answered, 'Choose one of these two,
460. Do sacrifice, or Christendom renay,
461. That thou may'st now escape by that way.'
462. At which the holy blissful faire maid
463. Gan for to laugh, and to the judge said;

464. 'O judge, *confused in thy nicety,*       *confounded in thy folly*
465. Wouldest thou that I reny innocence?
466. To make me a wicked wight,' quoth she,
467. 'Lo, he dissimuleth* here in audience;                  *dissembles
468. He stareth and woodeth* in his advertence.'** *grows furious **thought
469. To whom Almachius said, 'Unsely* wretch,                   *unhappy
470. Knowest thou not how far my might may stretch?

471. 'Have not our mighty princes to me given
472. Yea bothe power and eke authority
473. To make folk to dien or to liven?
474. Why speakest thou so proudly then to me?'
475. 'I speake not but steadfastly,' quoth she,
476. Not proudly, for I say, as for my side,
477. We hate deadly* thilke vice of pride.                     *mortally

478. 'And, if thou dreade not a sooth* to hear,                   *truth
479. Then will I shew all openly by right,
480. That thou hast made a full great leasing* here.          *falsehood
481. Thou say'st thy princes have thee given might
482. Both for to slay and for to quick* a wight, -        *give life to
483. Thou that may'st not but only life bereave;
484. Thou hast none other power nor no leave.

485. 'But thou may'st say, thy princes have thee maked
486. Minister of death; for if thou speak of mo',
487. Thou liest; for thy power is full naked.'
488. 'Do away thy boldness,' said Almachius tho,*                  *then
489. 'And sacrifice to our gods, ere thou go.
490. I recke not what wrong that thou me proffer,
491. For I can suffer it as a philosopher.

492. 'But those wronges may I not endure,
493. That thou speak'st of our goddes here,' quoth he.
494. Cecile answer'd, 'O nice* creature,                        *foolish
495. Thou saidest no word, since thou spake to me,
496. That I knew not therewith thy nicety,*                       *folly
497. And that thou wert in *every manner wise*       *every sort of way*
498. A lewed* officer, a vain justice.                         *ignorant

499. 'There lacketh nothing to thine outward eyen
500. That thou art blind; for thing that we see all
501. That it is stone, that men may well espyen,
502. That ilke* stone a god thou wilt it call.           *very, selfsame
503. I rede* thee let thine hand upon it fall,                   *advise
504. And taste* it well, and stone thou shalt it find;        *examine, test
505. Since that thou see'st not with thine eyen blind.

506. 'It is a shame that the people shall
507. So scorne thee, and laugh at thy folly;
508. For commonly men *wot it well over all,*       *know it everywhere*
509. That mighty God is in his heaven high;
510. And these images, well may'st thou espy,
511. To thee nor to themselves may not profite,
512. For in effect they be not worth a mite.'

513. These wordes and such others saide she,
514. And he wax'd wroth, and bade men should her lead
515. Home to her house; 'And in her house,' quoth he,
516. 'Burn her right in a bath, with flames red.'
517. And as he bade, right so was done the deed;
518. For in a bath they gan her faste shetten,*           *shut, confine
519. And night and day great fire they under betten.*      *kindled, applied

520. The longe night, and eke a day also,
521. For all the fire, and eke the bathe's heat,
522. She sat all cold, and felt of it no woe,
523. It made her not one droppe for to sweat;
524. But in that bath her life she must lete.*                    *leave
525. For he, Almachius, with full wick' intent,
526. To slay her in the bath his sonde* sent.            *message, order

527. Three strokes in the neck he smote her tho,*                 *there
528. The tormentor,* but for no manner chance               *executioner
529. He might not smite her faire neck in two:
530. And, for there was that time an ordinance
531. That no man should do man such penance,*         *severity, torture
532. The fourthe stroke to smite, soft or sore,
533. This tormentor he durste do no more;

534. But half dead, with her necke carven* there                 *gashed
535. He let her lie, and on his way is went.
536. The Christian folk, which that about her were,
537. With sheetes have the blood full fair y-hent;             *taken up
538. Three dayes lived she in this torment,
539. And never ceased them the faith to teach,
540. That she had foster'd them, she gan to preach.

541. And them she gave her mebles* and her thing,                 *goods
542. And to the Pope Urban betook* them tho;**         *commended **then
543. And said, 'I aske this of heaven's king,
544. To have respite three dayes and no mo',
545. To recommend to you, ere that I go,
546. These soules, lo; and that *I might do wirch*        *cause to be made*
547. Here of mine house perpetually a church.'

548. Saint Urban, with his deacons, privily
549. The body fetch'd, and buried it by night
550. Among his other saintes honestly;
551. Her house the church of Saint Cecilie hight;*            *is called
552. Saint Urban hallow'd it, as he well might;
553. In which unto this day, in noble wise,
554. Men do to Christ and to his saint service.
