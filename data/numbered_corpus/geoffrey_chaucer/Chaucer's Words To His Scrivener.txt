1. Adam Scrivener, if ever it thee befall
2. Boece or Troilus for to write anew,
3. Under thy long locks thou may'st have the scall
4. But after my making thou write more true!
5. So oft a day I must thy work renew,
6. It to correct, and eke to rub and scrape;
7. And all is through thy negligence and rape.
