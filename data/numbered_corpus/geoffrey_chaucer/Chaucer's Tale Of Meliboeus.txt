49. A young man called Meliboeus, mighty and rich, begat upon his
50. wife, that called was Prudence, a daughter which that called was
51. Sophia. Upon a day befell, that he for his disport went into the
52. fields him to play. His wife and eke his daughter hath he left
53. within his house, of which the doors were fast shut. Three of his
54. old foes have it espied, and set ladders to the walls of his house,
55. and by the windows be entered, and beaten his wife, and
56. wounded his daughter with five mortal wounds, in five sundry
57. places; that is to say, in her feet, in her hands, in her ears, in her
58. nose, and in her mouth; and left her for dead, and went away.
59. When Meliboeus returned was into his house, and saw all this
60. mischief, he, like a man mad, rending his clothes, gan weep and
61. cry. Prudence his wife, as farforth as she durst, besought him of
62. his weeping for to stint: but not forthy [notwithstanding] he gan
63. to weep and cry ever longer the more.

64. This noble wife Prudence remembered her upon the sentence of
65. Ovid, in his book that called is the 'Remedy of Love,' 
66. where he saith: He is a fool that disturbeth the mother to weep
67. in the death of her child, till she have wept her fill, as for a
68. certain time; and then shall a man do his diligence with amiable
69. words her to recomfort and pray her of her weeping for to stint
70. [cease]. For which reason this noble wife Prudence suffered her
71. husband for to weep and cry, as for a certain space; and when
72. she saw her time, she said to him in this wise: 'Alas! my lord,'
73. quoth she, 'why make ye yourself for to be like a fool? For
74. sooth it appertaineth not to a wise man to make such a sorrow.
75. Your daughter, with the grace of God, shall warish [be cured]
76. and escape. And all [although] were it so that she right now
77. were dead, ye ought not for her death yourself to destroy.
78. Seneca saith, 'The wise man shall not take too great discomfort
79. for the death of his children, but certes he should suffer it in
80. patience, as well as he abideth the death of his own proper
81. person.''

82. Meliboeus answered anon and said: 'What man,' quoth he,
83. 'should of his weeping stint, that hath so great a cause to weep?
84. Jesus Christ, our Lord, himself wept for the death of Lazarus
85. his friend.' Prudence answered, 'Certes, well I wot,
86. attempered [moderate] weeping is nothing defended [forbidden]
87. to him that sorrowful is, among folk in sorrow but it is rather
88. granted him to weep. The Apostle Paul unto the Romans
89. writeth, 'Man shall rejoice with them that make joy, and weep
90. with such folk as weep.' But though temperate weeping be
91. granted, outrageous weeping certes is defended. Measure of
92. weeping should be conserved, after the lore [doctrine] that
93. teacheth us Seneca. 'When that thy friend is dead,' quoth he, 'let
94. not thine eyes too moist be of tears, nor too much dry: although
95. the tears come to thine eyes, let them not fall. And when thou
96. hast forgone [lost] thy friend, do diligence to get again another
97. friend: and this is more wisdom than to weep for thy friend
98. which that thou hast lorn [lost] for therein is no boot
99. [advantage]. And therefore if ye govern you by sapience, put
100. away sorrow out of your heart. Remember you that Jesus
101. Sirach saith, 'A man that is joyous and glad in heart, it him
102. conserveth flourishing in his age: but soothly a sorrowful heart
103. maketh his bones dry.' He said eke thus, 'that sorrow in heart
104. slayth full many a man.' Solomon saith 'that right as moths in
105. the sheep's fleece annoy [do injury] to the clothes, and the small
106. worms to the tree, right so annoyeth sorrow to the heart of
107. man.' Wherefore us ought as well in the death of our children,
108. as in the loss of our goods temporal, have patience. Remember
109. you upon the patient Job, when he had lost his children and his
110. temporal substance, and in his body endured and received full
111. many a grievous tribulation, yet said he thus: 'Our Lord hath
112. given it to me, our Lord hath bereft it me; right as our Lord
113. would, right so be it done; blessed be the name of our Lord.''

114. To these foresaid things answered Meliboeus unto his wife
115. Prudence: 'All thy words,' quoth he, 'be true, and thereto
116. [also] profitable, but truly mine heart is troubled with this
117. sorrow so grievously, that I know not what to do.' 'Let call,'
118. quoth Prudence, 'thy true friends all, and thy lineage, which be
119. wise, and tell to them your case, and hearken what they say in
120. counselling, and govern you after their sentence [opinion].
121. Solomon saith, 'Work all things by counsel, and thou shall never
122. repent.'' Then, by counsel of his wife Prudence, this Meliboeus
123. let call [sent for] a great congregation of folk, as surgeons,
124. physicians, old folk and young, and some of his old enemies
125. reconciled (as by their semblance) to his love and to his grace;
126. and therewithal there come some of his neighbours, that did him
127. reverence more for dread than for love, as happeneth oft. There
128. come also full many subtle flatterers, and wise advocates
129. learned in the law. And when these folk together assembled
130. were, this Meliboeus in sorrowful wise showed them his case,
131. and by the manner of his speech it seemed that in heart he bare
132. a cruel ire, ready to do vengeance upon his foes, and suddenly
133. desired that the war should begin, but nevertheless yet asked he
134. their counsel in this matter. A surgeon, by licence and assent of
135. such as were wise, up rose, and to Meliboeus said as ye may
136. hear. 'Sir,' quoth he, 'as to us surgeons appertaineth, that we
137. do to every wight the best that we can, where as we be
138. withholden, [employed] and to our patient that we do no
139. damage; wherefore it happeneth many a time and oft, that when
140. two men have wounded each other, one same surgeon healeth
141. them both; wherefore unto our art it is not pertinent to nurse
142. war, nor parties to support [take sides]. But certes, as to the
143. warishing [healing] of your daughter, albeit so that perilously
144. she be wounded, we shall do so attentive business from day to
145. night, that, with the grace of God, she shall be whole and
146. sound, as soon as is possible.' Almost right in the same wise the
147. physicians answered, save that they said a few words more: that
148. right as maladies be cured by their contraries, right so shall man
149. warish war (by peace). His neighbours full of envy, his feigned
150. friends that seemed reconciled, and his flatterers, made
151. semblance of weeping, and impaired and agregged [aggravated]
152. much of this matter, in praising greatly Meliboeus of might, of
153. power, of riches, and of friends, despising the power of his
154. adversaries: and said utterly, that he anon should wreak him on
155. his foes, and begin war.

156. Up rose then an advocate that was wise, by leave and by
157. counsel of other that were wise, and said, 'Lordings, the need
158. [business] for which we be assembled in this place, is a full
159. heavy thing, and an high matter, because of the wrong and of
160. the wickedness that hath been done, and eke by reason of the
161. great damages that in time coming be possible to fall for the
162. same cause, and eke by reason of the great riches and power of
163. the parties both; for which reasons, it were a full great peril to
164. err in this matter. Wherefore, Meliboeus, this is our sentence
165. [opinion]; we counsel you, above all things, that right anon thou
166. do thy diligence in keeping of thy body, in such a wise that thou
167. want no espy nor watch thy body to save. And after that, we
168. counsel that in thine house thou set sufficient garrison, so that
169. they may as well thy body as thy house defend. But, certes, to
170. move war or suddenly to do vengeance, we may not deem
171. [judge] in so little time that it were profitable. Wherefore we
172. ask leisure and space to have deliberation in this case to deem;
173. for the common proverb saith thus; 'He that soon deemeth soon
174. shall repent.' And eke men say, that that judge is wise, that soon
175. understandeth a matter, and judgeth by leisure. For albeit so
176. that all tarrying be annoying, algates [nevertheless] it is no
177. reproof [subject for reproach] in giving of judgement, nor in
178. vengeance taking, when it is sufficient and, reasonable. And
179. that shewed our Lord Jesus Christ by example; for when that
180. the woman that was taken in adultery was brought in his
181. presence to know what should be done with her person, albeit
182. that he wist well himself what he would answer, yet would he
183. not answer suddenly, but he would have deliberation, and in the
184. ground he wrote twice. And by these causes we ask deliberation
185. and we shall then by the grace of God counsel the thing that
186. shall be profitable.'

187. Up started then the young folk anon at once, and the most part
188. of that company have scorned these old wise men and begun to
189. make noise and said, 'Right as while that iron is hot men should
190. smite, right so men should wreak their wrongs while that they
191. be fresh and new:' and with loud voice they cried. 'War! War!'
192. Up rose then one of these old wise, and with his hand made
193. countenance [a sign, gesture] that men should hold them still,
194. and give him audience. 'Lordings,' quoth he, 'there is full many
195. a man that crieth, 'War! war!' that wot full little what war
196. amounteth. War at his beginning hath so great an entering and
197. so large, that every wight may enter when him liketh, and lightly
198. [easily] find war: but certes what end shall fall thereof it is not
199. light to know. For soothly when war is once begun, there is full
200. many a child unborn of his mother, that shall sterve [die] young
201. by cause of that war, or else live in sorrow and die in
202. wretchedness; and therefore, ere that any war be begun, men
203. must have great counsel and great deliberation.' And when this
204. old man weened [thought, intended] to enforce his tale by
205. reasons, well-nigh all at once began they to rise for to break his
206. tale, and bid him full oft his words abridge. For soothly he that
207. preacheth to them that list not hear his words, his sermon them
208. annoyeth. For Jesus Sirach saith, that music in weeping is a
209. noyous [troublesome] thing. This is to say, as much availeth to
210. speak before folk to whom his speech annoyeth, as to sing
211. before him that weepeth. And when this wise man saw that him
212. wanted audience, all shamefast he sat him down again. For
213. Solomon saith, 'Where as thou mayest have no audience,
214. enforce thee not to speak.' 'I see well,' quoth this wise man,
215. 'that the common proverb is sooth, that good counsel wanteth,
216. when it is most need.' Yet [besides, further] had this Meliboeus
217. in his council many folk, that privily in his ear counselled him
218. certain thing, and counselled him the contrary in general
219. audience. When Meliboeus had heard that the greatest part of
220. his council were accorded [in agreement] that he should make
221. war, anon he consented to their counselling, and fully affirmed
222. their sentence [opinion, judgement].

223. (Dame Prudence, seeing her husband's resolution thus taken, in
224. full humble wise, when she saw her time, begins to counsel him
225. against war, by a warning against haste in requital of either
226. good or evil. Meliboeus tells her that he will not work by her
227. counsel, because he should be held a fool if he rejected for her
228. advice the opinion of so many wise men; because all women are
229. bad; because it would seem that he had given her the mastery
230. over him; and because she could not keep his secret, if he
231. resolved to follow her advice. To these reasons Prudence
232. answers that it is no folly to change counsel when things, or
233. men's judgements of them, change - especially to alter a
234. resolution taken on the impulse of a great multitude of folk,
235. where every man crieth and clattereth what him liketh; that if all
236. women had been wicked, Jesus Christ would never have
237. descended to be born of a woman, nor have showed himself
238. first to a woman after his resurrection and that when Solomon
239. said he had found no good woman, he meant that God alone
240. was supremely good;  that her husband would not seem to
241. give her the mastery by following her counsel, for he had his
242. own free choice in following or rejecting it; and that he knew
243. well and had often tested her great silence, patience, and
244. secrecy. And whereas he had quoted a saying, that in wicked
245. counsel women vanquish men, she reminds him that she would
246. counsel him against doing a wickedness on which he had set his
247. mind, and cites instances to show that many women have been
248. and yet are full good, and their counsel wholesome and
249. profitable. Lastly, she quotes the words of God himself, when
250. he was about to make woman as an help meet for man; and
251. promises that, if her husband will trust her counsel, she will
252. restore to him his daughter whole and sound, and make him
253. have honour in this case. Meliboeus answers that because of his
254. wife's sweet words, and also because he has proved and assayed
255. her great wisdom and her great truth, he will govern him by her
256. counsel in all things. Thus encouraged, Prudence enters on a
257. long discourse, full of learned citations, regarding the manner in
258. which counsellors should be chosen and consulted, and the
259. times and reasons for changing a counsel. First, God must be
260. besought for guidance. Then a man must well examine his own
261. thoughts, of such things as he holds to be best for his own
262. profit; driving out of his heart anger, covetousness, and
263. hastiness, which perturb and pervert the judgement. Then he
264. must keep his counsel secret, unless confiding it to another shall
265. be more profitable; but, in so confiding it, he shall say nothing
266. to bias the mind of the counsellor toward flattery or
267. subserviency. After that he should consider his friends and his
268. enemies, choosing of the former such as be most faithful and
269. wise, and eldest and most approved in counselling; and even of
270. these only a few. Then he must eschew the counselling of fools,
271. of flatterers, of his old enemies that be reconciled, of servants
272. who bear him great reverence and fear, of folk that be drunken
273. and can hide no counsel, of such as counsel one thing privily
274. and the contrary openly; and of young folk, for their counselling
275. is not ripe. Then, in examining his counsel, he must truly tell his
276. tale; he must consider whether the thing he proposes to do be
277. reasonable, within his power, and acceptable to the more part
278. and the better part of his counsellors; he must look at the things
279. that may follow from that counselling, choosing the best and
280. waiving all besides; he must consider the root whence the
281. matter of his counsel is engendered, what fruits it may bear,
282. and from what causes they be sprung. And having thus
283. examined his counsel and approved it by many wise folk and
284. old, he shall consider if he may perform it and make of it a good
285. end; if he be in doubt, he shall choose rather to suffer than to
286. begin; but otherwise he shall prosecute his resolution steadfastly
287. till the enterprise be at an end. As to changing his counsel, a
288. man may do so without reproach, if the cause cease, or when a
289. new case betides, or if he find that by error or otherwise harm
290. or damage may result, or if his counsel be dishonest or come of
291. dishonest cause, or if it be impossible or may not properly be
292. kept; and he must take it for a general rule, that every counsel
293. which is affirmed so strongly, that it may not be changed for
294. any condition that may betide, that counsel is wicked.
295. Meliboeus, admitting that his wife had spoken well and suitably
296. as to counsellors and counsel in general, prays her to tell him in
297. especial what she thinks of the counsellors whom they have
298. chosen in their present need. Prudence replies that his counsel in
299. this case could not properly be called a counselling, but a
300. movement of folly; and points out that he has erred in sundry
301. wise against the rules which he had just laid down. Granting
302. that he has erred, Meliboeus says that he is all ready to change
303. his counsel right as she will devise; for, as the proverb runs, to
304. do sin is human, but to persevere long in sin is work of the
305. Devil. Prudence then minutely recites, analyses, and criticises
306. the counsel given to her husband in the assembly of his friends.
307. She commends the advice of the physicians and surgeons, and
308. urges that they should be well rewarded for their noble speech
309. and their services in healing Sophia; and she asks Meliboeus
310. how he understands their proposition that one contrary must be
311. cured by another contrary. Meliboeus answers, that he should
312. do vengeance on his enemies, who had done him wrong.
313. Prudence, however, insists that vengeance is not the contrary of
314. vengeance, nor wrong of wrong, but the like; and that
315. wickedness should be healed by goodness, discord by accord,
316. war by peace. She proceeds to deal with the counsel of the
317. lawyers and wise folk that advised Meliboeus to take prudent
318. measures for the security of his body and of his house. First, she
319. would have her husband pray for the protection and aid of
320. Christ; then commit the keeping of his person to his true
321. friends; then suspect and avoid all strange folk, and liars, and
322. such people as she had already warned him against; then beware
323. of presuming on his strength, or the weakness of his adversary,
324. and neglecting to guard his person - for every wise man
325. dreadeth his enemy; then he should evermore be on the watch
326. against ambush and all espial, even in what seems a place of
327. safety; though he should not be so cowardly, as to fear where is
328. no cause for dread; yet he should dread to be poisoned, and
329. therefore shun scorners, and fly their words as venom. As to
330. the fortification of his house, she points out that towers and
331. great edifices are costly and laborious, yet useless unless
332. defended by true friends that be old and wise; and the greatest
333. and strongest garrison that a rich man may have, as well to keep
334. his person as his goods, is, that he be beloved by his subjects
335. and by his neighbours. Warmly approving the counsel that in all
336. this business Meliboeus should proceed with great diligence and
337. deliberation, Prudence goes on to examine the advice given by
338. his neighbours that do him reverence without love, his old
339. enemies reconciled, his flatterers that counselled him certain
340. things privily and openly counselled him the contrary, and the
341. young folk that counselled him to avenge himself and make war
342. at once. She reminds him that he stands alone against three
343. powerful enemies, whose kindred are numerous and close,
344. while his are fewer and remote in relationship; that only the
345. judge who has jurisdiction in a case may take sudden vengeance
346. on any man; that her husband's power does not accord with his
347. desire; and that, if he did take vengeance, it would only breed
348. fresh wrongs and contests. As to the causes of the wrong done
349. to him, she holds that God, the causer of all things, has
350. permitted him to suffer because he has drunk so much honey
351.  of sweet temporal riches, and delights, and honours of this
352. world, that he is drunken, and has forgotten Jesus Christ his
353. Saviour; the three enemies of mankind, the flesh, the fiend, and
354. the world, have entered his heart by the windows of his body,
355. and wounded his soul in five places - that is to say, the deadly
356. sins that have entered into his heart by the five senses; and in
357. the same manner Christ has suffered his three enemies to enter
358. his house by the windows, and wound his daughter in the five
359. places before specified. Meliboeus demurs, that if his wife's
360. objections prevailed, vengeance would never be taken, and
361. thence great mischiefs would arise; but Prudence replies that the
362. taking of vengeance lies with the judges, to whom the private
363. individual must have recourse. Meliboeus declares that such
364. vengeance does not please him, and that, as Fortune has
365. nourished and helped him from his childhood, he will now assay
366. her, trusting, with God's help, that she will aid him to avenge his
367. shame. Prudence warns him against trusting to Fortune, all the
368. less because she has hitherto favoured him, for just on that
369. account she is the more likely to fail him; and she calls on him
370. to leave his vengeance with the Sovereign Judge, that avengeth
371. all villainies and wrongs. Meliboeus argues that if he refrains
372. from taking vengeance he will invite his enemies to do him
373. further wrong, and he will be put and held over low; but
374. Prudence contends that such a result can be brought about only
375. by the neglect of the judges, not by the patience of the
376. individual. Supposing that he had leave to avenge himself, she
377. repeats that he is not strong enough, and quotes the common
378. saw, that it is madness for a man to strive with a stronger than
379. himself, peril to strive with one of equal strength, and folly to
380. strive with a weaker. But, considering his own defaults and
381. demerits, - remembering the patience of Christ and the
382. undeserved tribulations of the saints, the brevity of this life with
383. all its trouble and sorrow, the discredit thrown on the wisdom
384. and training of a man who cannot bear wrong with patience -
385. he should refrain wholly from taking vengeance. Meliboeus
386. submits that he is not at all a perfect man, and his heart will
387. never be at peace until he is avenged; and that as his enemies
388. disregarded the peril when they attacked him, so he might,
389. without reproach, incur some peril in attacking them in return,
390. even though he did a great excess in avenging one wrong by
391. another. Prudence strongly deprecates all outrage or excess; but
392. Meliboeus insists that he cannot see that it might greatly harm
393. him though he took a vengeance, for he is richer and mightier
394. than his enemies, and all things obey money. Prudence
395. thereupon launches into a long dissertation on the advantages of
396. riches, the evils of poverty, the means by which wealth should
397. be gathered, and the manner in which it should be used; and
398. concludes by counselling her husband not to move war and
399. battle through trust in his riches, for they suffice not to maintain
400. war, the battle is not always to the strong or the numerous, and
401. the perils of conflict are many. Meliboeus then curtly asks her
402. for her counsel how he shall do in this need; and she answers
403. that certainly she counsels him to agree with his adversaries and
404. have peace with them. Meliboeus on this cries out that plainly
405. she loves not his honour or his worship, in counselling him to
406. go and humble himself before his enemies, crying mercy to them
407. that, having done him so grievous wrong, ask him not to be
408. reconciled. Then Prudence, making semblance of wrath, retorts
409. that she loves his honour and profit as she loves her own, and
410. ever has done; she cites the Scriptures in support of her counsel
411. to seek peace; and says she will leave him to his own courses,
412. for she knows well he is so stubborn, that he will do nothing for
413. her. Meliboeus then relents; admits that he is angry and cannot
414. judge aright; and puts himself wholly in her hands, promising to
415. do just as she desires, and admitting that he is the more held to
416. love and praise her, if she reproves him of his folly)

417. Then Dame Prudence discovered all her counsel and her will
418. unto him, and said: 'I counsel you,' quoth she, 'above all
419. things, that ye make peace between God and you, and be
420. reconciled unto Him and to his grace; for, as I have said to you
421. herebefore, God hath suffered you to have this tribulation and
422. disease [distress, trouble] for your sins; and if ye do as I say
423. you, God will send your adversaries unto you, and make them
424. fall at your feet, ready to do your will and your commandment.
425. For Solomon saith, 'When the condition of man is pleasant and
426. liking to God, he changeth the hearts of the man's adversaries,
427. and constraineth them to beseech him of peace of grace.' And I
428. pray you let me speak with your adversaries in privy place, for
429. they shall not know it is by your will or your assent; and then,
430. when I know their will and their intent, I may counsel you the
431. more surely.' ''Dame,' quoth Meliboeus, ''do your will and
432. your liking, for I put me wholly in your disposition and
433. ordinance.'

434. Then Dame Prudence, when she saw the goodwill of her
435. husband, deliberated and took advice in herself, thinking how
436. she might bring this need [affair, emergency] unto a good end.
437. And when she saw her time, she sent for these adversaries to
438. come into her into a privy place, and showed wisely into them
439. the great goods that come of peace, and the great harms and
440. perils that be in war; and said to them, in goodly manner, how
441. that they ought have great repentance of the injuries and
442. wrongs that they had done to Meliboeus her Lord, and unto her
443. and her daughter. And when they heard the goodly words of
444. Dame Prudence, then they were surprised and ravished, and had
445. so great joy of her, that wonder was to tell. 'Ah lady!' quoth
446. they, 'ye have showed unto us the blessing of sweetness, after
447. the saying of David the prophet; for the reconciling which we
448. be not worthy to have in no manner, but we ought require it
449. with great contrition and humility, ye of your great goodness
450. have presented unto us. Now see we well, that the science and
451. conning [knowledge] of Solomon is full true; for he saith, that
452. sweet words multiply and increase friends, and make shrews
453. [the ill-natured or angry] to be debonair [gentle, courteous] and
454. meek. Certes we put our deed, and all our matter and cause, all
455. wholly in your goodwill, and be ready to obey unto the speech
456. and commandment of my lord Meliboeus. And therefore, dear
457. and benign lady, we pray you and beseech you as meekly as we
458. can and may, that it like unto your great goodness to fulfil in
459. deed your goodly words. For we consider and acknowledge
460. that we have offended and grieved my lord Meliboeus out of
461. measure, so far forth that we be not of power to make him
462. amends; and therefore we oblige and bind us and our friends to
463. do all his will and his commandment. But peradventure he hath
464. such heaviness and such wrath to usward, [towards us] because
465. of our offence, that he will enjoin us such a pain [penalty] as we
466. may not bear nor sustain; and therefore, noble lady, we beseech
467. to your womanly pity to take such advisement [consideration]
468. in this need, that we, nor our friends, be not disinherited and
469. destroyed through our folly.'

470. 'Certes,' quoth Prudence, 'it is an hard thing, and right
471. perilous, that a man put him all utterly in the arbitration and
472. judgement and in the might and power of his enemy. For
473. Solomon saith, 'Believe me, and give credence to that that I
474. shall say: to thy son, to thy wife, to thy friend, nor to thy
475. brother, give thou never might nor mastery over thy body, while
476. thou livest.' Now, since he defendeth [forbiddeth] that a man
477. should not give to his brother, nor to his friend, the might of his
478. body, by a stronger reason he defendeth and forbiddeth a man
479. to give himself to his enemy. And nevertheless, I counsel you
480. that ye mistrust not my lord: for I wot well and know verily,
481. that he is debonair and meek, large, courteous and nothing
482. desirous nor envious of good nor riches: for there is nothing in
483. this world that he desireth save only worship and honour.
484. Furthermore I know well, and am right sure, that he shall
485. nothing do in this need without counsel of me; and I shall so
486. work in this case, that by the grace of our Lord God ye shall be
487. reconciled unto us.'

488. Then said they with one voice, ''Worshipful lady, we put us
489. and our goods all fully in your will and disposition, and be ready
490. to come, what day that it like unto your nobleness to limit us or
491. assign us, for to make our obligation and bond, as strong as it
492. liketh unto your goodness, that we may fulfil the will of you and
493. of my lord Meliboeus.'

494. When Dame Prudence had heard the answer of these men, she
495. bade them go again privily, and she returned to her lord
496. Meliboeus, and told him how she found his adversaries full
497. repentant, acknowledging full lowly their sins and trespasses,
498. and how they were ready to suffer all pain, requiring and
499. praying him of mercy and pity. Then said Meliboeus, 'He is well
500. worthy to have pardon and forgiveness of his sin, that excuseth
501. not his sin, but acknowledgeth, and repenteth him, asking
502. indulgence. For Seneca saith, 'There is the remission and
503. forgiveness, where the confession is; for confession is neighbour
504. to innocence.' And therefore I assent and confirm me to have
505. peace, but it is good that we do naught without the assent and
506. will of our friends.' Then was Prudence right glad and joyful,
507. and said, 'Certes, Sir, ye be well and goodly advised; for right
508. as by the counsel, assent, and help of your friends ye have been
509. stirred to avenge you and make war, right so without their
510. counsel shall ye not accord you, nor have peace with your
511. adversaries. For the law saith, 'There is nothing so good by way
512. of kind, [nature] as a thing to be unbound by him that it was
513. bound.''

514. And then Dame Prudence, without delay or tarrying, sent anon
515. her messengers for their kin and for their old friends, which
516. were true and wise; and told them by order, in the presence of
517. Meliboeus, all this matter, as it is above expressed and declared;
518. and prayed them that they would give their advice and counsel
519. what were best to do in this need. And when Meliboeus' friends
520. had taken their advice and deliberation of the foresaid matter,
521. and had examined it by great business and great diligence, they
522. gave full counsel for to have peace and rest, and that Meliboeus
523. should with good heart receive his adversaries to forgiveness
524. and mercy. And when Dame Prudence had heard the assent of
525. her lord Meliboeus, and the counsel of his friends, accord with
526. her will and her intention, she was wondrous glad in her heart,
527. and said: 'There is an old proverb that saith, 'The goodness that
528. thou mayest do this day, do it, and abide not nor delay it not till
529. to-morrow:' and therefore I counsel you that ye send your
530. messengers, such as be discreet and wise, unto your adversaries,
531. telling them on your behalf, that if they will treat of peace and
532. of accord, that they shape [prepare] them, without delay or
533. tarrying, to come unto us.' Which thing performed was indeed.
534. And when these trespassers and repenting folk of their follies,
535. that is to say, the adversaries of Meliboeus, had heard what
536. these messengers said unto them, they were right glad and
537. joyful, and answered full meekly and benignly, yielding graces
538. and thanks to their lord Meliboeus, and to all his company; and
539. shaped them without delay to go with the messengers, and obey
540. to the commandment of their lord Meliboeus. And right anon
541. they took their way to the court of Meliboeus, and took with
542. them some of their true friends, to make faith for them, and for
543. to be their borrows [sureties].

544. And when they were come to the presence of Meliboeus, he
545. said to them these words; 'It stands thus,' quoth Meliboeus,
546. 'and sooth it is, that ye causeless, and without skill and reason,
547. have done great injuries and wrongs to me, and to my wife
548. Prudence, and to my daughter also; for ye have entered into my
549. house by violence, and have done such outrage, that all men
550. know well that ye have deserved the death: and therefore will I
551. know and weet of you, whether ye will put the punishing and
552. chastising, and the vengeance of this outrage, in the will of me
553. and of my wife, or ye will not?' Then the wisest of them three
554. answered for them all, and said; 'Sir,' quoth he, 'we know well,
555. that we be I unworthy to come to the court of so great a lord
556. and so worthy as ye be, for we have so greatly mistaken us, and
557. have offended and aguilt [incurred guilt] in such wise against
558. your high lordship, that truly we have deserved the death. But
559. yet for the great goodness and debonairte [courtesy, gentleness]
560. that all the world witnesseth of your person, we submit us to
561. the excellence and benignity of your gracious lordship, and be
562. ready to obey to all your commandments, beseeching you, that
563. of your merciable [merciful] pity ye will consider our great
564. repentance and low submission, and grant us forgiveness of our
565. outrageous trespass and offence; for well we know, that your
566. liberal grace and mercy stretch them farther into goodness, than
567. do our outrageous guilt and trespass into wickedness; albeit that
568. cursedly [wickedly] and damnably we have aguilt [incurred
569. guilt] against your high lordship.' Then Meliboeus took them
570. up from the ground full benignly, and received their obligations
571. and their bonds, by their oaths upon their pledges and borrows,
572. [sureties] and assigned them a certain day to return unto his
573. court for to receive and accept sentence and judgement, that
574. Meliboeus would command to be done on them, by the causes
575. aforesaid; which things ordained, every man returned home to
576. his house.

577. And when that Dame Prudence saw her time she freined
578. [inquired] and asked her lord Meliboeus, what vengeance he
579. thought to take of his adversaries. To which Meliboeus
580. answered, and said; 'Certes,' quoth he, 'I think and purpose me
581. fully to disinherit them of all that ever they have, and for to put
582. them in exile for evermore.' 'Certes,' quoth Dame Prudence,
583. 'this were a cruel sentence, and much against reason. For ye be
584. rich enough, and have no need of other men's goods; and ye
585. might lightly [easily] in this wise get you a covetous name,
586. which is a vicious thing, and ought to be eschewed of every
587. good man: for, after the saying of the Apostle, covetousness is
588. root of all harms. And therefore it were better for you to lose
589. much good of your own, than for to take of their good in this
590. manner. For better it is to lose good with worship [honour],
591. than to win good with villainy and shame. And every man ought
592. to do his diligence and his business to get him a good name.
593. And yet [further] shall he not only busy him in keeping his good
594. name, but he shall also enforce him alway to do some thing by
595. which he may renew his good name; for it is written, that the
596. old good los [reputation ] of a man is soon gone and
597. passed, when it is not renewed. And as touching that ye say,
598. that ye will exile your adversaries, that thinketh ye much against
599. reason, and out of measure, [moderation] considered the power
600. that they have given you upon themselves. And it is written,
601. that he is worthy to lose his privilege, that misuseth the might
602. and the power that is given him. And I set case [if I assume] ye
603. might enjoin them that pain by right and by law (which I trow
604. ye may not do), I say, ye might not put it to execution
605. peradventure, and then it were like to return to the war, as it
606. was before. And therefore if ye will that men do you obeisance,
607. ye must deem [decide] more courteously, that is to say, ye must
608. give more easy sentences and judgements. For it is written, 'He
609. that most courteously commandeth, to him men most obey.'
610. And therefore I pray you, that in this necessity and in this need
611. ye cast you [endeavour, devise a way] to overcome your heart.
612. For Seneca saith, that he that overcometh his heart, overcometh
613. twice. And Tullius saith, 'There is nothing so commendable in a
614. great lord, as when he is debonair and meek, and appeaseth him
615. lightly [easily].' And I pray you, that ye will now forbear to do
616. vengeance, in such a manner, that your good name may be kept
617. and conserved, and that men may have cause and matter to
618. praise you of pity and of mercy; and that ye have no cause to
619. repent you of thing that ye do. For Seneca saith, 'He
620. overcometh in an evil manner, that repenteth him of his victory.'
621. Wherefore I pray you let mercy be in your heart, to the effect
622. and intent that God Almighty have mercy upon you in his last
623. judgement; for Saint James saith in his Epistle, 'Judgement
624. without mercy shall be done to him, that hath no mercy of
625. another wight.''

626. When Meliboeus had heard the great skills [arguments, reasons]
627. and reasons of Dame Prudence, and her wise information and
628. teaching, his heart gan incline to the will of his wife, considering
629. her true intent, he conformed him anon and assented fully to
630. work after her counsel, and thanked God, of whom proceedeth
631. all goodness and all virtue, that him sent a wife of so great
632. discretion. And when the day came that his adversaries should
633. appear in his presence, he spake to them full goodly, and said in
634. this wise; 'Albeit so, that of your pride and high presumption
635. and folly, an of your negligence and unconning, [ignorance] ye
636. have misborne [misbehaved] you, and trespassed [done injury]
637. unto me, yet forasmuch as I see and behold your great humility,
638. and that ye be sorry and repentant of your guilts, it constraineth
639. me to do you grace and mercy. Wherefore I receive you into my
640. grace, and forgive you utterly all the offences, injuries, and
641. wrongs, that ye have done against me and mine, to this effect
642. and to this end, that God of his endless mercy will at the time of
643. our dying forgive us our guilts, that we have trespassed to him
644. in this wretched world; for doubtless, if we be sorry and
645. repentant of the sins and guilts which we have trespassed in the
646. sight of our Lord God, he is so free and so merciable [merciful],
647. that he will forgive us our guilts, and bring us to the bliss that
648. never hath end.' Amen.
