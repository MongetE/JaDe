1. Now welcome Summer with thy sunne soft,
2. That hast this winter`s weathers overshake,
3. And driven away the longe nighties black.
4. Saint Valentine, that art full high aloft,
5. Thus singen smalle fowles for thy sake:
6. Now welcome Summer with tye sunne soft,
7. That hast this winter`s weathers overshake.

8. Well have they cause for to gladden oft,
9. Wince each of them recovered hath his make.
10. Full blissful may they singe when they wake:
11. Now welcome Summer with they sunne soft,
12. That has this winters weathers overshake,
13. And driven away the longe nighties black.
