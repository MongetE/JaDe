1. Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
2. Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;
3. Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.
4. Only your word will heal the injury
5. To my hurt heart, while yet the wound is clean -
6. Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
7. Their beauty shakes me who was once serene.

8. Upon my word, I tell you faithfully
9. Through life and after death you are my queen;
10. For with my death the whole truth shall be seen.
11. Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
12. Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;
13. Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.
