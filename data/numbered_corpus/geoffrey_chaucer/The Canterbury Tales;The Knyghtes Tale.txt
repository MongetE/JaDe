1. THE KNYGHTES TALE.

2. Iamque domos patrias Scithice post aspera gentis prelia
3. laurigero &c. Thebaid, xii, 519.

4. Heere bigynneth the knyghtes tale.

5. Whilom, as olde stories tellen us,
6. Ther was a duc that highte Theseus;
7. Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,
8. That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
9. Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne,
10. What with his wysdom and his chivalrie;

11. He conquered al the regne of Femenye,
12. That whilom was ycleped Scithia,
13. And weddede the queene Ypolita,
14. And broghte hir hoom with hym in his contree,
15. With muchel glorie and greet solempnytee,

16. And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.
17. And thus with victorie and with melodye
18. Lete I this noble duk to Atthenes ryde,
19. And al his hoost, in armes hym bisyde.
20. And certes, if it nere to long to heere,

21. I wolde have toold yow fully the manere
22. How wonnen was the regne of Femenye
23. By Theseus, and by his chivalrye,
24. And of the grete bataille for the nones
25. Bitwixen Atthenes and Amazones,

26. And how asseged was Ypolita
27. The faire hardy queene of Scithia,
28. And of the feste that was at hir weddynge,
29. And of the tempest at hir hoom-comynge;
30. But al the thyng I moot as now forbere,

31. I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,
32. And wayke been the oxen in my plough,
33. The remenant of the tale is long ynough.
34. I wol nat letten eek noon of this route,
35. Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute,

36. And lat se now who shal the soper wynne;-
37. And ther I lefte, I wol ayeyn bigynne.
38. This duc of whom I make mencioun,
39. Whan he was come almoost unto the toun,
40. In al his wele and in his mooste pride,

41. He was war, as he caste his eye aside,
42. Where that ther kneled in the hye weye
43. A compaignye of ladyes, tweye and tweye,
44. Ech after oother, clad in clothes blake;
45. But swich a cry and swich a wo they make,

46. That in this world nys creature lyvynge
47. That herde swich another waymentynge!
48. And of this cry they nolde nevere stenten,
49. Til they the reynes of his brydel henten.
50. 'What folk been ye, that at myn hom-comynge

51. Perturben so my feste with criynge?'
52. Quod Theseus, 'hav ye so greet envye
53. Of myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye?
54. Or who hath yow mysboden or offended?
55. And telleth me if it may been amended,

56. And why that ye been clothed thus in blak?'
57. The eldeste lady of hem alle spak-
58. Whan she hadde swowned with a deedly cheere,
59. That it was routhe for to seen and heere-
60. And seyde, 'Lord, to whom Fortune hath yeven

61. Victorie, and as a conqueror to lyven,
62. Nat greveth us youre glorie and youre honour,
63. But we biseken mercy and socour.
64. Have mercy on oure wo and oure distresse,
65. Som drope of pitee thurgh thy gentillesse

66. Upon us wrecched wommen lat thou falle;
67. For certes, lord, ther is noon of us alle
68. That she ne hath been a duchesse or a queene.
69. Now be we caytyves, as it is wel seene-
70. Thanked be Fortune, and hir false wheel,

71. That noon estat assureth to be weel.
72. And certes, lord, to abyden youre presence,
73. Heere in the temple of the goddesse Clemence
74. We han ben waitynge al this fourtenyght;
75. Now help us, lord, sith it is in thy myght!

76. I wrecche, which that wepe and waille thus,
77. Was whilom wyf to kyng Cappaneus,
78. That starf at Thebes, cursed be that day!
79. And alle we that been in this array
80. And maken al this lamentacioun,

81. We losten alle oure housbondes at that toun,
82. Whil that the seege theraboute lay.
83. And yet now the olde Creon, weylaway!
84. That lord is now of Thebes the Citee,
85. Fulfild of ire and of iniquitee,

86. He, for despit and for his tirannye,
87. To do the dede bodyes vileynye,
88. Of alle oure lordes, whiche that been slawe,
89. He hath alle the bodyes on an heep ydrawe,
90. And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent,

91. Neither to been yburyed nor ybrent,
92. But maketh houndes ete hem in despit.'
93. And with that word, withouten moore respit,
94. They fillen gruf, and criden pitously,
95. 'Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy

96. And lat oure sorwe synken in thyn herte.'
97. This gentil duk doun from his courser sterte
98. With herte pitous, whan he herde hem speke;
99. Hym thoughte that his herte wolde breke,
100. Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so maat,

101. That whilom weren of so greet estaat.
102. And in his armes he hem alle up hente,
103. And hem conforteth in ful good entente,
104. And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knyght,
105. He solde doon so ferforthyl his myght

106. Upon the tiraunt Creon hem to wreke,
107. That all the peple of Grece sholde speke
108. How Creon was of Theseus yserved,
109. As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.
110. And right anoon, withouten moore abood,

111. His baner he desplayeth, and forth rood
112. To Thebesward, and al his hoost biside,
113. No neer Atthenes wolde he go ne ride,
114. Ne take his ese fully half a day,
115. But onward on his wey that nyght he lay-

116. And sente anon Ypolita the queene,
117. And Emelye, hir yonge suster sheene,
118. Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle-
119. And forth he rit; ther is namoore to telle.
120. The rede statue of Mars, with spere and targe,

121. So shyneth, in his white baner large,
122. That alle the feeldes gliteren up and doun,
123. And by his baner gorn is his penoun
124. Of gold ful riche, in which ther was ybete
125. The Mynotaur which that he slough in Crete.

126. Thus rit this duc, thus rit this conquerour,
127. And in his hoost of chivalrie the flour,
128. Til that he cam to Thebes, and alighte
129. Faire in a feeld, ther as he thoughte fighte.
130. But shortly for to speken of this thyng,

131. With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,
132. He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyght
133. In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flyght,
134. And by assaut he wan the citee after,
135. And rente adoun bothe wall, and sparre, and rafter.

136. And to the ladyes he sestored agayn
137. The bones of hir housbondes that weren slayn,
138. To doon obsequies as was tho the gyse.
139. But it were al to longe for to devyse
140. The grete clamour and the waymentynge

141. That the ladyes made at the brennynge
142. Of the bodies, and the grete honour
143. That Theseus, the noble conquerour,
144. Dooth to the ladyes, whan they from hym wente;
145. But shortly for to telle is myn entente.

146. Whan that his worthy duc, this Theseus,
147. Hath Creon slayn, and wonne Thebes thus,
148. Stille in that feeld he took al nyght his reste
149. And dide with al the contree as hym leste.
150. To ransake in the taas of bodyes dede,

151. Hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede,
152. The pilours diden bisynesse and cure,
153. After the bataille and disconfiture;
154. And so bifel, that in the taas they founde
155. Thurgh-girt with many a grevous blody wounde,

156. Two yonge knyghtes liggynge by and by,
157. Bothe in oon armes wroght ful richely,
158. Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,
159. And that oother knyght highte Palamon.
160. Nat fully quyke, ne fully dede they were,

161. But by here cote-armures, and by hir gere,
162. The heraudes knewe hem best, in special,
163. As they that weren of the blood roial
164. Of Thebes, and of sustren two yborn.
165. Out of the taas the pilours han hem torn,

166. And had hem caried softe unto the tente
167. Of Theseus, and he ful soone hem sente
168. To Atthenes to dwellen in prisoun
169. Perpetuelly, he nolde no raunsoun.
170. And whan this worthy due hath thus ydon,

171. He took his hoost, and hoom he rood anon,
172. With laurer crowned, as a conquerour,
173. And ther he lyveth in joye and in honour

174. Terme of his lyve, what nedeth wordes mo?
175. And in a tour, in angwissh and in wo,

176. Dwellen this Palamon and eek Arcite
177. For evermoore, ther may no gold hem quite.
178. This passeth yeer by yeer, and day by day,
179. Till it fil ones, in a morwe of May,
180. That Emelye, that fairer was to sene

181. Than is the lylie upon his stalke grene,
182. And fressher than the May with floures newe-
183. For with the rose colour stroof hir hewe,
184. I noot which was the fairer of hem two-
185. Er it were day, as was hir wone to do,

186. She was arisen, and al redy dight-
187. For May wole have no slogardrie a-nyght;
188. The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,
189. And maketh hym out of his slepe to sterte,
190. And seith, `arys and do thyn observaunce,'

191. This maked Emelye have remembraunce
192. To doon honour to May, and for to ryse.
193. Yclothed was she fressh, for to devyse,
194. Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse,
195. Bihynde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse,

196. And in the gardyn, at the sonne upriste,
197. She walketh up and doun, and as hir liste
198. She gadereth floures, party white and rede,
199. To make a subtil gerland for hir hede,
200. And as an aungel hevenysshly she soong.

201. The grete tour, that was so thikke and stroong,
202. Which of the castel was the chief dongeoun,
203. Ther as the knyghtes weren in prisoun,
204. Of whiche I tolde yow, and tellen shal,
205. Was evene joynant to the gardyn wal

206. Ther as this Emelye hadde hir pleyynge.
207. Bright was the sonne, and cleer that morwenynge,
208. And Palamoun, this woful prisoner,
209. As was his wone, by leve of his gayler,
210. Was risen, and romed in a chambre on heigh,

211. In which he al the noble citee seigh,
212. And eek the gardyn, ful of braunches grene,
213. Ther as this fresshe Emelye the shene
214. Was in hire walk, and romed up and doun.
215. This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,

216. Goth in the chambre romynge to and fro,
217. And to hym-self compleynynge of his wo.
218. That he was born, ful ofte he seyde, `allas!'
219. And so bifel, by aventure or cas,
220. That thurgh a wyndow, thikke of many a barre

221. Of iren greet, and square as any sparre,
222. He cast his eye upon Emelya,

223. And therwithal he bleynte, and cryede 'A!'
224. As though he stongen were unto the herte.
225. And with that cry Arcite anon upsterte

226. And seyde, 'Cosyn myn, what eyleth thee,
227. That art so pale and deedly on to see?
228. Why cridestow? who hath thee doon offence?
229. For Goddess love, taak al in pacience
230. Oure prisoun, for it may noon oother be;

231. Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee.
232. Som wikke aspect or disposicioun
233. Of Saturne by sum constellacioun
234. Hath yeven us this, al though we hadde it sworn.
235. So stood the hevene, whan that we were born.

236. We moste endure it, this the short and playn.'
237. This Palamon answerde and seyde agayn,
238. 'Cosyn, for sothe, of this opinioun
239. Thow hast a veyn ymaginacioun.
240. This prison caused me nat for to crye,

241. But I was hurt right now thurgh-out myn eye
242. Into myn herte, that wol my bane be.
243. The fairnesse of that lady, that I see
244. Yond in the gardyn romen to and fro,
245. Is cause of al my criyng and my wo.

246. I noot wher she be womman or goddesse,
247. But Venus is it, soothly as I gesse.'
248. And therwithal, on knees doun he fil,
249. And seyde, 'Venus, if it be thy wil,
250. Yow in this gardyn thus to transfigure

251. Bifore me, sorweful wrecche creature,
252. Out of this prisoun helpe that we may scapen!
253. And if so be my destynee be shapen
254. By eterne word to dyen in prisoun,
255. Of oure lynage have som compassioun,

256. That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye.'
257. And with that word Arcite gan espye
258. Wher-as this lady romed to and fro,
259. And with that sighte hir beautee hurte hym so,
260. That if that Palamon was wounded sore,

261. Arcite is hurt as moche as he, or moore.
262. And with a sigh he seyde pitously,
263. 'The fresshe beautee sleeth me sodeynly
264. Of hir, that rometh in the yonder place!
265. And but I have hir mercy and hir grace

266. That I may seen hir atte leeste weye,
267. I nam but deed, ther is namoore to seye.'
268. This Palamon, whan he tho wordes herde,
269. Dispitously he looked and answerde,
270. 'Wheither seistow this in ernest or in pley?'

271. 'Nay,' quod Arcite, 'in ernest by my fey,
272. God helpe me so, me list ful yvele pleye.'
273. This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye;
274. 'It nere,' quod he, 'to thee no greet honour
275. For to be fals, ne for to be traitour

276. To me, that am thy cosyn and thy brother,
277. Ysworn ful depe, and ech of us til oother,
278. That nevere for to dyen in the peyne,
279. Til that the deeth departe shal us tweyne,
280. Neither of us in love to hyndre other,

281. Ne in noon oother cas, my leeve brother,
282. But that thou sholdest trewely forthren me
283. In every cas, as I shal forthren thee.
284. This was thyn ooth, and myn also certeyn,
285. I woot right wel thou darst it nat withseyn.

286. Thus artow of my conseil, out of doute;
287. And now thou woldest falsly been aboute
288. To love my lady, whom I love and serve
289. And evere shal, til that myn herte sterve.
290. Nay, certes, false Arcite, thow shalt nat so!

291. I loved hir first, and tolde thee my wo
292. As to my conseil, and to my brother sworn,
293. To forthre me as I have toold biforn,
294. For which thou art ybounden as a knyght
295. To helpen me, if it lay in thy myght,

296. Or elles artow fals, I dar wel seyn.'
297. This Arcite ful proudly spak ageyn,
298. 'Thow shalt,' quod he, 'be rather fals than I.
299. But thou art fals, I telle thee outrely,
300. For paramour I loved hir first er thow.

301. What, wiltow seyn thou wistest nat yet now
302. Wheither she be a womman or goddesse?
303. Thyn is affeccioun of hoolynesse,
304. And myn is love as to a creature;
305. For which I tolde thee myn aventure

306. As to my cosyn and my brother sworn.
307. I pose, that thow lovedest hir biforn;
308. Wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe
309. That `who shal yeve a lovere any lawe?'
310. Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan,

311. Than may be yeve of any erthely man.
312. And therfore positif lawe and swich decree
313. Is broken al day for love in ech degree.
314. A man moot nedes love, maugree his heed,
315. He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed,

316. Al be she mayde, or wydwe, or elles wyf.
317. And eek it is nat likly, al thy lyf,
318. To stonden in hir grace, namoore shal I,
319. For wel thou woost thyselven, verraily,
320. That thou and I be dampned to prisoun

321. Perpetuelly, us gayneth no faunsoun.
322. We stryven as dide the houndes for the boon,
323. They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon.
324. Ther cam a kyte, whil they weren so wrothe,
325. And baar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.

326. And therfore at the kynges court, my brother,
327. Ech man for hymself, ther is noon oother.
328. Love if thee list, for I love, and ay shal;
329. And soothly, leeve brother, this is al.
330. Heere in this prisoun moote we endure,

331. And everich of us take his aventure.'
332. Greet was the strif and long bitwix hem tweye,
333. If that I hadde leyser for to seye-
334. But to theffect; it happed on a day,
335. To telle it yow as shortly as I may,

336. A worthy duc, that highte Perotheus,
337. That felawe was unto duc Theseus
338. Syn thilke day that they were children lite,
339. Was come to Atthenes his felawe to visite,
340. And for to pleye as he was wont to do-

341. For in this world he loved no man so,
342. And he loved hym als tendrely agayn.
343. So wel they lovede, as olde bookes sayn,
344. That whan that oon was deed, soothly to telle,
345. His felawe wente and soughte hym doun in helle.

346. But of that storie list me nat to write;
347. Duc Perotheus loved wel Arcite,
348. And hadde hym knowe at Thebes yeer by yere,
349. And finally, at requeste and preyere
350. Of Perotheus, withouten any raunsoun

351. Duc Theseus hym leet out of prisoun
352. Frely to goon, wher that hym liste overal,
353. In swich a gyse as I you tellen shal.
354. This was the forward, pleynly for tendite,
355. Bitwixen Theseus and hym Arcite,

356. That if so were that Arcite were yfounde
357. Evere in his lif, by day or nyght or stounde,
358. In any contree of this Theseus,
359. And he were caught, it was acorded thus,
360. That with a swerd he sholde lese his heed;

361. Ther nas noon oother remedie ne reed,
362. But taketh his leve and homward he him spedde;
363. Lat hym be war, his nekke lith to wedde!
364. How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!
365. The deeth he feeleth thurgh his herte smyte,

366. He wepeth, wayleth, crieth pitously,
367. To sleen hymself he waiteth prively.
368. He seyde, 'Allas, that day that he was born!
369. Now is my prisoun worse than biforn;
370. Now is me shape eternally to dwelle

371. Nat in purgatorie but in helle.
372. Allas, that evere knew I Perotheus!
373. For elles hadde I dwelled with Theseus,
374. Yfetered in his prisoun evermo;
375. Thanne hadde I been in blisse, and nat in wo.

376. Oonly the sighte of hire whom that I serve,
377. Though that I nevere hir grace may deserve,
378. Wolde han suffised right ynough for me.
379. O deere cosyn Palamon,' quod he,
380. 'Thyn is the victorie of this aventure.

381. Ful blisfully in prison maistow dure.-
382. In prisoun? certes, nay, but in Paradys!
383. Wel hath Fortune yturned thee the dys,
384. That hast the sighte of hir, and I thabsence;
385. For possible is, syn thou hast hir presence,

386. And art a knyght, a worthy and an able,
387. That by som cas, syn Fortune is chaungeable,
388. Thow maist to thy desir som tyme atteyne.
389. But I, that am exiled and bareyne
390. Of alle grace, and in so greet dispeir

391. That ther nys erthe, water, fir, ne eir,
392. Ne creature, that of hem maked is,
393. That may me heelp, or doon confort in this,
394. Wel oughte I sterve in wanhope and distresse,
395. Farwel, my lif, my lust, and my galdnesse!

396. Allas, why pleynen folk so in commune
397. On purveyaunce of God or of Fortune,
398. That yeveth hem ful ofte in many a gyse
399. Wel bettre than they kan hem-self devyse?
400. Som man desireth for to han richesse,

401. That cause is of his moerdre of greet siknesse.
402. And som man wolde out of his prisoun fayn,
403. That in his hous is of his meynee slayn.
404. Infinite harmes been in thai mateere,
405. We witen nat what thing we preyen here.

406. We faren as he that dronke is as a mous;
407. A dronke man woot wel he hath an hous,
408. But he noot which the righte wey is thider,
409. And to a dronke man the wey is slider.
410. And certes, in this world so faren we;

411. We seken faste after felicitee,
412. But we goon wrong ful often trewely.
413. Thus may we seyen alle, and namely I,
414. That wende and hadde a greet opinioun
415. That if I myghte escapen from prisoun,

416. Thanne hadde I been in joye and perfit heele,
417. Ther now I am exiled fro my wele.
418. Syn that I may nat seen you, Emelye,
419. I nam but deed, ther nys no remedye.'
420. Upon that oother syde, Palamon,


421. Whan that he wiste Arcite was agon,
422. Swich sorwe he maketh, that the grete tour
423. Resouneth of his youlyng and clamour.
424. The pure fettres on his shynes grete
425. Weren of his bittre salte teeres wete.

426. 'Allas,' quod he, 'Arcite, cosyn myn!
427. Of al oure strif, God woot, the fruyt is thyn.
428. Thow walkest now in Thebes at thy large,
429. And of my wo thow yevest litel charge.
430. Thou mayst, syn thou hast wysdom and manhede,

431. Assemblen alle the folk of oure kynrede,
432. And make a werre so sharp on this citee,
433. That by som aventure, or som tretee,
434. Thow mayst have hir to lady and to wyf,
435. For whom that I moste nedes lese my lyf.

436. For as by wey of possibilitee,
437. Sith thou art at thy large of prisoun free,
438. And art a lord, greet is thyn avauntage
439. Moore than is myn, that sterve here in a cage.
440. For I moot wepe and wayle, whil I lyve,

441. With al the wo that prison may me yeve,
442. And eek with peyne that love me yeveth also,
443. That doubleth al my torment and my wo.'
444. Therwith the fyr of jalousie up-sterte
445. Withinne his brest, and hente him by the herte

446. So woodly, that he lyk was to biholde
447. The boxtree, or the asshen dede and colde.
448. Thanne seyde he, 'O cruel goddes, that governe
449. This world with byndyng of youre word eterne,
450. And writen in the table of atthamaunt

451. Youre parlement and youre eterne graunt,
452. What is mankynde moore unto you holde
453. Than is the sheep that rouketh in the folde?
454. For slayn is man right as another beeste,
455. And dwelleth eek in prison and arreeste,

456. And hath siknesse, and greet adversitee,
457. And ofte tymes giltelees, pardee!
458. What governance is in this prescience
459. That giltelees tormenteth innocence?
460. And yet encresseth this al my penaunce,

461. That man is bounden to his observaunce,
462. For Goddes sake, to letten of his wille,
463. Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille.
464. And whan a beest is deed, he hath no peyne,
465. But man after his deeth moot wepe and pleyne,

466. Though in this world he have care and wo.
467. Withouten doute it may stonden so.
468. The answere of this lete I to dyvynys,
469. But well I woot, that in this world greet pyne ys.
470. Allas, I se a serpent or a theef,

471. That many a trewe man hath doon mescheef,
472. Goon at his large, and where hym list may turne!
473. But I moot been in prisoun thurgh Saturne,
474. And eek thurgh Juno, jalous and eek wood,
475. That hath destroyed wel ny al the blood

476. Of Thebes, with hise waste walles wyde.
477. And Venus sleeth me on that oother syde
478. For jalousie and fere of hym Arcite.'
479. Now wol I stynte of Palamon a lite,
480. And lete hym in his prisoun stille dwelle,

481. And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle.
482. The somer passeth, and the nyghtes longe
483. Encressen double wise the peynes stronge
484. Bothe of the lovere and the prisoner;
485. I noot which hath the wofuller mester.

486. For shortly for to seyn, this Palamoun
487. Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun
488. In cheynes and in fettres to been deed,
489. And Arcite is exiled upon his heed
490. For evere mo as out of that contree,

491. Ne nevere mo he shal his lady see.
492. Yow loveres axe I now this questioun,
493. Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?
494. That oon may seen his lady day by day,
495. But in prison he moot dwelle alway;

496. That oother wher hym list may ride or go,
497. But seen his lady shal he nevere mo.
498. Now demeth as yow liste ye that kan,
499. For I wol telle forth, as I bigan.

500. Explicit prima pars.

501. Sequitur pars secunda.

502. Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,
503. Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde `allas,'
504. For seen his lady shal he nevere mo;
505. And shortly to concluden al his wo,
506. So muche sorwe hadde nevere creature,
507. That is, or shal whil that the world may dure.

508. His sleep, his mete, his drynke is hym biraft,
509. That lene he wex and drye as is a shaft.
510. Hise eyen holwe and grisly to biholde,
511. His hewe falow and pale as asshen colde;
512. And solitarie he was and evere allone

513. And waillynge al the nyght, makynge his mone.
514. And if he herde song or instrument,
515. Thanne wolde he wepe, he myghte nat be stent.
516. So feble eek were hise spiritz, and so lowe,
517. And chaunged so, that no man koude knowe

518. His speche nor his voys, though men it herde.
519. And in his geere for al the world he ferde
520. Nat oonly lik the loveris maladye
521. Of Hereos, but rather lyk manye
522. Engendred of humour malencolik

523. Biforen in his celle fantastik,
524. And shortly turned was al up-so-doun
525. Bothe habit and eek disposicioun
526. Of hym, this woful lovere daun Arcite.
527. What sholde I al day of his wo endite?

528. Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
529. This crueel torment, and this peyne and woo,
530. At Thebes in his contree, as I seyde,
531. Upon a nyght in sleep as he hym leyde,
532. Hym thoughte how that the wynged god Mercurie

533. Biforn hym stood, and bad hym to be murie.
534. His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte,
535. An hat he werede upon hise heris brighte.
536. Arrayed was this god, as he took keep,
537. As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;

538. And seyde hym thus, 'To Atthenes shaltou wende,
539. Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.'
540. And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.
541. 'Now trewely, how soore that me smerte,'
542. Quod he, 'to Atthenes right now wol I fare,

543. Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
544. To se my lady that I love and serve,
545. In hir presence I recche nat to sterve.'
546. And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,
547. And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,

548. And saugh his visage al in another kynde.
549. And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,
550. That sith his face was so disfigured
551. Of maladye, the which he hadde endured,
552. He myghte wel, if that he bar hym lowe,

553. Lyve in Atthenes, everemoore unknowe,
554. And seen his lady wel ny day by day.
555. And right anon he chaunged his array,
556. And cladde hym as a povre laborer,
557. And al allone, save oonly a squier

558. That knew his privetee and al his cas,
559. Which was disgised povrely, as he was,
560. To Atthenes is he goon, the nexte way.
561. And to the court he wente, upon a day,
562. And at the gate he profreth his servyse,

563. To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.
564. And shortly of this matere for to seyn,
565. He fil in office with a chamberleyn,
566. The which that dwellynge was with Emelye,
567. For he was wys and koude soone espye

568. Of every servant which that serveth here.
569. Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,
570. For he was yong and myghty for the nones,
571. And therto he was strong and big of bones
572. To doon that any wight kan hym devyse.

573. A yeer or two he was in this servyse
574. Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte;
575. And Philostrate he seyde that he highte.
576. But half so wel biloved a man as he
577. Ne was ther nevere in court, of his degree;

578. He was so gentil of condicioun
579. That thurghout al the court was his renoun.
580. They seyden, that it were a charitee,
581. That Theseus wolde enhaunsen his degree,
582. And putten hym in worshipful servyse

583. Ther as he myghte his vertu exercise.
584. And thus withinne a while his name is spronge
585. Bothe of hise dedes and his goode tonge,
586. That Theseus hath taken hym so neer
587. That of his chambre he made hym a Squier,

588. And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.
589. And eek men broghte hym out of his contree
590. From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely, his rente.
591. But honestly and slyly he it spente,
592. That no man wondred how that he it hadde.

593. And thre yeer in this wise his lif he ladde,

594. And bar hym so in pees, and eek ibn werre,
595. Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.
596. And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,
597. And speke I wole of Palamon a lite.

598. In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
599. Thise seven yeer hath seten Palamoun,
600. Forpyned, what for wo and for distresse.
601. Who feeleth double soor and hevynesse
602. But Palamon, that love destreyneth so,

603. That wood out of his wit he goth for wo?
604. And eek therto he is a prisoner,
605. Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.
606. Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely
607. His martirdom? Forsothe it am nat I,

608. Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.
609. It fel that in the seventhe yer, in May,
610. The thridde nyght, as olde bookes seyn,
611. That al this storie tellen moore pleyn,
612. Were it by aventure or destynee-

613. As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be-
614. That soone after the mydnyght, Palamoun
615. By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisoun
616. And fleeth the citee faste as he may go;
617. For he hade yeve his gayler drynke so

618. Of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn,
619. With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
620. That al that nyght, thogh that men wolde him shake,
621. The gayler sleep, he myghte nat awake.
622. And thus he fleeth as faste as evere he may;

623. The nyght was short and faste by the day,
624. That nedes-cost he moot hymselven hyde;
625. And til a grove, faste ther bisyde,
626. With dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamoun.
627. For shortly this was his opinioun,

628. That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al day,
629. And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his way
630. To Thebesward, his freendes for to preye
631. On Theseus to helpe hym to werreye;
632. And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lif,

633. Or wynnen Emelye unto his wyf;
634. This is theffect and his entente pleyn.
635. Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,
636. That litel wiste how ny that was his care
637. Til that Fortune had broght him in the snare.

638. The bisy larke, messager of day,
639. Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,
640. And firy Phebus riseth up so brighte
641. That al the orient laugheth of the lighte,
642. And with hise stremes dryeth in the greves

643. The silver dropes hangynge on the leves;
644. And Arcita, that is in the court roial
645. With Theseus, his squier principal,
646. Is risen, and looketh on the myrie day.
647. And for to doon his observaunce ot May,

648. Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir
649. He on a courser startlynge as the fir
650. Is riden into the feeldes, hym to pleye,
651. Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.
652. And to the grove of which that I yow tolde

653. By aventure his wey he gan to holde,
654. To maken hym a gerland of the greves,
655. Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn-leves.
656. And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene,
657. 'May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,

658. Welcome be thou, faire fresshe May,
659. In hope that I som grene gete may.'
660. And from his courser, with a lusty herte,
661. Into a grove ful hastily he sterte,
662. And in a path he rometh up and doun

663. Ther as by aventure this Palamoun
664. Was in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se;
665. For soore afered of his deeth was he.
666. No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite,
667. God woot, he wolde have trowed it ful lite!

668. But sooth is seyd, gon sithen many yeres,
669. That feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres.
670. It is ful fair a man to bere hym evene,
671. For al day meeteth men at unset stevene.
672. Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,

673. That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,
674. For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.
675. Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille
676. And songen al the roundel lustily,
677. Into a studie he fil al sodeynly,

678. As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,
679. Now in the croppe, now doun in the breres,
680. Now up, now doun as boket in a welle.
681. Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,
682. Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,

683. Right so kan geery Venus overcaste
684. The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
685. Is gereful, right so chaungeth she array.
686. Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.
687. Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to sike,

688. And sette hym doun withouten any moore;
689. 'Allas,' quod he, 'that day that I was bore!
690. How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee
691. Woltow werreyen Thebes the Citee?
692. Allas, ybroght is to confusioun

693. The blood roial of Cadme and Amphioun!
694. Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man
695. That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,
696. And of the citee first was crouned kyng,
697. Of his lynage am I, and his ofspryng,

698. By verray ligne, as of the stok roial,
699. And now I am so caytyf and so thral
700. That he that is my mortal enemy
701. I serve hym as his squier povrely.
702. And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,

703. For I dar noght biknowe myn owene name,
704. But theras I was wont to highte Arcite,
705. Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte.
706. Allas, thou felle Mars! allas, Juno!
707. Thus hath youre ire oure kynrede al fordo,

708. Save oonly me, and wrecched Palamoun
709. That Theseus martireth in prisoun.
710. And over al this, to sleen me outrely,
711. Love hath his firy dart so brennyngly
712. Ystiked thurgh my trewe careful herte,

713. That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.
714. Ye sleen me with youre eyen, Emelye,
715. Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye.
716. Of al the remenant of myn oother care
717. Ne sette I nat the montance of a tare,

718. So that I koude doon aught to youre plesaunce.'
719. And with that word he fil doun in a traunce
720. A longe tyme, and after he upsterte.
721. This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte
722. He felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,

723. For ire he quook, no lenger wolde he byde.
724. And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,
725. As he were wood, with face deed and pale,
726. He stirte hym up out of the buskes thikke,
727. And seide, 'Arcite, false traytour wikke!

728. Now artow hent that lovest my lady so,
729. For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,
730. And art my blood, and to my conseil sworn,
731. As I ful ofte have seyd thee heer-biforn,
732. And hast byjaped heere duc Theseus,

733. And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus.
734. I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye;
735. Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,
736. But I wol love hire oonly, and namo,
737. For I am Palamon, thy mortal foo!

738. And though that I no wepene have in this place,
739. But out of prison am astert by grace,
740. I drede noght that outher thow shalt dye,
741. Or thow ne shalt nat loven Emelye.
742. Chees which thou wolt, for thou shalt nat asterte!'

743. This Arcite, with ful despitous herte,
744. Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,
745. As fiers as leoun pulled out his swerd,
746. And seyde thus: 'By God that sit above,
747. Nere it that thou art sik and wood for love,

748. And eek that thow no wepne hast in this place,
749. Thou sholdest nevere out of this grove pace,
750. That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.
751. For I defye the seurete and the bond
752. Which that thou seist that I have maad to thee.

753. What, verray fool, thynk wel that love is free!
754. And I wol love hir, maugree al thy myght!
755. But for as muche thou art a worthy knyght,
756. And wilnest to darreyne hire by bataille,
757. Have heer my trouthe; tomorwe I wol nat faille

758. Withoute wityng of any oother wight
759. That heere I wol be founden as a knyght,
760. And bryngen harneys right ynough for thee,
761. And chese the beste, and leve the worste for me.
762. And mete and drynke this nyght wol I brynge

763. Ynough for thee, and clothes for thy beddynge;
764. And if so be that thou my lady wynne,
765. And sle me in this wode ther I am inne,
766. Thow mayst wel have thy lady as for me.'
767. This Palamon answerde, 'I graunte it thee.'

768. And thus they been departed til amorwe,
769. Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.
770. O Cupide, out of alle charitee!
771. O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!
772. Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe

773. Wol noght, hir thankes, have no felaweshipe.
774. Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun:
775. Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,
776. And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,
777. Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,

778. Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne
779. The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne.
780. And on his hors, allone as he was born,
781. He carieth al this harneys hym biforn,
782. And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,

783. This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.
784. Tho chaungen gan the colour in hir face
785. Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,
786. That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,
787. Whan hunted is the leoun and the bere,

788. And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,
789. And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,
790. And thynketh, 'Heere cometh my mortal enemy,
791. Withoute faille he moot be deed or I,
792. For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,

793. Or he moot sleen me, if that me myshappe'-
794. So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,
795. As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.
796. Ther nas no good day ne no saluyng,
797. But streight withouten word or rehersyng

798. Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother,
799. As freendly as he were his owene brother.
800. And after that with sharpe speres stronge
801. They foynen ech at oother wonder longe.
802. Thou myghtest wene that this Palamoun

803. In his fightyng were a wood leoun,
804. And as a crueel tigre was Arcite.
805. As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,
806. That frothen white as foom for ire wood.
807. Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood;

808. And in this wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle,
809. And forth I wole of Theseus yow telle.
810. The destinee, ministre general,
811. That executeth in the world overal
812. The purveiaunce that God hath seyn biforn,

813. So strong it is, that though the world had sworn
814. The contrarie of a thyng, by ye or nay,
815. Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day
816. That falleth nat eft withinne a thousand yeere.
817. For certeinly, oure appetites heere,

818. Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,
819. Al is this reuled by the sighte above.
820. This mene I now by myghty Theseus,
821. That for to hunten is so desirus
822. And namely at the grete hert in May,

823. That in his bed ther daweth hym no day
824. That he nys clad, and redy for to ryde
825. With hunte and horn, and houndes hym bisyde.
826. For in his huntyng hath he swich delit
827. That it is al his joye and appetit

828. To been hymself the grete hertes bane-
829. For after Mars he serveth now Dyane.
830. Cleer was the day, as I have toold er this,
831. And Theseus, with alle joye and blis,
832. With his Ypolita, the faire quene,

833. And Emelye, clothed al in grene,
834. On huntyng be they riden roially,
835. And to the grove, that stood ful faste by,
836. In which ther was an hert, as men hym tolde,
837. Duc Theseus the streighte wey hath holde,

838. And to the launde he rideth hym ful right,
839. For thider was the hert wont have his flight,
840. And over a brook, and so forth in his weye.
841. This duc wol han a cours at hym, or tweye,
842. With houndes swiche as that hym list comaunde.

843. And whan this duc was come unto the launde,
844. Under the sonne he looketh, and anon
845. He was war of Arcite and Palamon,
846. That foughten breme, as it were bores two;
847. The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro

848. So hidously, that with the leeste strook
849. It semed as it wolde felle an ook;
850. But what they were, nothyng he ne woot.
851. This duc his courser with his spores smoot,
852. And at a stert he was bitwix hem two,

853. And pulled out a swerd, and cride, 'Hoo!
854. Namoore, up peyne of lesynge of youre heed!
855. By myghty Mars, he shal anon be deed
856. That smyteth any strook, that I may seen!
857. But telleth me what myster men ye been,

858. That been so hardy for to fighten heere
859. Withouten juge or oother officere,
860. As it were in a lystes roially?'
861. This Palamon answerde hastily,
862. And seyde, 'Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?

863. We have the deeth disserved, bothe two.
864. Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,
865. That been encombred of oure owene lyves,
866. And as thou art a fightful lord and juge,
867. Ne yeve us neither mercy ne refuge,

868. But sle me first for seinte charitee;
869. But sle my felawe eek as wel as me-
870. Or sle hym first, for, though thow knowest it lite,
871. This is thy mortal foo, this is Arcite,
872. That fro thy lond is banysshed on his heed,

873. For which he hath deserved to be deed.
874. For this is he, that cam unto thy gate,
875. And seyde that he highe Philostrate.
876. Thus hath he japed thee ful many a yer,
877. And thou hast maked hym thy chief Squier,

878. And this is he that loveth Emelye.
879. For sith the day is come that I shal dye,
880. I make pleynly my confessioun
881. That I am thilke woful Palamoun,
882. That hath thy prisoun broken wikkedly.

883. I am thy mortal foo, and it am I
884. That loveth so hoote Emelye the grighte,
885. That I wol dye present in hir sighte;
886. Wherfore I axe deeth and my juwise-
887. But sle my felawe in the same wise

888. For bothe han we deserved to be slayn.'
889. This worthy duc answered anon agayn,
890. And seyde, 'This is a short conclusioun,
891. Youre owene mouth, by your confessioun,
892. Hath dampned yow, and I wol it recorde.

893. It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde,
894. Ye shal be deed, by myghty Mars the rede!'
895. The queene anon, for verray wommanhede,
896. Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,
897. And alle the ladyes in the compaignye.

898. Greet pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
899. That evere swich a chaunce sholde falle.
900. For gentilmen they were of greet estaat,
901. And no thyng but for love was this debaat,
902. And saugh hir blody woundes wyde and soore,

903. And alle crieden, both lasse and moore,
904. 'Have mercy, lord, upon us wommen alle!'
905. And on hir bare knees adoun they falle,
906. And wolde have kist his feet ther as he stood;
907. Til at the laste aslaked was his mood,

908. For pitee renneth soone in gentil herte.
909. And though he first for ire quook and sterte,
910. He hath considered shortly in a clause
911. The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause,
912. And although that his ire hir gilt accused,

913. Yet in his resoun he hem bothe excused.
914. As thus, he thoghte wel, that every man
915. Wol helpe hym-self in love, if that he kan,
916. And eek delivere hym-self out of prisoun;
917. And eek his herte hadde compassioun

918. Of wommen, for they wepen evere in oon.
919. And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon,
920. And softe unto hym-self he seyde, 'Fy
921. Upon a lord that wol have no mercy,
922. But been a leoun, bothe in word and dede,

923. To hem that been in repentaunce and drede,
924. As wel as to a proud despitous man,
925. That wol maynteyne that he first bigan!
926. That lord hath litel of discrecioun
927. That in swich cas kan no divisioun,

928. But weyeth pride and humblesse after oon.'
929. And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,
930. He gan to looken up with eyen lighte,
931. And spak thise same wordes al on highte:
932. 'The God of love, A! benedicite!

933. How myghty and how greet a lord is he!
934. Ayeyns his myght ther gayneth none obstacles,
935. He may be cleped a god for hise myracles,
936. For he kan maken at his owene gyse
937. Of everich herte as that hym list divyse.

938. Lo heere, this Arcite and this Palamoun

939. That quitly weren out of my prisoun,
940. And myghte han lyved in Thebes roially,
941. And witen I am hir mortal enemy,
942. And that hir deth lith in my myght also;

943. And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,
944. Ybroght hem hyder bothe for to dye!
945. Now looketh, is nat that an heigh folye?
946. Who may been a fole, but if he love?
947. Bihoold, for Goddes sake that sit above,

948. Se how they blede? Be they noght wel arrayed?
949. Thus hath hir lord, the God of Love, ypayed
950. Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!
951. And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse,
952. That serven love, for aught that may bifalle!

953. But this is yet the beste game of alle,
954. That she, for whom they han this jolitee,
955. Kan hem therfore as muche thank, as me!
956. She woot namoore of al this hoote fare,
957. By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!

958. But all moot ben assayed, hoot and coold;
959. A man moot ben a fool, or yong or oold;
960. I woot it by myself ful yore agon,
961. For in my tyme a servant was I oon.
962. And therfore, syn I knowe of loves peyne,

963. And woot how soore it kan a man distreyne,
964. As he that hath ben caught ofte in his laas,
965. I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespaas,
966. At requeste of the queene that kneleth heere,
967. And eek of Emelye, my suster deere.

968. And ye shul bothe anon unto me swere,
969. That nevere mo ye shal my contree dere,
970. Ne make werre upon me, nyght ne day,
971. But been my freendes in al that ye may,
972. I yow foryeve this trespas, every deel.'

973. And they hym sworen his axyng, faire and weel,
974. And hym of lordship and of mercy preyde,
975. And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he seyde:
976. 'To speke of roial lynage and richesse,
977. Though that she were a queene or a princesse,

978. Ech of you bothe is worthy doutelees
979. To wedden whan tyme is, but nathelees
980. I speke as for my suster Emelye,
981. For whom ye have this strif and jalousye:
982. Ye woot yourself, she may nat wedden two

983. Atones, though ye fighten everemo!
984. That oon of you, al be hym looth or lief,
985. He moot go pipen in an yvy-leef-
986. This is to seyn, she may nat now han bothe,
987. Al be ye never so jalouse, ne so wrothe.

988. And forthy, I yow putte in this degree;
989. That ech of yow shal have his destynee
990. As hym is shape, and herkneth in what wyse;
991. Lo, heere your ende of that I shal devyse.
992. My wyl is this, for plat conclusioun,

993. Withouten any repplicacioun,
994. If that you liketh, take it for the beste,
995. That everich of you shal goon where hym leste,
996. Frely, withouten raunson, or daunger,
997. And this day fifty wykes fer ne ner,

998. Everich of you shal brynge an hundred knyghtes
999. Armed for lystes up at alle rightes,
1000. Al redy to darreyne hire by bataille.
1001. And this bihote I yow withouten faille,
1002. Upon my trouthe, and as I am a knyght,

1003. That wheither of yow bothe that hath myght,
1004. This is to seyn, that wheither he, or thow
1005. May with his hundred, as I spak of now,
1006. Sleen his contrarie, or out of lystes dryve,
1007. Thanne shal I yeve Emelya to wyve,

1008. To whom that Fortune yeveth so fair a grace.
1009. Tho lystes shal I maken in this place,
1010. And God so wisly on my soule rewe,
1011. As I shal evene juge been, and trewe.
1012. Ye shul noon oother ende with me maken,

1013. That oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken.
1014. And if yow thynketh this is weel ysayd,
1015. Seyeth youre avys and holdeth you apayd;
1016. This is youre ende and youre conclusioun.'
1017. Who looketh lightly now but Palamoun?

1018. Who spryngeth up for joye but Arcite?
1019. Who kouthe tellen, or who kouthe endite
1020. The joye that is maked in the place,
1021. Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace?
1022. But doun on knees wente every maner wight,

1023. And thonken hym with al hir herte and myght,
1024. And namely the Thebans, often sithe.
1025. And thus with good hope and with herte blithe
1026. They taken hir leve, and homward gonne they ride
1027. To Thebes with hise olde walles wyde.

1028. Explicit secunda pars

1029. Sequitur pars tercia

1030. I trowe men wolde deme it necligence,
1031. If I foryete to tellen the dispence
1032. Of Theseus, that gooth so bisily
1033. To maken up the lystes roially;
1034. That swich a noble theatre as it was,

1035. I dar wel seyen, in this world ther nas.
1036. The circuit a myle was aboute,
1037. Walled of stoon, and dyched al withoute.
1038. Round was the shap, in manere of compas,
1039. Ful of degrees the heighte os sixty pas,

1040. That whan a man was set on o degree,
1041. He lette nat his felawe for to see.
1042. Estward ther stood a gate of marbul whit,
1043. Westward, right swich another in the opposit;
1044. And shortly to concluden, swich a place

1045. Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space.
1046. For in the lond ther was no crafty man
1047. That geometrie or ars-metrik kan,
1048. Ne portreitour, ne kervere of ymages,
1049. That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages

1050. The theatre for to maken and devyse.
1051. And for to doon his ryte and sacrifise
1052. He estward hath upon the gate above,
1053. In worship of Venus, goddesse of love,
1054. Doon make an auter and an oratorie.

1055. And on the gate westward, in memorie
1056. Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another,
1057. That coste largely of gold a fother.
1058. And northward, in a touret on the wal
1059. Of alabastre whit, and reed coral,

1060. An oratorie, riche for to see,
1061. In worship of Dyane, of chastitee,
1062. Hath Theseus doon wroght in noble wyse.
1063. But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse
1064. The noble kervyng and the portreitures,

1065. The shap, the contenaunce, and the figures,
1066. That weren in thise oratories thre.
1067. First in the temple of Venus maystow se
1068. Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,
1069. The broken slepes and the sikes colde,

1070. The sacred teeris and the waymentynge,
1071. The firy strokes, and the desirynge
1072. That loves servauntz in this lyf enduren;
1073. The othes that her covenantz assuren;
1074. Plesaunce and Hope, Desir, Foolhardynesse,

1075. Beautee and Youthe, Bauderie, Richesse,
1076. Charmes and Force, Lesynges, Flaterye,
1077. Despense, Bisynesse, and Jalousye,
1078. That wered of yelewe gooldes a gerland,
1079. And a cokkow sittynge on hir hand;

1080. Festes, instrumentz, caroles, daunces,
1081. Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces
1082. Of love, whiche that I rekned, and rekne shal,
1083. By ordre weren peynted on the wal,
1084. And mo than I kan make of mencioun;

1085. For soothly, al the mount of Citheroun,
1086. Ther Venus hath hir principal dwellynge,
1087. Was shewed on the wal in portreyynge,
1088. With al the gardyn and the lustynesse.
1089. Nat was foryeten the Porter Ydelnesse,

1090. Ne Narcisus the faire, of yore agon,
1091. Ne yet the folye of kyng Salamon,
1092. And eek the grete strengthe of Ercules,
1093. Thenchauntementz of Medea and Circes,
1094. Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage,

1095. The riche Cresus, kaytyf in servage;
1096. Thus may ye seen, that wysdom ne richesse,
1097. Beautee ne sleighte, strengthe, hardynesse,
1098. Ne may with Venus holde champartie,
1099. For as hir list, the world than may she gye.

1100. Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir las,
1101. Til they for wo ful ofte seyde `allas!'
1102. Suffiseth heere ensamples oon or two-
1103. And, though, I koude rekene a thousand mo.
1104. The statue of Venus, glorious for to se,

1105. Was naked, fletynge in the large see,
1106. And fro the navele doun al covered was
1107. With wawes grene, and brighte as any glas.
1108. A citole in hir right hand hadde she,
1109. And on hir heed, ful semely for to se,

1110. A rose gerland, fressh and wel smellynge;
1111. Above hir heed hir dowves flikerynge.
1112. Biforn hir stood hir sone, Cupido,
1113. Upon his shuldres wynges hadde he two,
1114. And blynd he was, as it was often seene.

1115. A bowe he bar, and arwes brighte and kene.
1116. Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al
1117. The portreiture, that was upon the wal
1118. Withinne the temple of myghty Mars the rede?
1119. Al peynted was the wal in lengthe and brede

1120. Lyk to the estres of the grisly place
1121. That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace,
1122. In thilke colde frosty regioun
1123. Ther as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun.
1124. First on the wal was peynted a forest

1125. In which ther dwelleth neither man ne best,
1126. With knotty knarry bareyne trees olde,
1127. Of stubbes sharpe and hidouse to biholde,
1128. In which ther ran a rumbel and a swough
1129. As though a storm sholde bresten every bough.

1130. And dounward from an hille, under a bente,
1131. Ther stood the temple of Mars Armypotente,
1132. Wroght al of burned steel, of which the entree
1133. Was long and streit, and gastly for to see,
1134. And therout came a rage and suche a veze,

1135. That it made al the gate for to rese.
1136. The northren lyght in at the dores shoon,
1137. For wyndowe on the wal ne was ther noon,
1138. Thurgh which men myghten any light discerne.
1139. The dore was al of adamant eterne,

1140. Yclenched overthwart and endelong
1141. With iren tough, and for to make it strong
1142. Every pyler, the temple to sustene,
1143. Was tonne-greet of iren bright and shene.
1144. Ther saugh I first the dirke ymaginyng

1145. Of felonye, and al the compassyng,
1146. The crueel ire, reed as any gleede,
1147. The pykepurs, and eek the pale drede,
1148. The smyler with the knyfe under the cloke,
1149. The shepne brennynge with the blake smoke,

1150. The tresoun of the mordrynge in the bedde,
1151. The open werre, with woundes al bibledde,
1152. Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace,
1153. Al ful of chirkyng was that sory place.
1154. The sleer of hymself yet saugh I ther,

1155. His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer;
1156. The nayl ydryven in the shode a nyght,
1157. The colde deeth, with mouth gapyng upright.
1158. Amyddes of the temple sat Meschaunce,
1159. With Disconfort and Sory Contenaunce.

1160. Yet saugh I Woodnesse laughynge in his rage,
1161. Armed Compleint, Outhees, and fiers Outrage;
1162. The careyne in the busk with throte ycorve,
1163. A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm ystorve,
1164. The tiraunt with the pray by force yraft,

1165. The toun destroyed, ther was nothyng laft.
1166. Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres,
1167. The hunte strangled with the wilde beres,
1168. The sowe freten the child right in the cradel,
1169. The cook yscalded, for al his longe ladel.

1170. Noght was foryeten by the infortune of Marte,
1171. The cartere over-ryden with his carte,
1172. Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.
1173. Ther were also, of Martes divisioun,
1174. The barbour, and the bocher, and the smyth

1175. That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his styth.
1176. And al above, depeynted in a tour,
1177. Saugh I Conquest sittynge in greet honour,
1178. With the sharpe swerd over his heed
1179. Hangynge by a soutil twyned threed.

1180. Depeynted was the slaughtre of Julius,
1181. Of grete Nero, and of Antonius;
1182. Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn,
1183. Yet was hir deth depeynted therbiforn
1184. By manasynge of Mars, right by figure;

1185. So was it shewed in that portreiture,
1186. As is depeynted in the sterres above
1187. Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.
1188. Suggiseth oon ensample in stories olde,
1189. I may nat rekene hem alle though I wolde.

1190. The statue of Mars upon a carte stood
1191. Armed, and looked grym as he were wood,
1192. And over his heed ther shynen two figures
1193. Of sterres, that been cleped in scriptures
1194. That oon Puella, that oother Rubeus.

1195. This god of armes was arrayed thus:
1196. A wolf ther stood biforn hym at his feet,
1197. With eyen rede, and of a man he eet.
1198. With soutil pencel was depeynt this storie,
1199. In redoutynge of Mars and of his glorie.

1200. Now to the temple of Dyane the chaste
1201. As shortly as I kan I wol me haste,
1202. To telle yow al the descripsioun.
1203. Depeynted been the walles up and doun
1204. Of huntyng and of shamefast chastitee.

1205. Ther saugh I, how woful Calistopee
1206. Whan that Diane agreved was with here,
1207. Was turned from a womman til a bere,
1208. And after was she maad the loode-sterre;-
1209. Thus was it peynted, I kan sey yow no ferre-

1210. Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see.
1211. Ther saugh I Dane, yturned til a tree,
1212. I mene nat the goddesse Diane,
1213. But Penneus doughter which that highte Dane.
1214. Ther saugh I Attheon an hert ymaked,

1215. For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked.
1216. I saugh how that hise houndes have hym caught
1217. And freeten hym, for that they knewe hym naught.
1218. Yet peynted was a litel forthermoor
1219. How Atthalante hunted the wilde boor,

1220. And Meleagree, and many another mo,
1221. For which Dyane wroghte hym care and wo.
1222. Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,
1223. The whiche me list nat drawen to memorie.
1224. This goddesse on an hert ful hye seet,

1225. With smale houndes al aboute hir feet;
1226. And undernethe hir feet she hadde a moone,
1227. Wexynge it was, and sholde wanye soone.
1228. In gaude grene hir statue clothed was,
1229. With bowe in honde, and arwes in a cas.

1230. Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun,
1231. Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun.
1232. A womman travaillynge was hir biforn;
1233. But for hir child so longe was unborn
1234. Ful pitously Lucyna gan she calle,

1235. And seyde, 'Help, for thou mayst best of alle!'
1236. Wel koude he peynten lyfly, that it wroghte,
1237. With many a floryn he the hewes boghte.
1238. Now been thise listes maad, and Theseus,
1239. That at his grete cost arrayed thus

1240. The temples, and the theatre every deel,
1241. Whan it was doon, hym lyked wonder weel.-
1242. But stynte I wole of Theseus a lite,
1243. And speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
1244. The day approcheth of hir retournynge,

1245. That everich sholde an hundred knyghtes brynge
1246. The bataille to darreyne, as I yow tolde.
1247. And til Atthenes, hir covenantz for to holde,
1248. Hath everich of hem broght an hundred knyghtes,
1249. Wel armed for the werre at alle rightes.

1250. And sikerly, ther trowed many a man,
1251. That nevere sithen that the world bigan,
1252. As for to speke of knyghthod of hir hond,
1253. As fer as God hath maked see or lond,
1254. Nas of so fewe so noble a compaignye.

1255. For every wight that lovede chivalrye,
1256. And wolde, his thankes, han a passant name,
1257. Hath preyed that he myghte been of that game;
1258. And wel was hym that therto chosen was.
1259. For if ther fille tomorwe swich a cas

1260. Ye knowen wel, that every lusty knyght
1261. That loveth paramours, and hath his myght,
1262. Were it in Engelond or elles where,
1263. They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen to be there,
1264. To fighte for a lady, benedicitee!

1265. It were a lusty sighte for to see.
1266. And right so ferden they with Palamon,
1267. With hym ther wenten knyghtes many on.
1268. Som wol ben armed in an haubergeoun,
1269. In a bristplate, and in a light gypoun,

1270. And somme woln have a paire plates large,
1271. And somme woln have a Pruce sheeld, or a targe,
1272. Somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel,
1273. And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
1274. Ther is no newe gyse, that it nas old;

1275. Armed were they, as I have yow told,
1276. Everych after his opinioun.
1277. Ther maistow seen comyng with Palamoun
1278. Lygurge hym-self, the grete kyng of Trace.
1279. Blak was his berd, and manly was his face,

1280. The cercles of hise eyen in his heed,
1281. They gloweden bitwyxen yelow and reed,
1282. And lik a griff on looked he aboute,
1283. With kempe heeris on hise browes stoute,
1284. Hise lymes grete, hise brawnes harde and stronge,

1285. Hise shuldres brode, hise armes rounde and longe;
1286. And as the gyse was in his contree,
1287. Ful hye upon a chaar of gold stood he,
1288. With foure white boles in the trays.
1289. In stede of cote-armure, over his harnays

1290. With nayles yelewe and brighte as any gold
1291. He hadde a beres skyn, colblak, for-old;
1292. His longe heer was kembd bihynde his bak,
1293. As any ravenes fethere it shoon for-blak.
1294. A wrethe of gold arm-greet, of huge wighte,

1295. Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
1296. Of fyne rubyes and of dyamauntz.
1297. Aboute his chaar ther wenten white alauntz,
1298. Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
1299. To hunten at the leoun or the deer,

1300. And folwed hym, with mosel faste ybounde,
1301. Colored of gold, and tourettes fyled rounde.
1302. An hundred lordes hadde he in his route,
1303. Armed ful wel, with hertes stierne and stoute.
1304. With Arcita, in stories as men fynde,

1311. His sadel was of brend gold newe ybete;
1312. A mantelet upon his shuldre hangynge

1322. His berd was wel bigonne for to sprynge,
1323. His voys was as a trompe thonderynge.
1324. Upon his heed he wered of laurer grene

1325. A gerland, fressh and lusty for to sene.
1326. Upon his hand he bar for his deduyt
1327. An egle tame, as any lilye whyt.
1328. An hundred lordes hadde he with hym there,
1329. Al armed, save hir heddes, in al hir gere,

1361. Yet song the larke, and Palamon also.
1362. With hooly herte and with an heigh corage
1363. He roos, to wenden on his pilgrymage,
1364. Unto the blisful Citherea benigne,

1365. I mene Venus, honurable and digne.
1366. And in hir houre he walketh forth a pas
1367. Unto the lystes, ther hire temple was,
1368. And doun he kneleth, with ful humble cheer,
1369. And herte soor, and seyde in this manere.

1370. 'Faireste of faire, O lady myn, Venus,
1371. Doughter to Jove, and spouse of Vulcanus,

1378. Myn herte may myne harmes nat biwreye,

1385. And holden werre alwey with chastitee.
1386. That make I myn avow, so ye me helpe.
1387. I kepe noght of armes for to yelpe,
1388. Ne I ne axe nat tomorwe to have victorie,
1389. Ne renoun in this cas, ne veyne glorie

1390. Of pris of armes blowen up and doun,
1391. But I wolde have fully possessioun
1392. Of Emelye, and dye in thy servyse.
1393. Fynd thow the manere how, and in what wyse-
1394. I recche nat, but it may bettre be

1395. To have victorie of hem, or they of me-
1396. So that I have my lady in myne armes.
1397. For though so be, that Mars is god of armes,
1398. Youre vertu is so greet in hevene above
1399. That if yow list, I shal wel have my love.

1400. Thy temple wol I worshipe everemo,
1401. And on thyn auter, where I ride or go,

1403. And if ye wol nat so, my lady sweete,

1408. This is theffect and ende of my preyere,
1409. Yif me my love, thow blisful lady deere!'

1410. Whan the orison was doon of Palamon,
1411. His sacrifice he dide, and that anon,
1412. Ful pitously with alle circumstaunce;
1413. Al telle I noght as now his observaunce.
1414. But atte laste, the statue of Venus shook,

1415. And made a signe wherby that he took
1416. That his preyere accepted was that day.
1417. For thogh the signe shewed a delay,
1418. Yet wiste he wel that graunted was his boone,
1419. And with glad herte he wente hym hoom ful soone.

1420. The thridde houre inequal, that Palamon
1421. Bigan to Venus temple for to gon,
1422. Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye,
1423. And to the temple of Dyane gan hye.

1425. Ful redily with hem the fyr they ladde,
1426. Thencens, the clothes, and the remenant al

1429. Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifise,

1430. Smokynge the temple, ful of clothes faire.
1431. This Emelye, with herte debonaire,
1432. Hir body wessh with water of a welle-
1433. But how she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle,
1434. But it be any thing in general;

1435. And yet it were a game to heeren al,
1436. To hym that meneth wel it were no charge,
1437. But it is good a man been at his large.-
1438. Hir brighte heer was kempt untressed al,
1439. A coroune of a grene ook cerial

1440. Upon hir heed was set, ful fair and meete.
1441. Two fyres on the suter gan she beete,
1442. And dide hir thynges as men may biholde
1443. In Stace of Thebes, and thise bookes olde.
1444. Whan kyndled was the fyr, with pitous cheere

1445. Unto Dyane she spak as ye may heere.
1446. 'O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,
1447. To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene,

1458. And for to walken in the wodes wilde,
1459. And noght to ben a wyf, and be with childe.

1460. Noght wol I knowe the compaignye of man;
1461. Now helpe me, lady, sith ye may and kan,
1462. For tho thre formes that thou hast in thee.
1463. And Palamon, that hath swich love to me,
1464. And eek Arcite, that loveth me so sore,

1465. This grace I preye thee, withoute moore,
1466. As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two,

1477. Syn thou art mayde and kepere of us alle,
1478. My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve,
1479. And whil I lyve a mayde, I wol thee serve.'

1480. The fires brenne upon the auter cleere,
1481. Whil Emelye was thus in hir preyere;
1482. But sodeynly she saugh a sighte queynte,
1483. For right anon oon of the fyres queynte,
1484. And quyked agayn, and after that anon

1485. That oother fyr was queynt and al agon.
1486. And as it queynte, it made a whistelynge
1487. As doon thise wete brondes in hir brennynge;
1488. And at the brondes ende out ran anon
1489. As it were blody dropes many oon;

1490. For which so soore agast was Emelye
1491. That she was wel ny mad, and gan to crye;
1492. For she ne wiste what it signyfied.
1493. But oonly for the feere thus hath she cried,
1494. And weep that it was pitee for to heere;

1495. And therwithal Dyane gan appeere,
1496. With bowe in honde, right as an hunteresse,
1497. And seyde, 'Doghter, stynt thyn hevynesse.
1498. Among the goddes hye it is affermed,
1499. And by eterne word writen and confermed,

1500. Thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of tho

1504. The fires whiche that on myn auter brenne

1505. Shule thee declaren, er that thou go henne,
1506. Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas.'
1507. And with that word, the arwes in the caas
1508. Of the goddesse clateren faste and rynge,
1509. And forth she wente, and made a vanysshynge,

1510. For which this Emelye astoned was,
1511. And seyde, 'What amounteth this, allas!
1512. I putte me in thy proteccioun,
1513. Dyane, and in thy disposicioun!'
1514. And hoom she goth anon the nexte weye.

1515. This is theffect, ther is namoore to seye.
1516. The nexte houre of Mars folwynge this
1517. Arcite unto the temple walked is
1518. Of fierse Mars, to doon his sacrifise
1519. With alle the rytes of his payen wyse.

1520. With pitous herte and heigh devocioun
1521. Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun.
1522. 'O stronge god, that in the regnes colde

1550. Of thee, ne may my strengthe noght availle.
1551. Thanne help me, lord, tomorwe in my bataille
1552. For thilke fyr that whilom brente thee,
1553. As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me!
1554. And do that I tomorwe have victorie,

1555. Myn be the travaille and thyn be the glorie.
1556. Thy sovereyn temple wol I moost honouren
1557. Of any place, and alwey moost labouren

1568. Now lord, have routhe upon my sorwes soore;
1569. Yif me the victorie, I aske thee namoore!'

1570. The preyere stynt of Arcita the stronge;
1571. The rynges on the temple dore that honge,
1572. And eek the dores clatereden ful faste,
1573. Of which Arcita somwhat hym agaste.
1574. The fyres brenden upon the auter brighte,

1631. The grete effect for which that I bygan.

1632. Explicit tercia pars.

1634. Greet was the feeste in Atthenes that day,
1635. And eek the lusty seson of that May
1636. Made every wight to been in such plesaunce

1637. That al that Monday justen they and daunce,
1638. And spenten it in Venus heigh servyse.
1639. And by the cause that they sholde ryse
1640. Eerly for to seen the grete fight,
1641. Unto hir rest wenten they at nyght.

1642. And on the morwe, whan that day gan sprynge,
1643. Of hors and harneys, noyse and claterynge
1644. Ther was in hostelryes al aboute.
1645. And to the paleys rood ther many a route
1646. Of lordes, upon steedes and palfreys.

1647. Ther maystow seen divisynge of harneys
1648. So unkouth and so riche, and wroght so weel,
1649. Of goldsmythrye, of browdynge, and of steel;
1650. The sheeldes brighte, testeres, and trappures;
1651. Gold-hewen helmes, hauberkes, cote-armures;

1652. Lordes in parementz on hir courseres,
1653. Knyghtes of retenue and eek squieres,

1656. There as nede is, they weren nothyng ydel.

1657. The fomy steedes on the golden brydel
1658. Gnawynge, and faste the armurers also
1659. With fyle and hamer prikynge to and fro;
1660. Yemen on foote and communes many oon,
1661. With shorte staves thikke as they may goon,

1662. Pypes, trompes, nakerers, clariounes,
1663. That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;
1664. The paleys ful of peples up and doun,
1665. Heere thre, ther ten, holdynge hir questioun,

1670. Somme seyde he looked grymme, and he wolde fighte,
1671. He hath a sparth of twenty pound of wighte,

1672. Thus was the halle ful of divynynge
1673. Longe after that the sonne gan to sprynge.
1674. The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked
1675. With mynstralcie and noyse that was maked,
1676. Heeld yet the chambre of his paleys riche,

1677. Til that the Thebane knyghtes, bothe yliche
1678. Honured, were into the paleys fet.
1679. Due Theseus was at a wyndow set,
1680. Arrayed, right as he were a god in trone.
1681. The peple preesseth thiderward ful soone,

1682. Hym for to seen and doon heigh reverence.
1683. And eek to herkne his heste and his sentence.
1684. An heraud on a scaffold made an 'Oo!'
1685. Til al the noyse of peple was ydo,
1686. And whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille,

1687. Tho shewed he the myghty dukes wille.
1688. 'The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun
1689. Considered, that it were destruccioun
1690. To gentil blood, to fighten in the gyse
1691. Of mortal bataille, now in this emprise;

1692. Wherfore, to shapen that they shal nat dye,
1693. He wolde his firste purpos modifye.
1694. No man therfore, up peyne of los of lyf,
1695. No maner shot, ne polax, ne short knyf
1696. Into the lystes sende, ne thider brynge.

1697. Ne short swerd for to stoke, with poynt bitynge,
1698. No man ne drawe, ne bere by his syde;
1699. Ne no man shal unto his felawe ryde
1700. But o cours, with a sharpe ygrounde spere.
1701. Foyne if hym list on foote, hym-self to were;

1702. And he that is at meschief shal be take,
1703. And noght slayn, but be broght unto the stake
1704. That shal ben ordeyned on either syde,
1705. But thider he shal by force, and there abyde.
1706. And if so be the chevetayn be take

1707. On outher syde, or elles sleen his make,
1708. No lenger shal the turneiynge laste.
1709. God spede you, gooth forth, and ley on faste!
1710. With long swerd and with maces fight youre fille;
1711. Gooth now youre wey, this is the lordes wille.'

1712. The voys of peple touchede the hevene,
1713. So loude cride they with murie stevene,
1714. 'God save swich a lord, that is so good
1715. He wilneth no destruccion of blood.'
1716. Up goon the trompes and the melodye,

1717. And to the lystes rit the compaignye,
1718. By ordinance, thurgh-out the citee large
1719. Hanged with clooth of gold, and nat with sarge.
1720. Ful lik a lord this noble duc gan ryde,
1721. Thise two Thebanes upon either syde,

1722. And after rood the queene and Emelye,
1723. And after that another compaignye,
1724. Of oon and oother, after hir degre;
1725. And thus they passen thurgh-out the citee
1726. And to the lystes come they by tyme.

1727. It nas nat of the day yet fully pryme
1728. Whan set was Theseus ful riche and hye,
1729. Ypolita the queene, and Emelye,
1730. And othere ladys in degrees aboute.
1731. Unto the seettes preesseth al the route,

1732. And westward thurgh the gates under Marte,
1733. Arcite, and eek the hondred of his parte,
1734. With baner reed is entred right anon.
1735. And in that selve moment Palamon
1736. Is under Venus estward in the place,

1737. With baner whyt, and hardy chiere and face.
1738. In al the world to seken up and doun
1739. So evene withouten variacioun
1740. Ther nere swiche compaignyes tweye!
1741. For ther was noon so wys, that koude seye

1742. That any hadde of oother avauntage,
1743. Of worthynesse ne of estaat ne age,
1744. So evene were they chosen, for to gesse.
1745. And in two renges faire they hem dresse,
1746. Whan that hir names rad were everichon,

1747. That in hir nombre gyle were ther noon.
1748. Tho were the gates shet and cried was loude,
1749. 'Do now youre devoir, yonge knyghtes proude!'
1750. The heraudes lefte hir prikyng up and doun;
1751. Now ryngen trompes loude and clarioun.

1752. Ther is namoore to seyn, but west and est
1753. In goon the speres ful sadly in arrest,
1754. In gooth the sharpe spore into the syde.
1755. Ther seen men who kan juste, and who kan ryde,
1756. Ther shyveren shaftes upon sheeldes thikke;

1757. He feeleth thurgh the herte-spoon the prikke.
1758. Up spryngen speres twenty foot on highte;
1759. Out gooth the swerdes as the silver brighte.
1760. The helmes they tohewen and toshrede,
1761. Out brest the blood, with stierne stremes rede,

1762. With myghty maces the bones they tobreste.
1763. He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste;
1764. Ther stomblen steedes stronge, and doun gooth al;
1765. He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal,
1766. He foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun,

1767. And he hym hurtleth with his hors adoun.
1768. He thurgh the body is hurt and sithen ytake,
1769. Maugree his heed, and broght unto the stake,
1770. As forward was, right there he moste abyde;
1771. Another lad is on that oother syde.

1772. And som tyme dooth hem Theseus to reste,
1773. Hem to refresshe, and drynken if hem leste.
1774. Ful ofte a day han thise Thebanes two
1775. Togydre ymet, and wroght his felawe wo.
1776. Unhorsed hath ech oother of hem tweye,


1777. Ther nas no tygre in the vlae of Galgopheye
1778. Whan that hir whelp is stole, whan it is lite,
1779. So crueel on the hunte, as is Arcite
1780. For jelous herte upon this Palamoun;
1781. Ne in Belmarye ther nys so fel leoun

1782. That hunted is, or for his hunger wood,
1783. Ne of his praye desireth so the blood,
1784. As Palamoun to sleen his foo Arcite.
1785. The jelous strokes on hir helmes byte,
1786. Out renneth blood on bothe hir sydes rede.

1787. Som tyme an ende ther is of every dede;
1788. For er the sonne unto the reste wente,
1789. The stronge kyng Emetreus gan hente
1790. This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite,
1791. And made his swerd depe in his flessh to byte.

1792. And by the force of twenty is he take
1793. Unyolden, and ydrawe unto the stake.
1794. And in the rescous of this Palamoun
1795. The stronge kyng Lygurge is born adoun,
1796. And kyng Emetreus, for al his strengthe,

1797. Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,
1798. So hitte him Palamoun er he were take;
1799. But al for noght, he was broght to the stake.
1800. His hardy herte myghte hym helpe naught,
1801. He moste abyde, whan that he was caught,

1802. By force, and eek by composicioun.
1803. Who sorweth now but woful Palamoun,
1804. That moot namoore goon agayn to fighte?
1805. And whan that Theseus hadde seyn this sighte
1806. Unto the folk that foghten thus echon

1807. He cryde, 'Hoo! namoore, for it is doon.
1808. I wol be trewe juge, and no partie;
1809. Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelie,
1810. That by his fortune hath hir faire ywonne!'
1811. Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne

1812. For joye of this so loude and heighe withalle
1813. It semed that the lystes sholde falle.
1814. What kan now faire Venus doon above?
1815. What seith she now, what dooth this queene of Love,
1816. But wepeth so, for wantynge of hir wille,

1817. Til that hir teeres in the lystes fille.
1818. She seyde, 'I am ashamed, doutelees.'
1819. Saturnus seyde, 'Doghter, hoold thy pees,
1820. Mars hath his wille, his knyght hath al his boone,
1821. And, by myn heed, thow shalt been esed soone.'

1822. The trompes with the loude mynstralcie,
1823. The heraudes that ful loude yolle and crie,
1824. Been in hir wele for joye of Daun Arcite.
1825. But herkneth me, and stynteth now a lite,
1826. Which a myracle ther bifel anon.

1827. This fierse Arcite hath of his helm ydon,
1828. And on a courser for to shewe his face
1829. He priketh endelong the large place,
1830. Lokynge upward upon this Emelye,
1831. And she agayn hym caste a freendlich eye,

1832. (For wommen, as to speken in commune,
1833. They folwen al the favour of Fortune)
1834. And she was al his chiere, as in his herte.
1835. Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,
1836. From Pluto sent, at requeste of Saturne,

1837. For which his hors for fere gan to turne,
1838. And leep aside and foundred as he leep.
1839. And er that Arcite may taken keep,
1840. He pighte hym on the pomel of his heed,
1841. That in the place he lay as he were deed,

1842. His brest tobrosten with his sadel-bowe.
1843. As blak he lay as any cole or crowe,
1844. So was the blood yronnen in his face.
1845. Anon he was yborn out of the place,
1846. With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.

1847. Tho was he korven out of his harneys,
1848. And in a bed ybrought ful faire and blyve,
1849. For he was yet in memorie and alyve,
1850. And alwey criynge after Emelye.
1851. Duc Theseus, with al hes compaignye,

1852. Is comen hoom to Atthenes his citee,
1853. With alle blisse and greet solempnitee;
1854. Al be it that this aventure was falle,
1855. He nolde noght disconforten hem alle.
1856. Men seyde eek that Arcite shal nat dye,

1857. He shal been heeled of his maladye.
1858. And of another thyng they weren as fayn,
1859. That of hem alle was ther noon yslayn,
1860. Al were they soore yhurt, and namely oon,
1861. That with a spere was thirled his brest-boon.

1862. To othere woundes, and to broken armes,
1863. Somme hadden salves, and somme hadden charmes,
1864. Fermacies of herbes and eek save
1865. They dronken, for they wolde hir lymes have.
1866. For which this noble duc as he wel kan,

1867. Conforteth and honoureth every man,
1868. And made revel al the longe nyght
1869. Unto the straunge lordes, as was right.
1870. Ne ther was holden no disconfitynge
1871. But as a justes or a tourneiynge,

1872. For soothly ther was no disconfiture-
1873. For fallyng nys nat but an aventure-
1874. Ne to be lad by force unto the stake
1875. Unyolden, and with twenty knyghtes take,
1876. O persone allone, withouten mo,

1877. And haryed forth by arme, foot, and too,
1878. And eke his steede dryven forth with staves,
1879. With footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves,
1880. It nas aretted hym no vileynye,
1881. Ther may no man clepen it cowardye.

1882. For which anon duc Theseus leet crye,
1883. To stynten alle rancour and envye,
1884. The gree, as wel of o syde as of oother,
1885. And eyther syde ylik as ootheres brother,
1886. And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree,

1887. And fully heeld a feeste dayes three,
1888. And convoyed the kynges worthily
1889. Out of his toun a journee, largely;
1890. And hoom wente every man, the righte way,
1891. Ther was namoore but `fare-wel, have good day.'

1892. Of this bataille I wol namoore endite,
1893. But speke of Palamoun and of Arcite.
1894. Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the soore
1895. Encreesseth at his herte moore and moore.
1896. The clothered blood for any lechecraft

1897. Corrupteth, and is in his bouk ylaft,
1898. That neither veyne-blood, ne ventusynge,
1899. Ne drynke of herbes may ben his helpynge.
1900. The vertu expulsif, or animal,
1901. Fro thilke vertu cleped natural

1902. Ne may the venym voyden, ne expelle.
1903. The pipes of his longes gonne to swelle,
1904. And every lacerte in his brest adoun
1905. Is shent with venym and corrupcioun.
1906. Hym gayneth neither for to gete his lif

1907. Vomyt upward, ne dounward laxatif;
1908. Al is tobrosten thilke regioun,
1909. Nature hath now no dominacioun.
1910. And certeinly, ther Nature wol nat wirche,
1911. Fare-wel phisik, go ber the man to chirche!

1912. This al and som, that Arcita moot dye;
1913. For which he sendeth after Emelye
1914. And Palamon, that was his cosyn deere.
1915. Thanne seyde he thus, as ye shal after heere:
1916. 'Naught may the woful spirit in myn herte

1917. Declare o point of alle my sorwes smerte
1918. To yow, my lady, that I love moost.
1919. But I biquethe the servyce of my goost
1920. To yow aboven every creature.
1921. Syn that my lyf may no lenger dure,

1922. Allas, the wo! allas, the peynes stronge
1923. That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!
1924. Allas, the deeth! allas, myn Emelye!
1925. Allas, departynge of our compaignye!
1926. Allas, myn hertes queene! allas, my wyf!

1927. Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf!
1928. What is this world? what asketh men to have?
1929. Now with his love, now in his colde grave,
1930. Allone, withouten any compaignye.
1931. Fare-wel, my swete foo, myn Emelye,

1932. And softe taak me in youre armes tweye,
1933. For love of God, and herkneth what I seye.
1934. 'I have heer with my cosyn Palamon
1935. Had strif and rancour many a day agon,
1936. For love of yow, and for my jalousye.

1937. And Juppiter so wys my soule gye
1938. To speken of a servaunt proprely,
1939. With alle circumstances trewely,
1940. That is to seyn, trouthe, honour, and knyghthede,
1941. Wysdom, humblesse, estaat, and heigh kynrede,

1942. Fredom, and al that longeth to that art,
1943. So Juppiter have of my soule part
1944. As in this world right now ne knowe I non
1945. So worthy to ben loved, as Palamon
1946. That serveth yow, and wol doon al his lyf;

1947. And if that evere ye shul ben a wyf,
1948. Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man.'
1949. And with that word his speche faille gan,
1950. And from his herte up to his brest was come
1951. The coold of deeth, that hadde hym overcome.

1952. And yet moreover in hise armes two
1953. The vital strengthe is lost and al ago.
1954. Oonly the intellect, withouten moore,
1955. That dwelled in his herte syk and soore
1956. Gan faillen, when the herte felte deeth.

1957. Dusked hise eyen two, and failled breeth,
1958. But on his lady yet caste he his eye.
1959. His laste word was 'mercy, Emelye!'
1960. His spirit chaunged hous, and wente ther
1961. As I cam nevere, I kan nat tellen wher,

1962. Therfore I stynte; I nam no divinistre,
1963. Of soules fynde I nat in this registre,
1964. Ne me ne list thilke opinions to telle
1965. Of hem, though that they writen wher they dwelle.
1966. Arcite is coold, ther Mars his soule gye:

1967. Now wol I speken forthe of Emelye.
1968. Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon,
1969. And Theseus his suster took anon
1970. Swownynge, and baar hir fro the corps away.
1971. What helpeth it to tarien forth the day

1972. To tellen how she weep bothe eve and morwe?
1973. For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe
1974. Whan that hir housbond is from hem ago,
1975. That for the moore part they sorwen so,
1976. Or ellis fallen in swich maladye,

1977. That at the laste certeinly they dye.
1978. Infinite been the sorwes and the teeres
1979. Of olde folk, and eek of tendre yeeres
1980. In al the toun, for deeth of this Theban.
1981. For hym ther wepeth bothe child and man;

1982. So greet a wepyng was ther noon, certayn,
1983. Whan Ector was ybroght al fressh yslayn
1984. To Troye, allas, the pitee that was ther!
1985. Cracchynge of chekes, rentynge eek of heer;
1986. 'Why soldestow be deed,' thise wommen crye,

1987. 'And haddest gold ynough, and Emelye?'
1988. No man myghte gladen Theseus,
1989. Savynge his olde fader, Egeus,
1990. That knew this worldes transmutacioun,
1991. As he hadde seyn it chaungen up and doun,

1992. Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse,
1993. And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse.
1994. 'Right as ther dyed nevere man,' quod he,
1995. 'That he ne lyvede in erthe in som degree,
1996. Right so ther lyvede never man,' he seyde,

1997. 'In al this world that somtyme he ne deyde.
1998. This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo,
1999. And we been pilgrymes passynge to and fro.
2000. Deeth is an ende of every worldes soore.'
2001. And over al this yet seyde he muchel moore,

2002. To this effect ful wisely to enhorte
2003. The peple, that they sholde hem reconforte.
2004. Duc Theseus, with al his bisy cure,
2005. Caste now, wher that the sepulture
2006. Of goode Arcite may best ymaked be,

2007. And eek moost honurable in his degree.
2008. And at the laste he took conclusioun
2009. That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun
2010. Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,
2011. That in that selve grove swoote and grene

2012. Ther as he hadde hise amorouse desires,
2013. His compleynte, and for love hise hoote fires
2014. He wolde make a fyr, in which the office
2015. Funeral he myghte al accomplice;
2016. And leet comande anon to hakke and hewe

2017. The okes olde, and leye hem on a rewe
2018. In colpons, wel arrayed for to brenne.
2019. Hise officers with swifte feet they renne
2020. And ryden anon at his comandement;
2021. And after this Theseus hath ysent

2022. After a beere, and it al over-spradde
2023. With clooth of gold, the richeste that he hadde.
2024. And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite,
2025. Upon his hondes hadde he gloves white,
2026. EEk on his heed a coroune of laurer grene,

2027. And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.
2028. He leyde hym bare the visage on the beere,
2029. Ther-with he weep that pitee was to heere.
2030. And for the peple sholde seen hym alle,
2031. Whan it was day, he broghte hym to the halle,

2032. That roreth of the criyng and the soun.
2033. Tho cam this woful Theban, Palamoun,
2034. With flotery berd and rugged asshy heeres,
2035. In clothes blake, ydropped al with teeres,
2036. And passynge othere of wepynge Emelye,

2037. The rewefulleste of al the compaignye.
2038. In as muche as the servyce sholde be
2039. The moore noble and riche in his degree,
2040. Duc Theseus leet forth thre steedes brynge
2041. That trapped were in steel al gliterynge,

2042. And covered with the armes of daun Arcite.
2043. Upon thise steedes that weren grete and white
2044. Ther sitten folk, of whiche oon baar his sheeld,
2045. Another his spere up in his hondes heeld,
2046. The thridde baar with hym his bowe Turkeys,

2047. Of brend gold was the caas, and eek the harneys;
2048. And riden forth a paas, with sorweful cheere,
2049. Toward the grove, as ye shul after heere.

2052. With slakke paas, and eyen rede and wete,
2053. Thurghout the citee by the maister-strete,
2054. That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye
2055. Right of the same is the strete ywrye.
2056. Upon the right hond wente olde Egeus,

2057. And on that oother syde duc Theseus,

2121. Thanne semed me ther was a parlement

2128. Unwist of hym what was the cause and why.
2129. But in hise blake clothes sorwefully
2130. He cam at his comandement in hye;
2131. Tho sente Theseus for Emelye.

2132. Whan they were set, and hust was al the place,
2133. And Theseus abiden hadde a space
2134. Er any word cam fram his wise brest,
2135. Hise eyen sette he ther as was his lest,
2136. And with a sad visage he siked stille,

2137. And after that right thus he seyde his wille.
2138. 'The firste moevere of the cause above
2139. Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,
2140. Greet was theffect, and heigh was his entente;
2141. Wel wiste he, why, and what therof he mente,

2142. For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
2143. The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond,
2144. In certeyn boundes that they may nat flee.
2145. That same prince and that same moevere,' quod he,
2146. 'Hath stablissed in this wrecched world adoun

2147. Certeyne dayes and duracioun
2148. To al that is engendred in this place,
2149. Over the whiche day they may nat pace;
2150. Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge,
2151. Ther nedeth noght noon auctoritee allegge,

2152. For it is preeved by experience-
2153. But that me list declaren my sentence.
2154. Thanne may men by this ordre wel discerne
2155. That thilke moevere stable is and eterne.
2156. Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,

2157. That every part deryveth from his hool;
2158. For nature hath nat taken his bigynnyng
2159. Of no partie nor cantel of a thyng,
2160. But of a thyng that parfit is and stable,
2161. Descendynge so til it be corrumpable;

2162. And therfore, of his wise purveiaunce,
2163. He hath so wel biset his ordinaunce,
2164. That speces of thynges and progressiouns
2165. Shullen enduren by successiouns,
2166. And nat eterne, withouten any lye.

2167. This maystow understonde and seen at eye.
2168. Lo the ook, that hath so long a norisshynge
2169. From tyme that it first bigynneth sprynge,
2170. And hath so long a lif, as we may see,
2171. Yet at the laste wasted is the tree.

2172. Considereth eek, how that the harde stoon
2173. Under oure feet, on which we trede and goon,
2174. Yit wasteth it, as it lyth by the weye.
2175. The brode ryver somtyme wexeth dreye,
2176. The grete toures se we wane and wende,

2177. Thanne may ye se that al this thyng hath ende.
2178. Of man and womman seen we wel also,
2179. That nedeth, in oon of thise termes two,
2180. This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age,
2181. He moot be deed, the kyng as shal a page.

2182. Som in his bed, som in the depe see,
2183. Som in the large feeld, as men may se;
2184. Ther helpeth noght, al goth that ilke weye,
2185. Thanne may I seyn that al this thyng moot deye.
2186. What maketh this, but Juppiter the kyng,

2187. That is prince and cause of alle thyng
2188. Convertyng al unto his propre welle
2189. From which it is deryved, sooth to telle,
2190. And heer agayns no creature on lyve
2191. Of no degree availleth for to stryve.

2192. Thanne is it wysdom, as it thynketh me,
2193. To maken vertu of necessitee,
2194. And take it weel, that we may nat eschue;
2195. And namely, that to us alle is due.
2196. And who so gruccheth ought, he dooth folye,

2197. And rebel is to hym that al may gye.
2198. And certeinly, a man hath moost honour
2199. To dyen in his excellence and flour,
2200. Whan he is siker of his goode name,
2201. Thanne hath he doon his freend ne hym no shame.

2202. And galdder oghte his freend been of his deeth,
2203. Whan with honour upyolden in his breeth,
2204. Than whan his name apalled is for age;
2205. For al forgeten is his vassellage.
2206. Thanne is it best as for a worthy fame,

2207. To dyen whan that he is best of name.
2208. The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse:
2209. Why grucchen heere his cosyn and his wyf
2210. That goode Arcite, of chivalrie flour,
2211. Departed is with duetee and honour

2212. Out of this foule prisoun of this lyf?
2213. Why grucchen heere his cosyn and his wyf
2214. Of his welfare, that loved hem so weel?
2215. Kan he hem thank? Nay, God woot never a deel!
2216. That bothe his soule and eek hemself offende,

2217. And yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende.
2218. What may I concluden of this longe serye,
2219. But after wo I rede us to be merye,
2220. And thanken Juppiter of al his grace?
2221. And er that we departen from this place

2222. I rede that we make, of sorwes two,
2223. O parfit joye lastyng everemo.
2224. And looketh now, wher moost sorwe is her inne,
2225. Ther wol we first amenden and bigynne.
2226. 'Suster,' quod he, 'this is my fulle assent,

2227. With all thavys heere of my parlement,
2228. That gentil Palamon thyn owene kynght,
2229. That serveth yow with wille, herte, and myght,
2230. And evere hath doon, syn that ye first hym knewe,
2231. That ye shul of your grace upon hym rewe,

2232. And taken hym for housbonde and for lord.
2233. Lene me youre hond, for this is oure accord.
2234. Lat se now of youre wommanly pitee;
2235. He is a kynges brother sone, pardee,
2236. And though he were a povre bacheler,

2237. Syn he hath served yow so many a yeer,
2238. And had for yow so greet adversitee,
2239. It moste been considered, leeveth me,
2240. For gentil mercy oghte to passen right.'
2241. Thanne seyde he thus to Palamon ful right:

2242. 'I trowe ther nedeth litel sermonyng
2243. To make yow assente to this thyng.
2244. Com neer, and taak youre lady by the hond.'
2245. Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond
2246. That highte matrimoigne, or mariage,

2247. By al the conseil and the baronage.
2248. And thus with alle blisse and melodye
2249. Hath Palamon ywedded Emelye;
2250. And God, that al this wyde world hath wroght,
2251. Sende hym his love that hath it deere aboght!

2252. For now is Palamon in alle wele,
2253. Lyvynge in blisse, in richesse, and in heele,
2254. And Emelye hym loveth so tendrely,
2255. And he hir serveth al so gentilly,
2256. That nevere was ther no word hem bitwene,

2257. Of jalousie, or any oother teene.
2258. Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye,
2259. And God save al this faire compaignye!-Amen-

2260. Heere is ended the knyghtes tale.
