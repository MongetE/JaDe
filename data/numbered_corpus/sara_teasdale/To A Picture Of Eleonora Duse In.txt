1. Carved in the silence by the hand of Pain,
2. And made more perfect by the gift of Peace,
3. Than if Delight had bid your sorrow cease,
4. And brought the dawn to where the dark has lain,
5. And set a smile upon your lips again;
6. Oh strong and noble! Tho' your woes increase,
7. The gods shall hear no crying for release,
8. Nor see the tremble that your lips restrain.
9. Alone as all the chosen are alone,
10. Yet one with all the beauty of the past;
11. A sister to the noblest that we know,
12. The Venus carved in Melos long ago,
13. Yea, speak to her, and at your lightest tone,
14. Her lips will part and words will come at last.
