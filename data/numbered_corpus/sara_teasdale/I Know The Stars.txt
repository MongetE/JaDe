1. I KNOW the stars by their names,
2. Aldebaran, Altair,
3. And I know the path they take
4. Up heaven's broad blue stair.
5. I know the secrets of men
6. By the look of their eyes,
7. Their gray thoughts, their strange thoughts
8. Have made me sad and wise.
9. But your eyes are dark to me
10. Though they seem to call and callâ€”
11. I cannot tell if you love me
12. Or do not love me at all.
13. I know many things,
14. But the years come and go,
15. I shall die not knowing
16. The thing I long to know.
