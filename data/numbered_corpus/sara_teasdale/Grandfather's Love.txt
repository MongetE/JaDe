1. They said he sent his love to me,
2. They wouldn't put it in my hand,
3. And when I asked them where it was
4. They said I couldn't understand.

5. I thought they must have hidden it,
6. I hunted for it all the day,
7. And when I told them so at night
8. They smiled and turned their heads away.

9. They say that love is something kind,
10. That I can never see or touch.
11. I wish he'd sent me something else,
12. I like his cough-drops twice as much.
