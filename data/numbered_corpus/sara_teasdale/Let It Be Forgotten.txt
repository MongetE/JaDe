1. Let it be forgotten, as a flower is forgotten,
2. Forgotten as a fire that once was singing gold,
3. Let it be forgotten forever and ever,
4. Time is a kind friend, he will make us old.

5. If anyone asks, say it was forgotten
6. Long and long ago,
7. As a flower, as a fire, as a hushed footfall
8. In a long-forgotten snow.
