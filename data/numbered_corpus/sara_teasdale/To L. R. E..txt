1. When first I saw you — felt you take my hand,
2. I could not speak for happiness to find
3. How more than all they said your heart was kind,
4. How strong you were, and quick to understand —
5. I dared not say: 'I who am least of those
6. Who call you friend — I love you, and I crave
7. A little love that I may be more brave
8. Because one watches me who cares and knows.'
9. So, silent, long ago I used to look
10. High up along the shelves at one great book,
11. And longed to see its contents, childishwise,
12. And now I know it for my Poet's own, —
13. So sometime shall I know you and be known,
14. And looking upward, I shall find your eyes.
