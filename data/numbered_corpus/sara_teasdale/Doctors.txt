1. Every night I lie awake
2. And every day I lie abed
3. And hear the doctors, Pain and Death,
4. Confering at my head.

5. They speak in scientific tones,
6. Professional and low--
7. One argues for a speedy cure,
8. The other, sure and slow.

9. To one so humble as myself
10. It should be matter for some pride
11. To have such noted fellows here,
12. Conferring at my side.
