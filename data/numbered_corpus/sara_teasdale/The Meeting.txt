1. I'm happy, I'm happy,
2. I saw my love to-day.
3. He came along the crowded street,
4. By all the ladies gay,
5. And oh, he smiled and spoke to me
6. Before he went his way.
7. My throat was tight with happiness,
8. I couldn't say a word,
9. My heart was beating fast, so fast
10. I'm sure he must have heard;
11. And when he passed, I trembled like
12. A little frightened bird.
13. I wish I were the flower-girl
14. Who waits beside the way â€”
15. I'd give my flowers all to him
16. And see him every day;
17. I wish I were the flower-girl
18. Who waits beside the way.
