1. I said, "I will take my life
2. And throw it away;
3. I who was fire and song
4. Will turn to clay."

5. "I will lie no more in the night
6. With shaken breath,
7. I will toss my heart in the air
8. To be caught by Death."

9. But out of the night I heard,
10. Like the inland sound of the sea,
11. The hushed and terrible sob
12. Of all humanity.

13. Then I said, "Oh who am I
14. To scorn God to his face?
15. I will bow my head and stay
16. And suffer with my race."
