1. WILL it always be like this until I am dead,
2. Every spring must I bear it all again
3. With the first red haze of the budding maple boughs,
4. And the first sweet-smelling rain?
5. Oh I am like a rock in the rising river
6. Where the flooded water breaks with a low callâ€”
7. Like a rock that knows the cry of the waters
8. And cannot answer at all.
