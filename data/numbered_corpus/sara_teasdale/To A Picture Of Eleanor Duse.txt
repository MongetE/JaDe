1. Was ever any face like this before —
2. So light a veiling for the soul within,
3. So pure and yet so pitiful for sin?
4. They say the soul will pass the Heavy Door,
5. And yearning upward, learn creation's lore —
6. The body buried 'neath the earthly din.
7. But thine shall live forever, it hath been
8. So near the soul, and shall be evermore.
9. Oh eyes that see so far thro' misted tears,
10. Oh Death, behold, these eyes can never die!
11. Yea, tho' your kiss shall rob these lips of breath,
12. Their faint, sad smile will still elude thee, Death.
13. Behold the perfect flower this neck uprears,
14. And bow thy head and pass the wonder by.
