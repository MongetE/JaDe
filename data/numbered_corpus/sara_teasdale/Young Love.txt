1. I

2. I cannot heed the words they say,
3. The lights grow far away and dim,
4. Amid the laughing men and maids
5. My eyes unbidden seek for him.

6. I hope that when he smiles at me
7. He does not guess my joy and pain,
8. For if he did, he is too kind
9. To ever look my way again.

10. II

11. I have a secret in my heart
12. No ears have ever heard,
13. And still it sings there day by day
14. Most like a caged bird.

15. And when it beats against the bars,
16. I do not set it free,
17. For I am happier to know
18. It only sings for me.

19. III

20. I wrote his name along the beach,
21. I love the letters so.
22. Far up it seemed and out of reach,
23. For still the tide was low.

24. But oh, the sea came creeping up,
25. And washed the name away,
26. And on the sand where it had been
27. A bit of sea-grass lay.

28. A bit of sea-grass on the sand,
29. Dropped from a mermaid's hair --
30. Ah, had she come to kiss his name
31. And leave a token there?

32. IV

33. What am I that he should love me,
34. He who stands so far above me,
35. What am I?
36. I am like a cowslip turning
37. Toward the sky,
38. Where a planet's golden burning
39. Breaks the cowslip's heart with yearning,
40. What am I that he should love me,
41. What am I?

42. V

43. O dreams that flock about my sleep,
44. I pray you bring my love to me,
45. And let me think I hear his voice
46. Again ring free.

47. And if you care to please me well,
48. And live to-morrow in my mind,
49. Let him who was so cold before,
50. To-night seem kind.

51. VI

52. I plucked a daisy in the fields,
53. And there beneath the sun
54. I let its silver petals fall
55. One after one.

56. I said, "He loves me, loves me not,"
57. And oh, my heart beat fast,
58. The flower was kind, it let me say
59. "He loves me," last.

60. I kissed the little leafless stem,
61. But oh, my poor heart knew
62. The words the flower had said to me,
63. They were not true.

64. VII

65. I sent my love a letter,
66. And if he loves me not,
67. He shall not find my love for him
68. In any line or dot.

69. But if he loves me truly,
70. He'll find it hidden deep,
71. As dawn gleams red thro' chilly clouds
72. To eyes awaked from sleep.

73. VIII

74. The world is cold and gray and wet,
75. And I am heavy-hearted, yet
76. When I am home and look to see
77. The place my letters wait for me,
78. If I should find one letter there,
79. I think I should not greatly care
80. If it were rainy or were fair,
81. For all the world would suddenly
82. Seem like a festival to me.

83. IX

84. I hid three words within my heart,
85. That longed to fly to him,
86. At dawn they woke me with a start,
87. They sang till day was dim.

88. And now at last I let them fly,
89. As little birds should do,
90. And he will know the first is "I",
91. The others "Love" and "You".

92. X

93. Across the twilight's violet
94. His curtained window glimmers gold;
95. Oh happy light that round my love
96. Can fold.

97. Oh happy book within his hand,
98. Oh happy page he glorifies,
99. Oh happy little word beneath
100. His eyes.

101. But oh, thrice happy, happy I
102. Who love him more than songs can tell,
103. For in the heaven of his heart
104. I dwell.
