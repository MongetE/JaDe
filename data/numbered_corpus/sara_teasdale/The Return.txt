1. I turned the key and opened wide the door
2. To enter my deserted room again,
3. Where thro' the long hot months the dust had lain.
4. Was it not lonely when across the floor
5. No step was heard, no sudden song that bore
6. My whole heart upward with a joyous pain?
7. Were not the pictures and the volumes fain
8. To have me with them always as before?
9. But Giorgione's Venus did not deign
10. To lift her lids, nor did the subtle smile
11. Of Mona Lisa deepen. Madeleine
12. Still wept against the glory of her hair,
13. Nor did the lovers part their lips the while,
14. But kissed unheeding that I watched them there.
