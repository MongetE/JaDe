1. REDBIRDS, redbirds,
2. Long and long ago,
3. What a honey-call you had
4. In hills I used to know;
5. Redbud, buckberry,
6. Wild plum-tree
7. And proud river sweeping
8. Southward to the sea,
9. Brown and gold in the sun
10. Sparkling far below,
11. Trailing stately round her bluffs
12. Where the poplars growâ€”
13. Redbirds, redbirds,
14. Are you singing still
15. As you sang one May day
16. On Saxton's Hill?
