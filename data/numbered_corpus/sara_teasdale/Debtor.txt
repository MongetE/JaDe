1. SO long as my spirit still
2. Is glad of breath
3. And lifts its plumes of pride
4. In the dark face of death;
5. While I am curious still
6. Of love and fame,
7. Keeping my heart too high
8. For the years to tame,
9. How can I quarrel with fate
10. Since I can see
11. I am a debtor to life,
12. Not life to me?
