1. Out of the window a sea of green trees
2. Lift their soft boughs like the arms of a dancer;
3. They beckon and call me, "Come out in the sun!"
4. But I cannot answer.

5. I am alone with Weakness and Pain,
6. Sick abed and June is going,
7. I cannot keep her, she hurries by
8. With the silver-green of her garments blowing.

9. Men and women pass in the street
10. Glad of the shining sapphire weather,
11. But we know more of it than they,
12. Pain and I together.

13. They are the runners in the sun,
14. Breathless and blinded by the race,
15. But we are watchers in the shade
16. Who speak with Wonder face to face.
