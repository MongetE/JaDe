1. I have remembered beauty in the night,
2. Against black silences I waked to see
3. A shower of sunlight over Italy
4. And green Ravello dreaming on her height;
5. I have remembered music in the dark,
6. The clean swift brightness of a fugue of Bach's,
7. And running water singing on the rocks
8. When once in English woods I heard a lark.

9. But all remembered beauty is no more
10. Than a vague prelude to the thought of you--
11. You are the rarest soul I ever knew,
12. Lover of beauty, knightliest and best,
13. My thoughts seek you as waves that seek the shore,
14. And when I think of you I am at rest.
