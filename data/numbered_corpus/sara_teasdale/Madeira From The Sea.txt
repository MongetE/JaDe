1. Out of the delicate dream of the distance an emerald emerges
2. Veiled in the violet folds of the air of the sea;
3. Softly the dream grows awakening -- shimmering white of a city,
4. Splashes of crimson, the gay bougainvillea, the palms.
5. High in the infinite blue of its heaven a quiet cloud lingers,
6. Lost and forgotten of winds that have fallen asleep,
7. Fallen asleep to the tune of a Portuguese song in a garden.
