1. Was Time not harsh to you, or was he kind,
2. O pale Erinna of the perfect lyre,
3. That he has left no word of singing fire
4. Whereby you waked the dreaming Lesbian wind,
5. And kindled night along the lyric shore?
6. O girl whose lips Erato stooped to kiss,
7. Do you go sorrowing because of this
8. In fields where poets sing forevermore?
9. Or are you glad and is it best to be
10. A silent music men have never heard,
11. A dream in all our souls that we may say:
12. "Her voice had all the rapture of the sea,
13. And all the clear cool quiver of a bird
14. Deep in a forest at the break of day"?
