1. My heart has grown rich with the passing of years,
2. I have less need now than when I was young
3. To share myself with every comer
4. Or shape my thoughts into words with my tongue.

5. It is one to me that they come or go
6. If I have myself and the drive of my will,
7. And strength to climb on a summer night
8. And watch the stars swarm over the hill.

9. Let them think I love them more than I do,
10. Let them think I care, though I go alone;
11. If it lifts their pride, what is it to me
12. Who am self-complete as a flower or a stone.
