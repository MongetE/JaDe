1. (To the maiden with the hidden face in Abbey's painting)

2. The other maidens raised their eyes to him
3. Who stumbled in before them when the fight
4. Had left him victor, with a victor's right.
5. I think his eyes with quick hot tears grew dim;
6. He scarcely saw her swaying white and slim,
7. And trembling slightly, dreaming of his might,
8. Nor knew he touched her hand, as strangely light
9. As a wan wraith's beside a river's rim.
10. The other maidens raised their eyes to see
11. And only she has hid her face away,
12. And yet I ween she loved him more than they,
13. And very fairly fashioned was her face.
14. Yet for Love's shame and sweet humility,
15. She dared not meet him with their queenlike grace.
