1. (For a picture by Duncan Walker)

2. Lady, light in the east hangs low,
3. Draw your veils of dream apart,
4. Under the casement stands Pierrot
5. Making a song to ease his heart.
6. (Yet do not break the song too soon--
7. I love to sing in the paling moon.)

8. The petals are falling, heavy with dew,
9. The stars have fainted out of the sky,
10. Come to me, come, or else I too,
11. Faint with the weight of love will die.
12. (She comes--alas, I hoped to make
13. Another stanza for her sake!)
