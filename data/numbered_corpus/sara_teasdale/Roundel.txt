1. If he could know my songs are all for him,
2. At silver dawn or in the evening glow,
3. Would he not smile and think it but a whim,
4. If he could know?

5. Or would his heart rejoice and overflow,
6. As happy brooks that break their icy rim
7. When April's horns along the hillsides blow?

8. I may not speak till Eros' torch is dim,
9. The god is bitter and will have it so;
10. And yet to-night our fate would seem less grim
11. If he could know.
