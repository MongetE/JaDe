1. I said, "My youth is gone
2. Like a fire beaten out by the rain,
3. That will never sway and sing
4. Or play with the wind again."

5. I said, "It is no great sorrow
6. That quenched my youth in me,
7. But only little sorrows
8. Beating ceaselessly."

9. I thought my youth was gone,
10. But you returned --
11. Like a flame at the call of the wind
12. It leaped and burned;

13. Threw off its ashen cloak,
14. And gowned anew
15. Gave itself like a bride
16. Once more to you.
