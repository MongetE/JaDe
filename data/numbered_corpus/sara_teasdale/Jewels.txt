1. If I should see your eyes again,
2. I know how far their look would go --
3. Back to a morning in the park
4. With sapphire shadows on the snow.

5. Or back to oak trees in the spring
6. When you unloosed my hair and kissed
7. The head that lay against your knees
8. In the leaf shadow's amethyst.

9. And still another shining place
10. We would remember -- how the dun
11. Wild mountain held us on its crest
12. One diamond morning white with sun.

13. But I will turn my eyes from you
14. As women turn to put away
15. The jewels they have worn at night
16. And cannot wear in sober day.
