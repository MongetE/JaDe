1. OH to be free of myself,
2. With nothing left to remember,
3. To have my heart as bare
4. As a tree in December;
5. Resting, as a tree rests
6. After its leaves are gone,
7. Waiting no more for a rain at night
8. Nor for the red at dawn;
9. But still, oh so still
10. While the winds come and go,
11. With no more fear of the hard frost
12. Or the bright burden of snow;
13. Page
14. And heedless, heedless
15. If anyone pass and see
16. On the white page of the sky
17. Its thin black tracery.
