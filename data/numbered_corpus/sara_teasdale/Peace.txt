1. Peace flows into me
2. As the tide to the pool by the shore;
3. It is mine forevermore,
4. It ebbs not back like the sea.

5. I am the pool of blue
6. That worships the vivid sky;
7. My hopes were heaven-high,
8. They are all fulfilled in you.

9. I am the pool of gold
10. When sunset burns and dies--
11. You are my deepening skies,
12. Give me your stars to hold.
