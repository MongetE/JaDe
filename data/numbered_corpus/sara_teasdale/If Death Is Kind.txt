1. Perhaps if Death is kind, and there can be returning,
2. We will come back to earth some fragrant night,
3. And take these lanes to find the sea, and bending
4. Breathe the same honeysuckle, low and white.

5. We will come down at night to these resounding beaches
6. And the long gentle thunder of the sea,
7. Here for a single hour in the wide starlight
8. We shall be happy, for the dead are free.
