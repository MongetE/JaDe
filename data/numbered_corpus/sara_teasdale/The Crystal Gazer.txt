1. I shall gather myself into myself again,
2. I shall take my scattered selves and make them one,
3. Fusing them into a polished crystal ball
4. Where I can see the moon and the flashing sun.

5. I shall sit like a sibyl, hour after hour intent,
6. Watching the future come and the present go,
7. And the little shifting pictures of people rushing
8. In restless self-importance to and fro.
