1. As kings, seeing their lives about to pass,
2. Take off the heavy ermine and the crown,
3. So had the trees that autumn-time laid down
4. Their golden garments on the dying grass,
5. When I, who watched the seasons in the glass
6. Of my own thoughts, saw all the autumn's brown
7. Leap into life and wear a sunny gown
8. Of leafage fresh as happy April has.
9. Great spring came singing upward from the south;
10. For in my heart, far carried on the wind,
11. Your words like winged seeds took root and grew,
12. And all the world caught music from your mouth;
13. I saw the light as one who had been blind,
14. And knew my sun and song and spring were you.
