1. Oh you are coming, coming, coming,
2. How will hungry Time put by the hours till then? --
3. But why does it anger my heart to long so
4. For one man out of the world of men?

5. Oh I would live in myself only
6. And build my life lightly and still as a dream --
7. Are not my thoughts clearer than your thoughts
8. And colored like stones in a running stream?

9. Now the slow moon brightens in heaven,
10. The stars are ready, the night is here --
11. Oh why must I lose myself to love you,
12. My dear?
