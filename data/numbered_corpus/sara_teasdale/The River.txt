1. I came from the sunny valleys
2. And sought for the open sea,
3. For I thought in its gray expanses
4. My peace would come to me.

5. I came at last to the ocean
6. And found it wild and black,
7. And I cried to the windless valleys,
8. "Be kind and take me back!"

9. But the thirsty tide ran inland,
10. And the salt waves drank of me,
11. And I who was fresh as the rainfall
12. Am bitter as the sea.
