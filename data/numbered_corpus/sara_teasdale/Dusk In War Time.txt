1. A half-hour more and you will lean
2. To gather me close in the old sweet way--
3. But oh, to the woman over the sea
4. Who will come at the close of day?

5. A half-hour more and I will hear
6. The key in the latch and the strong quick tread--
7. But oh, the woman over the sea
8. Waiting at dusk for one who is dead!
