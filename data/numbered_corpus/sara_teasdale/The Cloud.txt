1. I am a cloud in the heaven's height,
2. The stars are lit for my delight,
3. Tireless and changeful, swift and free,
4. I cast my shadow on hill and sea--
5. But why do the pines on the mountain's crest
6. Call to me always, "Rest, rest"?

7. I throw my mantle over the moon
8. And I blind the sun on his throne at noon,
9. Nothing can tame me, nothing can bind,
10. I am a child of the heartless wind--
11. But oh the pines on the mountain's crest
12. Whispering always, "Rest, rest."
