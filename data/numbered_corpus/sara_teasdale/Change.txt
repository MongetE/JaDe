1. REMEMBER me as I was then;
2. Turn from me now, but always see
3. The laughing shadowy girl who stood
4. At midnight by the flowering tree,
5. With eyes that love had made as bright
6. As the trembling stars of the summer night.
7. Turn from me now, but always hear
8. The muted laughter in the dew
9. Of that one year of youth we had,
10. The only youth we ever knewâ€”
11. Turn from me now, or you will see
12. What other years have done to me.
