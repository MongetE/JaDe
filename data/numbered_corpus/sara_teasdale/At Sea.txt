1. IN the pull of the wind I stand, lonely,
2. On the deck of a ship, rising, falling,
3. Wild night around me, wild water under me,
4. Whipped by the storm, screaming and calling.
5. Earth is hostile and the sea hostile,
6. Why do I look for a place to rest?
7. I must fight always and die fighting
8. With fear an unhealing wound in my breast.
