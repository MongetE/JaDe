1. The princess has her lovers,
2. A score of knights has she,
3. And each can sing a madrigal,
4. And praise her gracefully.

5. But Love that is so bitter
6. Hath put within her heart
7. A longing for the scornful knight
8. Who silent stands apart.

9. And tho' the others praise and plead,
10. She maketh no reply,
11. Yet for a single word from him,
12. I ween that she would die.
