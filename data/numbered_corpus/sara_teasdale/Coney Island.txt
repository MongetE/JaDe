1. Why did you bring me here?
2. The sand is white with snow,
3. Over the wooden domes
4. The winter sea-winds blow--
5. There is no shelter near,
6. Come, let us go.
7. With foam of icy lace
8. The sea creeps up the sand,
9. The wind is like a hand
10. That strikes us in the face.
11. Doors that June set a-swing
12. Are bolted long ago;
13. We try them uselessly--
14. Alas there cannot be
15. For us a second spring;
16. Come, let us go.
