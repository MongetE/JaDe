1. Fairy snow, fairy snow,
2. Blowing, blowing everywhere,
3. Would that I
4. Too, could fly
5. Lightly, lightly through the air.

6. Like a wee, crystal star
7. I should drift, I should blow
8. Near, more near,
9. To my dear
10. Where he comes through the snow.

11. I should fly to my love
12. Like a flake in the storm,
13. I should die,
14. I should die,
15. On his lips that are warm.
