1. DAY, you have bruised and beaten me,
2. As rain beats down the bright, proud sea,
3. Beaten my body, bruised my soul,
4. Left me nothing lovely or whole—
5. Yet I have wrested a gift from you,
6. Day that dies in dusky blue:
7. For suddenly over the factories
8. I saw a moon in the cloudy seas—
9. A wisp of beauty all alone
10. In a world as hard and gray as stone—
11. Oh who could be bitter and want to die
12. When a maiden moon wakes up in the sky?
