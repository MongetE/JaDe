1. I am not yours, not lost in you,
2. Not lost, although I long to be
3. Lost as a candle lit at noon,
4. Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

5. You love me, and I find you still
6. A spirit beautiful and bright,
7. Yet I am I, who long to be
8. Lost as a light is lost in light.

9. Oh plunge me deep in love--put out
10. My senses, leave me deaf and blind,
11. Swept by the tempest of your love,
12. A taper in a rushing wind.
