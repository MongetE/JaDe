1. DEATH went up the hall
2. Unseen by every one,
3. Trailing twilight robes
4. Past the nurse and the nun.
5. He paused at every door
6. And listened to the breath
7. Of those who did not know
8. How near they were to Death.
9. Death went up the hall
10. Unseen by nurse and nun;
11. He passed by many a doorâ€”
12. But he entered one.
