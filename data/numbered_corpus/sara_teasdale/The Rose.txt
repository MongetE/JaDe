1. Beneath my chamber window
2. Pierrot was singing, singing;
3. I heard his lute the whole night thru
4. Until the east was red.
5. Alas, alas Pierrot,
6. I had no rose for flinging
7. Save one that drank my tears for dew
8. Before its leaves were dead.

9. I found it in the darkness,
10. I kissed it once and threw it,
11. The petals scattered over him,
12. His song was turned to joy;
13. And he will never know--
14. Alas, the one who knew it!
15. The rose was plucked when dusk was dim
16. Beside a laughing boy.
