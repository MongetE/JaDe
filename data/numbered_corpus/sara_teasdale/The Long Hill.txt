1. I must have passed the crest a while ago
2. And now I am going down--
3. Strange to have crossed the crest and not to know,
4. But the brambles were always grabbing at the hem of my gown.

5. All the morning I thought how proud I should be
6. To stand there straight as a queen,
7. Wrapped in the wind and the sun with the world under me--
8. But the air was dull, there was little I could have seen.

9. It was nearly level along the beaten track
10. And the brambles caught in my gown--
11. But it's no use now to think of turning back,
12. The rest of the way will be only going down.
