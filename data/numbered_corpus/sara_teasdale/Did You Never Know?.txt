1. Did you never know, long ago, how much you loved me—
2. That your love would never lessen and never go?
3. You were young then, proud and fresh-hearted,
4. You were too young to know.

5. Fate is a wind, and red leaves fly before it
6. Far apart, far away in the gusty time of year—
7. Seldom we meet now, but when I hear you speaking,
8. I know your secret, my dear, my dear.
