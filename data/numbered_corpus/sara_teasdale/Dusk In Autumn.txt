1. The moon is like a scimitar,
2. A little silver scimitar,
3. A-drifting down the sky.
4. And near beside it is a star,
5. A timid twinkling golden star,
6. That watches like an eye.
7. And thro' the nursery window-pane
8. The witches have a fire again,
9. Just like the ones we make, â€”
10. And now I know they're having tea,
11. I wish they'd give a cup to me,
12. With witches' currant cake.
