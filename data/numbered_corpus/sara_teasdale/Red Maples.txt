1. IN the last year I have learned
2. How few men are worth my trust;
3. I have seen the friend I loved
4. Struck by death into the dust,
5. And fears I never knew before
6. Have knocked and knocked upon my door—
7. 'I shall hope little and ask for less,'
8. I said, 'There is no happiness.'
9. I have grown wise at last—but how
10. Can I hide the gleam on the willow-bough,
11. Or keep the fragrance out of the rain
12. Now that April is here again?
13. When maples stand in a haze of fire
14. What can I say to the old desire,
15. What shall I do with the joy in me
16. That is born out of agony?
