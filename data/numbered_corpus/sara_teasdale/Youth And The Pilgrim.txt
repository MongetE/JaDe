1. Gray pilgrim, you have journeyed far,
2. I pray you tell to me
3. Is there a land where Love is not,
4. By shore of any sea?

5. For I am weary of the god,
6. And I would flee from him
7. Tho' I must take a ship and go
8. Beyond the ocean's rim.

9. "I know a port where Love is not,
10. The ship is in your hand,
11. Then plunge your sword within your breast
12. And you will reach the land."
