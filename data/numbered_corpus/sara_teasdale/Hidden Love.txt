1. I hid the love within my heart,
2. And lit the laughter in my eyes,
3. That when we meet he may not know
4. My love that never dies.

5. But sometimes when he dreams at night
6. Of fragrant forests green and dim,
7. It may be that my love crept out
8. And brought the dream to him.

9. And sometimes when his heart is sick
10. And suddenly grows well again,
11. It may be that my love was there
12. To free his life of pain.
