1. One by one, like leaves from a tree
2. All my faiths have forsaken me;
3. But the stars above my head
4. Burn in white and delicate red,
5. And beneath my feet the earth
6. Brings the sturdy grass to birth.
7. I who was content to be
8. But a silken-singing tree,
9. But a rustle of delight
10. In the wistful heart of night--
11. I have lost the leaves that knew
12. Touch of rain and weight of dew.
13. Blinded by a leafy crown
14. I looked neither up nor down--
15. But the little leaves that die
16. Have left me room to see the sky;
17. Now for the first time I know
18. Stars above and earth below.
