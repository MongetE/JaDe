1. Oh day of fire and sun,
2. Pure as a naked flame,
3. Blue sea, blue sky and dun
4. Sands where he spoke my name;

5. Laughter and hearts so high
6. That the spirit flew off free,
7. Lifting into the sky
8. Diving into the sea;

9. Oh day of fire and sun
10. Like a crystal burning,
11. Slow days go one by one,
12. But you have no returning.
