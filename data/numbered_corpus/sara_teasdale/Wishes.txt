1. I wish for such a lot of things
2. That never will come true —
3. And yet I want them all so much
4. I think they might, don't you?
5. I want a little kitty-cat
6. That's soft and tame and sweet,
7. And every day I watch and hope
8. I'll find one in the street.
9. But nursie says, 'Come, walk along,
10. 'Don't stand and stare like that' —
11. I'm only looking hard and hard
12. To try to find my cat.
13. And then I want a blue balloon
14. That tries to fly away,
15. I thought if I wished hard enough
16. That it would come some day.
17. One time when I was in the park
18. I knew that it would be
19. Beside the big old clock at home
20. A-waiting there for me —
21. And soon as we got home again,
22. I hurried thro' the hall,
23. And looked beside the big old clock —
24. It wasn't there at all.
25. I think I'll never wish again —
26. But then, what shall I do?
27. The wishes are a lot of fun
28. Altho' they don't come true.
