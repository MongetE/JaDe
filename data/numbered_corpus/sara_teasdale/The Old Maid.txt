1. I saw her in a Broadway car,
2. The woman I might grow to be;
3. I felt my lover look at her
4. And then turn suddenly to me.

5. Her hair was dull and drew no light
6. And yet its color was as mine;
7. Her eyes were strangely like my eyes
8. Tho' love had never made them shine.

9. Her body was a thing grown thin,
10. Hungry for love that never came;
11. Her soul was frozen in the dark
12. Unwarmed forever by love's flame.

13. I felt my lover look at her
14. And then turn suddenly to me,--
15. His eyes were magic to defy
16. The woman I shall never be.
