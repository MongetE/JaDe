1. (In Memory of J. W. T. Jr.)
2. HE was a soldier in that fight
3. Where there is neither flag nor drum,
4. And without sound of musketry
5. The stealthy foemen come.
6. Year in, year out, by day and night
7. They forced him to a slow retreat,
8. And for his gallant fight alone
9. No fife was blown, and no drum beat.
10. In winter fog, in gathering mist
11. The gray grim battle had its endâ€”
12. And at the very last we knew
13. His enemy had turned his friend.
