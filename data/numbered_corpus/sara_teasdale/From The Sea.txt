1. All beauty calls you to me, and you seem,
2. Past twice a thousand miles of shifting sea,
3. To reach me. You are as the wind I breathe
4. Here on the ship's sun-smitten topmost deck,
5. With only light between the heavens and me.
6. I feel your spirit and I close my eyes,
7. Knowing the bright hair blowing in the sun,
8. The eager whisper and the searching eyes.
9. Listen, I love you. Do not turn your face
10. Nor touch me. Only stand and watch awhile
11. The blue unbroken circle of the sea.
12. Look far away and let me ease my heart
13. Of words that beat in it with broken wing.
14. Look far away, and if I say too much,
15. Forget that I am speaking. Only watch,
16. How like a gull that sparkling sinks to rest,
17. The foam-crest drifts along a happy wave
18. Toward the bright verge, the boundary of the world.

19. I am so weak a thing, praise me for this,
20. That in some strange way I was strong enough
21. To keep my love unuttered and to stand
22. Altho' I longed to kneel to you that night
23. You looked at me with ever-calling eyes.
24. Was I not calm? And if you guessed my love
25. You thought it something delicate and free,
26. Soft as the sound of fir-trees in the wind,
27. Fleeting as phosphorescent stars in foam.
28. Yet in my heart there was a beating storm
29. Bending my thoughts before it, and I strove
30. To say too little lest I say too much,
31. And from my eyes to drive love's happy shame.
32. Yet when I heard your name the first far time
33. It seemed like other names to me, and I
34. Was all unconscious, as a dreaming river
35. That nears at last its long predestined sea;
36. And when you spoke to me, I did not know
37. That to my life's high altar came its priest.
38. But now I know between my God and me
39. You stand forever, nearer God than I,
40. And in your hands with faith and utter joy
41. I would that I could lay my woman's soul.

42. Oh, my love
43. To whom I cannot come with any gift
44. Of body or of soul, I pass and go.
45. But sometimes when you hear blown back to you
46. My wistful, far-off singing touched with tears,
47. Know that I sang for you alone to hear,
48. And that I wondered if the wind would bring
49. To him who tuned my heart its distant song.
50. So might a woman who in loneliness
51. Had borne a child, dreaming of days to come,
52. Wonder if it would please its father's eyes.
53. But long before I ever heard your name,
54. Always the undertone's unchanging note
55. In all my singing had prefigured you,
56. Foretold you as a spark foretells a flame.
57. Yet I was free as an untethered cloud
58. In the great space between the sky and sea,
59. And might have blown before the wind of joy
60. Like a bright banner woven by the sun.
61. I did not know the longing in the night--
62. You who have waked me cannot give me sleep.
63. All things in all the world can rest, but I,
64. Even the smooth brief respite of a wave
65. When it gives up its broken crown of foam,
66. Even that little rest I may not have.
67. And yet all quiet loves of friends, all joy
68. In all the piercing beauty of the world
69. I would give up--go blind forevermore,
70. Rather than have God blot from out my soul
71. Remembrance of your voice that said my name.

72. For us no starlight stilled the April fields,
73. No birds awoke in darkling trees for us,
74. Yet where we walked the city's street that night
75. Felt in our feet the singing fire of spring,
76. And in our path we left a trail of light
77. Soft as the phosphorescence of the sea
78. When night submerges in the vessel's wake
79. A heaven of unborn evanescent stars.
