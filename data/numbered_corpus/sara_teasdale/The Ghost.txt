1. I went back to the clanging city,
2. I went back where my old loves stayed,
3. But my heart was full of my new love's glory,
4. My eyes were laughing and unafraid.

5. I met one who had loved me madly
6. And told his love for all to hear --
7. But we talked of a thousand things together,
8. The past was buried too deep to fear.

9. I met the other, whose love was given
10. With never a kiss and scarcely a word --
11. Oh, it was then the terror took me
12. Of words unuttered that breathed and stirred.

13. Oh, love that lives its life with laughter
14. Or love that lives its life with tears
15. Can die -- but love that is never spoken
16. Goes like a ghost through the winding years. . . .

17. I went back to the clanging city,
18. I went back where my old loves stayed,
19. My heart was full of my new love's glory, --
20. But my eyes were suddenly afraid.
