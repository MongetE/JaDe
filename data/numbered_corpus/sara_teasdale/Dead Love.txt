1. God let me listen to your voice,
2. And look upon you for a space â€”
3. And then he took your voice away,
4. And dropped a veil before your face.
5. God let me look within your eyes,
6. And touch for once your clinging hand,
7. And then he left me all alone,
8. And took you to the Silent Land.
9. I cannot weep, I cannot pray,
10. My heart has very silent grown,
11. I only watch how God gives love,
12. And then leaves lovers all alone.
