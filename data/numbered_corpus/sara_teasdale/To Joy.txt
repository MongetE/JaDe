1. Lo, I am happy, for my eyes have seen
2. Joy glowing here before me, face to face;
3. His wings were arched above me for a space,
4. I kissed his lips, no bitter came between.
5. The air is vibrant where his feet have been,
6. And full of song and color is his place.
7. His wondrous presence sheds about a grace
8. That lifts and hallows all that once was mean.
9. I may not sorrow for I saw the light,
10. Tho' I shall walk in valley ways for long,
11. I still shall hear the echo of the song,â€”
12. My life is measured by its one great height.
13. Joy holds more grace than pain can ever give,
14. And by my glimpse of joy my soul shall live.
