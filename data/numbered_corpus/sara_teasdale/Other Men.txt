1. When I talk with other men
2. I always think of you --
3. Your words are keener than their words,
4. And they are gentler, too.

5. When I look at other men,
6. I wish your face were there,
7. With its gray eyes and dark skin
8. And tossed black hair.

9. When I think of other men,
10. Dreaming alone by day,
11. The thought of you like a strong wind
12. Blows the dreams away.
