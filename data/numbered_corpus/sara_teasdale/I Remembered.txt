1. There never was a mood of mine,
2. Gay or heart-broken, luminous or dull,
3. But you could ease me of its fever
4. And give it back to me more beutiful.
5. In many another soul I broke the bread,
6. And drank the wine and played the happy guest,
7. But I was lonely, I remembered you;
8. The heart belong to him who knew it best.
