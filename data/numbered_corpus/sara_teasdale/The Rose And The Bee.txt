1. IF I were a bee and you were a rose,
2. Would you let me in when the gray wind blows?
3. Would you hold your petals wide apart,
4. Would you let me in to find your heart,
5. If you were a rose?

6. "If I were a rose and you were a bee,
7. You should never go when you came to me,
8. I should hold my love on my heart at last,
9. I should close my leaves and keep you fast,
10. If you were a bee."
