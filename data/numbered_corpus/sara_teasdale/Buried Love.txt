1. I shall bury my weary Love
2. Beneath a tree,
3. In the forest tall and black
4. Where none can see.

5. I shall put no flowers at his head,
6. Nor stone at his feet,
7. For the mouth I loved so much
8. Was bittersweet.

9. I shall go no more to his grave,
10. For the woods are cold.
11. I shall gather as much of joy
12. As my hands can hold.

13. I shall stay all day in the sun
14. Where the wide winds blow,
15. But oh, I shall weep at night
16. When none will know.
