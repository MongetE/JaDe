1. A FOG drifts in, the heavy laden
2. Cold white ghost of the seaâ€”
3. One by one the hills go out,
4. The road and the pepper-tree.
5. I watch the fog float in at the window
6. With the whole world gone blind,
7. Everything, even my longing, drowses,
8. Even the thoughts in my mind.
9. I put my head on my hands before me,
10. There is nothing left to be done or said,
11. There is nothing to hope for, I am tired,
12. And heavy as the dead.
