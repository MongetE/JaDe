1. Only in sleep I see their faces,
2. Children I played with when I was a child,
3. Louise comes back with her brown hair braided,
4. Annie with ringlets warm and wild.

5. Only in sleep Time is forgotten --
6. What may have come to them, who can know?
7. Yet we played last night as long ago,
8. And the doll-house stood at the turn of the stair.

9. The years had not sharpened their smooth round faces,
10. I met their eyes and found them mild --
11. Do they, too, dream of me, I wonder,
12. And for them am I too a child?
