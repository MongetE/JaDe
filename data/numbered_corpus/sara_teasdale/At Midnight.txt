1. Now at last I have come to see what life is,
2. Nothing is ever ended, everything only begun,
3. And the brave victories that seem so splendid
4. Are never really won.

5. Even love that I built my spirit's house for,
6. Comes like a brooding and a baffled guest,
7. And music and men's praise and even laughter
8. Are not so good as rest.
