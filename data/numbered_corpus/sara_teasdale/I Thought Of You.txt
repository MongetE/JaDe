1. I thought of you and how you love this beauty,
2. And walking up the long beach all alone
3. I heard the waves breaking in measured thunder
4. As you and I once heard their monotone.

5. Around me were the echoing dunes, beyond me
6. The cold and sparkling silver of the sea --
7. We two will pass through death and ages lengthen
8. Before you hear that sound again with me.
