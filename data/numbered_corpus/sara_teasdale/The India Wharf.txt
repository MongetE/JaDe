1. Here in the velvet stillness
2. The wide sown fields fall to the faint horizon,
3. Sleeping in starlight. . . .

4. A year ago we walked in the jangling city
5. Together . . . . forgetful.
6. One by one we crossed the avenues,
7. Rivers of light, roaring in tumult,
8. And came to the narrow, knotted streets.
9. Thru the tense crowd
10. We went aloof, ecstatic, walking in wonder,
11. Unconscious of our motion.
12. Forever the foreign people with dark, deep-seeing eyes
13. Passed us and passed.
14. Lights and foreign words and foreign faces,
15. I forgot them all;
16. I only felt alive, defiant of all death and sorrow,
17. Sure and elated.

18. That was the gift you gave me. . . .

19. The streets grew still more tangled,
20. And led at last to water black and glossy,
21. Flecked here and there with lights, faint and far off.
22. There on a shabby building was a sign
23. "The India Wharf " . . . and we turned back.

24. I always felt we could have taken ship
25. And crossed the bright green seas
26. To dreaming cities set on sacred streams
27. And palaces
28. Of ivory and scarlet.
