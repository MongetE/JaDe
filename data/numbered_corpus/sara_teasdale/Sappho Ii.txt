1. Oh Litis, little slave, why will you sleep?
2. These long Egyptian noons bend down your head
3. Bowed like the yarrow with a yellow bee.
4. There, lift your eyes no man has ever kindled,
5. Dark eyes that wait like faggots for the fire.
6. See how the temple's solid square of shade
7. Points north to Lesbos, and the splendid sea
8. That you have never seen, oh evening-eyed.
9. Yet have you never wondered what the Nile
10. Is seeking always, restless and wild with spring
11. And no less in the winter, seeking still?
12. How shall I tell you? Can you think of fields
13. Greater than Gods could till, more blue than night
14. Sown over with the stars; and delicate
15. With filmy nets of foam that come and go?
16. It is more cruel and more compassionate
17. Than harried earth. It takes with unconcern
18. And quick forgetting, rapture of the rain
19. And agony of thunder, the moon's white
20. Soft-garmented virginity, and then
21. The insatiable ardor of the sun.
22. And me it took. But there is one more strong,
23. Love, that came laughing from the eider seas,
24. The Cyprian, the mother of the world;
25. She gave me love who only asked for death —
26. I who had seen much sorrow in men's eyes
27. And in my own too sorrowful a fire.
28. I was a sister of the stars, and yet
29. Shaken with pain; sister of birds and yet
30. The wings that bore my soul were very tired.
31. I watched the careless spring too many times
32. Light her green torches in a hungry wind;
33. Too many times I watched them flare, and then
34. Fall to forsaken embers in the autumn.
35. And I was sick of all things — even song.
36. In the dull autumn dawn I turned to death,
37. Buried my living body in the sea,
38. The strong cold sea that takes and does not give —
39. But there is one more strong, the Cyprian.
40. Litis, to wake from sleep and find your eyes
41. Met in their first fresh upward gaze by love,
42. Filled with love's happy shame from other eyes,
43. Dazzled with tenderness and drowned in light
44. As tho' you looked unthinking at the sun,
45. Oh Litis, that is joy! But if you came
46. Not from the sunny shallow pool of sleep,
47. But from the sea of death, the strangling sea
48. Of night and nothingness, and waked to find
49. Love looking down upon you, glad and still,
50. Strange and yet known forever, that is peace.
51. So did he lean above me. Not a word
52. He spoke; I only heard the morning sea
53. Singing against his happy ship, the keen
54. And straining joy of wind-awakened sails
55. And songs of mariners, and in myself
56. The precious pain of arms that held me fast.
57. They warmed the cold sea out of all my blood;
58. I slept, feeling his eyes above my sleep.
59. There on the ship with wines and olives laden,
60. Led by the stars to far invisible ports,
61. Egypt and islands of the inner seas,
62. Love came to me, and Cercolas was love.
