1. The summer dawn came over-soon,
2. The earth was like hot iron at noon
3. In Nazareth;
4. There fell no rain to ease the heat,
5. And dusk drew on with tired feet
6. And stifled breath.

7. The shop was low and hot and square,
8. And fresh-cut wood made sharp the air,
9. While all day long
10. The saw went tearing thru the oak
11. That moaned as tho' the tree's heart broke
12. Beneath its wrong.

13. The narrow street was full of cries,
14. Of bickering and snarling lies
15. In many keys--
16. The tongues of Egypt and of Rome
17. And lands beyond the shifting foam
18. Of windy seas.

19. Sometimes a ruler riding fast
20. Scattered the dark crowds as he passed,
21. And drove them close
22. In doorways, drawing broken breath
23. Lest they be trampled to their death
24. Where the dust rose.

25. There in the gathering night and noise
26. A group of Galilean boys
27. Crowding to see
28. Gray Joseph toiling with his son,
29. Saw Jesus, when the task was done,
30. Turn wearily.

31. He passed them by with hurried tread
32. Silently, nor raised his head,
33. He who looked up
34. Drinking all beauty from his birth
35. Out of the heaven and the earth
36. As from a cup.

37. And Mary, who was growing old,
38. Knew that the pottage would be cold
39. When he returned;
40. He hungered only for the night,
41. And westward, bending sharp and bright,
42. The thin moon burned.

43. He reached the open western gate
44. Where whining halt and leper wait,
45. And came at last
46. To the blue desert, where the deep
47. Great seas of twilight lay asleep,
48. Windless and vast.

49. With shining eyes the stars awoke,
50. The dew lay heavy on his cloak,
51. The world was dim;
52. And in the stillness he could hear
53. His secret thoughts draw very near
54. And call to him.

55. Faint voices lifted shrill with pain
56. And multitudinous as rain;
57. From all the lands
58. And all the villages thereof
59. Men crying for the gift of love
60. With outstretched hands.

61. Voices that called with ceaseless crying,
62. The broken and the blind, the dying,
63. And those grown dumb
64. Beneath oppression, and he heard
65. Upon their lips a single word,
66. "Come!"

67. Their cries engulfed him like the night,
68. The moon put out her placid light
69. And black and low
70. Nearer the heavy thunder drew,
71. Hushing the voices . . . yet he knew
72. That he would go.

73. A quick-spun thread of lightning burns,
74. And for a flash the day returns--
75. He only hears
76. Joseph, an old man bent and white
77. Toiling alone from morn till night
78. Thru all the years.

79. Swift clouds make all the heavens blind,
80. A storm is running on the wind--
81. He only sees
82. How Mary will stretch out her hands
83. Sobbing, who never understands
84. Voices like these.
