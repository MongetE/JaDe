1. To-night I close my eyes and see
2. A strange procession passing me--
3. The years before I saw your face
4. Go by me with a wistful grace;
5. They pass, the sensitive shy years,
6. As one who strives to dance, half blind with tears.

7. The years went by and never knew
8. That each one brought me nearer you;
9. Their path was narrow and apart
10. And yet it led me to your heart--
11. Oh sensitive shy years, oh lonely years,
12. That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears.
