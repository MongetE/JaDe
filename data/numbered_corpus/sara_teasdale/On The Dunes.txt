1. IF there is any life when death is over,
2. These tawny beaches will know much of me,
3. I shall come back, as constant and as changeful
4. As the unchanging, many-colored sea.
5. If life was small, if it has made me scornful,
6. Forgive me; I shall straighten like a flame
7. In the great calm of death, and if you want me
8. Stand on the sea-ward dunes and call my name.
