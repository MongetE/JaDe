1. THE sun was gone, and the moon was coming
2. Over the blue Connecticut hills;
3. The west was rosy, the east was flushed,
4. And over my head the swallows rushed
5. This way and that, with changeful wills.
6. I heard them twitter and watched them dart
7. Now together and now apart
8. Like dark petals blown from a tree;
9. The maples stamped against the west
10. Were black and stately and full of rest,
11. And the hazy orange moon grew up
12. And slowly changed to yellow gold
13. While the hills were darkened, fold on fold
14. To a deeper blue than a flower could hold.
15. Down the hill I went, and then
16. I forgot the ways of men,
17. For night-scents, heady, and damp and cool
18. Wakened ecstasy in me
19. On the brink of a shining pool.
20. O Beauty, out of many a cup
21. You have made me drunk and wild
22. Ever since I was a child,
23. But when have I been sure as now
24. That no bitterness can bend
25. And no sorrow wholly bow
26. One who loves you to the end?
27. And though I must give my breath
28. And my laughter all to death,
29. And my eyes through which joy came,
30. And my heart, a wavering flame;
31. If all must leave me and go back
32. Along a blind and fearful track
33. So that you can make anew,
34. Fusing with intenser fire,
35. Something nearer your desire;
36. If my soul must go alone
37. Through a cold infinity,
38. Or even if it vanish, too,
39. Beauty, I have worshipped you.
40. Let this single hour atone
41. For the theft of all of me.
