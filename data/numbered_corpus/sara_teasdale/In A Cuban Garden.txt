1. HIBISCUS flowers are cups of fire,
2. (Love me, my lover, life will not stay)
3. The bright poinsettia shakes in the wind,
4. A scarlet leaf is blowing away.
5. A lizard lifts his head and listensâ€”
6. Kiss me before the noon goes by,
7. Here in the shade of the ceiba hide me
8. From the great black vulture circling the sky.
