1. Your eyes drink of me,
2. Love makes them shine,
3. Your eyes that lean
4. So close to mine.

5. We have long been lovers,
6. We know the range
7. Of each other's moods
8. And how they change;

9. But when we look
10. At each other so
11. Then we feel
12. How little we know;

13. The spirit eludes us,
14. Timid and freeâ€”
15. Can I ever know you
16. Or you know me?
