1. Inside the tiny Pantheon
2. We stood together silently,
3. Leaving the restless crowsd awhile,
4. As ships find shelter from the sea.

5. The ancient centuries came back
6. To cover us a moment's space,
7. And through the dome the light was glad
8. Because it shone upon your face.

9. Ah, not from Rome but farther still
10. Beyond sun-smitten Salamis,
11. The moment took us, till you learned
12. To find the present with a kiss.
