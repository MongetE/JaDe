1. Heaven-invading hills are drowned
2. In wide moving waves of mist,
3. Phlox before my door are wound
4. In dripping wreaths of amethyst.

5. Ten feet away the solid earth
6. Changes into melting cloud,
7. There is a hush of pain and mirth,
8. No bird has heart to speak aloud.

9. Here in a world without a sky,
10. Without the ground, without the sea,
11. The one unchanging thing is I,
12. Myself remains to comfort me.
