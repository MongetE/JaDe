1. (The daughter of Sappho)

2. When the dusk was wet with dew,
3. Cle√Øs, did the muses nine
4. Listen in a silent line
5. While your mother sang to you?

6. Did they weep or did they smile
7. When she crooned to still your cries,
8. She, a muse in human guise
9. Who forsook her lyre awhile

10. Did you hear her wild heart beat?
11. Did the warmth of all the sun
12. Through your little body run
13. When she kissed your hands and feet?

14. Did your fingers, babywise,
15. Touch her face and touch her hair
16. Did you think your mother fair,
17. Could you bear her burning eyes?

18. Are the songs that soothed your fears
19. Vanished like a vanished flame,
20. Save the line where shines your name
21. Starlike down the graying years? . . .

22. Cleis speaks no word to me,
23. For the land where she has gone
24. Lies as still at dusk and dawn,
25. As a windless, tideless sea.
