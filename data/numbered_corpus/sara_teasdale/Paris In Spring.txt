1. The city's all a-shining
2. Beneath a fickle sun,
3. A gay young wind's a-blowing,
4. The little shower is done.
5. But the rain-drops still are clinging
6. And falling one by one --
7. Oh it's Paris, it's Paris,
8. And spring-time has begun.

9. I know the Bois is twinkling
10. In a sort of hazy sheen,
11. And down the Champs the gray old arch
12. Stands cold and still between.
13. But the walk is flecked with sunlight
14. Where the great acacias lean,
15. Oh it's Paris, it's Paris,
16. And the leaves are growing green.

17. The sun's gone in, the sparkle's dead,
18. There falls a dash of rain,
19. But who would care when such an air
20. Comes blowing up the Seine?
21. And still Ninette sits sewing
22. Beside her window-pane,
23. When it's Paris, it's Paris,
24. And spring-time's come again.
