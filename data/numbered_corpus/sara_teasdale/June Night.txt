1. OH Earth, you are too dear to-night,
2. How can I sleep while all around
3. Floats rainy fragrance and the far
4. Deep voice of the ocean that talks to the ground?
5. Oh Earth, you gave me all I have,
6. I love you, I love you,—oh what have I
7. That I can give you in return—
8. Except my body after I die?
