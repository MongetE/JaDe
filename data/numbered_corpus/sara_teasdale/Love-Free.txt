1. I am free of love as a bird flying south in the autumn,
2. Swift and intent, asking no joy from another,
3. Glad to forget all of the passion of April
4. Ere it was love-free.

5. I am free of love, and I listen to music lightly,
6. But if he returned, if he should look at me deeply,
7. I should awake, I should awake and remember
8. I am my lover's.
