1. With the man I love who loves me not,
2. I walked in the street-lamps' flare;
3. We watched the world go home that night
4. In a flood through Union Square.

5. I leaned to catch the words he said
6. That were light as a snowflake falling;
7. Ah well that he never leaned to hear
8. The words my heart was calling.

9. And on we walked and on we walked
10. Past the fiery lights of the picture shows --
11. Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by
12. On the errand each man knows.

13. And on we walked and on we walked,
14. At the door at last we said good-bye;
15. I knew by his smile he had not heard
16. My heart's unuttered cry.

17. With the man I love who loves me not
18. I walked in the street-lamps' flare --
19. But oh, the girls who can ask for love
20. In the lights of Union Square.
