1. I feel the Spring far off, far off,
2. The faint far scent of bud and leaf--
3. Oh how can Spring take heart to come
4. To a world in grief,
5. Deep grief?

6. The sun turns north, the days grow long,
7. Later the evening star grows bright--
8. How can the daylight linger on
9. For men to fight,
10. Still fight?

11. The grass is waking in the ground,
12. Soon it will rise and blow in waves--
13. How can it have the heart to sway
14. Over the graves,
15. New graves?

16. Under the boughs where lovers walked
17. The apple-blooms will shed their breath--
18. But what of all the lovers now
19. Parted by death,
20. Gray Death?
