1. I thought I had forgotten,
2. But it all came back again
3. To-night with the first spring thunder
4. In a rush of rain.
5. I remembered a darkened doorway
6. Where we stood while the storm swept by,
7. Thunder gripping the earth
8. And lightning scrawled on the sky.

9. The passing motor busses swayed,
10. For the street was a river of rain,
11. Lashed into little golden waves
12. In the lamp light's stain.

13. With the wild spring rain and thunder
14. My heart was wild and gay;
15. Your eyes said more to me that night
16. Than your lips would ever say. . . .

17. I thought I had forgotten,
18. But it all came back again
19. To-night with the first spring thunder
20. In a rush of rain.
