1. The wide, bright temple of the world I found,
2. And entered from the dizzy infinite
3. That I might kneel and worship thee in it;
4. Leaving the singing stars their ceaseless round
5. Of silver music sound on orbed sound,
6. For measured spaces where the shrines are lit,
7. And men with wisdom or with little wit
8. Implore the gods that mercy may abound.
9. Ah, Aphrodite, was it not from thee
10. My summons came across the endless spaces?
11. Mother of Love, turn not thy face from me
12. Now that I seek for thee in human faces;
13. Answer my prayer or set my spirit free
14. Again to drift along the starry places.
