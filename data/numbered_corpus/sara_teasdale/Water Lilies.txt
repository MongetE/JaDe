1. If you have forgotten water lilies floating
2. On a dark lake among mountains in the afternoon shade,
3. If you have forgotten their wet, sleepy fragrance,
4. Then you can return and not be afraid.

5. But if you remember, then turn away forever
6. To the plains and the prairies where pools are far apart,
7. There you will not come at dusk on closing water lilies,
8. And the shadow of mountains will not fall on your heart.
