1. Two knights rode forth at early dawn
2. A-seeking maids to wed,
3. Said one, "My lady must be fair,
4. With gold hair on her head."

5. Then spake the other knight-at-arms:
6. "I care not for her face,
7. But she I love must be a dove
8. For purity and grace."

9. And each knight blew upon his horn
10. And went his separate way,
11. And each knight found a lady-love
12. Before the fall of day.

13. But she was brown who should have had
14. The shining yellow hair --
15. I ween the knights forgot their words
16. Or else they ceased to care.

17. For he who wanted purity
18. Brought home a wanton wild,
19. And when each saw the other knight
20. I ween that each knight smiled.
