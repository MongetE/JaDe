1. Child, child, love while you can
2. The voice and the eyes and the soul of a man,
3. Never fear though it break your heart -
4. Out of the wound new joy will start;
5. Only love proudly and gladly and well
6. Though love be heaven or love be hell.

7. Child, child, love while you may,
8. For life is short as a happy day;
9. Never fear the thing you feel -
10. Only by love is life made real;
11. Love, for the deadly sins are seven,
12. Only through love will you enter heaven.
