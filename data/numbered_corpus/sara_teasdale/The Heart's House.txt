1. My heart is but a little house
2. With room for only three or four,
3. And it was filled before you knocked
4. Upon the door.
5. I longed to bid you come within,
6. I knew that I should love you well,
7. But if you came the rest must go
8. Elsewhere to dwell.
9. For you would never be content
10. With just a corner in my room,
11. Yea, if you came the rest must go
12. Into the gloom.
13. And so, farewell, O friend, my friend!
14. Nay, I could weep a little too,
15. But I shall only smile and say
16. Farewell to you.
