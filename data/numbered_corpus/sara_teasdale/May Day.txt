1. The shining line of motors,
2. The swaying motor-bus,
3. The prancing dancing horses
4. Are passing by for us.

5. The sunlight on the steeple,
6. The toys we stop to see,
7. The smiling passing people
8. Are all for you and me.

9. "I love you and I love you!"--
10. "And oh, I love you, too!"--
11. "All of the flower girl's lilies
12. Were only grown for you!"

13. Fifth Avenue and April
14. And love and lack of care--
15. The world is mad with music
16. Too beautiful to bear.
