1. The lightning spun your garment for the night
2. Of silver filaments with fire shot thru,
3. A broidery of lamps that lit for you
4. The steadfast splendor of enduring light.
5. The moon drifts dimly in the heaven's height,
6. Watching with wonder how the earth she knew
7. That lay so long wrapped deep in dark and dew,
8. Should wear upon her breast a star so white.
9. The festivals of Babylon were dark
10. With flaring flambeaux that the wind blew down;
11. The Saturnalia were a wild boy's lark
12. With rain-quenched torches dripping thru the town--
13. But you have found a god and filched from him
14. A fire that neither wind nor rain can dim.
