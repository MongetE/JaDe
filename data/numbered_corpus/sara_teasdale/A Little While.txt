1. A little while when I am gone
2. My life will live in music after me,
3. As spun foam lifted and borne on
4. After the wave is lost in the full sea.

5. A while these nights and days will burn
6. In song with the bright frailty of foam,
7. Living in light before they turn
8. Back to the nothingness that is their home.
