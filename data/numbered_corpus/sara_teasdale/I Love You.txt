1. When April bends above me
2. And finds me fast asleep
3. Dust need not keep the secret
4. A live heart died to keep.

5. When April tells the thrushes,
6. The meadow-larks will know,
7. And pipe the three words lightly
8. To all the winds that blow.

9. Above his roof the swallows,
10. In notes like far-blown rain,
11. Will tell the little sparrow
12. Beside his window-pane.

13. O sparrow, little sparrow,
14. When I am fast asleep,
15. Then tell my love the secret
16. That I have died to keep.
