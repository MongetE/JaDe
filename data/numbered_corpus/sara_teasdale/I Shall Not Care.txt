1. When I am dead and over me bright April
2. Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,
3. Though you shall lean above me broken-hearted,
4. I shall not care.

5. I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful
6. When rain bends down the bough;
7. And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted
8. Than you are now.
