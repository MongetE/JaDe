1. IF I could keep my innermost Me
2. Fearless, aloof and free
3. Of the least breath of love or hate,
4. And not disconsolate
5. At the sick load of sorrow laid on men;
6. If I could keep a sanctuary there
7. Free even of prayer,
8. If I could do this, then,
9. With quiet candor as I grew more wise
10. I could look even at God with grave forgiving eyes.
