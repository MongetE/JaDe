1. I said, "I have shut my heart
2. As one shuts an open door,
3. That Love may starve therein
4. And trouble me no more."

5. But over the roofs there came
6. The wet new wind of May,
7. And a tune blew up from the curb
8. Where the street-pianos play.

9. My room was white with the sun
10. And Love cried out in me,
11. "I am strong, I will break your heart
12. Unless you set me free."
