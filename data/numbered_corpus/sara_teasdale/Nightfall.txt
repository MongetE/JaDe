1. WE will never walk again
2. As we used to walk at night,
3. Watching our shadows lengthen
4. Under the gold street-light
5. When the snow was new and white.
6. We will never walk again
7. Slowly, we two,
8. In spring when the park is sweet
9. With midnight and with dew,
10. And the passers-by are few.
11. I sit and think of it all,
12. And the blue June twilight dies,â€”
13. Down in the clanging square
14. A street-piano cries
15. And stars come out in the skies.
