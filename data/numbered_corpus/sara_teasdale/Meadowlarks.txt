1. IN the silver light after a storm,
2. Under dripping boughs of bright new green,
3. I take the low path to hear the meadowlarks
4. Alone and high-hearted as if I were a queen.
5. What have I to fear in life or death
6. Who have known three things: the kiss in the night,
7. The white flying joy when a song is born,
8. And meadowlarks whistling in silver light.
