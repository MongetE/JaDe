1. "She can't be unhappy," you said,
2. "The smiles are like stars in her eyes,
3. And her laughter is thistledown
4. Around her low replies."
5. "Is she unhappy?" you said--
6. But who has ever known
7. Another's heartbreak--
8. All he can know is his own;
9. And she seems hushed to me,
10. As hushed as though
11. Her heart were a hunter's fire
12. Smothered in snow.
