1. Here in the teeth of this triumphant wind
2. That shakes the naked shadows on the ground,
3. Making a key-board of the earth to strike
4. From clattering tree and hedge a separate sound,

5. Bear witness for me that I loved my life,
6. All things that hurt me and all things that healed,
7. And that I swore it this day in March,
8. Here at the edge of this new-broken field.

9. You only knew me, tell them I was glad
10. For every hour since my hour of birth,
11. And that I ceased to fear, as once I feared,
12. The last complete reunion with the earth.
