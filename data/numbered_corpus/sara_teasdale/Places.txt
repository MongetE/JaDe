1. PLACES I love come back to me like music,
2. Hush me and heal me when I am very tired;
3. I see the oak woods at Saxton's flaming
4. In a flare of crimson by the frost newly fired;
5. And I am thirsty for the spring in the valley
6. As for a kiss ungiven and long desired.
7. I know a bright world of snowy hills at Boonton,
8. A blue and white dazzling light on everything one sees,
9. The ice-covered branches of the hemlocks sparkle
10. Bending low and tinkling in the sharp thin breeze,
11. And iridescent crystals fall and crackle on the snow-crust
12. With the winter sun drawing cold blue shadows from the trees.
13. Violet now, in veil on veil of evening
14. The hills across from Cromwell grow dreamy and far;
15. A wood-thrush is singing soft as a viol
16. In the heart of the hollow where the dark pools are;
17. The primrose has opened her pale yellow flowers
18. And heaven is lighting star after star.
19. Places I love come back to me like musicâ€”
20. Mid-ocean, midnight, the waves buzz drowsily;
21. In the ship's deep churning the eerie phosphorescence
22. Is like the souls of people who were drowned at sea,
23. And I can hear a man's voice, speaking, hushed, insistent,
24. At midnight, in mid-ocean, hour on hour to me.
