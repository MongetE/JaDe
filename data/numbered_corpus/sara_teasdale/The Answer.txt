1. When I go back to earth
2. And all my joyous body
3. Puts off the red and white
4. That once had been so proud,
5. If men should pass above
6. With false and feeble pity,
7. My dust will find a voice
8. To answer them aloud:

9. "Be still, I am content,
10. Take back your poor compassion,
11. Joy was a flame in me
12. Too steady to destroy;
13. Lithe as a bending reed
14. Loving the storm that sways her--
15. I found more joy in sorrow
16. Than you could find in joy."
