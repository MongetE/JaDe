1. If I can bear your love like a lamp before me,
2. When I go down the long steep Road of Darkness,
3. I shall not fear the everlasting shadows,
4. Nor cry in terror.

5. If I can find out God, then I shall find Him,
6. If none can find Him, then I shall sleep soundly,
7. Knowing how well on earth your love sufficed me,
8. A lamp in darkness.
