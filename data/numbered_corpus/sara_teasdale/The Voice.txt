1. ATOMS as old as stars,
2. Mutation on mutation,
3. Millions and millions of cells
4. Dividing yet still the same,
5. From air and changing earth,
6. From ancient Eastern rivers,
7. From turquoise tropic seas,
8. Unto myself I came.
9. My spirit like my flesh
10. Sprang from a thousand sources,
11. From cave-man, hunter and shepherd,
12. From Karnak, Cyprus, Rome;
13. The living thoughts in me
14. Spring from dead men and women,
15. Forgotten time out of mind
16. And many as bubbles of foam.
17. Here for a moment's space
18. Into the light out of darkness,
19. I come and they come with me
20. Finding words with my breath;
21. From the wisdom of many life-times
22. I hear them cry: 'Forever
23. Seek for Beauty, she only
24. Fights with man against Death!'
