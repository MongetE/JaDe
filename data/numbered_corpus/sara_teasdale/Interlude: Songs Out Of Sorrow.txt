1. I.  Spirit's House



2. From naked stones of agony
3. I will build a house for me;
4. As a mason all alone
5. I will raise it, stone by stone,
6. And every stone where I have bled
7. Will show a sign of dusky red.
8. I have not gone the way in vain,
9. For I have good of all my pain;
10. My spirit's quiet house will be
11. Built of naked stones I trod
12. On roads where I lost sight of God.




13. II.  Mastery



14. I would not have a god come in
15. To shield me suddenly from sin,
16. And set my house of life to rights;
17. Nor angels with bright burning wings
18. Ordering my earthly thoughts and things;
19. Rather my own frail guttering lights
20. Wind blown and nearly beaten out;
21. Rather the terror of the nights
22. And long, sick groping after doubt;
23. Rather be lost than let my soul
24. Slip vaguely from my own control --
25. Of my own spirit let me be
26. In sole though feeble mastery.




27. III.  Lessons



28. Unless I learn to ask no help
29. From any other soul but mine,
30. To seek no strength in waving reeds
31. Nor shade beneath a straggling pine;
32. Unless I learn to look at Grief
33. Unshrinking from her tear-blind eyes,
34. And take from Pleasure fearlessly
35. Whatever gifts will make me wise --
36. Unless I learn these things on earth,
37. Why was I ever given birth?




38. IV.  Wisdom



39. When I have ceased to break my wings
40. Against the faultiness of things,
41. And learned that compromises wait
42. Behind each hardly opened gate,
43. When I can look Life in the eyes,
44. Grown calm and very coldly wise,
45. Life will have given me the Truth,
46. And taken in exchange -- my youth.




47. V.  In a Burying Ground



48. This is the spot where I will lie
49. When life has had enough of me,
50. These are the grasses that will blow
51. Above me like a living sea.

52. These gay old lilies will not shrink
53. To draw their life from death of mine,
54. And I will give my body's fire
55. To make blue flowers on this vine.

56. "O Soul," I said, "have you no tears?
57. Was not the body dear to you?"
58. I heard my soul say carelessly,
59. "The myrtle flowers will grow more blue."




60. VI.  Wood Song



61. I heard a wood thrush in the dusk
62. Twirl three notes and make a star --
63. My heart that walked with bitterness
64. Came back from very far.

65. Three shining notes were all he had,
66. And yet they made a starry call --
67. I caught life back against my breast
68. And kissed it, scars and all.




69. VII.  Refuge



70. From my spirit's gray defeat,
71. From my pulse's flagging beat,
72. From my hopes that turned to sand
73. Sifting through my close-clenched hand,
74. From my own fault's slavery,
75. If I can sing, I still am free.

76. For with my singing I can make
77. A refuge for my spirit's sake,
78. A house of shining words, to be
79. My fragile immortality.
