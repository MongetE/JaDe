1. In the wild soft summer darkness
2. How many and many a night we two together
3. Sat in the park and watched the Hudson
4. Wearing her lights like golden spangles
5. Glinting on black satin.
6. The rail along the curving pathway
7. Was low in a happy place to let us cross,
8. And down the hill a tree that dripped with bloom
9. Sheltered us,
10. While your kisses and the flowers,
11. Falling, falling,
12. Tangled in my hair. . . .

13. The frail white stars moved slowly over the sky.

14. And now, far off
15. In the fragrant darkness
16. The tree is tremulous again with bloom
17. For June comes back.

18. To-night what girl
19. Dreamily before her mirror shakes from her hair
20. This year's blossoms, clinging to its coils?
