1. I came to the crowded Inn of Earth,
2. And called for a cup of wine,
3. But the Host went by with averted eye
4. From a thirst as keen as mine.

5. Then I sat down with weariness
6. And asked a bit of bread,
7. But the Host went by with averted eye
8. And never a word he said.

9. While always from the outer night
10. The waiting souls came in
11. With stifled cries of sharp surprise
12. At all the light and din.

13. "Then give me a bed to sleep," I said,
14. "For midnight comes apace"--
15. But the Host went by with averted eye
16. And I never saw his face.

17. "Since there is neither food nor rest,
18. I go where I fared before"--
19. But the Host went by with averted eye
20. And barred the outer door.
