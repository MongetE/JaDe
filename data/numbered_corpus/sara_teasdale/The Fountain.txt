1. Oh in the deep blue night
2. The fountain sang alone;
3. It sang to the drowsy heart
4. Of a satyr carved in stone.

5. The fountain sang and sang
6. But the satyr never stirred--
7. Only the great white moon
8. In the empty heaven heard.

9. The fountain sang and sang
10. And on the marble rim
11. The milk-white peacocks slept,
12. Their dreams were strange and dim.

13. Bright dew was on the grass,
14. And on the ilex dew,
15. The dreamy milk-white birds
16. Were all a-glisten too.

17. The fountain sang and sang
18. The things one cannot tell,
19. The dreaming peacocks stirred
20. And the gleaming dew-drops fell.
