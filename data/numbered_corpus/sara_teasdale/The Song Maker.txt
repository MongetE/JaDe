1. I made a hundred little songs
2. That told the joy and pain of love,
3. And sang them blithely, tho' I knew
4. No whit thereof.

5. I was a weaver deaf and blind;
6. A miracle was wrought for me,
7. But I have lost my skill to weave
8. Since I can see.

9. For while I sang -- ah swift and strange!
10. Love passed and touched me on the brow,
11. And I who made so many songs
12. Am silent now.
