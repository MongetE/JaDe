1. The winds have grown articulate in thee,
2. And voiced again the wail of ancient woe
3. That smote upon the winds of long ago:
4. The cries of Trojan women as they flee,
5. The quivering moan of pale Andromache,
6. Now lifted loud with pain and now brought low.
7. It is the soul of sorrow that we know,
8. As in a shell the soul of all the sea.
9. So sometimes in the compass of a song,
10. Unknown to him who sings, thro' lips that live,
11. The voiceless dead of long-forgotten lands
12. Proclaim to us their heaviness and wrong
13. In sweeping sadness of the winds that give
14. Thy strings no rest from weariless wild hands.
