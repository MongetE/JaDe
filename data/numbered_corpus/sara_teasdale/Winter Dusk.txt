1. I WATCH the great clear twilight
2. Veiling the ice-bowed trees;
3. Their branches tinkle faintly
4. With crystal melodies.
5. The larches bend their silver
6. Over the hush of snow;
7. One star is lighted in the west,
8. Two in the zenith glow.
9. For a moment I have forgotten
10. Wars and women who mournâ€”
11. I think of the mother who bore me
12. And thank her that I was born.
