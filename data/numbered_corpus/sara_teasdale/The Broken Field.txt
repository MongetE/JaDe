1. My soul is a dark ploughed field
2. In the cold rain;
3. My soul is a broken field
4. Ploughed by pain.

5. Where grass and bending flowers
6. Were growing,
7. The field lies broken now
8. For another sowing.

9. Great Sower when you tread
10. My field again,
11. Scatter the furrows there
12. With better grain.
