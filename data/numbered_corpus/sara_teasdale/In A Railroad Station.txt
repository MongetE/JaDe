1. We stood in the shrill electric light,
2. Dumb and sick in the whirling din
3. We who had all of love to say
4. And a single second to say it in.

5. "Good-by!" "Good-by!"--you turned to go,
6. I felt the train's slow heavy start,
7. You thought to see me cry, but oh
8. My tears were hidden in my heart.
