1. I love too much; I am a river
2. Surging with spring that seeks the sea,
3. I am too generous a giver,
4. Love will not stoop to drink of me.

5. His feet will turn to desert places
6. Shadowless, reft of rain and dew,
7. Where stars stare down with sharpened faces
8. From heavens pitilessly blue.

9. And there at midnight sick with faring,
10. He will stoop down in his desire
11. To slake the thirst grown past all bearing
12. In stagnant water keen as fire.
