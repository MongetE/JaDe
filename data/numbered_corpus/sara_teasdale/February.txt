1. They spoke of him I love
2. With cruel words and gay;
3. My lips kept silent guard
4. On all I could not say.

5. I heard, and down the street
6. The lonely trees in the square
7. Stood in the winter wind
8. Patient and bare.

9. I heard . . . oh voiceless trees
10. Under the wind, I knew
11. The eager terrible spring
12. Hidden in you.
