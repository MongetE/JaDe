1. When I went to look at what had long been hidden,
2. A jewel laid long ago in a secret place,
3. I trembled, for I thought to see its dark deep fire—
4. But only a pinch of dust blew up in my face.

5. I almost gave my life long ago for a thing
6. That has gone to dust now, stinging my eyes—
7. It is strange how often a heart must be broken
8. Before the years can make it wise.
