1. What can I give you, my lord, my lover,
2. You who have given the world to me,
3. Showed me the light and the joy that cover
4. The wild sweet earth and the restless sea?
5. All that I have are gifts of your giving â€”
6. If I gave them again, you would find them old,
7. And your soul would weary of always living
8. Before the mirror my life would hold.
9. What shall I give you, my lord, my lover?
10. The gift that breaks the heart in me:
11. I bid you awake at dawn and discover
12. I have gone my way and left you free.
