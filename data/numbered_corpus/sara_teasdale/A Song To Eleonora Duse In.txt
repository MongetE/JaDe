1. Oh would I were the roses, that lie against her hands,
2. The heavy burning roses she touches as she stands!
3. Dear hands that hold the roses, where mine would love to be,
4. Oh leave, oh leave the roses, and hold the hands of me!
5. She draws the heart from out them, she draws away their breath,â€”
6. Oh would that I might perish and find so sweet a death!
