1. My soul lives in my body's house,
2. And you have both the house and her—
3. But sometimes she is less your own
4. Than a wild, gay adventurer;
5. A restless and an eager wraith,
6. How can I tell what she will do—
7. Oh, I am sure of my body's faith,
8. But what if my soul broke faith with you?
