1. Shall we, too, rise forgetful from our sleep,
2. And shall my soul that lies within your hand
3. Remember nothing, as the blowing sand
4. Forgets the palm where long blue shadows creep
5. When winds along the darkened desert sweep?
6. Or would it still remember, tho' it spanned
7. A thousand heavens, while the planets fanned
8. The vacant ether with their voices deep?
9. Soul of my soul, no word shall be forgot,
10. Nor yet alone, beloved, shall we see
11. The desolation of extinguished suns,
12. Nor fear the void wherethro' our planet runs,
13. For still together shall we go and not
14. Fare forth alone to front eternity.
