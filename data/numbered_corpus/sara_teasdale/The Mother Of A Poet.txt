1. She is too kind, I think, for mortal things,
2. Too gentle for the gusty ways of earth;
3. God gave to her a shy and silver mirth,
4. And made her soul as clear
5. And softly singing as an orchard spring's
6. In sheltered hollows all the sunny year--
7. A spring that thru the leaning grass looks up
8. And holds all heaven in its clarid cup,
9. Mirror to holy meadows high and blue
10. With stars like drops of dew.

11. I love to think that never tears at night
12. Have made her eyes less bright;
13. That all her girlhood thru
14. Never a cry of love made over-tense
15. Her voice's innocence;
16. That in her hands have lain,
17. Flowers beaten by the rain,
18. And little birds before they learned to sing
19. Drowned in the sudden ecstasy of spring.

20. I love to think that with a wistful wonder
21. She held her baby warm against her breast;
22. That never any fear awoke whereunder
23. She shuddered at her gift, or trembled lest
24. Thru the great doors of birth
25. Here to a windy earth
26. She lured from heaven a half-unwilling guest.

27. She caught and kept his first vague flickering smile,
28. The faint upleaping of his spirit's fire;
29. And for a long sweet while
30. In her was all he asked of earth or heaven--
31. But in the end how far,
32. Past every shaken star,
33. Should leap at last that arrow-like desire,
34. His full-grown manhood's keen
35. Ardor toward the unseen
36. Dark mystery beyond the Pleiads seven.
37. And in her heart she heard
38. His first dim-spoken word--
39. She only of them all could understand,
40. Flushing to feel at last
41. The silence over-past,
42. Thrilling as tho' her hand had touched God's hand.
43. But in the end how many words
44. Winged on a flight she could not follow,
45. Farther than skyward lark or swallow,
46. His lips should free to lands she never knew;
47. Braver than white sea-faring birds
48. With a fearless melody,
49. Flying over a shining sea,
50. A star-white song between the blue and blue.

51. Oh I have seen a lake as clear and fair
52. As it were molten air,
53. Lifting a lily upward to the sun.
54. How should the water know the glowing heart
55. That ever to the heaven lifts its fire,
56. A golden and unchangeable desire?
57. The water only knows
58. The faint and rosy glows
59. Of under-petals, opening apart.
60. Yet in the soul of earth,
61. Deep in the primal ground,
62. Its searching roots are wound,
63. And centuries have struggled toward its birth.
64. So, in the man who sings,
65. All of the voiceless horde
66. From the cold dawn of things
67. Have their reward;
68. All in whose pulses ran
69. Blood that is his at last,
70. From the first stooping man
71. Far in the winnowed past.
72. Out of the tumult of their love and mating
73. Each one created, seeing life was good--
74. Dumb, till at last the song that they were waiting
75. Breaks like brave April thru a wintry wood.
