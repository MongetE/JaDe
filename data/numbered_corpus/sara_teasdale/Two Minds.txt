1. Your mind and mine are such great lovers they
2. Have freed themselves from cautious human clay,
3. And on wild clouds of thought, naked together
4. They ride above us in extreme delight;
5. We see them, we look up with a lone envy
6. And watch them in their zone of crystal weather
7. That changes not for winter or the night.
