1. I am alone, in spite of love,
2. In spite of all I take and giveâ€”
3. In spite of all your tenderness,
4. Sometimes I am not glad to live.

5. I am alone, as though I stood
6. On the highest peak of the tired gray world,
7. About me only swirling snow,
8. Above me, endless space unfurled;

9. With earth hidden and heaven hidden,
10. And only my own spirit's pride
11. To keep me from the peace of those
12. Who are not lonely, having died.
