1. There!  See the line of lights,
2. A chain of stars down either side the street --
3. Why can't you lift the chain and give it to me,
4. A necklace for my throat?  I'd twist it round
5. And you could play with it.  You smile at me
6. As though I were a little dreamy child
7. Behind whose eyes the fairies live. . . .  And see,
8. The people on the street look up at us
9. All envious.  We are a king and queen,
10. Our royal carriage is a motor bus,
11. We watch our subjects with a haughty joy. . . .
12. How still you are!  Have you been hard at work
13. And are you tired to-night?  It is so long
14. Since I have seen you -- four whole days, I think.
15. My heart is crowded full of foolish thoughts
16. Like early flowers in an April meadow,
17. And I must give them to you, all of them,
18. Before they fade.  The people I have met,
19. The play I saw, the trivial, shifting things
20. That loom too big or shrink too little, shadows
21. That hurry, gesturing along a wall,
22. Haunting or gay -- and yet they all grow real
23. And take their proper size here in my heart
24. When you have seen them. . . .  There's the Plaza now,
25. A lake of light!  To-night it almost seems
26. That all the lights are gathered in your eyes,
27. Drawn somehow toward you.  See the open park
28. Lying below us with a million lamps
29. Scattered in wise disorder like the stars.
30. We look down on them as God must look down
31. On constellations floating under Him
32. Tangled in clouds. . . .  Come, then, and let us walk
33. Since we have reached the park.  It is our garden,
34. All black and blossomless this winter night,
35. But we bring April with us, you and I;
36. We set the whole world on the trail of spring.
37. I think that every path we ever took
38. Has marked our footprints in mysterious fire,
39. Delicate gold that only fairies see.
40. When they wake up at dawn in hollow tree-trunks
41. And come out on the drowsy park, they look
42. Along the empty paths and say, "Oh, here
43. They went, and here, and here, and here!  Come, see,
44. Here is their bench, take hands and let us dance
45. About it in a windy ring and make
46. A circle round it only they can cross
47. When they come back again!" . . .  Look at the lake --
48. Do you remember how we watched the swans
49. That night in late October while they slept?
50. Swans must have stately dreams, I think.  But now
51. The lake bears only thin reflected lights
52. That shake a little.  How I long to take
53. One from the cold black water -- new-made gold
54. To give you in your hand!  And see, and see,
55. There is a star, deep in the lake, a star!
56. Oh, dimmer than a pearl -- if you stoop down
57. Your hand could almost reach it up to me. . . .

58. There was a new frail yellow moon to-night --
59. I wish you could have had it for a cup
60. With stars like dew to fill it to the brim. . . .

61. How cold it is!  Even the lights are cold;
62. They have put shawls of fog around them, see!
63. What if the air should grow so dimly white
64. That we would lose our way along the paths
65. Made new by walls of moving mist receding
66. The more we follow. . . .  What a silver night!
67. That was our bench the time you said to me
68. The long new poem -- but how different now,
69. How eerie with the curtain of the fog
70. Making it strange to all the friendly trees!
71. There is no wind, and yet great curving scrolls
72. Carve themselves, ever changing, in the mist.
73. Walk on a little, let me stand here watching
74. To see you, too, grown strange to me and far. . . .
75. I used to wonder how the park would be
76. If one night we could have it all alone --
77. No lovers with close arm-encircled waists
78. To whisper and break in upon our dreams.
79. And now we have it!  Every wish comes true!
80. We are alone now in a fleecy world;
81. Even the stars have gone.  We two alone!
