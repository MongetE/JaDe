1. No one worth possessing
2. Can be quite possessed;
3. Lay that on your heart,
4. My young angry dear;
5. This truth, this hard and precious stone,
6. Lay it on your hot cheek,
7. Let it hide your tear.
8. Hold it like a crystal
9. When you are alone
10. And gaze in the depths of the icy stone.
11. Long, look long and you will be blessed:
12. No one worth possessing
13. Can be quite possessed.
