1. I saw the sunset-colored sands,
2. The Nile, like flowing fire between,
3. Where Ramses stares forth serene
4. And ammon's heavy temple stands.

5. I saw the rocks where long ago,
6. Above the sea that cries and breaks,
7. Bright Perseus with Medusa's snakes
8. Set free the maiden white like snow.

9. And many skies have covered me,
10. And many winds have blown me forth,
11. And I have loved the green, bright north,
12. And I have loved the cold, sweet sea.

13. But what to me are north and south,
14. And what the lire of many lands,
15. Since you have learned to catch my hands
16. And lay a kiss upon my mouth.
