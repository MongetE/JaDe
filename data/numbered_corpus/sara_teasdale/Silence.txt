1. (To Eleonora Duse)

2. We are anhungered after solitude,
3. Deep stillness pure of any speech or sound,
4. Soft quiet hovering over pools profound,
5. The silences that on the desert brood,
6. Above a windless hush of empty seas,
7. The broad unfurling banners of the dawn,
8. A faery forest where there sleeps a Faun;
9. Our souls are fain of solitudes like these.
10. O woman who divined our weariness,
11. And set the crown of silence on your art,
12. From what undreamed-of depth within your heart
13. Have you sent forth the hush that makes us free
14. To hear an instant, high above earth's stress,
15. The silent music of infinity?
