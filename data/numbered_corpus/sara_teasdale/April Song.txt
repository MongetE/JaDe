1. Willow in your April gown
2. Delicate and gleaming,
3. Do you mind in years gone by
4. All my dreaming?

5. Spring was like a call to me
6. That I could not answer,
7. I was chained to loneliness,
8. I, the dancer.

9. Willow, twinkling in the sun,
10. Still your leaves and hear me,
11. I can answer spring at last,
12. Love is near me!
