1. Look back with longing eyes and know that I will follow,
2. Lift me up in your love as a light wind lifts a swallow,
3. Let our flight be far in sun or windy rain--
4. But what if I heard my first love calling me again?

5. Hold me on your heart as the brave sea holds the foam,
6. Take me far away to the hills that hide your home;
7. Peace shall thatch the roof and love shall latch the door--

8. But what if I heard my first love calling me once more?
