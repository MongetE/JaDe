1. STEELY stars and moon of brass,
2. How mockingly you watch me pass!
3. You know as well as I how soon
4. I shall be blind to stars and moon,
5. Deaf to the wind in the hemlock tree,
6. Dumb when the brown earth weighs on me.

32. In your quietness you house
33. The wind, the woman and the bird.
34. You speak to me and I have heard:
