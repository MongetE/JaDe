1. Pierrot stands in the garden
2. Beneath a waning moon,
3. And on his lute he fashions
4. A little silver tune.

5. Pierrot plays in the garden,
6. He thinks he plays for me,
7. But I am quite forgotten
8. Under the cherry tree.

9. Pierrot plays in the garden,
10. And all the roses know
11. That Pierrot loves his music,
12. But I love Pierrot.
