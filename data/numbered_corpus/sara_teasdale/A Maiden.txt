1. Oh if I were the velvet rose
2. Upon the red rose vine,
3. I'd climb to touch his window
4. And make his casement fine.

5. And if I were the little bird
6. That twitters on the tree,
7. All day I'd sing my love for him
8. Till he should harken me.

9. But since I am a maiden
10. I go with downcast eyes,
11. And he will never hear the songs
12. That he has turned to sighs.

13. And since I am a maiden
14. My love will never know
15. That I could kiss him with a mouth
16. More red than roses blow.
