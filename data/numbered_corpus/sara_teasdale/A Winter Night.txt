1. My window-pane is starred with frost,
2. The world is bitter cold to-night,
3. The moon is cruel, and the wind
4. Is like a two-edged sword to smite.

5. God pity all the homeless ones,
6. The beggars pacing to and fro.
7. God pity all the poor to-night
8. Who walk the lamp-lit streets of snow.

9. My room is like a bit of June,
10. Warm and close-curtained fold on fold,
11. But somewhere, like a homeless child,
12. My heart is crying in the cold.
