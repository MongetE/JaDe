1. The fountain shivers lightly in the rain,
2. The laurels drip, the fading roses fall,
3. The marble satyr plays a mournful strain
4. That leaves the rainy fragrance musical.

5. Oh dripping laurel, Phoebus sacred tree,
6. Would that swift Daphne's lot might come to me,
7. Then would I still my soul and for an hour
8. Change to a laurel in the glancing shower.
