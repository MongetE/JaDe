1. Vivid with love, eager for greater beauty
2. Out of the night we come
3. Into the corridor, brilliant and warm.
4. A metal door slides open,
5. And the lift receives us.
6. Swiftly, with sharp unswerving flight
7. The car shoots upward,
8. And the air, swirling and angry,
9. Howls like a hundred devils.
10. Past the maze of trim bronze doors,
11. Steadily we ascend.
12. I cling to you
13. Conscious of the chasm under us,
14. And a terrible whirring deafens my ears.

15. The flight is ended.

16. We pass thru a door leading onto the ledge--
17. Wind, night and space
18. Oh terrible height
19. Why have we sought you?
20. Oh bitter wind with icy invisible wings
21. Why do you beat us?
22. Why would you bear us away?
23. We look thru the miles of air,
24. The cold blue miles between us and the city,
25. Over the edge of eternity we look
26. On all the lights,
27. A thousand times more numerous than the stars;
28. Oh lines and loops of light in unwound chains
29. That mark for miles and miles
30. The vast black mazy cobweb of the streets;
31. Near us clusters and splashes of living gold
32. That change far off to bluish steel
33. Where the fragile lights on the Jersey shore
34. Tremble like drops of wind-stirred dew.
35. The strident noises of the city
36. Floating up to us
37. Are hallowed into whispers.
38. Ferries cross thru the darkness
39. Weaving a golden thread into the night,
40. Their whistles weird shadows of sound.

41. We feel the millions of humanity beneath us,--
42. The warm millions, moving under the roofs,
43. Consumed by their own desires;
44. Preparing food,
45. Sobbing alone in a garret,
46. With burning eyes bending over a needle,
47. Aimlessly reading the evening paper,
48. Dancing in the naked light of the caf√©,
49. Laying out the dead,
50. Bringing a child to birth--
51. The sorrow, the torpor, the bitterness, the frail joy
52. Come up to us
53. Like a cold fog wrapping us round.
54. Oh in a hundred years
55. Not one of these blood-warm bodies
56. But will be worthless as clay.
57. The anguish, the torpor, the toil
58. Will have passed to other millions
59. Consumed by the same desires.
60. Ages will come and go,
61. Darkness will blot the lights
62. And the tower will be laid on the earth.
63. The sea will remain
64. Black and unchanging,
65. The stars will look down
66. Brilliant and unconcerned.

67. Beloved,
68. Tho' sorrow, futility, defeat
69. Surround us,
70. They cannot bear us down.
71. Here on the abyss of eternity
72. Love has crowned us
73. For a moment
74. Victors.
