1. THE world is resting without sound or motion,
2. Behind the apple tree the sun goes down
3. Painting with fire the spires and the windows
4. In the elm-shaded town.
5. Beyond the calm Connecticut the hills lie
6. Silvered with haze as fruits still fresh with bloom,
7. The swallows weave in flight across the zenith
8. On an aerial loom.
9. Into the garden peace comes back with twilight,
10. Peace that since noon had left the purple phlox,
11. The heavy-headed asters, the late roses
12. And swaying hollyhocks.
13. For at high-noon I heard from this same garden
14. The far-off murmur as when many come;
15. Up from the village surged the blind and beating
16. Red music of a drum;
17. And the hysterical sharp fife that shattered
18. The brittle autumn air,
19. While they came, the young men marching
20. Past the village square....
21. Across the calm Connecticut the hills change
22. To violet, the veils of dusk are deepâ€”
23. Earth takes her children's many sorrows calmly
24. And stills herself to sleep.
