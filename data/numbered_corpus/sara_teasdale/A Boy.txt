1. OUT of the noise of tired people working,
2. Harried with thoughts of war and lists of dead,
3. His beauty met me like a fresh wind blowing,
4. Clean boyish beauty and high-held head.
5. Eyes that told secrets, lips that would not tell them,
6. Fearless and shy the young unwearied eyesâ€”
7. Men die by millions now, because God blunders,
8. Yet to have made this boy he must be wise.
