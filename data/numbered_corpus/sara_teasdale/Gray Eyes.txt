1. It was April when you came
2. The first time to me,
3. And my first look in your eyes
4. Was like my first look at the sea.

5. We have been together
6. Four Aprils now
7. Watching for the green
8. On the swaying willow bough;

9. Yet whenever I turn
10. To your gray eyes over me,
11. It is as though I looked
12. For the first time at the sea.
