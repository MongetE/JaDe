1. You took my empty dreams
2. And filled them every one
3. With tenderness and nobleness,
4. April and the sun.

5. The old empty dreams
6. Where my thoughts would throng
7. Are far too full of happiness
8. To even hold a song.

9. Oh, the empty dreams were dim
10. And the empty dreams were wide,
11. They were sweet and shadowy houses
12. Where my thoughts could hide.

13. But you took my dreams away
14. And you made them all come true -
15. My thoughts have no place now to play,
16. And nothing now to do.
