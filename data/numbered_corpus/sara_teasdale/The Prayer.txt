1. My answered prayer came up to me,
2. And in the silence thus spake he:
3. "O you who prayed for me to come,
4. Your greeting is but cold and dumb."

5. My heart made answer: "You are fair,
6. But I have prayed too long to care.
7. Why came you not when all was new,
8. And I had died for joy of you."
