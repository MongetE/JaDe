1. WHEN they see my songs
2. They will sigh and say,
3. 'Poor soul, wistful soul,
4. Lonely night and day.'
5. They will never know
6. All your love for me
7. Surer than the spring,
8. Stronger than the sea;
9. Hidden out of sight
10. Like a miser's gold
11. In forsaken fields
12. Where the wind is cold.
