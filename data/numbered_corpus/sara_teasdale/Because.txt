1. Oh, because you never tried
2. To bow my will or break my pride,
3. And nothing of the cave-man made
4. You want to keep me half afraid,
5. Nor ever with a conquering air
6. You thought to draw me unaware --
7. Take me, for I love you more
8. Than I ever loved before.

9. And since the body's maidenhood
10. Alone were neither rare nor good
11. Unless with it I gave to you
12. A spirit still untrammeled, too,
13. Take my dreams and take my mind
14. That were masterless as wind;
15. And "Master!" I shall say to you
16. Since you never asked me to.
