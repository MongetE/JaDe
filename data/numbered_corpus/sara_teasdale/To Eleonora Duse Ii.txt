1. Your beauty lives in mystic melodies,
2. And all the light about you breathes a song.
3. Your voice awakes the dreaming airs that throng
4. Within our music-haunted memories.
5. The sirens' strain that sank within the seas
6. When men forgot to listen, floats along
7. Your voice's undercurrent soft and strong.
8. Sicilian shepherds pipe beneath the trees;
9. Along the purple hills of drifted sand,
10. A lone Egyptian plays an ancient flute;
11. At dawn the Memnon gives his old salute
12. Beside the Nile, by desert breezes fanned.
13. The music faints about you as you stand,
14. And with the Orphean lay it trembles mute.
