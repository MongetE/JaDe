1. Francesca's life that was a limpid flame
2. Agleam against the shimmer of a sword,
3. Which falling, quenched the flame in blood outpoured
4. To free the house of Rimino from shame —
5. Francesca's death that blazed aloft her name
6. In guilty fadeless glory, hurling toward
7. The windy darkness where the tempest roared,
8. Her spirit burdened by the weight of blame —
9. Francesca's life and death are mirrored here
10. Forever, on the face of her who stands
11. Illumined and intent beside the blaze,
12. Grown one with it, and reading without fear
13. That they shall fare upon the selfsame ways,
14. Plucked forth and cast away by bloody hands.
