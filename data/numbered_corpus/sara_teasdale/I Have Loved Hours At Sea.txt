1. I have loved hours at sea, gray cities,
2. The fragile secret of a flower,
3. Music, the making of a poem
4. That gave me heaven for an hour;

5. First stars above a snowy hill,
6. Voices of people kindly and wise,
7. And the great look of love, long hidden,
8. Found at last in meeting eyes.

9. I have loved much and been loved deeply --
10. Oh when my spirit's fire burns low,
11. Leave me the darkness and the stillness,
12. I shall be tired and glad to go.
