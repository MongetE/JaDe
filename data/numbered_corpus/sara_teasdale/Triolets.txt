1. Before a lonely shrine
2. Of foam-born Aphrodite,
3. Ungarlanded of vine,
4. Undyed by dripping wine,
5. I brought green bay to twine,
6. And prayed to her, almighty, â€”
7. And lo, the prayer of mine
8. Was heard of Aphrodite.
9. I sang of answered prayer,
10. And now before the goddess,
11. The maids lay flowers rare,
12. And she has ceased to care
13. For bay that I might bear.
14. To heal my heart's distress,
15. My feet must wander where
16. There waits some lonelier goddess.
