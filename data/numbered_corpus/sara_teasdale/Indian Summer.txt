1. Lyric night of the lingering Indian summer,
2. Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing,
3. Never a bird, but the passionless chant of insects,
4. Ceaseless, insistent.

5. The grasshopper's horn, and far off, high in the maples
6. The wheel of a locust slowly grinding the silence,
7. Under a moon waning and warn and broken,
8. Tired with summer.

9. Let me remember you, voices of little insects,
10. Weeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters,
11. Let me remember you, soon the winter will be on us,
12. Snow-hushed and heartless.

13. Over my soul murmur your mute benediction
14. While I gaze, oh fields that rest after harvest,
15. As those who part look long in the eyes they lean to,
16. Lest they forget them.
