1. Alone in the night
2. On a dark hill
3. With pines around me
4. Spicy and still,

5. And a heaven full of stars
6. Over my head
7. White and topaz
8. And misty red;

9. Myriads with beating
10. Hearts of fire
11. The aeons
12. Cannot vex or tire;

13. Up the dome of heaven
14. Like a great hill
15. I watch them marching
16. Stately and still.

17. And I know that I
18. Am honored to be
19. Witness
20. Of so much majesty.
