1. MY forefathers gave me
2. My spirit's shaken flame,
3. The shape of hands, the beat of heart,
4. The letters of my name.
5. But it was my lovers,
6. And not my sleeping sires,
7. Who gave the flame its changeful
8. And iridescent fires;
9. As the driftwood burning
10. Learned its jewelled blaze
11. From the sea's blue splendor
12. Of colored nights and days.
