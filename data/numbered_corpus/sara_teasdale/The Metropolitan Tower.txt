1. We walked together in the dusk
2. To watch the tower grow dimly white,
3. And saw it lift against the sky
4. Its flower of amber light.

5. You talked of half a hundred things,
6. I kept each little word you said;
7. And when at last the hour was full,
8. I saw the light turn red.

9. You did not know the time had come,
10. You did not see the sudden flower,
11. Nor know that in my heart Love's birth
12. Was reckoned from that hour.
