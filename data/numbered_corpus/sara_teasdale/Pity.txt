1. They never saw my lover's face,
2. They only know our love was brief,
3. Wearing awhile a windy grace
4. And passing like an autumn leaf.

5. They wonder why I do not weep,
6. They think it strange that I can sing,
7. They say, "Her love was scarcely deep
8. Since it has left so slight a sting."

9. They never saw my love, nor knew
10. That in my heart's most secret place
11. I pity them as angels do
12. Men who have never seen God's face.
