1. Was that his step that sounded on the stair?
2. Was that his knock I heard upon the door?
3. I grow so tired I almost cease to care,
4. And yet I would that he might come once more.

5. It was the wind I heard, that mocks at me,
6. The bitter wind that is more cruel than he;
7. It was the wind that knocked upon the door,
8. But he will never knock nor enter more.
