1. I think the moon is very kind
2. To take such trouble just for me.
3. He came along with me from home
4. To keep me company.

5. He went as fast as I could run;
6. I wonder how he crossed the sky?
7. I'm sure he hasn't legs and feet
8. Or any wings to fly.

9. Yet here he is above their roof;
10. Perhaps he thinks it isn't right
11. For me to go so far alone,
12. Tho' mother said I might.
