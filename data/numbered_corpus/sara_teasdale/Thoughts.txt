1. When I can make my thoughts come forth
2. To walk like ladies up and down,
3. Each one puts on before the glass
4. Her most becoming hat and gown.

5. But oh, the shy and eager thoughts
6. That hide and will not get them dressed,
7. Why is it that they always seem
8. So much more lovely than the rest?
