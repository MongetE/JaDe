1. O LOVELY chance, what can I do
2. To give my gratefulness to you?
3. You rise between myself and me
4. With a wise persistency;
5. I would have broken body and soul,
6. But by your grace, still I am whole.
7. Many a thing you did to save me,
8. Many a holy gift you gave me,
9. Music and friends and happy love
10. More than my dearest dreaming of;
11. And now in this wide twilight hour
12. With earth and heaven a dark, blue flower,
13. In a humble mood I bless
14. Your wisdomâ€”and your waywardness.
15. You brought me even here, where I
16. Live on a hill against the sky
17. And look on mountains and the sea
18. And a thin white moon in the pepper tree.
