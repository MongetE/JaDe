1. The northern woods are delicately sweet,
2. The lake is folded softly by the shore,
3. But I am restless for the subway's roar,
4. The thunder and the hurrying of feet.
5. I try to sleep, but still my eyelids beat
6. Against the image of the tower that bore
7. Me high aloft, as if thru heaven's door
8. I watched the world from God's unshaken seat.
9. I would go back and breathe with quickened sense
10. The tunnel's strong hot breath of powdered steel;
11. But at the ferries I should leave the tense
12. Dark air behind, and I should mount and be
13. One among many who are thrilled to feel
14. The first keen sea-breath from the open sea.
