1. I built a little House of Dreams,
2. And fenced it all about,
3. But still I heard the Wind of Truth
4. That roared without.
5. I laid a fire of Memories
6. And sat before the glow,
7. But through the chinks and round the door
8. The wind would blow.
9. I left the House, for all the night
10. I heard the Wind of Truth; â€”
11. I followed where it seemed to lead
12. Through all my youth.
13. But when I sought the House of Dreams,
14. To creep within and die,
15. The Wind of Truth had levelled it,
16. And passed it by.
