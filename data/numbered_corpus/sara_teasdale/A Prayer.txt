1. When I am dying, let me know
2. That I loved the blowing snow
3. Although it stung like whips;
4. That I loved all lovely things
5. And I tried to take their stings
6. With gay unembittered lips;
7. That I loved with all my strength,
8. To my soul's full depth and length,
9. Careless if my heart must break,
10. That I sang as children sing
11. Fitting tunes to everything,
12. Loving life for its own sake.
