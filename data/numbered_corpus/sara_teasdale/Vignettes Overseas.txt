1. I. Off Gilbatrar
2. BEYOND the sleepy hills of Spain,
3. The sun goes down in yellow mist,
4. The sky is fresh with dewy stars
5. Above a sea of amethyst.
6. Yet in the city of my love
7. High noon burns all the heavens bare —
8. For him the happiness of light,
9. For me a delicate despair.
10. II. Off Algeirs
11. Oh give me neither love nor tears,
12. Nor dreams that sear the night with fire,
13. Go lightly on your pilgrimage
14. Unburdened by desire.
15. Forget me for a month, a year,
16. But, oh, beloved, think of me
17. When unexpected beauty burns
18. Like sudden sunlight on the sea.
19. III. Naples
20. Nisida and Prosida are laughing in the light,
21. Capri is a dewy flower lifting into sight,
22. Posilipo kneels and looks in the burnished sea,
23. Naples crowds her million roofs close as close can be;
24. Round about the mountain's crest a flag of smoke is hung-
25. Oh when God made Italy he was gay and young!
26. IV. Capri
27. When beauty grows too great to bear
28. How shall I ease me of its ache,
29. For beauty more than bitterness
30. Makes the heart break.
31. Now while I watch the dreaming sea
32. With isles like flowers against her breast,
33. Only one voice in all the world
34. Could give me rest.
35. V. Night Song at Amalfi
36. I asked the heaven of stars
37. What I should give my love —
38. It answered me with silence,
39. Silence above.
40. I asked the darkened sea
41. Down where the fishers go —
42. It answered me with silence,
43. Silence below.
44. Oh, I could give him weeping,
45. Or I could give him song —
46. But how can I give silence
47. My whole life long?
48. VI. Ruins of Paestum
49. On lowlands where the temples lie
50. The marsh-grass mingles with the flowers,
51. Only the little songs of birds
52. Link the unbroken hours.
53. So in the end, above my heart
54. Once like the city wild and gay,
55. The slow white stars will pass by night,
56. The swift brown birds by day.
57. VII. Rome
58. Oh for the rising moon
59. Over the roofs of Rome,
60. And swallows in the dusk
61. Circling a darkened dome!
62. Oh for the measured dawns
63. That pass with folded wings —
64. How can I let them go
65. With unremembered things?
66. Florence
67. The bells ring over the Arno,
68. Midnight, the long, long chime;
69. Here in the quivering darkness
70. I am afraid of time.
71. Oh, gray bells cease your tolling,
72. Time takes too much from me,
73. And yet to rock and river
74. He gives eternity.
75. Villa Serbelloni, Bellaggio
76. The fountain shivers lightly in the rain,
77. The laurels drip, the fading roses fall,
78. The marble satyr plays a mournful strain
79. That leaves the rainy fragrance musical.
80. Oh dripping laurel, Phoebus sacred tree,
81. Would that swift Daphne's lot might come to me,
82. Then would I still my soul and for an hour
83. Change to a laurel in the glancing shower.
84. X. Stresa
85. The moon grows out of the hills
86. A yellow flower,
87. The lake is a dreamy bride
88. Who waits her hour.
89. Beauty has filled my heart,
90. It can hold no more,
91. It is full, as the lake is full,
92. From shore to shore.
93. XI. Hamburg
94. The day that I come home,
95. What will you find to say,—
96. Words as light as foam
97. With laughter light as spray?
98. Yet say what words you will
99. The day that I come home;
100. I shall hear the whole deep ocean
101. Beating under the foam.
