1. As dew leaves the cobweb lightly
2. Threaded with stars,
3. Scattering jewels on the fence
4. And the pasture bars;
5. As dawn leaves the dry grass bright
6. And the tangled weeds
7. Bearing a rainbow gem
8. On each of their seeds;
9. So has your love, my lover,
10. Fresh as the dawn,
11. Made me a shining road
12. To travel on,
13. Set every common sight
14. Of tree or stone
15. Delicately alight
16. For me alone.
