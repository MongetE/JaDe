1. There is no lord within my heart,
2. Left silent as an empty shrine
3. Where rose and myrtle intertwine,
4. Within a place apart.

5. No god is there of carven stone
6. To watch with still approving eyes
7. My thoughts like steady incense rise;
8. I dream and weep alone.

9. But if I keep my altar fair,
10. Some morning I shall lift my head
11. From roses deftly garlanded
12. To find the god is there.
