1. He said:

2. "In the winter dusk
3. When the pavements were gleaming with rain,
4. I walked thru a dingy street
5. Hurried, harassed,
6. Thinking of all my problems that never are solved.
7. Suddenly out of the mist, a flaring gas-jet
8. Shone from a huddled shop.
9. I saw thru the bleary window
10. A mass of playthings:
11. False-faces hung on strings,
12. Valentines, paper and tinsel,
13. Tops of scarlet and green,
14. Candy, marbles, jacks--
15. A confusion of color
16. Pathetically gaudy and cheap.
17. All of my boyhood
18. Rushed back.
19. Once more these things were treasures
20. Wildly desired.
21. With covetous eyes I looked again at the marbles,
22. The precious agates, the pee-wees, the chinies--
23. Then I passed on.

24. In the winter dusk,
25. The pavements were gleaming with rain;
26. There in the lighted window
27. I left my boyhood."
