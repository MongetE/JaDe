1. The birds are all a-building,
2. They say the world's a-flower,
3. And still I linger lonely
4. Within a barren bower.

5. I weave a web of fancies
6. Of tears and darkness spun.
7. How shall I sing of sunlight
8. Who never saw the sun?

9. I hear the pipes a-blowing,
10. But yet I may not dance,
11. I know that Love is passing,
12. I cannot catch his glance.

13. And if his voice should call me
14. And I with groping dim
15. Should reach his place of calling
16. And stretch my arms to him,

17. The wind would blow between my hands
18. For Joy that I shall miss,
19. The rain would fall upon my mouth
20. That his will never kiss.
