1. I asked the heaven of stars
2. What I should I give my love--
3. It answered me with silence,
4. Silence above.

5. I asked the darkened sea
6. Down where the fishermen go--
7. It answered me with silence,
8. Silence below.

9. Oh, I could give him weeping,
10. Or I could give him song--
11. But how can I give silence
12. My whole life long?
