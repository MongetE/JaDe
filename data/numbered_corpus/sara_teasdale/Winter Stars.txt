1. I WENT out at night alone;
2. The young blood flowing beyond the sea
3. Seemed to have drenched my spirit's wingsâ€”
4. I bore my sorrow heavily.
5. But when I lifted up my head
6. From shadows shaken on the snow,
7. I saw Orion in the east
8. Burn steadily as long ago.
9. From windows in my father's house,
10. Dreaming my dreams on winter nights,
11. I watched Orion as a girl
12. Above another city's lights.
13. Years go, dreams go, and youth goes too,
14. The world's heart breaks beneath its wars,
15. All things are changed, save in the east
16. The faithful beauty of the stars.
