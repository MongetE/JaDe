1. How many million Aprils came
2. Before I ever knew
3. How white a cherry bough could be,
4. A bed of squills, how blue.

5. And many a dancing April
6. When life is done with me,
7. Will lift the blue flame of the flower
8. And the white flame of the tree.

9. Oh, burn me with your beauty, then,
10. Oh, hurt me, tree and flower,
11. Lest in the end death try to take
12. Even this glistening hour.

13. O shaken flowers, O shimmering trees,
14. O sunlit white and blue,
15. Wound me, that I through endless sleep
16. May bear the scar of you.
