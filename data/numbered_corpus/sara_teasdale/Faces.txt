1. PEOPLE that I meet and pass
2. In the city's broken roar,
3. Faces that I lose so soon
4. And have never found before,
5. Do you know how much you tell
6. In the meeting of our eyes,
7. How ashamed I am, and sad
8. To have pierced your poor disguise?
9. Secrets rushing without sound
10. Crying from your hiding places—
11. Let me go, I cannot bear
12. The sorrow of the passing faces.
13. —People in the restless street,
14. Can it be, oh can it be
15. In the meeting of our eyes
16. That you know as much of me?
