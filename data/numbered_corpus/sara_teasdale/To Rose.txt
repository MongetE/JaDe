1. Rose, when I remember you,
2. Little lady, scarcely two,
3. I am suddenly aware
4. Of the angels in the air.
5. All your softly gracious ways
6. Make an island in my days
7. Where my thoughts fly back to be
8. Sheltered from too strong a sea.
9. All your luminous delight
10. Shines before me in the night
11. When I grope for sleep and find
12. Only shadows in my mind.

13. Rose, when I remember you,
14. White and glowing, pink and new,
15. With so swift a sense of fun
16. Altho' life has just begun;
17. With so sure a pride of place
18. In your very infant face,
19. I should like to make a prayer
20. To the angels in the air:
21. "If an angel ever brings
22. Me a baby in her wings,
23. Please be certain that it grows
24. Very, very much like Rose."
