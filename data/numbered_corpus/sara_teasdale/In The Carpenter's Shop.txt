1. Mary sat in the corner dreaming,
2. Dim was the room and low,
3. While in the dusk, the saw went screaming
4. To and fro.

5. Jesus and Joseph toiled together,
6. Mary was watching them,
7. Thinking of kings in the wintry weather
8. At Bethlehem.

9. Mary sat in the corner thinking,
10. Jesus had grown a man;
11. One by one her hopes were sinking
12. As the years ran.

13. Jesus and Joseph toiled together,
14. Mary's thoughts were far--
15. Angels sang in the wintry weather
16. Under a star.

17. Mary sat in the corner weeping,
18. Bitter and hot her tears--
19. Little faith were the angels keeping
20. All the years.
