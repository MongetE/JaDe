1. Come, when the pale moon like a petal
2. Floats in the pearly dusk of spring,
3. Come with outstretched arms to take me,
4. Come with lips pursed up to cling.

5. Come, for life is a frail moth flying
6. Caught in the web of the years that pass,
7. And soon we two,so warm and eager,
8. Will be as the gray stones in the grass.
