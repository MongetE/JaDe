1. I KNEW you thought of me all night,
2. I knew, though you were far away;
3. I felt your love blow over me
4. As if a dark wind-riven sea
5. Drenched me with quivering spray.
6. There are so many ways to love
7. And each way has its own delightâ€”
8. Then be content to come to me
9. Only as spray the beating sea
10. Drives inland through the night.
