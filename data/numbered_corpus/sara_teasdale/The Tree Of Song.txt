1. I sang my songs for the rest,
2. For you I am still;
3. The tree of my song is bare
4. On its shining hill.

5. For you came like a lordly wind,
6. And the leaves were whirled
7. Far as forgotten things
8. Past the rim of the world.

9. The tree of my song stands bare
10. Against the blue --
11. I gave my songs to the rest,
12. Myself to you.
