1. Love entered in my heart one day,
2. A sad, unwelcome guest;
3. But when he begged that he might stay,
4. I let him wait and rest.
5. He broke my sleep with sorrowing,
6. And shook my dreams with tears,
7. And when my heart was fain to sing,
8. He stilled its joy with fears.

9. But now that he has gone his way,
10. I miss the old sweet pain,
11. And sometimes in the night I pray
12. That he may come again.
