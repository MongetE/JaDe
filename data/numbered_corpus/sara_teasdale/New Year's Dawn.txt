1. When the horns wear thin
2. And the noise, like a garment outworn,
3. Falls from the night,
4. The tattered and shivering night,
5. That thinks she is gay;
6. When the patient silence comes back,
7. And retires,
8. And returns,
9. Rebuffed by a ribald song,
10. Wounded by vehement cries,
11. Fleeing again to the stars--
12. Ashamed of her sister the night;
13. Oh, then they steal home,
14. The blinded, the pitiful ones
15. With their gew-gaws still in their hands,
16. Reeling with odorous breath
17. And thick, coarse words on their tongues.
18. They get them to bed, somehow,
19. And sleep the forgiving,
20. Comes thru the scattering tumult
21. And closes their eyes.
22. The stars sink down ashamed
23. And the dawn awakes,
24. Like a youth who steals from a brothel,
25. Dizzy and sick.
