1. Crisply the bright snow whispered,
2. Crunching beneath our feet;
3. Behind us as we walked along the parkway,
4. Our shadows danced,
5. Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.
6. Across the lake the skaters
7. Flew to and fro,
8. With sharp turns weaving
9. A frail invisible net.
10. In ecstacy the earth
11. Drank the silver sunlight;
12. In ecstacy the skaters
13. Drank the wine of speed;
14. In ecstacy we laughed
15. Drinking the wine of love.
16. Had not the music of our joy
17. Sounded its highest note?
18. But no,
19. For suddenly, with lifted eyes you said,
20. "Oh look!"
21. There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,
22. Fearless and gay as our love,
23. A bluejay cocked his crest!
24. Oh who can tell the range of joy
25. Or set the bounds of beauty?
