1. We are apart; the city grows quiet between us,
2. She hushes herself, for midnight makes heavy her eyes,
3. The tangle of traffic is ended, the cars are empty,
4. Five streets divide us, and on them the moonlight lies.

5. Oh are you asleep, or lying awake, my lover?
6. Open your dreams to my love and your heart to my words.
7. I send you my thoughts--the air between us is laden,
8. My thoughts fly in at your window, a flock of wild birds.
