1. IN Warsaw in Poland
2. Half the world away,
3. The one I love best of all
4. Thought of me to-day;
5. I know, for I went
6. Winged as a bird,
7. In the wide flowing wind
8. His own voice I heard;
9. His arms were round me
10. In a ferny place,
11. I looked in the pool
12. And there was his faceâ€”
13. But now it is night
14. And the cold stars say:
15. 'Warsaw in Poland
16. Is half the world away.'
