1. A thousand miles beyond this sun-steeped wall
2. Somewhere the waves creep cool along the sand,
3. The ebbing tide forsakes the listless land
4. With the old murmur, long and musical;
5. The windy waves mount up and curve and fall,
6. And round the rocks the foam blows up like snow,--
7. Tho' I am inland far, I hear and know,
8. For I was born the sea's eternal thrall.
9. I would that I were there and over me
10. The cold insistence of the tide would roll,
11. Quenching this burning thing men call the soul,--
12. Then with the ebbing I should drift and be
13. Less than the smallest shell along the shoal,
14. Less than the sea-gulls calling to the sea.
