1. I THOUGHT of you when I was wakened
2. By a wind that made me glad and afraid
3. Of the rushing, pouring sound of the sea
4. That the great trees made.
5. One thought in my mind went over and over
6. While the darkness shook and the leaves were thinnedâ€”
7. I thought it was you who had come to find me,
8. You were the wind.
