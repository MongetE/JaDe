1. The moon is a charring ember
2. Dying into the dark;
3. Off in the crouching mountains
4. Coyotes bark.

5. The stars are heavy in heaven,
6. Too great for the sky to hold --
7. What if they fell and shattered
8. The earth with gold?

9. No lights are over the mesa,
10. The wind is hard and wild,
11. I stand at the darkened window
12. And cry like a child.
