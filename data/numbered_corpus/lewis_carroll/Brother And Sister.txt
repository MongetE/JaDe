1. "SISTER, sister, go to bed!
2. Go and rest your weary head."
3. Thus the prudent brother said.

4. "Do you want a battered hide,
5. Or scratches to your face applied?"
6. Thus his sister calm replied.

7. "Sister, do not raise my wrath.
8. I'd make you into mutton broth
9. As easily as kill a moth"

10. The sister raised her beaming eye
11. And looked on him indignantly
12. And sternly answered, "Only try!"

13. Off to the cook he quickly ran.
14. "Dear Cook, please lend a frying-pan
15. To me as quickly as you can."

16. And wherefore should I lend it you?"
17. "The reason, Cook, is plain to view.
18. I wish to make an Irish stew."

19. "What meat is in that stew to go?"
20. "My sister'll be the contents!"
21. "Oh"
22. "You'll lend the pan to me, Cook?"
23. "No!"

24. Moral: Never stew your sister.
