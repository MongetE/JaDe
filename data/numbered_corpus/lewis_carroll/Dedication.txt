1. Inscribed to a Dear Child:
2. In Memory of Golden Summer Hours
3. And Whispers of a Summer Sea


4. Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,
5. Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well
6. Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask
7. The tale he loves to tell.
8. Rude spirits of the seething outer strife,
9. Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright,
10. Deem if you list, such hours a waste of life,
11. Empty of all delight!

12. Chat on, sweet Maid, and rescue from annoy
13. Hearts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled.
14. Ah, happy he who owns that tenderest joy,
15. The heart-love of a child!
