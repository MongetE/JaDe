1. She's all my fancy painted him
2. (I make no idle boast);
3. If he or you had lost a limb,
4. Which would have suffered most?

5. He said that you had been to her,
6. And seen me here before;
7. But, in another character,
8. She was the same of yore.

9. There was not one that spoke to us,
10. Of all that thronged the street:
11. So he sadly got into a 'bus,
12. And pattered with his feet.

13. They sent him word I had not gone
14. (We know it to be true);
15. If she should push the matter on,
16. What would become of you?

17. They gave her one, the gave me two,
18. They gave us three or more;
19. They all returned from him to you,
20. Though they were mine before.

21. If I or she should chance to be
22. Involved in this affair,
23. He trusts to you to set them free,
24. Exactly as we were.

25. It seemed to me that you had been
26. (Before she had this fit)
27. An obstacle, that came between
28. Him, and ourselves, and it.

29. Don't let him know she liked them best,
30. For this must ever be
31. A secret, kept from all the rest,
32. Between yourself and me.
