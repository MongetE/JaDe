1. Little maidens, when you look
2. On this little story-book,
3. Reading with attentive eye
4. Its enticing history,
5. Never think that hours of play
6. Are your only HOLIDAY,
7. And that in a HOUSE of joy
8. Lessons serve but to annoy:
9. If in any HOUSE you find
10. Children of a gentle mind,
11. Each the others pleasing ever--
12. Each the others vexing never--
13. Daily work and pastime daily
14. In their order taking gaily--
15. Then be very sure that they
16. Have a life of HOLIDAY.
