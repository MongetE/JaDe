1. With saddest music all day long
2. She soothed her secret sorrow:
3. At night she sighed "I fear 'twas wrong
4. Such cheerful words to borrow.
5. Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song
6. I'll sing to thee to-morrow."

7. I thanked her, but I could not say
8. That I was glad to hear it:
9. I left the house at break of day,
10. And did not venture near it
11. Till time, I hoped, had worn away
12. Her grief, for nought could cheer it!

13. My dismal sister! Couldst thou know
14. The wretched home thou keepest!
15. Thy brother, drowned in daily woe,
16. Is thankful when thou sleepest;
17. For if I laugh, however low,
18. When thou'rt awake, thou weepest!

19. I took my sister t'other day
20. (Excuse the slang expression)
21. To Sadler's Wells to see the play
22. In hopes the new impression
23. Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay
24. Effect some slight digression.

25. I asked three gay young dogs from town
26. To join us in our folly,
27. Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown
28. My sister's melancholy:
29. The lively Jones, the sportive Brown,
30. And Robinson the jolly.

31. The maid announced the meal in tones
32. That I myself had taught her,
33. Meant to allay my sister's moans
34. Like oil on troubled water:
35. I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones,
36. And begged him to escort her.

37. Vainly he strove, with ready wit,
38. To joke about the weather -
39. To ventilate the last 'ON DIT' -
40. To quote the price of leather -
41. She groaned "Here I and Sorrow sit:
42. Let us lament together!"

43. I urged "You're wasting time, you know:
44. Delay will spoil the venison."
45. "My heart is wasted with my woe!
46. There is no rest - in Venice, on
47. The Bridge of Sighs!" she quoted low
48. From Byron and from Tennyson.

49. I need not tell of soup and fish
50. In solemn silence swallowed,
51. The sobs that ushered in each dish,
52. And its departure followed,
53. Nor yet my suicidal wish
54. To BE the cheese I hollowed.

55. Some desperate attempts were made
56. To start a conversation;
57. "Madam," the sportive Brown essayed,
58. "Which kind of recreation,
59. Hunting or fishing, have you made
60. Your special occupation?"

61. Her lips curved downwards instantly,
62. As if of india-rubber.
63. "Hounds IN FULL CRY I like," said she:
64. (Oh how I longed to snub her!)
65. "Of fish, a whale's the one for me,
66. IT IS SO FULL OF BLUBBER!"

67. The night's performance was "King John."
68. "It's dull," she wept, "and so-so!"
69. Awhile I let her tears flow on,
70. She said they soothed her woe so!
71. At length the curtain rose upon
72. 'Bombastes Furioso.'

73. In vain we roared; in vain we tried
74. To rouse her into laughter:
75. Her pensive glances wandered wide
76. From orchestra to rafter -
77. "TIER UPON TIER!" she said, and sighed;
78. And silence followed after.
