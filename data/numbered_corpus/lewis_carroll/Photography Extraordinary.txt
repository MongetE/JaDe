1. The Milk-and-Water School
2. Alas! she would not hear my prayer!
3. Yet it were rash to tear my hair;
4. Disfigured, I should be less fair.

5. She was unwise, I may say blind;
6. Once she was lovingly inclined;
7. Some circumstance has changed her mind.


8. The Strong-Minded or Matter-of-Fact School
9. Well! so my offer was no go!
10. She might do worse, I told her so;
11. She was a fool to answer "No".

12. However, things are as they stood;
13. Nor would I have her if I could,
14. For there are plenty more as good.


15. The Spasmodic or German School
16. Firebrands and Daggers! hope hath fled!
17. To atoms dash the doubly dead!
18. My brain is fire--my heart is lead!

19. Her soul is flint, and what am I?
20. Scorch'd by her fierce, relentless eye,
21. Nothingness is my destiny!
