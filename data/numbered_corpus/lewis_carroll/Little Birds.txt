1. Little Birds are dining
2. Warily and well,
3. Hid in mossy cell:
4. Hid, I say, by waiters
5. Gorgeous in their gaiters -
6. I've a Tale to tell.

7. Little Birds are feeding
8. Justices with jam,
9. Rich in frizzled ham:
10. Rich, I say, in oysters
11. Haunting shady cloisters -
12. That is what I am.

13. Little Birds are teaching
14. Tigresses to smile,
15. Innocent of guile:
16. Smile, I say, not smirkle -
17. Mouth a semicircle,
18. That's the proper style!

19. Little Birds are sleeping
20. All among the pins,
21. Where the loser wins:
22. Where, I say, he sneezes
23. When and how he pleases -
24. So the Tale begins.

25. Little Birds are writing
26. Interesting books,
27. To be read by cooks:
28. Read, I say, not roasted -
29. Letterpress, when toasted,
30. Loses its good looks.

31. Little Birds are playing
32. Bagpipes on the shore,
33. Where the tourists snore:
34. "Thanks!" they cry. "'Tis thrilling!
35. Take, oh take this shilling!
36. Let us have no more!"

37. Little Birds are bathing
38. Crocodiles in cream,
39. Like a happy dream:
40. Like, but not so lasting -
41. Crocodiles, when fasting,
42. Are not all they seem!

43. Little Birds are choking
44. Baronets with bun,
45. Taught to fire a gun:
46. Taught, I say, to splinter
47. Salmon in the winter -
48. Merely for the fun.

49. Little Birds are hiding
50. Crimes in carpet-bags,
51. Blessed by happy stags:
52. Blessed, I say, though beaten -
53. Since our friends are eaten
54. When the memory flags.

55. Little Birds are tasting
56. Gratitude and gold,
57. Pale with sudden cold:
58. Pale, I say, and wrinkled -
59. When the bells have tinkled,
60. And the Tale is told.
