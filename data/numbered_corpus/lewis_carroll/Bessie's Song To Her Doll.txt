1. Matilda Jane, you never look
2. At any toy or picture-book.
3. I show you pretty things in vain
4. You must be blind, Matilda Jane!

5. I ask you riddles, tell you tales,
6. But all our conversation fails.
7. You never answer me again
8. I fear you're dumb, Matilda Jane!

9. Matilda darling, when I call,
10. You never seem to hear at all.
11. I shout with all my might and main
12. But you're so deaf, Matilda Jane!

13. Matilda Jane, you needn't mind,
14. For, though you're deaf and dumb and blind,
15. There's some one loves you, it is plain
16. And that is me, Matilda Jane!
