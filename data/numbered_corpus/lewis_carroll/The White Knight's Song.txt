1. 'Haddock's Eyes' or 'The Aged Aged Man' or
2. 'Ways and Means' or 'A-Sitting On A Gate'

3. I'll tell thee everything I can;
4. There's little to relate.
5. I saw an aged, aged man,
6. A-sitting on a gate.'Who are you, aged man?' I said.
7. 'And how is it you live?'
8. And his answer trickled through my head
9. Like water through a sieve.

10. He said 'I look for butterflies
11. That sleep among the wheat;
12. I make them into mutton-pies,
13. And sell them in the street.
14. I sell them unto men,' he said,
15. 'Who sail on stormy seas;
16. And that's the way I get my bread--
17. A trifle, if you please.'

18. But I was thinking of a plan
19. To dye one's whiskers green,
20. And always use so large a fan
21. That it could not be seen.
22. So, having no reply to give
23. To what the old man said,
24. I cried, 'Come, tell me how you live!'
25. And thumped him on the head.

26. His accents mild took up the tale;
27. He said, 'I go my ways,
28. And when I find a mountain-rill,
29. I set it in a blaze.
30. And thence they make a stuff they call
31. Rowland's Macassar Oil--
32. Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
33. They give me for my toil.'

34. But I was thinking of a way
35. To feed oneself on batter,
36. And so go on from day to day
37. Getting a little fatter.
38. I shook him well from side to side,
39. Until his face was blue;
40. 'Come, tell me how you live,' I cried
41. 'And what it is you do!'

42. He said, 'I hunt for haddocks' eyes
43. Among the heather bright,
44. And work them into waistcoat-buttons
45. In the silent night.
46. And these I do not sell for gold
47. Or coin of silvery shine,
48. But for a copper halfpenny,
49. And that will purchase nine.

50. 'I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
51. Or set limed twigs for crabs;
52. I sometimes search the grassy knolls
53. For wheels of hansom-cabs.
54. And that's the way' (he gave a wink)
55. 'By which I get my wealth--
56. And very gladly will I drink
57. Your Honor's noble health.'

58. I heard him then, for I had just
59. Completed my design
60. To keep the Menai bridge from rust
61. By boiling it in wine.
62. I thanked him much for telling me
63. The way he got his wealth,
64. But chiefly for his wish that he
65. Might drink my noble health.

66. And now, if e'er by chance I put
67. My fingers into glue,
68. Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
69. Into a left-hand shoe,
70. Or if I drop upon my toe
71. A very heavy weight,
72. I weep, for it reminds me so
73. Of that old man I used to know--
74. Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
75. Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
76. Whose face was very like a crow
77. With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
78. Who seemed distracted with his woe,
79. Who rocked his body to and fro,
80. And muttered mumblingly and low,
81. As if his mouth were full of dough,
82. Who snorted like a buffalo--
83. That summer evening long ago
84. A-sitting on a gate.
