1. As one who strives a hill to climb,
2. Who never climbed before:
3. Who finds it, in a little time,
4. Grow every moment less sublime,
5. And votes the thing a bore:

6. Yet, having once begun to try,
7. Dares not desert his quest,
8. But, climbing, ever keeps his eye
9. On one small hut against the sky
10. Wherein he hopes to rest:

11. Who climbs till nerve and force are spent,
12. With many a puff and pant:
13. Who still, as rises the ascent,
14. In language grows more violent,
15. Although in breath more scant:

16. Who, climbing, gains at length the place
17. That crowns the upward track.
18. And, entering with unsteady pace,
19. Receives a buffet in the face
20. That lands him on his back:

21. And feels himself, like one in sleep,
22. Glide swiftly down again,
23. A helpless weight, from steep to steep,
24. Till, with a headlong giddy sweep,
25. He drops upon the plain -

26. So I, that had resolved to bring
27. Conviction to a ghost,
28. And found it quite a different thing
29. From any human arguing,
30. Yet dared not quit my post

31. But, keeping still the end in view
32. To which I hoped to come,
33. I strove to prove the matter true
34. By putting everything I knew
35. Into an axiom:

36. Commencing every single phrase
37. With 'therefore' or 'because,'
38. I blindly reeled, a hundred ways,
39. About the syllogistic maze,
40. Unconscious where I was.

41. Quoth he "That's regular clap-trap:
42. Don't bluster any more.
43. Now DO be cool and take a nap!
44. Such a ridiculous old chap
45. Was never seen before!

46. "You're like a man I used to meet,
47. Who got one day so furious
48. In arguing, the simple heat
49. Scorched both his slippers off his feet!"
50. I said "THAT'S VERY CURIOUS!"

51. "Well, it IS curious, I agree,
52. And sounds perhaps like fibs:
53. But still it's true as true can be -
54. As sure as your name's Tibbs," said he.
55. I said "My name's NOT Tibbs."

56. "NOT Tibbs!" he cried - his tone became
57. A shade or two less hearty -
58. "Why, no," said I. "My proper name
59. Is Tibbets - " "Tibbets?" "Aye, the same."
60. "Why, then YOU'RE NOT THE PARTY!"

61. With that he struck the board a blow
62. That shivered half the glasses.
63. "Why couldn't you have told me so
64. Three quarters of an hour ago,
65. You prince of all the asses?

66. "To walk four miles through mud and rain,
67. To spend the night in smoking,
68. And then to find that it's in vain -
69. And I've to do it all again -
70. It's really TOO provoking!

71. "Don't talk!" he cried, as I began
72. To mutter some excuse.
73. "Who can have patience with a man
74. That's got no more discretion than
75. An idiotic goose?

76. "To keep me waiting here, instead
77. Of telling me at once
78. That this was not the house!" he said.
79. "There, that'll do - be off to bed!
80. Don't gape like that, you dunce!"

81. "It's very fine to throw the blame
82. On ME in such a fashion!
83. Why didn't you enquire my name
84. The very minute that you came?"
85. I answered in a passion.

86. "Of course it worries you a bit
87. To come so far on foot -
88. But how was I to blame for it?"
89. "Well, well!" said he. "I must admit
90. That isn't badly put.

91. "And certainly you've given me
92. The best of wine and victual -
93. Excuse my violence," said he,
94. "But accidents like this, you see,
95. They put one out a little.

96. "'Twas MY fault after all, I find -
97. Shake hands, old Turnip-top!"
98. The name was hardly to my mind,
99. But, as no doubt he meant it kind,
100. I let the matter drop.

101. "Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!
102. When I am gone, perhaps
103. They'll send you some inferior Sprite,
104. Who'll keep you in a constant fright
105. And spoil your soundest naps.

106. "Tell him you'll stand no sort of trick;
107. Then, if he leers and chuckles,
108. You just be handy with a stick
109. (Mind that it's pretty hard and thick)
110. And rap him on the knuckles!

111. "Then carelessly remark 'Old coon!
112. Perhaps you're not aware
113. That, if you don't behave, you'll soon
114. Be chuckling to another tune -
115. And so you'd best take care!'

116. "That's the right way to cure a Sprite
117. Of such like goings-on -
118. But gracious me! It's getting light!
119. Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!"
120. A nod, and he was gone.
