1. I'll tell thee everything I can;
2. There's little to relate,
3. I saw an aged, aged man,
4. A-sitting on a gate.'Who are you, aged man?' I said.
5. 'And how is it you live?'
6. And his answer trickled through my head
7. Like water through a sieve.

8. He said, 'I look for butterflies
9. That sleep among the wheat;
10. I make them into mutton-pies,
11. And sell them in the street.
12. I sell them unto men,' he said,
13. 'Who sail on stormy seas;
14. And that's the way I get my bread
15. A trifle, if you please.'

16. But I was thinking of a plan
17. To dye one's whiskers green,
18. And always use so large a fan
19. That they could not be seen.
20. So, having no reply to give
21. To what the old man said,
22. I cried, 'Come, tell me how you live!'
23. And thumped him on the head.

24. His accents mild took up the tale;
25. He said, 'I go my ways,
26. And when I find a mountain-rill,
27. I set it in a blaze;
28. And thence they make a stuff they call
29. Rowland's Macassar Oil
30. Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
31. They give me for my toil.'

32. But I was thinking of a way
33. To feed one's self on batter,
34. And so go on from day to day
35. Getting a little fatter.
36. I shook him well from side to side,
37. Until his face was blue,
38. 'Come, tell me how you live,' I cried,
39. 'And what it is you do!'

40. He said, 'I hunt for haddocks' eyes
41. Among the heather bright,
42. And work them into waistcoat-buttons
43. In the silent night.
44. And these I do not sell for gold
45. Or coin of silvery shine,
46. But for a copper halfpenny,
47. And that will purchase nine.

48. 'I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
49. Or set limed twigs for crabs;
50. I sometimes search the grassy knolls
51. For wheels of hansom-cabs.
52. And that's the way' (he gave a wink)
53. 'By which I get my wealth
54. And very gladly will I drink
55. Your honor's noble health.'

56. I heard him then, for I had just
57. Completed my design
58. To keep the Menai bridge from rust
59. By boiling it in wine.
60. I thanked him much for telling me
61. The way he got his wealth,
62. But chiefly for his wish that he
63. Might drink my noble health.

64. And now, if e'er by chance I put
65. My fingers into glue,
66. Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
67. Into a left-hand shoe,
68. Or if I drop upon my toe
69. A very heavy weight,
70. I weep, for it reminds me so
71. Of that old man I used to know
72. Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow,
73. Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
74. Whose face was very like a crow,
75. With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
76. Who seemed distracted with his woe,
77. Who rocked his body to and fro,
78. And muttered mumblingly and low,
79. As if his mouth were full of dough,
80. Who snorted like a buffalo
81. That summer evening long ago,
82. A-sitting on a gate.
