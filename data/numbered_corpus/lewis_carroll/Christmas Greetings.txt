1. Lady dear, if Fairies may
2. For a moment lay aside
3. Cunning tricks and elfish play,
4. 'Tis at happy Christmas-tide.

5. We have heard the children say -
6. Gentle children, whom we love -
7. Long ago, on Christmas Day,
8. Came a message from above.

9. Still, as Christmas-tide comes round,
10. They remember it again -
11. Echo still the joyful sound
12. 'Peace on earth, good-will to men!'

13. Yet the hearts must childlike be
14. Where such heavenly guests abide:
15. Unto children, in their glee,
16. All the year is Christmas-tide!

17. Thus, forgetting tricks and play
18. For a moment, Lady dear,
19. We would wish you, if we may,
20. Merry Christmas, glad New Year!
