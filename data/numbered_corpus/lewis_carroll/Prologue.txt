1. All in the golden afternoon
2. Full leisurely we glide;
3. For both our oars, with little skill,
4. By little arms are plied,
5. While little hands make vain pretence
6. Our wanderings to guide.

7. Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour
8. Beneath such dreamy weather,
9. To beg a tale of breath too weak
10. To stir the tiniest feather&xclm.
11. Yet what can one poor voice avail
12. Against three tongues together?

13. Imperious Prima flashes forth
14. Her edict ``to begin it'':
15. In gentler tones Secunda hopes
16. ``There will be nonsense in it!''
17. While Tertia interrupts the tale
18. Not more than once a minute.

19. Anon, to sudden silence won,
20. In fancy they pursue
21. The dream-child moving through a land
22. Of wonders wild and new,
23. In friendly chat with bird or beast--
24. And half believe it true.

25. And ever, as the story drained
26. The wells of fancy dry,
27. And faintly strove that weary one
28. To put the subject by
29. ``The rest next time--'' ``It is next time!''
30. The happy voices cry.

31. Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:
32. Thus slowly, one by one,
33. Its quaint events were hammered out--
34. And now the tale is done,
35. And home we steer, a merry crew,
36. Beneath the setting sun.

37. Alice! A childish story take,
38. And with a gentle hand,
39. Lay it where Childhoood's dreams are twined
40. In Memory's mystic band,
41. Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers
42. Pluck'd in a far-off land.
