1. PREFACE

2. If---and the thing is wildly possible---the charge of writing
3. nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but
4. instructive poem, it would be based, I feel convinced, on the line

5. ``Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes''

6. In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
7. indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of
8. such a deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral
9. purpose of this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so
10. cautiously inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in Natural
11. History---I will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining
12. how it happened.

13. The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances,
14. used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be
15. revarnished, and it more than once happened, when the time came for
16. replacing it, that no one on board could remember which end of the
17. ship it belonged to. They knew it was not of the slightest use to
18. appeal to the Bellman about it---he would only refer to his Naval
19. Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions which
20. none of them had ever been able to understand---so it generally ended
21. in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman
22. used to stand by with tears in his eyes: he knew it was all wrong,
23. but alas! Rule 42 of the Code, ``No one shall speak to the Man at the
24. Helm'', had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words
25. ``and the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one''. So remonstrance
26. was impossible, and no steering could be done till the next
27. varnishing day. During these bewildering intervals the ship usually
28. sailed backwards.

29. This office was usually undertaken by the Boots, who found in it
30. a refuge from the Baker's constant complaints about the insufficient
31. blacking of his three pairs of boots.

32. As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the
33. Jabberwock, let me take this opportunity of answering a question that
34. has often been asked me, how to pronounce ``slithy toves''. The
35. ``i'' in ``slithy'' is long, as in ``writhe''; and ``toves'' is
36. pronounced so as to rhyme with ``groves''. Again, the first ``o'' in
37. ``borogoves'' is pronounced like the ``o'' in ``borrow''. I have
38. heard people try to give it the sound of the ``o'' in ``worry''.
39. Such is Human Perversity.

40. This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in
41. that poem. Humpty-Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one
42. word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.

43. For instance, take the two words ``fuming'' and ``furious''. Make up
44. your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which
45. you will say first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts
46. incline ever so little towards ``fuming'', you will say
47. ``fuming-furious''; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards
48. ``furious'', you will say ``furious-fuming''; but if you have that
49. rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say
50. ``frumious''.

51. Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words---

52. ``Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or die!''

53. Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or
54. Richard, but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not
55. possibly say either name before the other, can it be doubted that,
56. rather than die, he would have gasped out ``Rilchiam!''.
