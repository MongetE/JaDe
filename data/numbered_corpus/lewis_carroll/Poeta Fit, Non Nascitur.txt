1. "How shall I be a poet?
2. How shall I write in rhyme?
3. You told me once 'the very wish
4. Partook of the sublime.'
5. The tell me how! Don't put me off
6. With your 'another time'!"

7. The old man smiled to see him,
8. To hear his sudden sally;
9. He liked the lad to speak his mind
10. Enthusiastically;
11. And thought "There's no hum-drum in him,
12. Nor any shilly-shally."

13. "And would you be a poet
14. Before you've been to school?
15. Ah, well! I hardly thought you
16. So absolute a fool.
17. First learn to be spasmodic --
18. A very simple rule.

19. "For first you write a sentence,
20. And then you chop it small;
21. Then mix the bits, and sort them out
22. Just as they chance to fall:
23. The order of the phrases makes
24. No difference at all.

25. 'Then, if you'd be impressive,
26. Remember what I say,
27. That abstract qualities begin
28. With capitals alway:
29. The True, the Good, the Beautiful --
30. Those are the things that pay!

31. "Next, when we are describing
32. A shape, or sound, or tint;
33. Don't state the matter plainly,
34. But put it in a hint;
35. And learn to look at all things
36. With a sort of mental squint."

37. "For instance, if I wished, Sir,
38. Of mutton-pies to tell,
39. Should I say 'dreams of fleecy flocks
40. Pent in a wheaten cell'?"
41. "Why, yes," the old man said: "that phrase
42. Would answer very well.

43. "Then fourthly, there are epithets
44. That suit with any word --
45. As well as Harvey's Reading Sauce
46. With fish, or flesh, or bird --
47. Of these, 'wild,' 'lonely,' 'weary,' 'strange,'
48. Are much to be preferred."

49. "And will it do, O will it do
50. To take them in a lump --
51. As 'the wild man went his weary way
52. To a strange and lonely pump'?"
53. "Nay, nay! You must not hastily
54. To such conclusions jump.

55. "Such epithets, like pepper,
56. Give zest to what you write;
57. And, if you strew them sparely,
58. They whet the appetite:
59. But if you lay them on too thick,
60. You spoil the matter quite!

61. "Last, as to the arrangement:
62. Your reader, you should show him,
63. Must take what information he
64. Can get, and look for no im
65. mature disclosure of the drift
66. And purpose of your poem.

67. "Therefore to test his patience --
68. How much he can endure --
69. Mention no places, names, or dates,
70. And evermore be sure
71. Throughout the poem to be found
72. Consistently obscure.

73. "First fix upon the limit
74. To which it shall extend:
75. Then fill it up with 'Padding'
76. (Beg some of any friend)
77. Your great SENSATION-STANZA
78. You place towards the end."

79. "And what is a Sensation,
80. Grandfather, tell me, pray?
81. I think I never heard the word
82. So used before to-day:
83. Be kind enough to mention one
84. 'Exempli grati√¢'"

85. And the old man, looking sadly
86. Across the garden-lawn,
87. Where here and there a dew-drop
88. Yet glittered in the dawn,
89. Said "Go to the Adelphi,
90. And see the 'Colleen Bawn.'

91. "The word is due to Boucicault --
92. The theory is his,
93. Where Life becomes a Spasm,
94. And History a Whiz:
95. If that is not Sensation,
96. I don't know what it is,

97. "Now try your hand, ere Fancy
98. Have lost its present glow --"
99. "And then," his grandson added,
100. "We'll publish it, you know:
101. Green cloth -- gold-lettered at the back --
102. In duodecimo!"

103. Then proudly smiled that old man
104. To see the eager lad
105. Rush madly for his pen and ink
106. And for his blotting-pad --
107. But, when he thought of publishing,
108. His face grew stern and sad.
