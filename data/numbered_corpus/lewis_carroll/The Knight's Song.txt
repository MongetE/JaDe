1. I'll tell thee everything I can:
2. There's little to relate.
3. I saw an aged aged man,
4. A-sitting on a gate.
5. 'Who are you, aged man?' I said.
6. 'And how is it you live?'
7. And his answer trickled through my head,
8. Like water through a sieve.
9. He said, 'I look for butterflies
10. That sleep among the wheat:
11. I make them into mutton-pies,
12. And sell them in the street.

13. I sell them unto men,' he said,
14. 'Who sail on stormy seas;
15. And that's the way I get my bread --
16. A trifle, if you please.'
17. But I was thinking of a plan
18. To dye one's whiskers green,
19. And always use so large a fan
20. That they could not be seen.

21. So having no reply to give
22. To what the old man said, I cried
23. 'Come, tell me how you live!'
24. And thumped him on the head.
25. His accents mild took up the tale:

26. He said 'I go my ways,
27. And when I find a mountain-rill,
28. I set it in a blaze;
29. And thence they make a stuff they call
30. Rowland's Macassar-Oil --
31. Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
32. They give me for my toil.'

33. But I was thinking of a way
34. To feed oneself on batter,
35. And so go on from day to day '
36. Getting a little fatter.
37. I shook him well from side to side,
38. Until his face was blue:
39. 'Come, tell me how you live,' I cried,
40. 'And what it is you do!'

41. He said, 'I hunt for haddocks' eyes
42. Among the heather bright,
43. And work them into waistcoat-buttons
44. In the silent night.
45. And these I do not sell for gold
46. Or coin of silvery shine,
47. But for a copper halfpenny,
48. And that will purchase nine.

49. 'I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
50. Or set limed twigs for crabs:
51. I sometimes search the grassy knolls
52. For wheels of Hansom-cabs.
53. And that's the way' (he gave a wink)
54. 'By which I get my wealth --
55. And very gladly will I drink
56. Your Honour's noble health.'

57. I heard him then, for I had just
58. Completed my design
59. To keep the Menai bridge from rust
60. By boiling it in wine.
61. I thanked him much for telling me
62. The way he got his wealth,
63. But chiefly for his wish that he
64. Might drink my noble health.

65. And now, if e'er by chance I put
66. My fingers into glue,
67. Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
68. Into a left-hand shoe,
69. Or if I drop upon my toe
70. A very heavy weight,
71. I weep, for it reminds me so
72. Of that old man I used to know --
73. Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow
74. Whose hair was whiter than the snow,
75. Whose face was very like a crow,
76. With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
77. Who seemed distracted with his woe,
78. Who rocked his body to and fro,
79. And muttered mumblingly and low,
80. As if his mouth were full of dough,
81. Who snorted like a buffalo-
82. That summer evening long ago,
83. A-sitting on a gate.
