1. I painted her a gushing thing,
2. With years about a score;
3. I little thought to find they were
4. A least a dozen more;
5. My fancy gave her eyes of blue,
6. A curly auburn head:
7. I came to find the blue a green,
8. The auburn turned to red.

9. She boxed my ears this morning,
10. They tingled very much;
11. I own that I could wish her
12. A somewhat lighter touch;
13. And if you ask me how
14. Her charms might be improved,
15. I would not have them added to,
16. But just a few removed!

17. She has the bear's ethereal grace,
18. The bland hyaena's laugh,
19. The footstep of the elephant,
20. The neck of a giraffe;
21. I love her still, believe me,
22. Though my heart its passion hides;
23. "She's all my fancy painted her,"
24. But oh! how much besides!
