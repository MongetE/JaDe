1. "WHAT'S this?" I pondered. "Have I slept?
2. Or can I have been drinking?"
3. But soon a gentler feeling crept
4. Upon me, and I sat and wept
5. An hour or so, like winking.

6. "No need for Bones to hurry so!"
7. I sobbed. "In fact, I doubt
8. If it was worth his while to go -
9. And who is Tibbs, I'd like to know,
10. To make such work about?

11. "If Tibbs is anything like me,
12. It's POSSIBLE," I said,
13. "He won't be over-pleased to be
14. Dropped in upon at half-past three,
15. After he's snug in bed.

16. "And if Bones plagues him anyhow -
17. Squeaking and all the rest of it,
18. As he was doing here just now -
19. I prophesy there'll be a row,
20. And Tibbs will have the best of it!"

21. Then, as my tears could never bring
22. The friendly Phantom back,
23. It seemed to me the proper thing
24. To mix another glass, and sing
25. The following Coronach.

26. 'AND ART THOU GONE, BELOVED GHOST?
27. BEST OF FAMILIARS!
28. NAY THEN, FAREWELL, MY DUCKLING ROAST,
29. FAREWELL, FAREWELL, MY TEA AND TOAST,
30. MY MEERSCHAUM AND CIGARS!

31. THE HUES OF LIFE ARE DULL AND GRAY,
32. THE SWEETS OF LIFE INSIPID,
33. WHEN thou, MY CHARMER, ART AWAY -
34. OLD BRICK, OR RATHER, LET ME SAY,
35. OLD PARALLELEPIPED!'

36. Instead of singing Verse the Third,
37. I ceased - abruptly, rather:
38. But, after such a splendid word
39. I felt that it would be absurd
40. To try it any farther.

41. So with a yawn I went my way
42. To seek the welcome downy,
43. And slept, and dreamed till break of day
44. Of Poltergeist and Fetch and Fay
45. And Leprechaun and Brownie!

46. For year I've not been visited
47. By any kind of Sprite;
48. Yet still they echo in my head,
49. Those parting words, so kindly said,
50. "Old Turnip-top, good-night!"
