1. A Mother's breast:
2. Safe refuge from her childish fears,
3. From childish troubles, childish tears,
4. Mists that enshroud her dawning years!
5. see how in sleep she seems to sing
6. A voiceless psalm--an offering
7. Raised, to the glory of her King
8. In Love: for Love is Rest.


9. A Darling's kiss:
10. Dearest of all the signs that fleet
11. From lips that lovingly repeat
12. Again, again, the message sweet!
13. Full to the brim with girlish glee,
14. A child, a very child is she,
15. Whose dream of heaven is still to be
16. At Home: for Home is Bliss.
