1. Low-anchored cloud,
2. Newfoundland air,
3. Fountain-head and source of rivers,
4. Dew-cloth, dream-drapery,
5. And napkin spread by fays;
6. Drifting meadow of the air,
7. Where bloom the daisied banks and violets,
8. And in whose fenny labyrinth
9. The bittern booms and heron wades;
10. Spirit of lakes and seas and rivers,
11. Bear only perfumes and the scent
12. Of healing herbs to just men's fields!
