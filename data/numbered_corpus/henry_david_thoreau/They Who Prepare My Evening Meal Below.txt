1. They who prepare my evening meal below
2. Carelessly hit the kettle as they go
3. With tongs or shovel,
4. And ringing round and round,
5. Out of this hovel
6. It makes an eastern temple by the sound.

7. At first I thought a cow bell right at hand
8. Mid birches sounded o'er the open land,
9. Where I plucked flowers
10. Many years ago,
11. Spending midsummer hours
12. With such secure delight they hardly seemed to flow.
