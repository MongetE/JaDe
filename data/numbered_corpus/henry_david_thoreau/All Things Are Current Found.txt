1. ALL things are current found
2. On earthly ground,
3. Spirits and elements
4. Have their descents.

5. Night and day, year on year,
6. High and low, far and near,
7. These are our own aspects,
8. These are our own regrets.

9. Ye gods of the shore,
10. Who abide evermore,
11. I see you far headland,
12. Stretching on either hand;

13. I hear the sweet evening sounds
14. From your undecaying grounds;
15. Cheat me no more with time,
16. Take me to your clime.
