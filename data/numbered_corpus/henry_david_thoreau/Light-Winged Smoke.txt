1. LIGHT-WINGED Smoke, Icarian bird,
2. Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,
3. Lark without song, and the messenger of dawn,
4. Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;
5. Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form
6. Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;
7. By night star-veiling, and by day
8. Darkening the light and blotting out the sun;
9. Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,
10. And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.
