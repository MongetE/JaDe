1. On fields o'er which the reaper's hand has pass'd
2. Lit by the harvest moon and autumn sun,
3. My thoughts like stubble floating in the wind
4. And of such fineness as October airs,
5. There after harvest could I glean my life
6. A richer harvest reaping without toil,
7. And weaving gorgeous fancies at my will
8. In subtler webs than finest summer haze.
