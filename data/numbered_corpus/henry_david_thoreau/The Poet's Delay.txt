1. IN vain I see the morning rise,
2. In vain observe the western blaze,
3. Who idly look to other skies,
4. Expecting life by other ways.

5. Amidst such boundless wealth without,
6. I only still am poor within,
7. The birds have sung their summer out,
8. But still my spring does not begin.

9. Shall I then wait the autumn wind,
10. Compelled to seek a milder day,
11. And leave no curious nest behind,
12. No woods still echoing to my lay?
