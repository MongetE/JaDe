1. Great God, I ask for no meaner pelf
2. Than that I may not disappoint myself,
3. That in my action I may soar as high
4. As I can now discern with this clear eye.
5. And next in value, which thy kindness lends,
6. That I may greatly disappoint my friends,
7. Howe'er they think or hope that it may be,
8. They may not dream how thou'st distinguished me.

9. That my weak hand may equal my firm faith
10. And my life practice what my tongue saith
11. That my low conduct may not show
12. Nor my relenting lines
13. That I thy purpose did not know
14. Or overrated thy designs.
