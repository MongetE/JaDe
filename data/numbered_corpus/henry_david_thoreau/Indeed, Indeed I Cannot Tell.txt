1. Indeed indeed, I cannot tell,
2. Though I ponder on it well,
3. Which were easier to state,
4. All my love or all my hate.
5. Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me
6. When I say thou dost disgust me.
7. O, I hate thee with a hate
8. That would fain annihilate;
9. Yet sometimes against my will,
10. My dear friend, I love thee still.
11. It were treason to our love,
12. And a sin to God above,
13. One iota to abate
14. Of a pure impartial hate.
