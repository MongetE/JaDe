1. Let such pure hate still underprop
2. Our love, that we may be
3. Each other's conscience,
4. And have our sympathy
5. Mainly from thence.
6. We'll one another treat like gods,
7. And all the faith we have
8. In virtue and in truth, bestow
9. On either, and suspicion leave
10. To gods below.

11. Two solitary stars--
12. Unmeasured systems far
13. Between us roll;
14. But by our conscious light we are
15. Determined to one pole.

16. What need confound the sphere?--
17. Love can afford to wait;
18. For it no hour's too late
19. That witnesseth one duty's end,
20. Or to another doth beginning lend.

21. It will subserve no use,
22. More than the tints of flowers;
23. Only the independent guest
24. Frequents its bowers,
25. Inherits its bequest.

26. No speech, though kind, has it;
27. But kinder silence doles
28. Unto its mates;
29. By night consoles,
30. By day congratulates.

31. What saith the tongue to tongue?
32. What hearest ear of ear?
33. By the decrees of fate
34. From year to year,
35. Does it communicate.

36. Pathless the gulf of feeling yawns;
37. No trivial bridge of words,
38. Or arch of boldest span,
39. Can leap the moat that girds
40. The sincere man.

41. No show of bolts and bars
42. Can keep the foeman out,
43. Or 'scape his secret mine,
44. Who entered with the doubt
45. That drew the line.

46. No warder at the gate
47. Can let the friendly in;
48. But, like the sun, o'er all
49. He will the castle win,
50. And shine along the wall.

51. There's nothing in the world I know
52. That can escape from love,
53. For every depth it goes below,
54. And every height above.
55. It waits, as waits the sky,
56. Until the clouds go by,
57. Yet shines serenely on
58. With an eternal day,
59. Alike when they are gone,
60. And when they stay.

61. Implacable is Love--
62. Foes may be bought or teased
63. From their hostile intent,
64. But he goes unappeased
65. Who is on kindness bent.
