1. I am a parcel of vain strivings tied
2. By a chance bond together,
3. Dangling this way and that, their links
4. Were made so loose and wide,
5. Methinks,
6. For milder weather.

7. A bunch of violets without their roots,
8. And sorrel intermixed,
9. Encircled by a wisp of straw
10. Once coiled about their shoots,
11. The law
12. By which I'm fixed.

13. A nosegay which Time clutched from out
14. Those fair Elysian fields,
15. With weeds and broken stems, in haste,
16. Doth make the rabble rout
17. That waste
18. The day he yields.

19. And here I bloom for a short hour unseen,
20. Drinking my juices up,
21. With no root in the land
22. To keep my branches green,
23. But stand
24. In a bare cup.

25. Some tender buds were left upon my stem
26. In mimicry of life,
27. But ah! the children will not know,
28. Till time has withered them,
29. The woe
30. With which they're rife.

31. But now I see I was not plucked for naught,
32. And after in life's vase
33. Of glass set while I might survive,
34. But by a kind hand brought
35. Alive
36. To a strange place.

37. That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours,
38. And by another year,
39. Such as God knows, with freer air,
40. More fruits and fairer flowers
41. Will bear,
42. While I droop here.
