1. I think awhile of Love, and while I think,
2. Love is to me a world,
3. Sole meat and sweetest drink,
4. And close connecting link
5. Tween heaven and earth.

6. I only know it is, not how or why,
7. My greatest happiness;
8. However hard I try,
9. Not if I were to die,
10. Can I explain.

11. I fain would ask my friend how it can be,
12. But when the time arrives,
13. Then Love is more lovely
14. Than anything to me,
15. And so I'm dumb.

16. For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak,
17. But only thinks and does;
18. Though surely out 'twill leak
19. Without the help of Greek,
20. Or any tongue.

21. A man may love the truth and practise it,
22. Beauty he may admire,
23. And goodness not omit,
24. As much as may befit
25. To reverence.

26. But only when these three together meet,
27. As they always incline,
28. And make one soul the seat,
29. And favorite retreat,
30. Of loveliness;

31. When under kindred shape, like loves and hates
32. And a kindred nature,
33. Proclaim us to be mates,
34. Exposed to equal fates
35. Eternally;

36. And each may other help, and service do,
37. Drawing Love's bands more tight,
38. Service he ne'er shall rue
39. While one and one make two,
40. And two are one;

41. In such case only doth man fully prove
42. Fully as man can do,
43. What power there is in Love
44. His inmost soul to move
45. Resistlessly.

46. ______

47. Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side,
48. Withstand the winter's storm,
49. And spite of wind and tide,
50. Grow up the meadow's pride,
51. For both are strong

52. Above they barely touch, but undermined
53. Down to their deepest source,
54. Admiring you shall find
55. Their roots are intertwined
56. Insep'rably.
