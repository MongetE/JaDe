1. They don't make it
2. the beautiful die in flame-
3. suicide pills, rat poison, rope what-
4. ever...
5. they rip their arms off,
6. throw themselves out of windows,
7. they pull their eyes out of the sockets,
8. reject love
9. reject hate
10. reject, reject.

11. they don't make it
12. the beautiful can't endure,
13. they are butterflies
14. they are doves
15. they are sparrows,
16. they don't make it.

17. one tall shot of flame
18. while the old men play checkers in the park
19. one flame, one good flame
20. while the old men play checkers in the park
21. in the sun.

22. the beautiful are found in the edge of a room
23. crumpled into spiders and needles and silence
24. and we can never understand why they
25. left, they were so
26. beautiful.

27. they don't make it,
28. the beautiful die young
29. and leave the ugly to their ugly lives.

30. lovely and brilliant: life and suicide and death
31. as the old men play checkers in the sun
32. in the park.
