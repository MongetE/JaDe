1. Making love in the sun, in the morning sun
2. in a hotel room
3. above the alley
4. where poor men poke for bottles;
5. making love in the sun
6. making love by a carpet redder than our blood,
7. making love while the boys sell headlines
8. and Cadillacs,
9. making love by a photograph of Paris
10. and an open pack of Chesterfields,
11. making love while other men- poor folks-
12. work.
13. That moment- to this. . .
14. may be years in the way they measure,
15. but it's only one sentence back in my mind-
16. there are so many days
17. when living stops and pulls up and sits
18. and waits like a train on the rails.
19. I pass the hotel at 8
20. and at 5; there are cats in the alleys
21. and bottles and bums,
22. and I look up at the window and think,
23. I no longer know where you are,
24. and I walk on and wonder where
25. the living goes
26. when it stops.
