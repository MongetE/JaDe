1. he lives in a house with a swimming pool
2. and says the job is
3. killing him.
4. he is 27. I am 44. I can’t seem to
5. get rid of
6. him. his novels keep coming
7. back. “what do you expect me to do?” he screams
8. “go to New York and pump the hands of the
9. publishers?”
10. “no,” I tell him, “but quit your job, go into a
11. small room and do the
12. thing.”
13. “but I need ASSURANCE, I need something to
14. go by, some word, some sign!”
15. “some men did not think that way:
16. Van Gogh, Wagner—”
17. “oh hell, Van Gogh had a brother who gave him
18. paints whenever he
19. needed them!”


20. “look,” he said, “I’m over at this broad’s house today and
21. this guy walks in. a salesman. you know
22. how they talk. drove up in this new
23. car. talked about his vacation. said he went to
24. Frisco—saw Fidelio up there but forgot who
25. wrote it. now this guy is 54 years
26. old. so I told him: ‘Fidelio is Beethoven’s only
27. opera.’ and then I told
28. him: ‘you’re a jerk!’ ‘whatcha mean?’ he
29. asked. ‘I mean, you’re a jerk, you’re 54 years old and
30. you don’t know anything!’”


31. “what happened
32. then?”
33. “I walked out.”
34. “you mean you left him there with
35. her?”
36. “yes.”


37. “I can’t quit my job,” he said. “I always have trouble getting a
38. job. I walk in, they look at me, listen to me talk and
39. they think right away, ah ha! he’s too intelligent for
40. this job, he won’t stay
41. so there’s really no sense in hiring
42. him.
43. now, YOU walk into a place and you don’t have any trouble:
44. you look like an old wino, you look like a guy who needs a
45. job and they look at you and they think:
46. ah ha!: now here’s a guy who really needs work! if we hire
47. him he’ll stay a long time and work
48. HARD!”


49. “do any of those people,” he asks “know you are a
50. writer, that you write poetry?”
51. “no.”
52. “you never talk about
53. it. not even to
54. me! if I hadn’t seen you in that magazine I’d
55. have never known.”
56. “that’s right.”
57. “still, I’d like to tell these people that you are a
58. writer.”
59. “I’d still like to
60. tell them.”
61. “why?”
62. “well, they talk about you. they think you are just a
63. horseplayer and a drunk.”
64. “I am both of those.”
65. “well, they talk about you. you have odd ways. you travel alone.
66. I’m the only friend you
67. have.”
68. “yes.”
69. “they talk you down. I’d like to defend you. I’d like to tell
70. them you write
71. poetry.”
72. “leave it alone. I work here like they
73. do. we’re all the same.”
74. “well, I’d like to do it for myself then. I want them to know why
75. I travel with
76. you. I speak 7 languages, I know my music—”
77. “forget it.”
78. “all right, I’ll respect your
79. wishes. but there’s something else—”
80. “what?”
81. “I’ve been thinking about getting a
82. piano. but then I’ve been thinking about getting a
83. violin too but I can’t make up my
84. mind!”
85. “buy a piano.”
86. “you think
87. so?”
88. “yes.”


89. he walks away
90. thinking about
91. it.


92. I was thinking about it
93. too: I figure he can always come over with his
94. violin and more
95. sad music.
