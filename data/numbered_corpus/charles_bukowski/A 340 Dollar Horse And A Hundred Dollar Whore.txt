1. don’t ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me
2. at the racetrack any day half drunk
3. betting quarters, sidewheelers and straight thoroughs,
4. but let me tell you, there are some women there
5. who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you
6. look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores
7. you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke
8. dealing out so much breast and ass and the way
9. it’s all hung together, you look and you look and
10. you look and you can’t believe it; there are ordinary women
11. and then there is something else that wants to make you
12. tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven
13. across the back of the john; anyhow, the season
14. was dragging and the big boys were getting busted,
15. all the non-pros, the producers, the cameraman,
16. the pushers of Mary, the fur salesman, the owners
17. themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day:
18. a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close;
19. he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly
20. and 35 to 1, and I put a ten down on him.
21. the driver broke him wide
22. took him out by the fence where he’d be alone
23. even if he had to travel four times as far,
24. and that’s the way he went it
25. all the way by the outer fence
26. traveling two miles in one
27. and he won like he was mad as hell
28. and he wasn’t even tired,
29. and the biggest blonde of all
30. all ass and breast, hardly anything else
31. went to the payoff window with me.


32. that night I couldn’t destroy her
33. although the springs shot sparks
34. and they pounded on the walls.
35. later she sat there in her slip
36. drinking Old Grandad
37. and she said
38. what’s a guy like you doing
39. living in a dump like this?
40. and I said
41. I’m a poet


42. and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed.


43. you? you . . . a poet?


44. I guess you’re right, I said, I guess you’re right.


45. but still she looked good to me, she still looked good,
46. and all thanks to an ugly horse
47. who wrote this poem.
