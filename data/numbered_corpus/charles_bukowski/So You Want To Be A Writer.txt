1. if it doesn't come bursting out of you
2. in spite of everything,
3. don't do it.
4. unless it comes unasked out of your
5. heart and your mind and your mouth
6. and your gut,
7. don't do it.
8. if you have to sit for hours
9. staring at your computer screen
10. or hunched over your
11. typewriter
12. searching for words,
13. don't do it.
14. if you're doing it for money or
15. fame,
16. don't do it.
17. if you're doing it because you want
18. women in your bed,
19. don't do it.
20. if you have to sit there and
21. rewrite it again and again,
22. don't do it.
23. if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,
24. don't do it.
25. if you're trying to write like somebody
26. else,
27. forget about it.
28. if you have to wait for it to roar out of
29. you,
30. then wait patiently.
31. if it never does roar out of you,
32. do something else.

33. if you first have to read it to your wife
34. or your girlfriend or your boyfriend
35. or your parents or to anybody at all,
36. you're not ready.

37. don't be like so many writers,
38. don't be like so many thousands of
39. people who call themselves writers,
40. don't be dull and boring and
41. pretentious, don't be consumed with self-
42. love.
43. the libraries of the world have
44. yawned themselves to
45. sleep
46. over your kind.
47. don't add to that.
48. don't do it.
49. unless it comes out of
50. your soul like a rocket,
51. unless being still would
52. drive you to madness or
53. suicide or murder,
54. don't do it.
55. unless the sun inside you is
56. burning your gut,
57. don't do it.

58. when it is truly time,
59. and if you have been chosen,
60. it will do it by
61. itself and it will keep on doing it
62. until you die or it dies in you.

63. there is no other way.

64. and there never was.
