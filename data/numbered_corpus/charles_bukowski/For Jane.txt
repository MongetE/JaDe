1. 225 days under grass
2. and you know more than I.
3. they have long taken your blood,
4. you are a dry stick in a basket.
5. is this how it works?
6. in this room
7. the hours of love
8. still make shadows.

9. when you left
10. you took almost
11. everything.
12. I kneel in the nights
13. before tigers
14. that will not let me be.

15. what you were
16. will not happen again.
17. the tigers have found me
18. and I do not care.
