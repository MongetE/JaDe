1. I reached up into the top of the closet
2. and took out a pair of blue panties
3. and showed them to her and
4. asked 'are these yours? '
5. and she looked and said,
6. 'no, those belong to a dog.'
7. she left after that and I haven't seen
8. her since. she's not at her place.
9. I keep going there, leaving notes stuck
10. into the door. I go back and the notes
11. are still there. I take the Maltese cross
12. cut it down from my car mirror, tie it
13. to her doorknob with a shoelace, leave
14. a book of poems.
15. when I go back the next night everything
16. is still there.
17. I keep searching the streets for that
18. blood-wine battleship she drives
19. with a weak battery, and the doors
20. hanging from broken hinges.
21. I drive around the streets
22. an inch away from weeping,
23. ashamed of my sentimentality and
24. possible love.
25. a confused old man driving in the rain
26. wondering where the good luck
27. went.
