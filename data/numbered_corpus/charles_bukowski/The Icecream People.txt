1. the lady has me temporarily off the bottle
2. and now the pecker stands up
3. better.
4. however, things change overnight--
5. instead of listening to Shostakovich and
6. Mozart through a smeared haze of smoke
7. the nights change, new
8. complexities:
9. we drive to Baskin-Robbins,
10. 31 flavors:
11. Rocky Road, Bubble Gum, Apricot Ice, Strawberry
12. Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint...

13. we park outside and look at icecream
14. people
15. a very healthy and satisfied people,
16. nary a potential suicide in sight
17. (they probably even vote)
18. and I tell her
19. "what if the boys saw me go in there? suppose they
20. find out I'm going in for a walnut peach sundae?"
21. "come on, chicken," she laughs and we go in
22. and stand with the icecream people.
23. none of them are cursing or threatening
24. the clerks.
25. there seem to be no hangovers or
26. grievances.
27. I am alarmed at the placid and calm wave
28. that flows about. I feel like a leper in a
29. beauty contest. we finally get our sundaes and
30. sit in the car and eat them.

31. I must admit they are quite good. a curious new
32. world. (all my friends tell me I am looking
33. better. "you're looking good, man, we thought you
34. were going to die there for a while...")
35. --those 4,500 dark nights, the jails, the
36. hospitals...

37. and later that night
38. there is use for the pecker, use for
39. love, and it is glorious,
40. long and true,
41. and afterwards we speak of easy things;
42. our heads by the open window with the moonlight
43. looking through, we sleep in each other's
44. arms.

45. the icecream people make me feel good,
46. inside and out.
