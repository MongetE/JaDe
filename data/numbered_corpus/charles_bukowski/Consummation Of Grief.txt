1. I even hear the mountains
2. the way they laugh
3. up and down their blue sides
4. and down in the water
5. the fish cry
6. and the water
7. is their tears.
8. I listen to the water
9. on nights I drink away
10. and the sadness becomes so great
11. I hear it in my clock
12. it becomes knobs upon my dresser
13. it becomes paper on the floor
14. it becomes a shoehorn
15. a laundry ticket
16. it becomes
17. cigarette smoke
18. climbing a chapel of dark vines. . .
19. it matters little
20. very little love is not so bad
21. or very little life
22. what counts
23. is waiting on walls
24. I was born for this
25. I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.
