1. I can see myself now
2. after all these suicide days and nights,
3. being wheeled out of one of those sterile rest homes
4. (of course, this is only if I get famous and lucky)
5. by a subnormal and bored nurse
6. there I am sitting upright in my wheelchair
7. almost blind, eyes rolling backward into the dark part of my skull
8. looking
9. for the mercy of death
10. Isn't it a lovely day, Mr. Bukowski
11. O, yeah, yeah
12. the children walk past and I don't even exist
13. and lovely women walk by
14. with big hot hips
15. and warm buttocks and tight hot everything
16. praying to be loved
17. and I don't even
18. exist
19. It's the first sunlight we've had in 3 days,
20. Mr. Bukowski.
21. Oh, yeah, yeah.
22. there I am sitting upright in my wheelchair,
23. myself whiter than this sheet of paper,
24. bloodless,
25. brain gone, gamble gone, me, Bukowski,
26. gone
27. Isn't it a lovely day, Mr. Bukowski
28. O, yeah, yeah pissing in my pajamas, slop drooling out of
29. my mouth.
30. 2 young schoolboys run by â€”
31. Hey, did you see that old guy
32. Christ, yes, he made me sick!
33. after all the threats to do so
34. somebody else has committed suicide for me
35. at last.
36. the nurse stops the wheelchair, breaks a rose from a nearby bush,
37. puts it in my hand.
38. I don't even know
39. what it is. it might as well be my pecker
40. for all the good
41. it does.
