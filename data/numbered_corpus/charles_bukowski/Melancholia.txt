1. the history of melancholia
2. includes all of us.

3. me, I writhe in dirty sheets
4. while staring at blue walls
5. and nothing.

6. I have gotten so used to melancholia
7. that
8. I greet it like an old
9. friend.

10. I will now do 15 minutes of grieving
11. for the lost redhead,
12. I tell the gods.

13. I do it and feel quite bad
14. quite sad,
15. then I rise
16. CLEANSED
17. even though nothing
18. is solved.

19. that’s what I get for kicking
20. religion in the ass.

21. I should have kicked the redhead
22. in the ass
23. where her brains and her bread and
24. butter are
25. at …

26. but, no, I’ve felt sad
27. about everything:
28. the lost redhead was just another
29. smash in a lifelong
30. loss …

31. I listen to drums on the radio now
32. and grin.
33. there is something wrong with me
34. besides
35. melancholia.
