1. They are building a house
2. half a block down
3. and I sit up here
4. with the shades down
5. listening to the sounds,
6. the hammers pounding in nails,
7. thack thack thack thack,
8. and then I hear birds,
9. and thack thack thack,
10. and I go to bed,
11. I pull the covers to my throat;
12. they have been building this house
13. for a month, and soon it will have
14. its people...sleeping, eating,
15. loving, moving around,
16. but somehow
17. now
18. it is not right,
19. there seems a madness,
20. men walk on top with nails
21. in their mouths
22. and I read about Castro and Cuba,
23. and at night I walk by
24. and the ribs of the house show
25. and inside I can see cats walking
26. the way cats walk,
27. and then a boy rides by on a bicycle
28. and still the house is not done
29. and in the morning the men
30. will be back
31. walking around on the house
32. with their hammers,
33. and it seems people should not build houses
34. anymore,
35. it seems people should not get married
36. anymore,
37. it seems people should stop working
38. and sit in small rooms
39. on 2nd floors
40. under electric lights without shades;
41. it seems there is a lot to forget
42. and a lot not to do,
43. and in drugstores, markets, bars,
44. the people are tired, they do not want
45. to move, and I stand there at night
46. and look through this house and the
47. house does not want to be built;
48. through its sides I can see the purple hills
49. and the first lights of evening,
50. and it is cold
51. and I button my coat
52. and I stand there looking through the house
53. and the cats stop and look at me
54. until I am embarrased
55. and move North up the sidewalk
56. where I will buy
57. cigarettes and beer
58. and return to my room.
