1. stuck in the rain on the freeway, 6:15 p.m.,
2. these are the lucky ones, these are the
3. dutifully employed, most with their radios on as loud
4. as possible as they try not to think or remember.

5. this is our new civilization: as men
6. once lived in trees and caves now they live
7. in their automobiles and on freeways as

8. the local news is heard again and again while
9. we shift from first gear to second and back to first.

10. there's a poor fellow stalled in the fast lane ahead, hood
11. up, he's standing against the freeway fence
12. a newspaper over his head in the rain.

13. the other cars force their way around his car, pull out into
14. the next lane in front of cars determined to shut them off.

15. in the lane to my right a driver is being followed by a
16. police car with blinking red and blue lights - he surely
17. can't be speeding as

18. suddenly the rain comes down in a giant wash and all the
19. cars stop and

20. even with the windows up I can smell somebody's clutch
21. burning.

22. I just hope it's not mine as

23. the wall of water diminishes and we go back into first
24. gear; we are all still
25. a long way from home as I memorize
26. the silhouette of the car in front of me and the shape of the

27. driver's head or
28. what
29. I can see of it above the headrest while
30. his bumper sticker asks me
31. HAVE YOU HUGGED YOUR KID TODAY?

32. suddenly I have an urge to scream
33. as another wall of water comes down and the
34. man on the radio announces that there will be a 70 percent
35. chance of showers tomorrow night
