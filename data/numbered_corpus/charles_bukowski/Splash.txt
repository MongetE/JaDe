1. the illusion is that you are simply
2. reading this poem.
3. the reality is that this is
4. more than a
5. poem.
6. this is a beggar's knife.
7. this is a tulip.
8. this is a soldier marching
9. through Madrid.
10. this is you on your
11. death bed.
12. this is Li Po laughing
13. underground.
14. this is not a god-damned
15. poem.
16. this is a horse asleep.
17. a butterfly in
18. your brain.
19. this is the devil's
20. circus.
21. you are not reading this
22. on a page.
23. the page is reading
24. you.
25. feel it?
26. it's like a cobra. it's a hungry eagle circling the room.

27. this is not a poem. poems are dull,
28. they make you sleep.

29. these words force you
30. to a new
31. madness.

32. you have been blessed, you have been pushed into a
33. blinding area of
34. light.

35. the elephant dreams
36. with you
37. now.
38. the curve of space
39. bends and
40. laughs.

41. you can die now.
42. you can die now as
43. people were meant to
44. die:
45. great,
46. victorious,
47. hearing the music,
48. being the music,
49. roaring,
50. roaring,
51. roaring.
