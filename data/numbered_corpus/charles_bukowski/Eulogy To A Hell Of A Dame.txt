1. some dogs who sleep At night
2. must dream of bones
3. and I remember your bones
4. in flesh
5. and best
6. in that dark green dress
7. and those high-heeled bright
8. black shoes,
9. you always cursed when you drank,
10. your hair coming down you
11. wanted to explode out of
12. what was holding you:
13. rotten memories of a
14. rotten
15. past, and
16. you finally got
17. out
18. by dying,
19. leaving me with the
20. rotten
21. present;
22. you've been dead
23. 28 years
24. yet I remember you
25. better than any of
26. the rest;
27. you were the only one
28. who understood
29. the futility of the
30. arrangement of
31. life;
32. all the others were only
33. displeased with
34. trivial segments,
35. carped
36. nonsensically about
37. nonsense;
38. Jane, you were
39. killed by
40. knowing too much.
41. here's a drink
42. to your bones
43. that
44. this dog
45. still
46. dreams about.
