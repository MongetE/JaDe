1. poetry readings have to be some of the saddest
2. damned things ever,
3. the gathering of the clansmen and clanladies,
4. week after week, month after month, year
5. after year,
6. getting old together,
7. reading on to tiny gatherings,
8. still hoping their genius will be
9. discovered,
10. making tapes together, discs together,
11. sweating for applause
12. they read basically to and for
13. each other,
14. they can't find a New York publisher
15. or one
16. within miles,
17. but they read on and on
18. in the poetry holes of America,
19. never daunted,
20. never considering the possibility that
21. their talent might be
22. thin, almost invisible,
23. they read on and on
24. before their mothers, their sisters, their husbands,
25. their wives, their friends, the other poets
26. and the handful of idiots who have wandered
27. in
28. from nowhere.

29. I am ashamed for them,
30. I am ashamed that they have to bolster each other,
31. I am ashamed for their lisping egos,
32. their lack of guts.

33. if these are our creators,
34. please, please give me something else:

35. a drunken plumber at a bowling alley,
36. a prelim boy in a four rounder,
37. a jock guiding his horse through along the
38. rail,
39. a bartender on last call,
40. a waitress pouring me a coffee,
41. a drunk sleeping in a deserted doorway,
42. a dog munching a dry bone,
43. an elephant's fart in a circus tent,
44. a 6 p.m. freeway crush,
45. the mailman telling a dirty joke

46. anything
47. anything
48. but
49. these.
