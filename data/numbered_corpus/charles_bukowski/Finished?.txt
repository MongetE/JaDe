1. the critics now have me
2. drinking champagne and
3. driving a BMW
4. and also married to a
5. socialite from
6. Philadelphia's Main Line
7. which of course is going to prevent me
8. from writing my earthy
9. and grubby stuff.
10. and they might be
11. right,
12. I could be getting to be
13. more like them,
14. and that's as close to
15. death as you can
16. get.

17. we'll see.
18. but don't bury me yet.
19. don't worry if I drink with
20. Sean Penn.
21. just measure the poems
22. as they come off the
23. keyboard.
24. listen only to them.
25. after this long fight
26. I have no intention of
27. quitting short.
28. or late.
29. or satisfied.
