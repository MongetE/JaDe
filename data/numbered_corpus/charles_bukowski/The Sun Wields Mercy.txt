1. and the sun wields mercy
2. but like a jet torch carried to high,
3. and the jets whip across its sight
4. and rockets leap like toads,
5. and the boys get out the maps
6. and pin-cushion the moon,
7. old green cheese,
8. no life there but too much on earth:
9. our unwashed India boys
10. crossing their legs,playing pipes,
11. starving with sucked in bellies,
12. watching the snakes volute
13. like beautiful women in the hungry air;
14. the rockets leap,
15. the rockets leap like hares,
16. clearing clump and dog
17. replacing out-dated bullets;
18. the Chinese still carve
19. in jade,quietly stuffing rice
20. into their hunger, a hunger
21. a thousand years old,
22. their muddy rivers moving with fire
23. and song, barges, houseboats
24. pushed by drifting poles
25. of waiting without wanting;
26. in Turkey they face the East
27. on their carpets
28. praying to a purple god
29. who smokes and laughs
30. and sticks fingers in their eyes
31. blinding them, as gods will do;
32. but the rockets are ready: peace is no longer,
33. for some reason,precious;
34. madness drifts like lily pads
35. on a pond circling senselessly;
36. the painters paint dipping
37. their reds and greens and yellows,
38. poets rhyme their loneliness,
39. musicians starve as always
40. and the novelists miss the mark,
41. but not the pelican , the gull;
42. pelicans dip and dive, rise,
43. shaking shocked half-dead
44. radioactive fish from their beaks;
45. indeed, indeed, the waters wash
46. the rocks with slime; and on wall st.
47. the market staggers like a lost drunk
48. looking for his key; ah,
49. this will be a good one,by God:
50. it will take us back to the
51. sabre-teeth, the winged monkey
52. scrabbling in pits over bits
53. of helmet, instrument and glass;
54. a lightning crashes across
55. the window and in a million rooms
56. lovers lie entwined and lost
57. and sick as peace;
58. the sky still breaks red and orange for the
59. painters-and for the lovers,
60. flowers open as they always have
61. opened but covered with thin dust
62. of rocket fuel and mushrooms,
63. poison mushrooms; it's a bad time,
64. a dog-sick time-curtain
65. act 3, standing room only,
66. SOLD OUT, SOLD OUT, SOLD OUT again,
67. by god,by somebody and something,
68. by rockets and generals and
69. leaders, by poets , doctors, comedians,
70. by manufacturers of soup
71. and biscuits, Janus-faced hucksters
72. of their own indexterity;
73. I can now see now the coal-slick
74. contaminated fields, a snail or 2,
75. bile, obsidian, a fish or 3
76. in the shallows, an obloquy of our
77. source and our sight.....
78. has this happened before? is history
79. a circle that catches itself by the tail,
80. a dream, a nightmare,
81. a general's dream, a presidents dream,
82. a dictators dream...
83. can't we awaken?
84. or are the forces of life greater than we are?
85. can't we awaken? must we forever,
86. dear friends, die in our sleep?
