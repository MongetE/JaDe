1. I'll settle for the 6 horse
2. on a rainy afternoon
3. a paper cup of coffee
4. in my hand
5. a little way to go,
6. the wind twirling out
7. small wrens from
8. the upper grandstand roof,
9. the jocks coming out
10. for a middle race
11. silent
12. and the easy rain making
13. everything
14. at once
15. almost alike,
16. the horses at peace with
17. each other
18. before the drunken war
19. and I am under the grandstand
20. feeling for
21. cigarettes
22. settling for coffee,
23. then the horses walk by
24. taking their little men
25. away-
26. it is funereal and graceful
27. and glad
28. like the opening
29. of flowers.
