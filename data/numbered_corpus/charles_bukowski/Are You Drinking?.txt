1. washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook
2. out again
3. I write from the bed
4. as I did last
5. year.
6. will see the doctor,
7. Monday.
8. "yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-
9. aches and my back
10. hurts."
11. "are you drinking?" he will ask.
12. "are you getting your
13. exercise, your
14. vitamins?"
15. I think that IÂ am just ill
16. with life, the same stale yet
17. fluctuating
18. factors.
19. even at the track
20. I watch the horses run by
21. and it seems
22. meaningless.
23. I leave early after buying tickets on the
24. remaining races.
25. "taking off?" asks the motel
26. clerk.
27. "yes, it's boring,"
28. I tell him.
29. "If you think it's boring
30. out there," he tells me, "you oughta be
31. back here."
32. so here I am
33. propped up against my pillows
34. again
35. just an old guy
36. just an old writer
37. with a yellow
38. notebook.
39. something is
40. walking across the
41. floor
42. toward
43. me.
44. oh, it's just
45. my cat
46. this
47. time.
