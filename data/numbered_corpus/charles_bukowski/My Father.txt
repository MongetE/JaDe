1. was a truly amazing man
2. he pretended to be
3. rich
4. even though we lived on beans and mush and weenies
5. when we sat down to eat, he said,
6. "not everybody can eat like this."

7. and because he wanted to be rich or because he actually
8. thought he was rich
9. he always voted Republican
10. and he voted for Hoover against Roosevelt
11. and he lost
12. and then he voted for Alf Landon against Roosevelt
13. and he lost again
14. saying, "I don't know what this world is coming to,
15. now we've got that god damned Red in there again
16. and the Russians will be in our backyard next!"

17. I think it was my father who made me decide to
18. become a bum.
19. I decided that if a man like that wants to be rich
20. then I want to be poor.

21. and I became a bum.
22. I lived on nickles and dimes and in cheap rooms and
23. on park benches.
24. I thought maybe the bums knew something.

25. but I found out that most of the bums wanted to be
26. rich too.
27. they had just failed at that.

28. so caught between my father and the bums
29. I had no place to go
30. and I went there fast and slow.
31. never voted Republican
32. never voted.

33. buried him
34. like an oddity of the earth
35. like a hundred thousand oddities
36. like millions of other oddities,
37. wasted.
