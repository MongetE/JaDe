1. this man used to be an
2. interesting writer,
3. he was able to say brisk and
4. refreshing things.
5. at the time
6. I suggested to the editors and
7. the critics that he was one to
8. be watched
9. and also that he had hardly yet been
10. noticed
11. and that he certainly should now be
12. noticed.
13. this writer used some of my
14. remarks as blurbs for his
15. books, which I didn't
16. mind.
17. all of his publications were little
18. chapbooks, 16 to
19. pages,
20. mimeographed.
21. they came out at a
22. rapid rate,
23. perhaps three or four a
24. year.
25. the problem was that each
26. chapbook seemed a little weaker
27. than the one that preceded
28. it
29. but he continued to use my old
30. blurbs.
31. my wife noticed the change
32. in his writing
33. too.
34. 'what's happened to his
35. writing?' she asked me.
36. 'he's doing too much of it, he's
37. pushing it out, forcing it.'
38. 'this stuff is bad, you ought to
39. tell him to stop using your
40. blurbs.'
41. 'I can't do that, I just wish he
42. wouldn't publish so much.'
43. 'well, you publish all the
44. time too.'
45. 'with me,' I told her, 'it's
46. different.'

47. yesterday I received another of his
48. little chapbooks
49. with his delicate dedication scrawled
50. on the title page.
51. this latest effort was totally
52. flat.
53. the words just fell off the
54. page,
55. dead on
56. arrival.

57. where had he gone?

58. too much ambition?
59. too much just doing it for the sake
60. of doing it?
61. just not waiting for the words to
62. pile up inside and then
63. explode of their own
64. volition?

65. I decided then I should take a whole week
66. off,
67. be on the safe side,
68. just shut the computer down,
69. forget the whole damned silly
70. business
71. for awhile.

72. as I said, that was
73. yesterday.
