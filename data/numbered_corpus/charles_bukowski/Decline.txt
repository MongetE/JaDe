1. naked along the side of the house,
2. 8 a.m., spreading sesame seed oil
3. over my body, Jesus, have I come
4. to this?
5. I once battled in dark alleys for a
6. laugh.
7. now I'm not laughing.
8. I splash myself with oil and wonder,
9. how many years do you want?
10. how many days?
11. my blood is soiled and a dark
12. angel sits in my brain.
13. things are made of something and
14. go to nothing.
15. I understand the fall of cities, of
16. nations.
17. a small plane passes overhead.
18. I look upward as if it made sense to
19. look upward.
20. it's true, the sky has rotted:
21. it won't be long for any of
22. us.
