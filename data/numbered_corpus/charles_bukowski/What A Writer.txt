1. what i liked about e.e. cummings
2. was that he cut away from
3. the holiness of the
4. word
5. and with charm
6. and gamble
7. gave us lines
8. that sliced through the
9. dung.

10. how it was needed!
11. how we were withering
12. away
13. in the old
14. tired
15. manner.

16. of course, then came all
17. the e.e. cummings
18. copyists.
19. they copied him then
20. as the others had
21. copied Keats, Shelly,
22. Swinburne, Byron, et
23. al.

24. but there was only
25. one
26. e.e. cummings.
27. of course.

28. one sun.

29. one moon.
