1. sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think,
2. I'm not going to make it, but you laugh inside
3. remembering all the times you've felt that way, and
4. you walk to the bathroom, do your toilet, see that face
5. in the mirror, oh my oh my oh my, but you comb your hair anyway,
6. get into your street clothes, feed the cats, fetch the
7. newspaper of horror, place it on the coffee table, kiss your
8. wife goodbye, and then you are backing the car out into life itself,
9. like millions of others you enter the arena once more.

10. you are on the freeway threading through traffic now,
11. moving both towards something and towards nothing at all as you punch
12. the radio on and get Mozart, which is something, and you will somehow
13. get through the slow days and the busy days and the dull
14. days and the hateful days and the rare days, all both so delightful
15. and so disappointing because
16. we are all so alike and so different.

17. you find the turn-off, drive through the most dangerous
18. part of town, feel momentarily wonderful as Mozart works
19. his way into your brain and slides down along your bones and
20. out through your shoes.

21. it's been a tough fight worth fighting
22. as we all drive along
23. betting on another day.
