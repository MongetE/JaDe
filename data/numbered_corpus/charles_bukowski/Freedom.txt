1. he drank wine all night of the
2. 28th, and he kept thinking of her:
3. the way she walked and talked and loved
4. the way she told him things that seemed true
5. but were not, and he knew the color of each
6. of her dresses
7. and her shoes-he knew the stock and curve of
8. each heel
9. as well as the leg shaped by it.

10. and she was out again and when he came home,and
11. she'd come back with that special stink again,
12. and she did
13. she came in at 3 a.m in the morning
14. filthy like a dung eating swine
15. and
16. he took out a butchers knife
17. and she screamed
18. backing into the rooming house wall
19. still pretty somehow
20. in spite of love's reek
21. and he finished the glass of wine.

22. that yellow dress
23. his favorite
24. and she screamed again.

25. and he took up the knife
26. and unhooked his belt
27. and tore away the cloth before her
28. and cut off his balls.

29. and carried them in his hands
30. like apricots
31. and flushed them down the
32. toilet bowl
33. and she kept screaming
34. as the room became red

35. GOD O GOD!
36. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

37. and he sat there holding 3 towels
38. between his legs
39. no caring now whether she left or
40. stayed
41. wore yellow or green or
42. anything at all.

43. and one hand holding and one hand
44. lifting he poured
45. another wine
