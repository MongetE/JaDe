1. when I look back now

2. at the abuse I took from

3. her

4. I feel shame that I was so

5. innocent,

6. but I must say

7. she did match me drink for

8. drink,

9. and I realized that her life

10. her feelings for things

11. had been ruined

12. along the way

13. and that I was no mare than a

14. temporary

15. companion;

16. she was ten years older

17. and mortally hurt by the past

18. and the present;

19. she treated me badly:

20. desertion, other

21. men;

22. she brought me immense

23. pain,

24. continually;

25. s he lied, stole;

26. there was desertion,

27. other men,

28. yet we had our moments; and

29. our little soap opera ended

30. with her in a coma

31. in the hospital,

32. and I sat at her bed

33. for hours

34. talking to her,

35. and then she opened her eyes

36. and saw me:

37. "I knew it would be you,"

38. she said.

39. then hse closed her

40. eyes.


41. the next day she was

42. dead.


43. I drank alone

44. for two years

45. after that.
