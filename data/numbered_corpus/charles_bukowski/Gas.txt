1. my grandmother had a serious gas
2. problem.
3. we only saw her on Sunday.
4. she'd sit down to dinner
5. and she'd have gas.
6. she was very heavy,
7. 80 years old.
8. wore this large glass brooch,
9. that's what you noticed most
10. in addition to the gas.
11. she'd let it go just as food was being served.
12. she'd let it go in bursts
13. spaced about a minute apart.
14. she'd let it go
15. 4 or 5 times
16. as we reached for the potatoes
17. poured the gravy
18. cut into the meat.

19. nobody ever said anything,
20. especially me.
21. I was 6 years old.
22. only my grandmother spoke.
23. after 4 or 5 blasts
24. she would say in an offhand way,
25. 'I'll bury you all!'

26. I didn't much like that:
27. first farting
28. then saying that.

29. it happened every Sunday.
30. she was my father's mother.

31. every Sunday it was death and gas
32. and mashed potatoes and gravy
33. and that big glass brooch.

34. those Sunday dinners would
35. always end with apple pie and
36. ice cream
37. and a big argument
38. about something or other,
39. my grandmother finally running out the door
40. and taking the red train back to
41. Pasadena
42. the place stinking for an hour
43. and my father walking about
44. fanning a newspaper in the air and
45. saying, 'it's all that damned sauerkraut
46. she eats!'
