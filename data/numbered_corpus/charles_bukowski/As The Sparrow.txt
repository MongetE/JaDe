1. To give life you must take life,
2. and as our grief falls flat and hollow
3. upon the billion-blooded sea
4. I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
5. with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures
6. lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.
7. Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow
8. did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be
9. young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.
10. I hated you when it would have taken less courage
11. to love.
