1. majestic, majic
2. infinite
3. my little girl is
4. sun
5. on the carpet-
6. out the door
7. picking a flower, ha!
8. an old man,
9. battle-wrecked,
10. emerges from his
11. chair
12. and she looks at me
13. but only sees
14. love,
15. ha!, and I become
16. quick with the world
17. and love right back
18. just like I was meant
19. to do.
