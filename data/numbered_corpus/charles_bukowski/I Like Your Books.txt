1. In the betting line the other
2. day
3. man behind me asked,
4. "are you Henry
5. Chinaski?"

6. "uh huh," I answered.

7. "I like your books," he went
8. on.

9. "thanks," I answered.

10. "who do you like in this
11. race?" he asked.

12. "uh uh," I answered.

13. "I like the 4 horse," he
14. told me.

15. I made my bet and went back
16. to my seat....

17. the next race I am standing in
18. line and here is this same man
19. standing behind me
20. again.
21. there are at least 50 lines at
22. the windows but
23. he has to find mine
24. again.

25. "I think this race favors the
26. closers," he said to the back of
27. my neck. "the track looks
28. heavy."

29. "listen," I said, not looking
30. around, "it's the kiss of death to
31. talk about horses at the
32. track..."

33. "what kind of rule is that?"
34. he asked. "God doesn't make
35. rules..."

36. I turned around and looked at him:
37. "maybe not, but I
38. do."

39. after the next race
40. I got in line, glanced behind
41. me:
42. he was not there:

43. lost another reader.

44. I lose 2 or 3 each
45. week.

46. fine.

47. let 'em go back to
48. Kafka.
