1. I read last Saturday in the
2. redwoods outside of Santa Cruz
3. and I was about 3/4's finished
4. when I heard a long high scream
5. and a quite attractive
6. young girl came running toward me
7. long gown & divine eyes of fire
8. and she leaped up on the stage
9. and screamed: "I WANT YOU!
10. I WANT YOU! TAKE  ME! TAKE
11. ME!"
12. I told her, "look, get the hell
13. away from me."
14. but she kept tearing at my
15. clothing and throwing herself
16. at me.
17. "where were you," I
18. asked her, "when I was living
19. on one candy bar a day and
20. sending short stories to the
21. Atlantic Monthly?"
22. she grabbed my balls and almost
23. twisted them off. her kisses
24. tasted like shitsoup.
25. 2 women jumped up on the stage
26. and
27. carried her off into the
28. woods.
29. I could still hear her screams
30. as I began the next poem.
31. mabye, I thought, I should have
32. taken her on stage in front
33. of all those eyes.
34. but one can never be sure
35. whether it's good poetry or
36. bad acid.
