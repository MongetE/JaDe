1. I was fairly drunk when it
2. began and I took out my bottle and used it
3. along the way. I was reading a week or two after
4. Kandel and I did not look quite as
5. pretty but
6. I brought it off and we
7. ended up at the Webbs, 6, 8, 10 of
8. us, and I drank scotch, wine, beer, tequila
9. and noticed a nice one sitting next to me -
10. one tooth missing when she smiled,
11. lovely, and I put my arm around her
12. and began loading her with bullshit. when I awakened at 10 a.m. the next morning
13. I was in a strange house
14. in bed with this
15. woman. she was asleep but looked
16. familiar.
