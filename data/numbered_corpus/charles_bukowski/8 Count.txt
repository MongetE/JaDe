1. from my bed
2. I watch
3. 3 birds
4. on a telephone
5. wire.
6. one flies
7. off.
8. then
9. another.
10. one is left,
11. then
12. it too
13. is gone.
14. my typewriter is
15. tombstone
16. still.
17. and I am
18. reduced to bird
19. watching.
20. just thought I'd
21. let you
22. know,
23. fucker.
