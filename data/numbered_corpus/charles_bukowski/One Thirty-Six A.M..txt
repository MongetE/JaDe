1. I laugh sometimes when I think about
2. say
3. Céline at a typewriter
4. or Dostoevsky...
5. or Hamsun...
6. ordinary men with feet, ears, eyes,
7. ordinary men with hair on their heads
8. sitting there typing words
9. while having difficulties with life
10. while being puzzled almost to madness.

11. Dostoevsky gets up
12. he leaves the machine to piss,
13. comes back
14. drinks a glass of milk and thinks about
15. the casino and
16. the roulette wheel.

17. Céline stops, gets up, walks to the
18. window, looks out, thinks, my last patient
19. died today, I won't have to make any more
20. visits there.
21. when I saw him last
22. he paid his doctor bill;
23. it's those who don't pay their bills,
24. they live on and on.
25. Céline walks back, sits down at the
26. machine
27. is still for a good two minutes
28. then begins to type.

29. Hamsun stands over his machine thinking,
30. I wonder if they are going to believe
31. all these things I write?
32. he sits down, begins to type.
33. he doesn't know what a writer's block
34. is:
35. he's a prolific son-of-a-bitch
36. damn near as magnificent as
37. the sun.
38. he types away.

39. and I laugh
40. not out loud
41. but all up and down these walls, these
42. dirty yellow and blue walls
43. my white cat asleep on the
44. table
45. hiding his eyes from the
46. light.

47. he's not alone tonight
48. and neither am
49. I.
