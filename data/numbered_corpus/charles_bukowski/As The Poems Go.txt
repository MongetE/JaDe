1. As the poems go into the thousands you
2. realize that you've created very
3. little.
4. it comes down to the rain, the sunlight,
5. the traffic, the nights and the days of the
6. years, the faces.
7. leaving this will be easier than living
8. it, typing one more line now as
9. a man plays a piano through the radio,
10. the best writers have said very
11. little
12. and the worst,
13. far too much.
