1. I read a book about John Dos Passos and according to
2. the book once radical-communist
3. John ended up in the Hollywood Hills living off investments
4. and reading the
5. Wall Street Journal

6. this seems to happen all too often.

7. what hardly ever happens is
8. a man going from being a young conservative to becoming an
9. old wild-ass radical

10. however:
11. young conservatives always seem to become old
12. conservatives.
13. it's a kind of lifelong mental vapor-lock.

14. but when a young radical ends up an
15. old radical
16. the critics
17. and the conservatives
18. treat him as if he escaped from a mental
19. institution.

20. such is our politics and you can have it
21. all.

22. keep it.

23. sail it up your
24. ass.
