1. call it the greenhouse effect or whatever
2. but it just doesn't rain like it used to.
3. I particularly remember the rains of the
4. depression era.
5. there wasn't any money but there was
6. plenty of rain.
7. it wouldn't rain for just a night or
8. a day,
9. it would RAIN for 7 days and 7
10. nights
11. and in Los Angeles the storm drains
12. weren't built to carry off taht much
13. water
14. and the rain came down THICK and
15. MEAN and
16. STEADY
17. and you HEARD it banging against
18. the roofs and into the ground
19. waterfalls of it came down
20. from roofs
21. and there was HAIL
22. big ROCKS OF ICE
23. bombing
24. exploding smashing into things
25. and the rain
26. just wouldn't
27. STOP
28. and all the roofs leaked-
29. dishpans,
30. cooking pots
31. were placed all about;
32. they dripped loudly
33. and had to be emptied
34. again and
35. again.
36. the rain came up over the street curbings,
37. across the lawns, climbed up the steps and
38. entered the houses.
39. there were mops and bathroom towels,
40. and the rain often came up through the
41. toilets:bubbling, brown, crazy,whirling,
42. and all the old cars stood in the streets,
43. cars that had problems starting on a
44. sunny day,
45. and the jobless men stood
46. looking out the windows
47. at the old machines dying
48. like living things out there.
49. the jobless men,
50. failures in a failing time
51. were imprisoned in their houses with their
52. wives and children
53. and their
54. pets.
55. the pets refused to go out
56. and left their waste in
57. strange places.
58. the jobless men went mad
59. confined with
60. their once beautiful wives.
61. there were terrible arguments
62. as notices of foreclosure
63. fell into the mailbox.
64. rain and hail, cans of beans,
65. bread without butter; fried
66. eggs, boiled eggs, poached
67. eggs; peanut butter
68. sandwiches, and an invisible
69. chicken in every pot.
70. my father, never a good man
71. at best, beat my mother
72. when it rained
73. as I threw myself
74. between them,
75. the legs, the knees, the
76. screams
77. until they
78. seperated.
79. 'I'll kill you,' I screamed
80. at him. 'You hit her again
81. and I'll kill you! '
82. 'Get that son-of-a-bitching
83. kid out of here! '
84. 'no, Henry, you stay with
85. your mother! '
86. all the households were under
87. seige but I believe that ours
88. held more terror than the
89. average.
90. and at night
91. as we attempted to sleep
92. the rains still came down
93. and it was in bed
94. in the dark
95. watching the moon against
96. the scarred window
97. so bravely
98. holding out
99. most of the rain,
100. I thought of Noah and the
101. Ark
102. and I thought, it has come
103. again.
104. we all thought
105. that.
106. and then, at once, it would
107. stop.
108. and it always seemed to
109. stop
110. around 5 or 6 a.m.,
111. peaceful then,
112. but not an exact silence
113. because things continued to
114. drip
115. drip
116. drip


117. and there was no smog then
118. and by 8 a.m.
119. there was a
120. blazing yellow sunlight,
121. Van Gogh yellow-
122. crazy, blinding!
123. and then
124. the roof drains
125. relieved of the rush of
126. water
127. began to expand in the warmth:
128. PANG! PANG! PANG!
129. and everybody got up and looked outside
130. and there were all the lawns
131. still soaked
132. greener than green will ever
133. be
134. and there were birds
135. on the lawn
136. CHIRPING like mad,
137. they hadn't eaten decently
138. for 7 days and 7 nights
139. and they were weary of
140. berries
141. andthey waited as the worms
142. rose to the top,
143. half drowned worms.
144. the birds plucked them
145. up
146. and gobbled them
147. down; there were
148. blackbirds and sparrows.
149. the blackbirds tried to
150. drive the sparrows off
151. but the sparrows,
152. maddened with hunger,
153. smaller and quicker,
154. got their
155. due.
156. the men stood on their porches
157. smoking cigarettes,
158. now knowing
159. they'd have to go out
160. there
161. to look for that job
162. that probably wasn't
163. there, to start that car
164. that probably wouldn't
165. start.
166. and the once beautiful
167. wives
168. stood in their bathrooms
169. combing their hair,
170. applying makeup,
171. trying to put their world back
172. together again,
173. trying to forget that
174. awful sadness that
175. gripped them,
176. wondering what they could
177. fix for
178. breakfast.
179. and on the radio
180. we were told that
181. school was now
182. open.
183. andsoon
184. there I was
185. on the way to school,
186. massive puddles in the
187. street,
188. the sun like a new
189. world,
190. my parents back in that
191. house,
192. I arrived at my classroom
193. on time.
194. Mrs. Sorenson greeted us
195. with, 'we won't have our
196. usual recess, the grounds
197. are too wet.'
198. 'AW! ' most of the boys
199. went.
200. 'but we are going to do
201. something special at
202. recess,' she went on,
203. 'and it will be
204. fun! '
205. well, we all wondered
206. what that would
207. be
208. and the two hour wait
209. seemed a long time
210. as Mrs.Sorenson
211. went about
212. teaching her
213. lessons.
214. I looked at the little
215. girls, they looked so
216. pretty and clean and
217. alert,
218. they sat still and
219. straight
220. and their hair was
221. beautiful
222. in the California
223. sunshine.
224. the the recess bells rang
225. and we all waited for the
226. fun.
227. then Mrs. Sorenson told us:
228. 'now, what we are going to
229. do is we are going to tell
230. each other what we did
231. during the rainstorm!
232. we'll begin in the front row
233. and go right around!
234. now, Michael, you're first! ...'
235. well, we all began to tell
236. our stories, Michael began
237. and it went on and on,
238. and soon we realized that
239. we were all lying, not
240. exactly lying but mostly
241. lying and some of the boys
242. began to snicker and some
243. of the girls began to give
244. them dirty looks and
245. Mrs.Sorenson said,
246. 'all right! I demand a
247. modicum of silence
248. here!
249. I am interested in what
250. you did
251. during the rainstorm
252. even if you
253. aren't! '
254. so we had to tell our
255. stories and they were
256. stories.
257. one girl said that
258. when the rainbow first
259. came
260. she saw God's face
261. at the end of it.
262. only she didn't say which end.
263. one boy said he stuck
264. his fishing pole
265. out the window
266. and caught a little
267. fish
268. and fed it to his
269. cat.
270. almost everybody told
271. a lie.
272. the truth was just
273. too awful and
274. embarassing to tell.
275. then the bell rang
276. and recess was
277. over.
278. 'thank you,' said Mrs.
279. Sorenson, 'that was very
280. nice.
281. and tomorrow the grounds
282. will be dry
283. and we will put them
284. to use
285. again.'
286. most of the boys
287. cheered
288. and the little girls
289. sat very straight and
290. still,
291. looking so pretty and
292. clean and
293. alert,
294. their hair beautiful in a sunshine that
295. the world might never see
296. again.
297. and
