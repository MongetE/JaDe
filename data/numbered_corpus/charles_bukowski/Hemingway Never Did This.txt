1. I read that he lost a suitcase full of manuscripts on a
2. train and that they never were recovered.
3. I can't match the agony of this
4. but the other night I wrote a 3-page poem
5. upon this computer
6. and through my lack of diligence and
7. practice
8. and by playing around with commands
9. on the menu
10. I somehow managed to erase the poem
11. forever.
12. believe me, such a thing is difficult to do
13. even for a novice
14. but I somehow managed to do
15. it.

16. now I don't think this 3-pager was immortal
17. but there were some crazy wild lines,
18. now gone forever.
19. it bothers more than a touch, it's some-
20. thing like knocking over a good bottle of
21. wine.

22. and writing about it hardly makes a good
23. poem.
24. still, I thought somehow you'd like to
25. know?

26. if not, at least you've read this far
27. and there could be better work
28. down the line.

29. let's hope so, for your sake
30. and
31. mine.
