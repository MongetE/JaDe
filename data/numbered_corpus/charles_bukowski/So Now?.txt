1. the words have come and gone,
2. I sit ill.
3. the phone rings, the cats sleep.
4. Linda vacuums.
5. I am waiting to live,
6. waiting to die.
7. I wish I could ring in some bravery.
8. it's a lousy fix
9. but the tree outside doesn't know:
10. I watch it moving with the wind
11. in the late afternoon sun.
12. there's nothing to declare here,
13. just a waiting.
14. each faces it alone.
15. Oh, I was once young,
16. Oh, I was once unbelievably
17. young!
