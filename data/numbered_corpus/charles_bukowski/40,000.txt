1. at the track today,
2. Father's Day,
3. each paid admission was
4. entitled to a wallet
5. and each contained a
6. little surprise.
7. most of the men seemed
8. between 30 and 55,
9. going to fat,
10. many of them in walking
11. shorts,
12. they had gone stale in
13. life,
14. flattened out....
15. in fact, damn it, they
16. aren't even worth writing
17. about!
18. why am I doing
19. this?
20. these don't even
21. deserve a death bed,
22. these little walking
23. whales,
24. only there are so
25. many of
26. them,
27. in the urinals,
28. in the food lines,
29. they have managed to
30. survive
31. in a most limited
32. sense
33. but when you see
34. so many of them
35. like that,
36. there and not there,
37. breathing, farting,
38. commenting,
39. waiting for a thunder
40. that will not arrive,
41. waiting for the charging
42. white horse of
43. Glory,
44. waiting for the lovely
45. female that is not
46. there,
47. waiting to WIN,
48. waiting for the great
49. dream to
50. engulf them
51. but they do nothing,
52. they clomp in their
53. sandals,
54. gnaw at hot dogs
55. dog style,
56. gulping at the
57. meat,
58. they complain about
59. losing,
60. blame the jocks,
61. drink green
62. beer,
63. the parking lot is
64. jammed with their
65. unpaid for
66. cars,
67. the jocks mount
68. again for another
69. race,
70. the men press
71. toward the betting
72. windows
73. mesmerized,
74. fathers and non-fathers
75. Monday is waiting
76. for them,
77. this is the last
78. big lark.
79. and the horses are
80. totally
81. beautiful.
82. it is shocking how
83. beautiful they
84. are
85. at that time,
86. at that place,
87. their life shines
88. through;
89. miracles happen,
90. even in
91. hell.
92. I decide to stay for
93. one more
94. race.
