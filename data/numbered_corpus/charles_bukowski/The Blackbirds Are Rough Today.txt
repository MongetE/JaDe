1. lonely as a dry and used orchard
2. spread over the earth
3. for use and surrender.

4. shot down like an ex-pug selling
5. dailies on the corner.

6. taken by tears like
7. an aging chorus girl
8. who has gotten her last check.

9. a hanky is in order your lord your
10. worship.

11. the blackbirds are rough today
12. like
13. ingrown toenails
14. in an overnight
15. jail---
16. wine wine whine,
17. the blackbirds run around and
18. fly around
19. harping about
20. Spanish melodies and bones.

21. and everywhere is
22. nowhere---
23. the dream is as bad as
24. flapjacks and flat tires:

25. why do we go on
26. with our minds and
27. pockets full of
28. dust
29. like a bad boy just out of
30. school---
31. you tell
32. me,
33. you who were a hero in some
34. revolution
35. you who teach children
36. you who drink with calmness
37. you who own large homes
38. and walk in gardens
39. you who have killed a man and own a
40. beautiful wife
41. you tell me
42. why I am on fire like old dry
43. garbage.

44. we might surely have some interesting
45. correspondence.
46. it will keep the mailman busy.
47. and the butterflies and ants and bridges and
48. cemeteries
49. the rocket-makers and dogs and garage mechanics
50. will still go on a
51. while
52. until we run out of stamps
53. and/or
54. ideas.

55. don't be ashamed of
56. anything; I guess God meant it all
57. like
58. locks on
59. doors.
