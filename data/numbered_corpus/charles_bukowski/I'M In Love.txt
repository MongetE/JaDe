1. she's young, she said,
2. but look at me,
3. I have pretty ankles,
4. and look at my wrists, I have pretty
5. wrists
6. o my god,
7. I thought it was all working,
8. and now it's her again,
9. every time she phones you go crazy,
10. you told me it was over
11. you told me it was finished,
12. listen, I've lived long enough to become a
13. good woman,
14. why do you need a bad woman?
15. you need to be tortured, don't you?
16. you think life is rotten if somebody treats you
17. rotten it all fits,
18. doesn't it?
19. tell me, is that it? do you want to be treated like a
20. piece of shit?
21. and my son, my son was going to meet you.
22. I told my son
23. and I dropped all my lovers.
24. I stood up in a cafe and screamed
25. I'M INÂ LOVE,
26. and now you've made a fool of me. . .
27. I'm sorry, I said, I'm really sorry.
28. hold me, she said, will you please hold me?
29. I've never been in one of these things before, I said,
30. these triangles. . .
31. she got up and lit a cigarette, she was trembling all
32. over.she paced up and down,wild and crazy.she had
33. a small body.her arms were thin,very thin and when
34. she screamed and started beating me I held her
35. wrists and then I got it through the eyes:hatred,
36. centuries deep and true.I was wrong and graceless and
37. sick.all the things I had learned had been wasted.
38. there was no creature living as foul as I
39. and all my poems were
40. false.
