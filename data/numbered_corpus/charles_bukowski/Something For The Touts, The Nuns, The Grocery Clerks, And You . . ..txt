1. we have everything and we have nothing
2. and some men do it in churches
3. and some men do it by tearing butterflies
4. in half
5. and some men do it in Palm Springs
6. laying it into butterblondes
7. with Cadillac souls
8. Cadillacs and butterflies
9. nothing and everything,
10. the face melting down to the last puff
11. in a cellar in Corpus Christi.
12. there's something for the touts, the nuns,
13. the grocery clerks and you . . .
14. something at 8 a.m., something in the library
15. something in the river,
16. everything and nothing.
17. in the slaughterhouse it comes running along
18. the ceiling on a hook, and you swing it --
19. one
20. two
21. three
22. and then you've got it, $200 worth of dead
23. meat, its bones against your bones
24. something and nothing.
25. it's always early enough to die and
26. it's always too late,
27. and the drill of blood in the basin white
28. it tells you nothing at all
29. and the gravediggers playing poker over
30. 5 a.m. coffee, waiting for the grass
31. to dismiss the frost . . .
32. they tell you nothing at all.

33. we have everything and we have nothing --
34. days with glass edges and the impossible stink
35. of river moss -- worse than shit;
36. checkerboard days of moves and countermoves,
37. fagged interest, with as much sense in defeat as
38. in victory; slow days like mules
39. humping it slagged and sullen and sun-glazed
40. up a road where a madman sits waiting among
41. bluejays and wrens netted in and sucked a flakey
42. grey.
43. good days too of wine and shouting, fights
44. in alleys, fat legs of women striving around
45. your bowels buried in moans,
46. the signs in bullrings like diamonds hollering
47. Mother Capri, violets coming out of the ground
48. telling you to forget the dead armies and the loves
49. that robbed you.
50. days when children say funny and brilliant things
51. like savages trying to send you a message through
52. their bodies while their bodies are still
53. alive enough to transmit and feel and run up
54. and down without locks and paychecks and
55. ideals and possessions and beetle-like
56. opinions.
57. days when you can cry all day long in
58. a green room with the door locked, days
59. when you can laugh at the breadman
60. because his legs are too long, days
61. of looking at hedges . . .

62. and nothing, and nothing, the days of
63. the bosses, yellow men
64. with bad breath and big feet, men
65. who look like frogs, hyenas, men who walk
66. as if melody had never been invented, men
67. who think it is intelligent to hire and fire and
68. profit, men with expensive wives they possess
69. like 60 acres of ground to be drilled
70. or shown-off or to be walled away from
71. the incompetent, men who'd kill you
72. because they're crazy and justify it because
73. it's the law, men who stand in front of
74. windows 30 feet wide and see nothing,
75. men with luxury yachts who can sail around
76. the world and yet never get out of their vest
77. pockets, men like snails, men like eels, men
78. like slugs, and not as good . . .
79. and nothing, getting your last paycheck
80. at a harbor, at a factory, at a hospital, at an
81. aircraft plant, at a penny arcade, at a
82. barbershop, at a job you didn't want
83. anyway.
84. income tax, sickness, servility, broken
85. arms, broken heads -- all the stuffing
86. come out like an old pillow.

87. we have everything and we have nothing.
88. some do it well enough for a while and
89. then give way. fame gets them or disgust
90. or age or lack of proper diet or ink
91. across the eyes or children in college
92. or new cars or broken backs while skiing
93. in Switzerland or new politics or new wives
94. or just natural change and decay --
95. the man you knew yesterday hooking
96. for ten rounds or drinking for three days and
97. three nights by the Sawtooth mountains now
98. just something under a sheet or a cross
99. or a stone or under an easy delusion,
100. or packing a bible or a golf bag or a
101. briefcase: how they go, how they go! -- all
102. the ones you thought would never go.

103. days like this. like your day today.
104. maybe the rain on the window trying to
105. get through to you. what do you see today?
106. what is it? where are you? the best
107. days are sometimes the first, sometimes
108. the middle and even sometimes the last.
109. the vacant lots are not bad, churches in
110. Europe on postcards are not bad. people in
111. wax museums frozen into their best sterility
112. are not bad, horrible but not bad. the
113. cannon, think of the cannon, and toast for
114. breakfast the coffee hot enough you
115. know your tongue is still there, three
116. geraniums outside a window, trying to be
117. red and trying to be pink and trying to be
118. geraniums, no wonder sometimes the women
119. cry, no wonder the mules don't want
120. to go up the hill. are you in a hotel room
121. in Detroit looking for a cigarette? one more
122. good day. a little bit of it. and as
123. the nurses come out of the building after
124. their shift, having had enough, eight nurses
125. with different names and different places
126. to go -- walking across the lawn, some of them
127. want cocoa and a paper, some of them want a
128. hot bath, some of them want a man, some
129. of them are hardly thinking at all. enough
130. and not enough. arcs and pilgrims, oranges
131. gutters, ferns, antibodies, boxes of
132. tissue paper.

133. in the most decent sometimes sun
134. there is the softsmoke feeling from urns
135. and the canned sound of old battleplanes
136. and if you go inside and run your finger
137. along the window ledge you'll find
138. dirt, maybe even earth.
139. and if you look out the window
140. there will be the day, and as you
141. get older you'll keep looking
142. keep looking
143. sucking your tongue in a little
144. ah ah   no no   maybe

145. some do it naturally
146. some obscenely
147. everywhere.
