1. first time my father overheard me listening to
2. this bit of music he asked me,
3. "what is it?"
4. "it's called Love For Three Oranges,"
5. I informed him.
6. "boy," he said, "that's getting it
7. cheap."
8. he meant sex.
9. listening to it
10. I always imagined three oranges
11. sitting there,
12. you know how orange they can
13. get,
14. so mightily orange.
15. maybe Prokofiev had meant
16. what my father
17. thought.
18. if so, I preferred it the
19. other way
20. the most horrible thing
21. I could think of
22. was part of me being
23. what ejaculated out of the
24. end of his
25. stupid penis.
26. I will never forgive him
27. for that,
28. his trick that I am stuck
29. with,
30. I find no nobility in
31. parenthood.
32. I say kill the Father
33. before he makes more
34. such as
35. I.
