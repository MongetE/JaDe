1. I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny
2. blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny
3. they are small, and the fountain is in France
4. where you wrote me that last letter and
5. I answered and never heard from you again.
6. you used to write insane poems about
7. ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you
8. knew famous artists and most of them
9. were your lovers, and I wrote back, it' all right,
10. go ahead, enter their lives, I' not jealous
11. because we' never met. we got close once in
12. New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never
13. touched. so you went with the famous and wrote
14. about the famous, and, of course, what you found out
15. is that the famous are worried about
16. their fame -  not the beautiful young girl in bed
17. with them, who gives them that, and then awakens
18. in the morning to write upper case poems about
19. ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they' told
20. us, but listening to you I wasn' sure. maybe
21. it was the upper case. you were one of the
22. best female poets and I told the publishers,
23. editors, " her, print her, she' mad but she'
24. magic. there' no lie in her fire." I loved you
25. like a man loves a woman he never touches, only
26. writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have
27. loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a
28. cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
29. but that didn' happen. your letters got sadder.
30. your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all
31. lovers betray. it didn' help. you said
32. you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and
33. the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying
34. bench every night and wept for the lovers who had
35. hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never
36. heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide
37. 3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you
38. I would probably have been unfair to you or you
39. to me. it was best like this.
