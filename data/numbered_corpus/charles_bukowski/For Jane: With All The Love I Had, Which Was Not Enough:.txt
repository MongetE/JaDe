1. I pick up the skirt,
2. I pick up the sparkling beads
3. in black,
4. this thing that moved once
5. around flesh,
6. and I call God a liar,
7. I say anything that moved
8. like that
9. or knew
10. my name
11. could never die
12. in the common verity of dying,
13. and I pick
14. up her lovely
15. dress,
16. all her loveliness gone,
17. and I speak to all the gods,
18. Jewish gods, Christ-gods,
19. chips of blinking things,
20. idols, pills, bread,
21. fathoms, risks,
22. knowledgeable surrender,
23. rats in the gravy of two gone quite mad
24. without a chance,
25. hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance,
26. I lean upon this,
27. I lean on all of this
28. and I know
29. her dress upon my arm
30. but
31. they will not
32. give her back to me.
