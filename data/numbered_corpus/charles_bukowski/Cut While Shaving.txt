1. It's never quite right, he said, the way people look,
2. the way the music sounds, the way the words are
3. written.
4. It's never quite right, he said, all the things we are
5. taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we
6. die, all the lives we live,
7. they are never quite right,
8. they are hardly close to right,
9. these lives we live
10. one after the other,
11. piled there as history,
12. the waste of the species,
13. the crushing of the light and the way,
14. it's not quite right,
15. it's hardly right at all
16. he said.

17. don't I know it? I
18. answered.

19. I walked away from the mirror.
20. it was morning, it was afternoon, it was
21. night

22. nothing changed
23. it was locked in place.
24. something flashed, something broke, something
25. remained.

26. I walked down the stairway and
27. into it.
