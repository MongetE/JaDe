1. it sits outside my window now
2. like and old woman going to market;
3. it sits and watches me,
4. it sweats nevously
5. through wire and fog and dog-bark
6. until suddenly
7. I slam the screen with a newspaper
8. like slapping at a fly
9. and you could hear the scream
10. over this plain city,
11. and then it left.

12. the way to end a poem
13. like this
14. is to become suddenly
15. quiet.
