1. I awaken about noon and go out to get the mail
2. in my old torn bathrobe.
3. I'm hung over
4. hair down in my eyes
5. barefoot
6. gingerly walking on the small sharp rocks
7. in my path
8. still afraid of pain behind my four-day beard.

9. the young housewife next door shakes a rug
10. out of her window and sees me:
11. "hello, Hank!"

12. god damn! it's almost like being shot in the ass
13. with a .

14. "hello," I say
15. gathering up my Visa card bill, my Pennysaver coupons,
16. a Dept. of Water and Power past-due notice,
17. a letter from the mortgage people
18. plus a demand from the Weed Abatement Department
19. giving me 30 days to clean up my act.

20. I mince back again over the small sharp rocks
21. thinking, maybe I'd better write something tonight,
22. they all seem
23. to be closing in.

24. there's only one way to handle those motherfuckers.

25. the night harness races will have to wait.
