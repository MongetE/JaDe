1. there is always that space there
2. just before they get to us
3. that space
4. that fine relaxer
5. the breather
6. while say
7. flopping on a bed
8. thinking of nothing
9. or say
10. pouring a glass of water from the
11. spigot
12. while entranced by
13. nothing

14. that
15. gentle pure
16. space

17. it's worth

18. centuries of
19. existence

20. say

21. just to scratch your neck
22. while looking out the window at
23. a bare branch

24. that space
25. there
26. before they get to us
27. ensures
28. that
29. when they do
30. they won't
31. get it all

32. ever.
