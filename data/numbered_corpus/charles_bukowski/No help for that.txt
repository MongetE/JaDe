1. There is a place in the heart that
2. will never be filled

3. a space

4. and even during the
5. best moments
6. and
7. the greatest times
8. times

9. we will know it

10. we will know it
11. more than
12. ever

13. there is a place in the heart that
14. will never be filled
15. and

16. we will wait
17. and
18. wait

19. in that space.
