1. these things that we support most well
2. have nothing to do with up,
3. and we do with them
4. out of boredom or fear or money
5. or cracked intelligence;
6. our circle and our candle of light
7. being small,
8. so small we cannot bear it,
9. we heave out with Idea
10. and lose the Center:
11. all wax without the wick,
12. and we see names that once meant
13. wisdom,
14. like signs into ghost towns,
15. and only the graves are real.
