1. hooray say the roses, today is blamesday
2. and we are red as blood.

3. hooray say the roses, today is Wednesday
4. and we bloom wher soldiers fell
5. and lovers too,
6. and the snake at the word.

7. hooray say the roses, darkness comes
8. all at once, like lights gone out,
9. the sun leaves dark continents
10. and rows of stone.

11. hooray say the roses, cannons and spires,
12. birds, bees, bombers, today is Friday
13. the hand holding a medal out the window,
14. a moth going by, half a mile an hour,
15. hooray hooray
16. hooray say the roses
17. we have empires on our stems,
18. the sun moves the mouth:
19. hooray hooray hooray
20. and that is why you like us.
