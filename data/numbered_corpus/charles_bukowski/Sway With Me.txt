1. sway with me, everything sad -
2. madmen in stone houses
3. without doors,
4. lepers steaming love and song
5. frogs trying to figure
6. the sky;
7. sway with me, sad things -
8. fingers split on a forge
9. old age like breakfast shell
10. used books, used people
11. used flowers, used love
12. I need you
13. I need you
14. I need you:
15. it has run away
16. like a horse or a dog,
17. dead or lost
18. or unforgiving.
