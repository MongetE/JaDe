1. you may not believe it
2. but there are people
3. who go through life with

5. friction or
6. distress.
7. they dress well, eat
8. well, sleep well.
9. they are contented with
10. their family
11. life.
12. they have moments of
13. grief
14. but all in all
15. they are undisturbed
16. and often feel

19. it is an easy
20. death, usually in their
21. sleep.
22. you may not believe

24. but such people do
25. exist.
26. but I am not one of

28. oh no, I am not one
29. of them,
30. I am not even near
31. to being
32. one of
33. them
34. but they are
35. there
36. and I am
37. here.
