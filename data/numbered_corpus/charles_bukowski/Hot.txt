1. she was hot, she was so hot
2. I didn't want anybody else to have her,
3. and if I didn't get home on time
4. she'd be gone, and I couldn't bear that-
5. I'd go mad...
6. it was foolish I know, childish,
7. but I was caught in it, I was caught.
8. I delivered all the mail
9. and then Henderson put me on the night pickup run
10. in an old army truck,
11. the damn thing began to heat halfway through the run
12. and the night went on
13. me thinking about my hot Miriam
14. and jumping in and out of the truck
15. filling mailsacks
16. the engine continuing to heat up
17. the temperature needle was at the top
18. HOT HOT
19. like Miriam.
20. leaped in and out
21. 3 more pickups and into the station
22. I'd be, my car
23. waiting to get me to Miriam who sat on my blue couch
24. with scotch on the rocks
25. crossing her legs and swinging her ankles
26. like she did,
27. 2 more stops...
28. the truck stalled at a traffic light, it was hell
29. kicking it over
30. again...
31. I had to be home by 8,8 was the deadline for Miriam.
32. I made the last pickup and the truck stalled at a signal
33. 1/2 block from the station...
34. it wouldn't start, it couldn't start...
35. I locked the doors, pulled the key and ran down to the
36. station...
37. I threw the keys down...signed out...
38. your goddamned truck is stalled at the signal,
39. I shouted,
40. Pico and Western...
41. ...I ran down the hall,put the key into the door,
42. opened it...her drinking glass was there, and a note:

43. sun of a bitch:
44. I waited until 5 after ate
45. you don't love me
46. you sun of a bitch
47. somebody will love me
48. I been wateing all day

49. Miriam

50. I poured a drink and let the water run into the tub
51. there were 5,000 bars in town
52. and I'd make 25 of them
53. looking for Miriam
54. her purple teddy bear held the note
55. as he leaned against a pillow
56. I gave the bear a drink, myself a drink
57. and got into the hot
58. water.
