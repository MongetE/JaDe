1. this fear of being what they are:
2. dead.

3. at least they are not out on the street, they
4. are careful to stay indoors, those
5. pasty mad who sit alone before their tv sets,
6. their lives full of canned, mutilated laughter.

7. their ideal neighborhood
8. of parked cars
9. of little green lawns
10. of little homes
11. the little doors that open and close
12. as their relatives visit
13. throughout the holidays
14. the doors closing
15. behind the dying who die so slowly
16. behind the dead who are still alive
17. in your quiet average neighborhood
18. of winding streets
19. of agony
20. of confusion
21. of horror
22. of fear
23. of ignorance.

24. a dog standing behind a fence.

25. a man silent at the window.
