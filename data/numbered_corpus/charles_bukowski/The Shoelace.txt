1. a woman, a
2. tire that’s flat, a
3. disease, a
4. desire: fears in front of you,
5. fears that hold so still
6. you can study them
7. like pieces on a
8. chessboard…
9. it’s not the large things that
10. send a man to the
11. madhouse. death he’s ready for, or
12. murder, incest, robbery, fire, flood…
13. no, it’s the continuing series of small tragedies
14. that send a man to the
15. madhouse…
16. not the death of his love
17. but a shoelace that snaps
18. with no time left …
19. The dread of life
20. is that swarm of trivialities
21. that can kill quicker than cancer
22. and which are always there -
23. license plates or taxes
24. or expired driver’s license,
25. or hiring or firing,
26. doing it or having it done to you, or
27. roaches or flies or a
28. broken hook on a
29. screen, or out of gas
30. or too much gas,
31. the sink’s stopped-up, the landlord’s drunk,
32. the president doesn’t care and the governor’s
33. crazy.
34. light switch broken, mattress like a
35. porcupine;
36. $105 for a tune-up, carburetor and fuel pump at
37. sears roebuck;
38. and the phone bill’s up and the market’s
39. down
40. and the toilet chain is
41. broken,
42. and the light has burned out -
43. the hall light, the front light, the back light,
44. the inner light; it’s
45. darker than hell
46. and twice as
47. expensive.
48. then there’s always crabs and ingrown toenails
49. and people who insist they’re
50. your friends;
51. there’s always that and worse;
52. leaky faucet, christ and christmas;
53. blue salami, 9 day rains,
54. 50 cent avocados
55. and purple
56. liverwurst.

57. or making it
58. as a waitress at norm’s on the split shift,
59. or as an emptier of
60. bedpans,
61. or as a carwash or a busboy
62. or a stealer of old lady’s purses
63. leaving them screaming on the sidewalks
64. with broken arms at the age of 80.

65. suddenly
66. 2 red lights in your rear view mirror
67. and blood in your
68. underwear;
69. toothache, and $979 for a bridge
70. $300 for a gold
71. tooth,
72. and china and russia and america, and
73. long hair and short hair and no
74. hair, and beards and no
75. faces, and plenty of zigzag but no
76. pot, except maybe one to piss in
77. and the other one around your
78. gut.

79. with each broken shoelace
80. out of one hundred broken shoelaces,
81. one man, one woman, one
82. thing
83. enters a
84. madhouse.

85. so be careful
86. when you
87. bend over.
