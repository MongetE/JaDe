1. it was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street
2. I used to get drunk
3. and throw the radio through the window
4. while it was playing, and, of course,
5. it would break the glass in the window
6. and the radio would sit there on the roof
7. still playing
8. and I'd tell my woman,
9. "Ah, what a marvelous radio!"
10. the next morning I'd take the window
11. off the hinges
12. and carry it down the street
13. to the glass man
14. who would put in another pane.
15. I kept throwing that radio through the window
16. each time I got drunk
17. and it would sit there on the roof
18. still playing-
19. a magic radio
20. a radio with guts,
21. and each morning I'd take the window
22. back to the glass man.
23. I don't remember how it ended exactly
24. though I do remember
25. we finally moved out.
26. there was a woman downstairs who worked in
27. the garden in her bathing suit,
28. she really dug with that trowel
29. and she put her behind up in the air
30. and I used to sit in the window
31. and watch the sun shine all over that thing
32. while the music played.
