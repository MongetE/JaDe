1. being the German kid in the 20's in Los Angeles
2. was difficult.
3. there was much anti-German feeling then,
4. a carry-over from World War 1.
5. gangs of kids chased me through the neighborhood
6. yelling, 'Hieneie! Hieneie! Hienie!'
7. they never caught me.
8. I was like a cat.
9. I knew all the paths through brush and alleys.
10. I scaled 6-foot back fences in a flash and was off through
11. backyards and around blocks
12. and onto garage roofs and other hiding places.
13. then too, they didn't really want to catch me.
14. they were afraid I might bayonet them
15. or gouge out their eyes.

16. this went on for about 18 months
17. then all of a sudden it seemed to stop.
18. I was more or less accepted(but never really)
19. which was all right with me.
20. those sons-of-bitches were Americans,
21. they and their parents had been born here.
22. they had names like Jones and Sullivan and
23. Baker.
24. they were pale and often fat with runny
25. noses and big belt buckles.
26. I decided never to become an American.
27. my hero was Baron Manfred von Richthofen
28. the German air ace;
29. he'd shot down 80 of their best
30. and there was nothing they could do about
31. that now.
32. their parents didn't like my parents
33. (I didn't either) and
34. I decided when I got big I'd go live in some place
35. like Iceland,
36. never open my door to anybody and live on my
37. luck, live with a beautiful wife and a bunch of wild
38. animals:
39. which is, more or less, what
40. happened
