1. I can remember starving in a
2. small room in a strange city
3. shades pulled down, listening to
4. classical music
5. I was young I was so young it hurt like a knife
6. inside
7. because there was no alternative except to hide as long
8. as possible--
9. not in self-pity but with dismay at my limited chance:
10. trying to connect.

11. the old composers -- Mozart, Bach, Beethoven,
12. Brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and
13. they were dead.

14. finally, starved and beaten, I had to go into
15. the streets to be interviewed for low-paying and
16. monotonous
17. jobs
18. by strange men behind desks
19. men without eyes men without faces
20. who would take away my hours
21. break them
22. piss on them.

23. now I work for the editors the readers the
24. critics

25. but still hang around and drink with
26. Mozart, Bach, Brahms and the
27. Bee
28. some buddies
29. some men
30. sometimes all we need to be able to continue alone
31. are the dead
32. rattling the walls
33. that close us in.
