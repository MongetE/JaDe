1. at one stage in my life
2. I met a man who claimed to have
3. visited Pound at St. Elizabeths.

4. then I met a woman who not only
5. claimed to have visited
6. E.P.
7. but also to have made love
8. to himâ€”she even showed
9. me
10. certain sections in the
11. Cantos
12. where Ezra was supposed to have
13. mentioned
14. her.

15. so there was this man and
16. this woman
17. and the woman told me
18. that Pound had never
19. mentioned a visit from this
20. man
21. and the man claimed that the
22. lady had had nothing to do
23. with the
24. master
25. that she was a
26. charlatan

27. and since I wasn't a
28. Poundian scholar
29. I didn't know who to
30. believe
31. but one thing I do
32. know: when a man is
33. living
34. many claim relationships
35. that are hardly
36. so
37. and after he dies, well,
38. then it's everybody's
39. party.

40. my guess is that Pound
41. knew neither the lady or the
42. gentleman

43. or if he knew
44. one
45. or if he knew
46. both

47. it was a shameful waste of
48. madhouse
49. time.
