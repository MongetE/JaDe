1. Sunday, I am eating a
2. grapefruit, church is over at the Russian
3. Orthadox to the
4. west.

5. she is dark
6. of Eastern descent,
7. large brown eyes look up from the Bible
8. then down. a small red and black
9. Bible, and as she reads
10. her legs keep moving, moving,
11. she is doing a slow rythmic dance
12. reading the Bible. . .

13. long gold earrings;
14. 2 gold bracelets on each arm,
15. and it's a mini-suit, I suppose,
16. the cloth hugs her body,
17. the lightest of tans is that cloth,
18. she twists this way and that,
19. long yellow legs warm in the sun. . .

20. there is no escaping her being
21. there is no desire to. . .

22. my radio is playing symphonic music
23. that she cannot hear
24. but her movements coincide exactly
25. to the rythms of the
26. symphony. . .

27. she is dark, she is dark
28. she is reading about God.
29. I am God.
