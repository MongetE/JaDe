1. they found him walking along the freeway
2. all red in
3. front
4. he had taken a rusty tin can
5. and cut off his sexual
6. machinery
7. as if to say --
8. see what you've done to
9. me? you might as well have the
10. rest.

11. and he put part of him
12. in one pocket and
13. part of him in
14. another
15. and that's how they found him,
16. walking
17. along.

18. they gave him over to the
19. doctors
20. who tried to sew the parts
21. back
22. on
23. but the parts were
24. quite contented
25. the way they
26. were.

27. I think sometimes of all of the good
28. ass
29. turned over to the
30. monsters of the
31. world.

32. maybe it was his protest against
33. this or
34. his protest
35. against
36. everything.

37. a one man
38. Freedom March
39. that never squeezed in
40. between
41. the concert reviews and the
42. baseball
43. scores.

44. God, or somebody,
45. bless
46. him.
