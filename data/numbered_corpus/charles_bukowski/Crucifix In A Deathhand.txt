1. yes, they begin out in a willow, I think
2. the starch mountains begin out in the willow
3. and keep right on going without regard for
4. pumas and nectarines
5. somehow these mountains are like
6. an old woman with a bad memory and
7. a shopping basket.
8. we are in a basin. that is the
9. idea. down in the sand and the alleys,
10. this land punched-in, cuffed-out, divided,
11. held like a crucifix in a deathhand,
12. this land bought, resold, bought again and
13. sold again, the wars long over,
14. the Spaniards all the way back in Spain
15. down in the thimble again, and now
16. real estaters, subdividers, landlords, freeway
17. engineers arguing. this is their land and
18. I walk on it, live on it a little while
19. near Hollywood here I see young men in rooms
20. listening to glazed recordings
21. and I think too of old men sick of music
22. sick of everything, and death like suicide
23. I think is sometimes voluntary, and to get your
24. hold on the land here it is best to return to the
25. Grand Central Market, see the old Mexican women,
26. the poor . . . I am sure you have seen these same women
27. many years before
28. arguing
29. with the same young Japanese clerks
30. witty, knowledgeable and golden
31. among their soaring store of oranges, apples
32. avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers -
33. and you know how
34. these
35. look, they do look good
36. as if you could eat them all
37. light a cigar and smoke away the bad world.
38. then it's best to go back to the bars, the same bars
39. wooden, stale, merciless, green
40. with the young policeman walking through
41. scared and looking for trouble,
42. and the beer is still bad
43. it has an edge that already mixes with vomit and
44. decay, and you've got to be strong in the shadows
45. to ignore it, to ignore the poor and to ignore yourself
46. and the shopping bag between your legs
47. down there feeling good with its avocados and
48. oranges and fresh fish and wine bottles, who needs
49. a Fort Lauderdale winter?
50. 25 years ago there used to be a whore there
51. with a film over one eye, who was too fat
52. and made little silver bells out of cigarette
53. tinfoil. the sun seemed warmer then
54. although this was probably not
55. true, and you take your shopping bag
56. outside and walk along the street
57. and the green beer hangs there
58. just above your stomach like
59. a short and shameful shawl, and
60. you look around and no longer
61. see any
62. old men.
