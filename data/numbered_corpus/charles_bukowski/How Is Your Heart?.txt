1. during my worst times
2. on the park benches
3. in the jails
4. or living with
5. whores
6. I always had this certain
7. contentment-
8. I wouldn't call it
9. happiness-
10. it was more of an inner
11. balance
12. that settled for
13. whatever was occuring
14. and it helped in the
15. factories
16. and when relationships
17. went wrong
18. with the
19. girls.
