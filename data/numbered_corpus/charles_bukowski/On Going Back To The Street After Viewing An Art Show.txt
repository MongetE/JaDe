1. they talk down through
2. the centuries to us,
3. and this we need more and more,
4. the statues and paintings
5. in midnight age
6. as we go along
7. holding dead hands.

8. and we would say
9. rather than delude the knowing:
10. a damn good show,
11. but hardly enough for a horse to eat,
12. and out on the sunshine street where
13. eyes are dabbled in metazoan faces
14. i decide again
15. that in theses centuries
16. they have done very well
17. considering the nature of their
18. brothers:
19. it's more than good
20. that some of them,
21. (closer really to the field-mouse than
22. falcon)
23. have been bold enough to try.
