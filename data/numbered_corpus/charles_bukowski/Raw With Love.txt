1. little dark girl with
2. kind eyes
3. when it comes time to
4. use the knife
5. I won't flinch and
6. I won't blame
7. you,
8. as I drive along the shore alone
9. as the palms wave,
10. the ugly heavy palms,
11. as the living does not arrive
12. as the dead do not leave,
13. I won't blame you,
14. instead
15. I will remember the kisses
16. our lips raw with love
17. and how you gave me
18. everything you had
19. and how I
20. offered you what was left of
21. me,
22. and I will remember your small room
23. the feel of you
24. the light in the window
25. your records
26. your books
27. our morning coffee
28. our noons our nights
29. our bodies spilled together
30. sleeping
31. the tiny flowing currents
32. immediate and forever
33. your leg my leg
34. your arm my arm
35. your smile and the warmth
36. of you
37. who made me laugh
38. again.
39. little dark girl with kind eyes
40. you have no
41. knife. the knife is
42. mine and I won't use it
43. yet.
