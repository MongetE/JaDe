1. I was always a natural slob
2. I liked to lay upon the bed
3. in undershirt (stained, of
4. course) (and with cigarette
5. holes)
6. shoes off
7. beerbottle in hand
8. trying to shake off a
9. difficult night, say with a
10. woman still around
11. walking the floor
12. complaining about this and
13. that,
14. and I'd work up a
15. belch and say, "HEY, YOU DON'T
16. LIKE IT? THEN GET YOUR ASS
17. OUT OF HERE!"

18. I really loved myself, I
19. really loved my slob-
20. self, and
21. they seemed to also:
22. always leaving
23. but almost
24. always
25. coming
26. back.
