1. the final curtain on one of the longest running
2. musicals ever, some people claim to have
3. seen it over one hundred times.
4. I saw it on the tv news, that final curtain:
5. flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous
6. accolade.I have not seen this particular musical
7. but I know if I had that I wouldn't have
8. been able to bear it, it would have
9. sickened me.
10. trust me on this, the world and its
11. peoples and its artful entertainment has
12. done very little for me, only to me.
13. still, let them enjoy one another, it will
14. keep them from my door
15. and for this, my own thunderous
16. accolade.
