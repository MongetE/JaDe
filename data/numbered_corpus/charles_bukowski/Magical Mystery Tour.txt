1. I am in this low-slung sports car
2. painted a deep, rich yellow
3. driving under an Italian sun.
4. I have a British accent.
5. I'm wearing dark shades
6. an expensive silk shirt.
7. there's no dirt under my
8. fingernails.
9. the radio plays Vivaldi
10. and there are two women with
11. me
12. one with raven hair
13. the other a blonde.
14. they have small breasts and
15. beautiful legs
16. and they laugh at everything I
17. say.

18. as we drive up a steep road
19. the blonde squeezes my leg
20. and nestles closer
21. while raven hair
22. leans across and nibbles my
23. ear.

24. we stop for lunch at a quaint
25. rustic inn.
26. there is more laughter
27. before lunch
28. during lunch and after
29. lunch.

30. after lunch we will have a
31. flat tire on the other side of
32. the mountain
33. and the blonde will change the
34. tire
35. while
36. raven hair
37. photographs me
38. lighting my pipe
39. leaning against a tree
40. the perfect background
41. perfectly at peace
42. with
43. sunlight
44. flowers
45. clouds
46. birds
47. everywhere.
