1. death wants more death, and its webs are full:
2. I remember my father's garage, how child-like
3. I would brush the corpses of flies
4. from the windows they thought were escape-
5. their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies
6. shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass
7. only to spin and flit
8. in that second larger than hell or heaven
9. onto the edge of the ledge,
10. and then the spider from his dank hole
11. nervous and exposed
12. the puff of body swelling
13. hanging there
14. not really quite knowing,
15. and then knowing-
16. something sending it down its string,
17. the wet web,
18. toward the weak shield of buzzing,
19. the pulsing;
20. a last desperate moving hair-leg
21. there against the glass
22. there alive in the sun,
23. spun in white;
24. and almost like love:
25. the closing over,
26. the first hushed spider-sucking:
27. filling its sack
28. upon this thing that lived;
29. crouching there upon its back
30. drawing its certain blood
31. as the world goes by outside
32. and my temples scream
33. and I hurl the broom against them:
34. the spider dull with spider-anger
35. still thinking of its prey
36. and waving an amazed broken leg;
37. the fly very still,
38. a dirty speck stranded to straw;
39. I shake the killer loose
40. and he walks lame and peeved
41. towards some dark corner
42. but I intercept his dawdling
43. his crawling like some broken hero,
44. and the straws smash his legs
45. now waving
46. above his head
47. and looking
48. looking for the enemy
49. and somewhat valiant,
50. dying without apparent pain
51. simply crawling backward
52. piece by piece
53. leaving nothing there
54. until at last the red gut sack
55. splashes
56. its secrets,
57. and I run child-like
58. with God's anger a step behind,
59. back to simple sunlight,
60. wondering
61. as the world goes by
62. with curled smile
63. if anyone else
64. saw or sensed my crime
