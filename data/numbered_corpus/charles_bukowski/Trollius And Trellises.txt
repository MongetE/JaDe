1. of course, I may die in the next ten minutes
2. and I’m ready for that
3. but what I’m really worried about is
4. that my editor-publisher might retire
5. even though he is ten years younger than
6. I.
7. it was just 25 years ago (I was at that ripe
8. old age of 45)
9. when we began our unholy alliance to
10. test the literary waters,
11. neither of us being much
12. known.

13. I think we had some luck and still have some
14. of same
15. yet
16. the odds are pretty fair
17. that he will opt for warm and pleasant
18. afternoons
19. in the garden
20. long before I.

21. writing is its own intoxication
22. while publishing and editing,
23. attempting to collect bills
24. carries its own
25. attrition
26. which also includes dealing with the
27. petty bitchings and demands
28. of many
29. so-called genius darlings who are
30. not.

31. I won’t blame him for getting
32. out
33. and hope he sends me photos of his
34. Rose Lane, his
35. Gardenia Avenue.

36. will I have to seek other
37. promulgators?
38. that fellow in the Russian
39. fur hat?
40. or that beast in the East
41. with all that hair
42. in his ears, with those wet and
43. greasy lips?

44. or will my editor-publisher
45. upon exiting for that world of Trollius and
46. trellis
47. hand over the
48. machinery
49. of his former trade to a
50. cousin, a
51. daughter or
52. some Poundian from Big
53. Sur?

54. or will he just pass the legacy on
55. to the
56. Shipping Clerk
57. who will rise like
58. Lazarus,
59. fingering new-found
60. importance?

61. one can imagine terrible
62. things:
63. “Mr. Chinaski, all your work
64. must now be submitted in
65. Rondo form
66. and
67. typed
68. triple-spaced on rice
69. paper.”

70. power corrupts,
71. life aborts
72. and all you
73. have left
74. is a
75. bunch of
76. warts.

77. “no, no, Mr. Chinaski:
78. Rondo form!”

79. “hey, man,” I’ll ask,
80. “haven’t you heard of
81. the thirties?”

82. “the thirties? what’s
83. that?”

84. my present editor-publisher
85. and I
86. at times
87. did discuss the thirties,
88. the Depression
89. and
90. some of the little tricks it
91. taught us—
92. like how to endure on almost
93. nothing
94. and move forward
95. anyhow.

96. well, John, if it happens enjoy your
97. divertissement to
98. plant husbandry,
99. cultivate and aerate
100. between
101. bushes, water only in the
102. early morning, spread
103. shredding to discourage
104. weed growth
105. and
106. as I do in my writing:
107. use plenty of
108. manure.

109. and thank you
110. for locating me there at
111. 5124 DeLongpre Avenue
112. somewhere between
113. alcoholism and
114. madness.

115. together we
116. laid down the gauntlet
117. and there are takers
118. even at this late date
119. still to be
120. found
121. as the fire sings
122. through the
123. trees.
