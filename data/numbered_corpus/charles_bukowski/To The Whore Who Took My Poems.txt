1. some say we should keep personal remorse from the
2. poem,
3. stay abstract, and there is some reason in this,
4. but jezus;
5. twelve poems gone and I don't keep carbons and you have
6. my
7. paintings too, my best ones; its stifling:
8. are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
9. why didn't you take my money? they usually do
10. from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.
11. next time take my left arm or a fifty
12. but not my poems:
13. I'm not Shakespeare
14. but sometime simply
15. there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise;
16. there'll always be mony and whores and drunkards
17. down to the last bomb,
18. but as God said,
19. crossing his legs,
20. I see where I have made plenty of poets
21. but not so very much
22. poetry.
