1. not much chance,
2. completely cut loose from
3. purpose,
4. he was a young man
5. riding a bus
6. through North Carolina
7. on the wat to somewhere
8. and it began to snow
9. and the bus stopped
10. at a little cafe
11. in the hills
12. and the passengers
13. entered.
14. he sat at the counter
15. with the others,
16. he ordered and the
17. food arived.
18. the meal was
19. particularly
20. good
21. and the
22. coffee.
23. the waitress was
24. unlike the women
25. he had
26. known.
27. she was unaffected,
28. there was a natural
29. humor which came
30. from her.
31. the fry cook said
32. crazy things.
33. the dishwasher.
34. in back,
35. laughed, a good
36. clean
37. pleasant
38. laugh.
39. the young man watched
40. the snow through the
41. windows.
42. he wanted to stay
43. in that cafe
44. forever.
45. the curious feeling
46. swam through him
47. that everything
48. was
49. beautiful
50. there,
51. that it would always
52. stay beautiful
53. there.
54. then the bus driver
55. told the passengers
56. that it was time
57. to board.
58. the young man
59. thought, I’ll just sit
60. here, I’ll just stay
61. here.
62. but then
63. he rose and followed
64. the others into the
65. bus.
66. he found his seat
67. and looked at the cafe
68. through the bus
69. window.
70. then the bus moved
71. off, down a curve,
72. downward, out of
73. the hills.
74. the young man
75. looked straight
76. foreward.
77. he heard the other
78. passengers
79. speaking
80. of other things,
81. or they were
82. reading
83. or
84. attempting to
85. sleep.
86. they had not
87. noticed
88. the
89. magic.
90. the young man
91. put his head to
92. one side,
93. closed his
94. eyes,
95. pretended to
96. sleep.
97. there was nothing
98. else to do-
99. just to listen to the
100. sound of the
101. engine,
102. the sound of the
103. tires
104. in the
105. snow.
