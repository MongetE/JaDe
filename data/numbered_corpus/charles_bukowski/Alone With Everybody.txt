1. the flesh covers the bone
2. and they put a mind
3. in there and
4. sometimes a soul,
5. and the women break
6. vases against the walls
7. and the men drink too
8. much
9. and nobody finds the
10. one
11. but keep
12. looking
13. crawling in and out
14. of beds.
15. flesh covers
16. the bone and the
17. flesh searches
18. for more than
19. flesh.

20. there's no chance
21. at all:
22. we are all trapped
23. by a singular
24. fate.

25. nobody ever finds
26. the one.

27. the city dumps fill
28. the junkyards fill
29. the madhouses fill
30. the hospitals fill
31. the graveyards fill

32. nothing else
33. fills.
