1. starving there, sitting around the bars,
2. and at night walking the streets for
3. hours,
4. the moonlight always seemed fake
5. to me, maybe it was,
6. and in the French Quarter I watched
7. the horses and buggies going by,
8. everybody sitting high in the open
9. carriages, the black driver, and in
10. back the man and the woman,
11. usually young and always white.
12. and I was always white.
13. and hardly charmed by the
14. world.
15. New Orleans was a place to
16. hide.
17. I could piss away my life,
18. unmolested.
19. except for the rats.
20. the rats in my dark small room
21. very much resented sharing it
22. with me.
23. they were large and fearless
24. and stared at me with eyes
25. that spoke
26. an unblinking
27. death.

28. women were beyond me.
29. they saw something
30. depraved.
31. there was one waitress
32. a little older than
33. I, she rather smiled,
34. lingered when she
35. brought my
36. coffee.

37. that was plenty for
38. me, that was
39. enough.

40. there was something about
41. that city, though
42. it didn't let me feel guilty
43. that I had no feeling for the
44. things so many others
45. needed.
46. it let me alone.

47. sitting up in my bed
48. the llights out,
49. hearing the outside
50. sounds,
51. lifting my cheap
52. bottle of wine,
53. letting the warmth of
54. the grape
55. enter
56. me
57. as I heard the rats
58. moving about the
59. room,
60. I preferred them
61. to
62. humans.

63. being lost,
64. being crazy maybe
65. is not so bad
66. if you can be
67. that way
68. undisturbed.

69. New Orleans gave me
70. that.
71. nobody ever called
72. my name.

73. no telephone,
74. no car,
75. no job,
76. no
77. anything.

78. me and the
79. rats
80. and my youth,
81. one time,
82. that time
83. I knew
84. even through the
85. nothingness,
86. it was a
87. celebration
88. of something not to
89. do
90. but only
91. know.
