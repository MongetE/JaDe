1. the night I was going to die
2. I was sweating on the bed
3. and I could hear the crickets
4. and there was a cat fight outside
5. and I could feel my soul dropping down through the
6. mattress
7. and just before it hit the floor I jumped up
8. I was almost too weak to walk
9. but I walked around and turned on all the lights
10. and then I went back to bed
11. and dropped it down again and
12. I was up
13. turning on all the lights
14. I had a 7-year-old daughter
15. and I felt sure she wouldn't want me dead
16. otherwise it wouldn't have
17. mattered
18. but all that night
19. nobody phoned
20. nobody came by with a beer
21. my girlfriend didn't phone
22. all I could hear were the crickets and it was
23. hot
24. and I kept working at it
25. getting up and down
26. until the first of the sun came through the window
27. through the bushes
28. and then I got on the bed
29. and the soul stayed
30. inside at last and
31. I slept.
32. now people come by
33. beating on the doors and windows
34. the phone rings
35. the phone rings again and again
36. I get great letters in the mail
37. hate letters and love letters.
38. everything is the same again.
