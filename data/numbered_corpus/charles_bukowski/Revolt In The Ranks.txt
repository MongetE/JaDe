1. I have just spent one-hour-and-a-half
2. handicapping tomorrow's
3. card.
4. when am I going to get at the poems?
5. well, they'll just have to wait
6. they'll have to warm their feet in the
7. anteroom
8. where they'll sit gossiping about
9. me.
10. "this Chinaski, doesn't he realize that
11. without us he would have long ago
12. gone mad, been dead?"
13. "he knows, but he thinks he can keep
14. us at his beck and call!"
15. "he's an ingrate!"
16. "let's give him writer's block!"
17. "yeah!"
18. "yeah!"
19. "yeah!"
20. the little poems kick up their heels
21. and laugh.
22. then the biggest one gets up and
23. walks toward the door.
24. "hey, where are you going?" he is
25. asked.
26. "somewhere where I am
27. appreciated."
28. then, he
29. and the others
30. vanish.
