1. there's a bluebird in my heart that
2. wants to get out
3. but I'm too tough for him,
4. I say, stay in there, I'm not going
5. to let anybody see
6. you.
7. there's a bluebird in my heart that
8. wants to get out
9. but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
10. cigarette smoke
11. and the whores and the bartenders
12. and the grocery clerks
13. never know that
14. he's
15. in there.

16. there's a bluebird in my heart that
17. wants to get out
18. but I'm too tough for him,
19. I say,
20. stay down, do you want to mess
21. me up?
22. you want to screw up the
23. works?
24. you want to blow my book sales in
25. Europe?
26. there's a bluebird in my heart that
27. wants to get out
28. but I'm too clever, I only let him out
29. at night sometimes
30. when everybody's asleep.
31. I say, I know that you're there,
32. so don't be
33. sad.
34. then I put him back,
35. but he's singing a little
36. in there, I haven't quite let him
37. die
38. and we sleep together like
39. that
40. with our
41. secret pact
42. and it's nice enough to
43. make a man
44. weep, but I don't
45. weep, do
46. you?
