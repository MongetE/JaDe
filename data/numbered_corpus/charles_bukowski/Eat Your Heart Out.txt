1. I've come by, she says, to tell you
2. that this is it. I'm not kidding, it's
3. over. this is it.
4. I sit on the couch watching her arrange
5. her long red hair before my bedroom
6. mirror.
7. she pulls her hair up and
8. piles it on top of her head-
9. she lets her eyes look at
10. my eyes-
11. then she drops her hair and
12. lets it fall down in front of her face.
13. we go to bed and I hold her
14. speechlessly from the back
15. my arm around her neck
16. I touch her wrists and hands
17. feel up to
18. her elbows
19. no further.
20. she gets up.
21. this is it, she says,
22. this will do. well,
23. I'm going.
24. I get up and walk her
25. to the door
26. just as she leaves
27. she says,
28. I want you to buy me
29. some high-heeled shoes
30. with tall thin spikes,
31. black high-heeled shoes.
32. no, I want them
33. red.
34. I watch her walk down the cement walk
35. under the trees
36. she walks all right and
37. as the pointsettas drip in the sun
38. I close the door.
