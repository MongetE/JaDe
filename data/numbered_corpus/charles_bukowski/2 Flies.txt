1. The flies are angry bits of life;
2. why are they so angry?
3. it seems they want more,
4. it seems almost as if they
5. are angry
6. that they are flies;
7. it is not my fault;
8. I sit in the room
9. with them
10. and they taunt me
11. with their agony;
12. it is as if they were
13. loose chunks of soul
14. left out of somewhere;
15. I try to read a paper
16. but they will not let me
17. be;
18. one seems to go in half-circles
19. high along the wall,
20. throwing a miserable sound
21. upon my head;
22. the other one, the smaller one
23. stays near and teases my hand,
24. saying nothing,
25. rising, dropping
26. crawling near;
27. what god puts these
28. lost things upon me?
29. other men suffer dictates of
30. empire, tragic love…
31. I suffer
32. insects…
33. I wave at the little one
34. which only seems to revive
35. his impulse to challenge:
36. he circles swifter,
37. nearer, even making
38. a fly-sound,
39. and one above
40. catching a sense of the new
41. whirling, he too, in excitement,
42. speeds his flight,
43. drops down suddenly
44. in a cuff of noise
45. and they join
46. in circling my hand,
47. strumming the base
48. of the lampshade
49. until some man-thing
50. in me
51. will take no more
52. unholiness
53. and I strike
54. with the rolled-up-paper -
55. missing! -
56. striking,
57. striking,
58. they break in discord,
59. some message lost between them,
60. and I get the big one
61. first, and he kicks on his back
62. flicking his legs
63. like an angry whore,
64. and I come down again
65. with my paper club
66. and he is a smear
67. of fly-ugliness;
68. the little one circles high
69. now, quiet and swift,
70. almost invisible;
71. he does not come near
72. my hand again;
73. he is tamed and
74. inaccessible; I leave
75. him be, he leaves me
76. be;
77. the paper, of course,
78. is ruined;
79. something has happened,
80. something has soiled my
81. day,
82. sometimes it does not
83. take man
84. or a woman,
85. only something alive;
86. I sit and watch
87. the small one;
88. we are woven together
89. in the air
90. and the living;
91. it is late
92. for both of us.
