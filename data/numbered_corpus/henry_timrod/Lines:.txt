1. I stooped from star-bright regions, where
2. Thou canst not enter even in prayer;
3. And thought to light thy heart and hearth
4. With all the poesy of earth.

5. Oh, foolish hope! those mystic gleams
6. To thee were unsubstantial dreams;
7. The paltry world had made thee blind,
8. And shut thy heart and dulled thy mind.

9. I was a vassal at thy feet,
10. And cringed more meanly than was meet,
11. And since I dared not to be free,
12. Was scouted as a slave should be.

13. I gave thee all -- my truth, my trust --
14. I bowed my spirit in the dust,
15. I put a crown upon thy brow,
16. And am its proper victim now.
