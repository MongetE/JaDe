1. I scarcely grieve, O Nature! at the lot
2. That pent my life within a city's bounds,
3. And shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds.
4. Perhaps I had not learned, if some lone cot
5. Had nursed a dreamy childhood, what the mart
6. Taught me amid its turmoil; so my youth
7. Had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth.
8. Here, too, O Nature! in this haunt of Art,
9. Thy power is on me, and I own thy thrall.
10. There is no unimpressive spot on earth!
11. The beauty of the stars is over all,
12. And Day and Darkness visit every hearth.
13. Clouds do not scorn us:  yonder factory's smoke
14. Looked like a golden mist when morning broke.
