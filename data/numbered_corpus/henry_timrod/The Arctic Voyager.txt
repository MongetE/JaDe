1. Shall I desist, twice baffled?  Once by land,
2. And once by sea, I fought and strove with storms,
3. All shades of danger, tides, and weary calms;
4. Head-currents, cold and famine, savage beasts,
5. And men more savage; all the while my face
6. Looked northward toward the pole; if mortal strength
7. Could have sustained me, I had never turned
8. Till I had seen the star which never sets
9. Freeze in the Arctic zenith.  That I failed
10. To solve the mysteries of the ice-bound world,
11. Was not because I faltered in the quest.
12. Witness those pathless forests which conceal
13. The bones of perished comrades, that long march,
14. Blood-tracked o'er flint and snow, and one dread night
15. By Athabasca, when a cherished life
16. Flowed to give life to others.  This, and worse,
17. I suffered -- let it pass -- it has not tamed
18. My spirit nor the faith which was my strength.
19. Despite of waning years, despite the world
20. Which doubts, the few who dare, I purpose now --
21. A purpose long and thoughtfully resolved,
22. Through all its grounds of reasonable hope --
23. To seek beyond the ice which guards the Pole,
24. A sea of open water; for I hold,
25. Not without proofs, that such a sea exists,
26. And may be reached, though since this earth was made
27. No keel hath ploughed it, and to mortal ear
28. No wind hath told its secrets. . . .  With this tide
29. I sail; if all be well, this very moon
30. Shall see my ship beyond the southern cape
31. Of Greenland, and far up the bay through which,
32. With diamond spire and gorgeous pinnacle,
33. The fleets of winter pass to warmer seas.
34. Whether, my hardy shipmates! we shall reach
35. Our bourne, and come with tales of wonder back,
36. Or whether we shall lose the precious time,
37. Locked in thick ice, or whether some strange fate
38. Shall end us all, I know not; but I know
39. A lofty hope, if earnestly pursued,
40. Is its own crown, and never in this life
41. Is labor wholly fruitless.  In this faith
42. I shall not count the chances -- sure that all
43. A prudent foresight asks we shall not want,
44. And all that bold and patient hearts can do
45. Ye will not leave undone.  The rest is God's!
