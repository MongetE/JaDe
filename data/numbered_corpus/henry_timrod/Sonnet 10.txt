1. Were I the poet-laureate of the fairies,
2. Who in a rose-leaf finds too broad a page;
3. Or could I, like your beautiful canaries,
4. Sing with free heart and happy, in a cage;
5. Perhaps I might within this little space
6. (As in some Eastern tale, by magic power,
7. A giant is imprisoned in a flower)
8. Have told you something with a poet's grace.
9. But I need wider limits, ampler scope,
10. A world of freedom for a world of passion,
11. And even then, the glory of my hope
12. Would not be uttered in its stateliest fashion;
13. Yet, lady, when fit language shall have told it,
14. You'll find one little heart enough to hold it!
