1. Some truths there be are better left unsaid;
2. Much is there that we may not speak unblamed.
3. On words, as wings, how many joys have fled!
4. The jealous fairies love not to be named.
5. There is an old-world tale of one whose bed
6. A genius graced, to all, save him, unknown;
7. One day the secret passed his lips, and sped
8. As secrets speed -- thenceforth he slept alone.
9. Too much, oh! far too much is told in books;
10. Too broad a daylight wraps us all and each.
11. Ah! it is well that, deeper than our looks,
12. Some secrets lie beyond conjecture's reach.
13. Ah! it is well that in the soul are nooks
14. That will not open to the keys of speech.
