1. Yes, in that dainty ivory shrine,
2. With those three pallid buds, I twine
3. And fold away a dream divine!

4. One night they lay upon a breast
5. Where Love hath made his fragrant nest,
6. And throned me as a life-long guest.

7. Near that chaste heart they seemed to me
8. Types of far fairer flowers to be --
9. The rosebuds of a human tree!

10. Buds that shall bloom beside my hearth,
11. And there be held of richer worth
12. Than all the kingliest gems of earth.

13. Ah me! the pathos of the thought!
14. I had not deemed she wanted aught;
15. Yet what a tenderer charm it wrought!

16. I know not if she marked the flame
17. That lit my cheek, but not from shame,
18. When one sweet image dimly came.

19. There was a murmur soft and low;
20. White folds of cambric, parted slow;
21. And little fingers played with snow!

22. How far my fancy dared to stray,
23. A lover's reverence needs not say --
24. Enough -- the vision passed away!

25. Passed in a mist of happy tears,
26. While something in my tranced ears
27. Hummed like the future in a seer's!
