1. Grief dies like joy; the tears upon my cheek
2. Will disappear like dew.  Dear God! I know
3. Thy kindly Providence hath made it so,
4. And thank thee for the law.  I am too weak
5. To make a friend of Sorrow, or to wear,
6. With that dark angel ever by my side
7. (Though to thy heaven there be no better guide),
8. A front of manly calm.  Yet, for I hear
9. How woe hath cleansed, how grief can deify,
10. So weak a thing it seems that grief should die,
11. And love and friendship with it, I could pray,
12. That if it might not gloom upon my brow,
13. Nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now,
14. No grief of mine should ever pass away.
