1. Somewhere on this earthly planet
2. In the dust of flowers to be,
3. In the dewdrop, in the sunshine,
4. Sleeps a solemn day for me.

5. At this wakeful hour of midnight
6. I behold it dawn in mist,
7. And I hear a sound of sobbing
8. Through the darkness -- hist! oh, hist!

9. In a dim and murky chamber,
10. I am breathing life away;
11. Some one draws a curtain softly,
12. And I watch the broadening day.

13. As it purples in the zenith,
14. As it brightens on the lawn,
15. There's a hush of death about me,
16. And a whisper, "He is gone!"
