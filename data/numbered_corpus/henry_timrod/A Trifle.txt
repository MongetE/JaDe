1. I know not why, but ev'n to me
2. My songs seem sweet when read to thee.

3. Perhaps in this the pleasure lies -
4. I read my thoughts within thine eyes.

5. And so dare fancy that my art
6. May sink as deeply as thy heart.

7. Perhaps I love to make my words
8. Sing round thee like so many birds,

9. Or, maybe, they are only sweet
10. As they seem offerings at thy feet.

11. Or haply, Lily, when I speak,
12. I think, perchance, they touch thy cheek,

13. Or with a yet more precious bliss,
14. Die on thy red lips in a kiss.

15. Each reason here - I cannot tell -
16. Or all perhaps may solve the spell.

17. But if she watch when I am by,
18. Lily may deeper see than I.
