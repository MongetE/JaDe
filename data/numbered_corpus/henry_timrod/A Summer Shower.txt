1. Welcome, rain or tempest
2. From yon airy powers,
3. We have languished for them
4. Many sultry hours,
5. And earth is sick and wan, and pines with all her flowers.

6. What have they been doing
7. In the burning June?
8. Riding with the genii?
9. Visiting the moon?
10. Or sleeping on the ice amid an arctic noon?

11. Bring they with them jewels
12. From the sunset lands?
13. What are these they scatter
14. With such lavish hands?
15. There are no brighter gems in Raolconda's sands.

16. Pattering on the gravel,
17. Dropping from the eaves,
18. Glancing in the grass, and
19. Tinkling on the leaves,
20. They flash the liquid pearls as flung from fairy sieves.

21. Meanwhile, unreluctant,
22. Earth like Danae lies;
23. Listen! is it fancy,
24. That beneath us sighs,
25. As that warm lap receives the largesse of the skies?

26. Jove, it is, descendeth
27. In those crystal rills;
28. And this world-wide tremor
29. Is a pulse that thrills
30. To a god's life infused through veins of velvet hills.

31. Wait, thou jealous sunshine,
32. Break not on their bliss;
33. Earth will blush in roses
34. Many a day for this,
35. And bend a brighter brow beneath thy burning kiss.
