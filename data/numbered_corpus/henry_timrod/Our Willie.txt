1. 'T was merry Christmas when he came,
2. Our little boy beneath the sod;
3. And brighter burned the Christmas flame,
4. And merrier sped the Christmas game,
5. Because within the house there lay
6. A shape as tiny as a fay --
7. The Christmas gift of God!
8. In wreaths and garlands on the walls
9. The holly hung its ruby balls,
10. The mistletoe its pearls;
11. And a Christmas tree's fantastic fruits
12. Woke laughter like a choir of flutes
13. From happy boys and girls.
14. For the mirth, which else had swelled as shrill
15. As a school let loose to its errant will,
16. Was softened by the thought,
17. That in a dim hushed room above
18. A mother's pains in a mother's love
19. Were only just forgot.
20. The jest, the tale, the toast, the glee,
21. All took a sober tone;
22. We spoke of the babe upstairs, as we
23. Held festival for him alone.
24. When the bells rang in the Christmas morn,
25. It scarcely seemed a sin to say
26. That they rang because that babe was born,
27. Not less than for the sacred day.
28. Ah! Christ forgive us for the crime
29. Which drowned the memories of the time
30. In a merely mortal bliss!
31. We owned the error when the mirth
32. Of another Christmas lit the hearth
33. Of every home but this.
34. When, in that lonely burial-ground,
35. With every Christmas sight and sound
36. Removed or shunned, we kept
37. A mournful Christmas by the mound
38. Where little Willie slept!

39. Ah, hapless mother! darling wife!
40. I might say nothing more,
41. And the dull cold world would hold
42. The story of that precious life
43. As amply told!
44. Shall we, shall you and I, before
45. That world's unsympathetic eyes
46. Lay other relics from our store
47. Of tender memories?
48. What could it know of the joy and love
49. That throbbed and smiled and wept above
50. An unresponsive thing?
51. And who could share the ecstatic thrill
52. With which we watched the upturned bill
53. Of our bird at its living spring?
54. Shall we tell how in the time gone by,
55. Beneath all changes of the sky,
56. And in an ordinary home
57. Amid the city's din,
58. Life was to us a crystal dome,
59. Our babe the flame therein?
60. Ah! this were jargon on the mart;
61. And though some gentle friend,
62. And many and many a suffering heart,
63. Would weep and comprehend,
64. Yet even these might fail to see
65. What we saw daily in the child --
66. Not the mere creature undefiled,
67. But the winged cherub soon to be.
68. That wandering hand which seemed to reach
69. At angel finger-tips,
70. And that murmur like a mystic speech
71. Upon the rosy lips,
72. That something in the serious face
73. Holier than even its infant grace,
74. And that rapt gaze on empty space,
75. Which made us, half believing, say,
76. "Ah, little wide-eyed seer! who knows
77. But that for you this chamber glows
78. With stately shapes and solemn shows?"
79. Which touched us, too, with vague alarms,
80. Lest in the circle of our arms
81. We held a being less akin
82. To his parents in a world of sin
83. Than to beings not of clay:
84. How could we speak in human phrase,
85. Of such scarce earthly traits and ways,
86. What would not seem
87. A doting dream,
88. In the creed of these sordid days?
89. No! let us keep
90. Deep, deep,
91. In sorrowing heart and aching brain,
92. This story hidden with the pain,
93. Which since that blue October night
94. When Willie vanished from our sight,
95. Must haunt us even in our sleep.
96. In the gloom of the chamber where he died,
97. And by that grave which, through our care,
98. From Yule to Yule of every year,
99. Is made like Spring to bloom;
100. And where, at times, we catch the sigh
101. As of an angel floating nigh,
102. Who longs but has not power to tell
103. That in that violet-shrouded cell
104. Lies nothing better than the shell
105. Which he had cast aside --
106. By that sweet grave, in that dark room,
107. We may weave at will for each other's ear,
108. Of that life, and that love, and that early doom,
109. The tale which is shadowed here:
110. To us alone it will always be
111. As fresh as our own misery;
112. But enough, alas! for the world is said,
113. In the brief "Here lieth" of the dead!
