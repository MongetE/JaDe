1. Sweet are these kisses of the South,
2. As dropped from woman's rosiest mouth,
3. And tenderer are those azure skies
4. Than this world's tenderest pair of eyes!

5. But ah! beneath such influence
6. Thought is too often lost in Sense;
7. And Action, faltering as we thrill,
8. Sinks in the unnerved arms of Will.

9. Awake, thou stormy North, and blast
10. The subtle spells around us cast;
11. Beat from our limbs these flowery chains
12. With the sharp scourges of thy rains!

13. Bring with thee from thy Polar cave
14. All the wild songs of wind and wave,
15. Of toppling berg and grinding floe,
16. And the dread avalanche of snow!

17. Wrap us in Arctic night and clouds!
18. Yell like a fiend amid the shrouds
19. Of some slow-sinking vessel, when
20. He hears the shrieks of drowning men!

21. Blend in thy mighty voice whate'er
22. Of danger, terror, and despair
23. Thou hast encountered in thy sweep
24. Across the land and o'er the deep.

25. Pour in our ears all notes of woe,
26. That, as these very moments flow,
27. Rise like a harsh discordant psalm,
28. While we lie here in tropic calm.

29. Sting our weak hearts with bitter shame,
30. Bear us along with thee like flame;
31. And prove that even to destroy
32. More God-like may be than to toy
33. And rust or rot in idle joy!
