1. Spring, with that nameless pathos in the air
2. Which dwells with all things fair,
3. Spring, with her golden suns and silver rain,
4. Is with us once again.

5. Out in the lonely woods the jasmine burns
6. Its fragrant lamps, and turns
7. Into a royal court with green festoons
8. The banks of dark lagoons.

9. In the deep heart of every forest tree
10. The blood is all aglee,
11. And there's a look about the leafless bowers
12. As if they dreamed of flowers.

13. Yet still on every side we trace the hand
14. Of Winter in the land,
15. Save where the maple reddens on the lawn,
16. Flushed by the season's dawn;

17. Or where, like those strange semblances we find
18. That age to childhood bind,
19. The elm puts on, as if in Nature's scorn,
20. The brown of Autumn corn.

21. As yet the turf is dark, although you know
22. That, not a span below,
23. A thousand germs are groping through the gloom,
24. And soon will burst their tomb.

25. Already, here and there, on frailest stems
26. Appear some azure gems,
27. Small as might deck, upon a gala day,
28. The forehead of a fay.

29. In gardens you may note amid the dearth
30. The crocus breaking earth;
31. And near the snowdrop's tender white and green,
32. The violet in its screen.

33. But many gleams and shadows need must pass
34. Along the budding grass,
35. And weeks go by, before the enamored South
36. Shall kiss the rose's mouth.

37. Still there's a sense of blossoms yet unborn
38. In the sweet airs of morn;
39. One almost looks to see the very street
40. Grow purple at his feet.

41. At times a fragrant breeze comes floating by,
42. And brings, you know not why,
43. A feeling as when eager crowds await
44. Before a palace gate

45. Some wondrous pageant; and you scarce would start,
46. If from a beech's heart,
47. A blue-eyed Dryad, stepping forth, should say,
48. "Behold me!  I am May!"

49. Ah! who would couple thoughts of war and crime
50. With such a bless|"ed time!
51. Who in the west wind's aromatic breath
52. Could hear the call of Death!

53. Yet not more surely shall the Spring awake
54. The voice of wood and brake,
55. Than she shall rouse, for all her tranquil charms,
56. A million men to arms.

57. There shall be deeper hues upon her plains
58. Than all her sunlit rains,
59. And every gladdening influence around,
60. Can summon from the ground.

61. Oh! standing on this desecrated mould,
62. Methinks that I behold,
63. Lifting her bloody daisies up to God,
64. Spring kneeling on the sod,

65. And calling, with the voice of all her rills,
66. Upon the ancient hills
67. To fall and crush the tyrants and the slaves
68. Who turn her meads to graves.
