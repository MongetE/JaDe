1. Take first a Cowslip, then an Asphodel,
2. A bridal Rose, some snowy Orange flowers;
3. A Lily next, and by its spotless bell
4. Place the bright Iris, darling of the showers;
5. Set gold Nasturtiums, Elder blooms between,
6. And Heart's-ease to the Orchis marry sweetly;
7. Then with red Pinks, and slips of Evergreen,
8. You will possess -- all folded up discreetly --
9. In one bouquet, that none but you may know,
10. The name I love beyond all names below.
