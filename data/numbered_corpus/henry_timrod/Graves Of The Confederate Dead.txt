1. Sleep sweetly in your humble graves,
2. Sleep, martyrs of a fallen cause;
3. Though yet no marble column craves
4. The pilgrim here to pause.

5. II

6. In seeds of laurel in the earth
7. The blossom of your fame is blown,
8. And somewhere, waiting for its birth,
9. The shaft is in the stone!

10. III

11. Meanwhile, behalf the tardy years
12. Which keep in trust your storied tombs,
13. Behold! your sisters bring their tears,
14. And these memorial blooms.

15. IV

16. Small tributes! but your shades will smile
17. More proudly on these wreaths to-day,
18. Than when some cannon-moulded pile
19. Shall overlook this bay.

20. V

21. Stoop, angels, hither from the skies!
22. There is no holier spot of ground
23. Than where defeated valor lies,
24. By mourning beauty crowned!
