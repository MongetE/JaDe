1. Why am I silent from year to year?
2. Needs must I sing on these blue March days?
3. What will you say, when I tell you here,
4. That already, I think, for a little praise,
5. I have paid too dear?

6. For, I know not why, when I tell my thought,
7. It seems as though I fling it away;
8. And the charm wherewith a fancy is fraught,
9. When secret, dies with the fleeting lay
10. Into which it is wrought.

11. So my butterfly-dreams their golden wings
12. But seldom unfurl from their chrysalis;
13. And thus I retain my loveliest things,
14. While the world, in its worldliness, does not miss
15. What a poet sings.
