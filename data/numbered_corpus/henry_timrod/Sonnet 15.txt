1. True Christian, tender husband, gentle Sire,
2. A stricken household mourns thee, but its loss
3. Is Heaven's gain and thine; upon the cross
4. God hangs the crown, the pinion, and the lyre:
5. And thou hast won them all.  Could we desire
6. To quench that diadem's celestial light,
7. To hush thy song and stay thy heavenward flight,
8. Because we miss thee by this autumn fire?
9. Ah, no! ah, no! -- chant on! -- soar on! -- Reign on!
10. For we are better -- thou art happier thus;
11. And haply from the splendor of thy throne,
12. Or haply from the echoes of thy psalm,
13. Something may fall upon us, like the calm
14. To which thou shalt hereafter welcome us!
