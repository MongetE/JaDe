1. While I recline
2. At ease beneath
3. This immemorial pine,
4. Small sphere!
5. (By dusky fingers brought this morning here
6. And shown with boastful smiles),
7. I turn thy cloven sheath,
8. Through which the soft white fibres peer,
9. That, with their gossamer bands,
10. Unite, like love, the sea-divided lands,
11. And slowly, thread by thread,
12. Draw forth the folded strands,
13. Than which the trembling line,
14. By whose frail help yon startled spider fled
15. Down the tall spear-grass from his swinging bed,
16. Is scarce more fine;
17. And as the tangled skein
18. Unravels in my hands,
19. Betwixt me and the noonday light,
20. A veil seems lifted, and for miles and miles
21. The landscape broadens on my sight,
22. As, in the little boll, there lurked a spell
23. Like that which, in the ocean shell,
24. With mystic sound,
25. Breaks down the narrow walls that hem us round,
26. And turns some city lane
27. Into the restless main,
28. With all his capes and isles!

29. Yonder bird,
30. Which floats, as if at rest,
31. In those blue tracts above the thunder, where
32. No vapors cloud the stainless air,
33. And never sound is heard,
34. Unless at such rare time
35. When, from the City of the Blest,
36. Rings down some golden chime,
37. Sees not from his high place
38. So vast a cirque of summer space
39. As widens round me in one mighty field,
40. Which, rimmed by seas and sands,
41. Doth hail its earliest daylight in the beams
42. Of gray Atlantic dawns;
43. And, broad as realms made up of many lands,
44. Is lost afar
45. Behind the crimson hills and purple lawns
46. Of sunset, among plains which roll their streams
47. Against the Evening Star!
48. And lo!
49. To the remotest point of sight,
50. Although I gaze upon no waste of snow,
51. The endless field is white;
52. And the whole landscape glows,
53. For many a shining league away,
54. With such accumulated light
55. As Polar lands would flash beneath a tropic day!
56. Nor lack there (for the vision grows,
57. And the small charm within my hands -
58. More potent even than the fabled one,
59. Which oped whatever golden mystery
60. Lay hid in fairy wood or magic vale,
61. The curious ointment of the Arabian tale -
62. Beyond all mortal sense
63. Doth stretch my sight's horizon, and I see,
64. Beneath its simple influence,
65. As if with Uriel's crown,
66. I stood in some great temple of the Sun,
67. And looked, as Uriel, down!)
68. Nor lack there pastures rich and fields all green
69. With all the common gifts of God,
70. For temperate airs and torrid sheen
71. Weave Edens of the sod;
72. Through lands which look one sea of billowy gold
73. Broad rivers wind their devious ways;
74. A hundred isles in their embraces fold
75. A hundred luminous bays;
76. And through yon purple haze
77. Vast mountains lift their plumed peaks cloud-crowned;
78. And, save where up their sides the ploughman creeps,
79. An unhewn forest girds them grandly round,
80. In whose dark shades a future navy sleeps!
81. Ye Stars, which, though unseen, yet with me gaze
82. Upon this loveliest fragment of the earth!
83. Thou Sun, that kindlest all thy gentlest rays
84. Above it, as to light a favorite hearth!
85. Ye Clouds, that in your temples in the West
86. See nothing brighter than its humblest flowers!
87. And you, ye Winds, that on the ocean's breast
88. Are kissed to coolness ere ye reach its bowers!
89. Bear witness with me in my song of praise,
90. And tell the world that, since the world began,
91. No fairer land hath fired a poet's lays,
92. Or given a home to man!

93. But these are charms already widely blown!
94. His be the meed whose pencil's trace
95. Hath touched our very swamps with grace,
96. And round whose tuneful way
97. All Southern laurels bloom;
98. The Poet of 'The Woodlands', unto whom
99. Alike are known
100. The flute's low breathing and the trumpet's tone,
101. And the soft west wind's sighs;
102. But who shall utter all the debt,
103. O Land wherein all powers are met
104. That bind a people's heart,
105. The world doth owe thee at this day,
106. And which it never can repay,
107. Yet scarcely deigns to own!
108. Where sleeps the poet who shall fitly sing
109. The source wherefrom doth spring
110. That mighty commerce which, confined
111. To the mean channels of no selfish mart,
112. Goes out to every shore
113. Of this broad earth, and throngs the sea with ships
114. That bear no thunders; hushes hungry lips
115. In alien lands;
116. Joins with a delicate web remotest strands;
117. And gladdening rich and poor,
118. Doth gild Parisian domes,
119. Or feed the cottage-smoke of English homes,
120. And only bounds its blessings by mankind!
121. In offices like these, thy mission lies,
122. My Country! and it shall not end
123. As long as rain shall fall and Heaven bend
124. In blue above thee; though thy foes be hard
125. And cruel as their weapons, it shall guard
126. Thy hearth-stones as a bulwark; make thee great
127. In white and bloodless state;
128. And haply, as the years increase -
129. Still working through its humbler reach
130. With that large wisdom which the ages teach -
131. Revive the half-dead dream of universal peace!
132. As men who labor in that mine
133. Of Cornwall, hollowed out beneath the bed
134. Of ocean, when a storm rolls overhead,
135. Hear the dull booming of the world of brine
136. Above them, and a mighty muffled roar
137. Of winds and waters, yet toil calmly on,
138. And split the rock, and pile the massive ore,
139. Or carve a niche, or shape the arch|'ed roof;
140. So I, as calmly, weave my woof
141. Of song, chanting the days to come,
142. Unsilenced, though the quiet summer air
143. Stirs with the bruit of battles, and each dawn
144. Wakes from its starry silence to the hum
145. Of many gathering armies. Still,
146. In that we sometimes hear,
147. Upon the Northern winds, the voice of woe
148. Not wholly drowned in triumph, though I know
149. The end must crown us, and a few brief years
150. Dry all our tears,
151. I may not sing too gladly. To Thy will
152. Resigned, O Lord! we cannot all forget
153. That there is much even Victory must regret.
154. And, therefore, not too long
155. From the great burthen of our country's wrong
156. Delay our just release!
157. And, if it may be, save
158. These sacred fields of peace
159. From stain of patriot or of hostile blood!
160. Oh, help us, Lord! to roll the crimson flood
161. Back on its course, and, while our banners wing
162. Northward, strike with us! till the Goth shall cling
163. To his own blasted altar-stones, and crave
164. Mercy; and we shall grant it, and dictate
165. The lenient future of his fate
166. There, where some rotting ships and crumbling quays
167. Shall one day mark the Port which ruled the Western seas.
