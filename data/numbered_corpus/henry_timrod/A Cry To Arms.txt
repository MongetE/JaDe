1. Ho! woodsmen of the mountain side!
2. Ho! dwellers in the vales!
3. Ho! ye who by the chafing tide
4. Have roughened in the gales!
5. Leave barn and byre, leave kin and cot,
6. Lay by the bloodless spade;
7. Let desk, and case, and counter rot,
8. And burn your books of trade.

9. The despot roves your fairest lands;
10. And till he flies or fears,
11. Your fields must grow but arm|\ed bands,
12. Your sheaves be sheaves of spears!
13. Give up to mildew and to rust
14. The useless tools of gain;
15. And feed your country's sacred dust
16. With floods of crimson rain!

17. Come, with the weapons at your call --
18. With musket, pike, or knife;
19. He wields the deadliest blade of all
20. Who lightest holds his life.
21. The arm that drives its unbought blows
22. With all a patriot's scorn,
23. Might brain a tyrant with a rose,
24. Or stab him with a thorn.

25. Does any falter? let him turn
26. To some brave maiden's eyes,
27. And catch the holy fires that burn
28. In those sublunar skies.
29. Oh! could you like your women feel,
30. And in their spirit march,
31. A day might see your lines of steel
32. Beneath the victor's arch.

33. What hope, O God! would not grow warm
34. When thoughts like these give cheer?
35. The Lily calmly braves the storm,
36. And shall the Palm-tree fear?
37. No! rather let its branches court
38. The rack that sweeps the plain;
39. And from the Lily's regal port
40. Learn how to breast the strain!

41. Ho! woodsmen of the mountain side!
42. Ho! dwellers in the vales!
43. Ho! ye who by the roaring tide
44. Have roughened in the gales!
45. Come! flocking gayly to the fight,
46. From forest, hill, and lake;
47. We battle for our Country's right,
48. And for the Lily's sake!
