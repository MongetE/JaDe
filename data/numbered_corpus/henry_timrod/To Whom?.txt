1. Awake upon a couch of pain,
2. I see a star betwixt the trees;
3. Across yon darkening field of cane,
4. Comes slow and soft the evening breeze.
5. My curtain's folds are faintly stirred;
6. And moving lightly in her rest,
7. I hear the chirrup of a bird,
8. That dreameth in some neighboring nest.

9. Last night I took no note of these --
10. How it was passed I scarce can say;
11. 'T was not in prayers to Heaven for ease,
12. 'T was not in wishes for the day.
13. Impatient tears, and passionate sighs,
14. Touched as with fire the pulse of pain, --
15. I cursed, and cursed the wildering eyes
16. That burned this fever in my brain.

17. Oh! blessings on the quiet hour!
18. My thoughts in calmer current flow;
19. She is not conscious of her power,
20. And hath no knowledge of my woe.
21. Perhaps, if like yon peaceful star,
22. She looked upon my burning brow,
23. She would not pity from afar,
24. But kiss me as the breeze does now.
