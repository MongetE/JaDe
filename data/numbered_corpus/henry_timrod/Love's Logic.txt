1. And if I ask thee for a kiss,
2. I ask no more than this sweet breeze,
3. With far less title to the bliss,
4. Steals every minute at his ease.
5. And yet how placid is thy brow!
6. It seems to woo the bold caress,
7. While now he takes his kiss, and now
8. All sorts of freedoms with thy dress.

9. Or if I dare thy hand to touch,
10. Hath nothing pressed its palm before?
11. A flower, I'm sure, hath done as much,
12. And ah! some senseless diamond more.
13. It strikes me, love, the very rings,
14. Now sparkling on that hand of thine,
15. Could tell some truly startling things,
16. If they had tongues or touch like mine.

17. Indeed, indeed, I do not know
18. Of all that thou hast power to grant,
19. A boon for which I could not show
20. Some pretty precedent extant.
21. Suppose, for instance, I should clasp
22. Thus, -- so, -- and thus! -- thy slender waist --
23. I would not hold within my grasp
24. More than this loosened zone embraced.

25. Oh! put the anger from thine eyes,
26. Or shut them if they still must frown;
27. Those lids, despite yon garish skies,
28. Can bring a timely darkness down.
29. Then, if in that convenient night,
30. My lips should press thy dewy mouth,
31. The touch shall be so soft, so light,
32. Thou 'lt fancy me -- this gentle South.
