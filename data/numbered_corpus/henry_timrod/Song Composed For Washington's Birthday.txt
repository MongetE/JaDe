1. A hundred years and more ago
2. A little child was born --
3. To-day, with pomp of martial show,
4. We hail his natal morn.

5. Who guessed as that poor infant wept
6. Upon a woman's knee,
7. A nation from the centuries stept
8. As weak and frail as he?

9. Who saw the future on his brow
10. Upon that happy morn?
11. We are a mighty nation now
12. Because that child was born.

13. To him, and to his spirit's scope,
14. Besides a glorious home,
15. We owe that what we have and hope
16. Are more than Greece and Rome.
