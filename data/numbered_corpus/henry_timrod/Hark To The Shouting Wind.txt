1. Hark to the shouting Wind!
2. Hark to the flying Rain!
3. And I care not though I never see
4. A bright blue sky again.

5. There are thoughts in my breast to-day
6. That are not for human speech;
7. But I hear them in the driving storm,
8. And the roar upon the beach.

9. And oh, to be with that ship
10. That I watch through the blinding brine!
11. O Wind! for thy sweep of land and sea!
12. O Sea! for a voice like thine!

13. Shout on, thou pitiless Wind,
14. To the frightened and flying Rain!
15. I care not though I never see
16. A calm blue sky again.
