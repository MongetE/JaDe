1. It may be through some foreign grace,
2. And unfamiliar charm of face;
3. It may be that across the foam
4. Which bore her from her childhood's home,
5. By some strange spell, my Katie brought,
6. Along with English creeds and thought --
7. Entangled in her golden hair --
8. Some English sunshine, warmth, and air!
9. I cannot tell -- but here to-day,
10. A thousand billowy leagues away
11. From that green isle whose twilight skies
12. No darker are than Katie's eyes,
13. She seems to me, go where she will,
14. An English girl in England still!

15. I meet her on the dusty street,
16. And daisies spring about her feet;
17. Or, touched to life beneath her tread,
18. An English cowslip lifts its head;
19. And, as to do her grace, rise up
20. The primrose and the buttercup!
21. I roam with her through fields of cane,
22. And seem to stroll an English lane,
23. Which, white with blossoms of the May,
24. Spreads its green carpet in her way!
25. As fancy wills, the path beneath
26. Is golden gorse, or purple heath:
27. And now we hear in woodlands dim
28. Their unarticulated hymn,
29. Now walk through rippling waves of wheat,
30. Now sink in mats of clover sweet,
31. Or see before us from the lawn
32. The lark go up to greet the dawn!
33. All birds that love the English sky
34. Throng round my path when she is by:
35. The blackbird from a neighboring thorn
36. With music brims the cup of morn,
37. And in a thick, melodious rain
38. The mavis pours her mellow strain!
39. But only when my Katie's voice
40. Makes all the listening woods rejoice
41. I hear -- with cheeks that flush and pale --
42. The passion of the nightingale!

43. Anon the pictures round her change,
44. And through an ancient town we range,
45. Whereto the shadowy memory clings
46. Of one of England's Saxon kings,
47. And which to shrine his fading fame
48. Still keeps his ashes and his name.
49. Quaint houses rise on either hand,
50. But still the airs are fresh and bland,
51. As if their gentle wings caressed
52. Some new-born village of the West.
53. A moment by the Norman tower
54. We pause; it is the Sabbath hour!
55. And o'er the city sinks and swells
56. The chime of old St. Mary's bells,
57. Which still resound in Katie's ears
58. As sweet as when in distant years
59. She heard them peal with jocund din
60. A merry English Christmas in!
61. We pass the abbey's ruined arch,
62. And statelier grows my Katie's march,
63. As round her, wearied with the taint
64. Of Transatlantic pine and paint,
65. She sees a thousand tokens cast
66. Of England's venerable Past!
67. Our reverent footsteps lastly claims
68. The younger chapel of St. James,
69. Which, though, as English records run,
70. Not old, had seen full many a sun,
71. Ere to the cold December gale
72. The thoughtful Pilgrim spread his sail.
73. There Katie in her childish days
74. Spelt out her prayers and lisped her praise,
75. And doubtless, as her beauty grew,
76. Did much as other maidens do --
77. Across the pews and down the aisle
78. Sent many a beau-bewildering smile,
79. And to subserve her spirit's need
80. Learned other things beside the creed!
81. There, too, to-day her knee she bows,
82. And by her one whose darker brows
83. Betray the Southern heart that burns
84. Beside her, and which only turns
85. Its thoughts to Heaven in one request,
86. Not all unworthy to be blest,
87. But rising from an earthlier pain
88. Than might beseem a Christian fane.
89. Ah! can the guileless maiden share
90. The wish that lifts that passionate prayer?
91. Is all at peace that breast within?
92. Good angels! warn her of the sin!
93. Alas! what boots it? who can save
94. A willing victim of the wave?
95. Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt?
96. Or gather wine when wine is spilt?

97. We quit the holy house and gain
98. The open air; then, happy twain,
99. Adown familiar streets we go,
100. And now and then she turns to show,
101. With fears that all is changing fast,
102. Some spot that's sacred to her Past.
103. Here by this way, through shadows cool,
104. A little maid, she tripped to school;
105. And there each morning used to stop
106. Before a wonder of a shop
107. Where, built of apples and of pears,
108. Rose pyramids of golden spheres;
109. While, dangling in her dazzled sight,
110. Ripe cherries cast a crimson light,
111. And made her think of elfin lamps,
112. And feast and sport in fairy camps,
113. Whereat, upon her royal throne
114. (Most richly carved in cherry-stone),
115. Titania ruled, in queenly state,
116. The boisterous revels of the f|^ete!
117. 'T was yonder, with their "horrid" noise,
118. Dismissed from books, she met the boys,
119. Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls,
120. Glanced slightly at her sunny curls,
121. And laughed and leaped as reckless by
122. As though no pretty face were nigh!
123. But -- here the maiden grows demure --
124. Indeed she's not so VERY sure,
125. That in a year, or haply twain,
126. Who looked e'er failed to look again,
127. And sooth to say, I little doubt
128. (Some azure day, the truth will out!)
129. That certain baits in certain eyes
130. Caught many an unsuspecting prize;
131. And somewhere underneath these eaves
132. A budding flirt put forth its leaves!

133. Has not the sky a deeper blue,
134. Have not the trees a greener hue,
135. And bend they not with lordlier grace
136. And nobler shapes above the place
137. Where on one cloudless winter morn
138. My Katie to this life was born?
139. Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour
140. When love to sight gave keener power,
141. And lovers looked for special boons
142. In brighter flowers and larger moons.
143. But wave the foliage as it may,
144. And let the sky be ashen gray,
145. Thus much at least a manly youth
146. May hold -- and yet not blush -- as truth:
147. If near that blessed spot of earth
148. Which saw the cherished maiden's birth
149. No softer dews than usual rise,
150. And life there keeps its wonted guise,
151. Yet not the less that spot may seem
152. As lovely as a poet's dream;
153. And should a fervid faith incline
154. To make thereof a sainted shrine,
155. Who may deny that round us throng
156. A hundred earthly creeds as wrong,
157. But meaner far, which yet unblamed
158. Stalk by us and are not ashamed?
159. So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll
160. Ends at this portal, while you roll
161. Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray
162. That may recall some vanished day,
163. I -- let them jeer and laugh who will --
164. Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!

165. So strongly sometimes on the sense
166. These fancies hold their influence,
167. That in long well-known streets I stray
168. Like one who fears to lose his way.
169. The stranger, I, the native, she,
170. Myself, not Kate, had crossed the sea;
171. And changing place, and mixing times,
172. I walk in unfamiliar climes!
173. These houses, free to every breeze
174. That blows from warm Floridian seas,
175. Assume a massive English air,
176. And close around an English square;
177. While, if I issue from the town,
178. An English hill looks greenly down,
179. Or round me rolls an English park,
180. And in the Broad I hear the Larke!
181. Thus when, where woodland violets hide,
182. I rove with Katie at my side,
183. It scarce would seem amiss to say:
184. "Katie! my home lies far away,
185. Beyond the pathless waste of brine,
186. In a young land of palm and pine!
187. There, by the tropic heats, the soul
188. Is touched as if with living coal,
189. And glows with such a fire as none
190. Can feel beneath a Northern sun,
191. Unless -- my Katie's heart attest! --
192. 'T is kindled in an English breast!
193. Such is the land in which I live,
194. And, Katie! such the soul I give.
195. Come! ere another morning beam,
196. We'll cleave the sea with wings of steam;
197. And soon, despite of storm or calm,
198. Beneath my native groves of palm,
199. Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride,
200. The Southron and his English bride!"
