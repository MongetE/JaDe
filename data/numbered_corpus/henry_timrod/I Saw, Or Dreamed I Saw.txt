1. I saw, or dreamed I saw, her sitting lone,
2. Her neck bent like a swan's, her brown eyes thrown
3. On some sweet poem -- his, I think, who sings
4. |Oenone, or the hapless Maud:  no rings
5. Flashed from the dainty fingers, which held back
6. Her beautiful blonde hair.  Ah! would these black
7. Locks of mine own were mingling with it now,
8. And these warm lips were pressed against her brow!
9. And, as she turned a page, methought I heard --
10. Hush! could it be? -- a faintly murmured word,
11. It was so softly dwelt on -- such a smile
12. Played on her brow and wreathed her lip the while
13. That my heart leaped to hear it, and a flame
14. Burned on my forehead -- Sa'ra! -- 't was my name.
