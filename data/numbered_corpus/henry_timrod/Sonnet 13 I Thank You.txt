1. I thank you, kind and best belov|'ed friend,
2. With the same thanks one murmurs to a sister,
3. When, for some gentle favor, he hath kissed her,
4. Less for the gifts than for the love you send,
5. Less for the flowers than what the flowers convey,
6. If I, indeed, divine their meaning truly,
7. And not unto myself ascribe, unduly,
8. Things which you neither meant nor wished to say,
9. Oh! tell me, is the hope then all misplaced?
10. And am I flattered by my own affection?
11. But in your beauteous gift, methought I traced
12. Something above a short-lived predilection,
13. And which, for that I know no dearer name,
14. I designate as love, without love's flame.
