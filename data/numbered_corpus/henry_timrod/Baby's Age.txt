1. She came with April blooms and showers;
2. We count her little life by flowers.
3. As buds the rose upon her cheek,
4. We choose a flower for every week.
5. A week of hyacinths, we say,
6. And one of heart's-ease, ushered May;
7. And then because two wishes met
8. Upon the rose and violet --
9. I liked the Beauty, Kate, the Nun --
10. The violet and the rose count one.
11. A week the apple marked with white;
12. A week the lily scored in light;
13. Red poppies closed May's happy moon,
14. And tulips this blue week in June.
15. Here end as yet the flowery links;
16. To-day begins the week of pinks;
17. But soon -- so grave, and deep, and wise
18. The meaning grows in Baby's eyes,
19. So VERY deep for Baby's age --
20. We think to date a week with sage!
