1. I saw her, Harry, first, in March --
2. You know the street that leadeth down
3. By the old bridge's crumbling arch? --
4. Just where it leaves the dusty town

5. A lonely house stands grim and dark --
6. You've seen it? then I need not say
7. How quaint the place is -- did you mark
8. An ivied window?  Well! one day,

9. I, chasing some forgotten dream,
10. And in a poet's idlest mood,
11. Caught, as I passed, a white hand's gleam --
12. A shutter opened -- there she stood

13. Training the ivy to its prop.
14. Two dark eyes and a brow of snow
15. Flashed down upon me -- did I stop? --
16. She says I did -- I do not know.

17. But all that day did something glow
18. Just where the heart beats; frail and slight,
19. A germ had slipped its shell, and now
20. Was pushing softly for the light.

21. And April saw me at her feet,
22. Dear month of sunshine and of rain!
23. My very fears were sometimes sweet,
24. And hope was often touched with pain.

25. For she was frank, and she was coy,
26. A willful April in her ways;
27. And in a dream of doubtful joy
28. I passed some truly April days.

29. May came, and on that arch, sweet mouth,
30. The smile was graver in its play,
31. And, softening with the softening South,
32. My April melted into May.

33. She loved me, yet my heart would doubt,
34. And ere I spoke the month was June --
35. One warm still night we wandered out
36. To watch a slowly setting moon.

37. Something which I saw not -- my eyes
38. Were not on heaven -- a star, perchance,
39. Or some bright drapery of the skies,
40. Had caught her earnest, upper glance.

41. And as she paused -- Hal! we have played
42. Upon the very spot -- a fir
43. Just touched me with its dreamy shade,
44. But the full moonlight fell on her --

45. And as she paused -- I know not why --
46. I longed to speak, yet could not speak;
47. The bashful are the boldest -- I --
48. I stooped and gently kissed her cheek.

49. A murmur (else some fragrant air
50. Stirred softly) and the faintest start --
51. O Hal! we were the happiest pair!
52. O Hal! I clasped her heart to heart!

53. And kissed away some tears that gushed;
54. But how she trembled, timid dove,
55. When my soul broke its silence, flushed
56. With a whole burning June of love.

57. Since then a happy year hath sped
58. Through months that seemed all June and May,
59. And soon a March sun, overhead,
60. Will usher in the crowning day.

61. Twelve blessed moons that seemed to glow
62. All summer, Hal! -- my peerless Kate!
63. She is the dearest -- "Angel?" -- no!
64. Thank God! -- but you shall see her -- wait.

65. So all is told!  I count on thee
66. To see the Priest, Hal!  Pass the wine!
67. Here's to my darling wife to be!
68. And here's to -- when thou find'st her -- thine!
