1. Rich in red honors, that upon him lie
2. As lightly as the Summer dews
3. Fall where he won his fame beneath the sky
4. Of tropic Vera Cruz;

5. Bold scorner of the cant that has its birth
6. In feeble or in failing powers;
7. A lover of all frank and genial mirth
8. That wreathes the sword with flowers;

9. He moves amid the warriors of the day,
10. Just such a soldier as the art
11. That builds its trophies upon human clay
12. Moulds of a cheerful heart.

13. I see him in the battle that shall shake,
14. Ere long, old Sumter's haughty crown,
15. And from their dreams of peaceful traffic wake
16. The wharves of yonder town;

17. As calm as one would greet a pleasant guest,
18. And quaff a cup to love and life,
19. He hurls his deadliest thunders with a jest,
20. And laughs amid the strife.

21. Yet not the gravest soldier of them all
22. Surveys a field with broader scope;
23. And who behind that sea-encircled wall
24. Fights with a loftier hope?

25. Gay Chieftain! on the crimson rolls of Fame
26. Thy deeds are written with the sword;
27. But there are gentler thoughts which, with thy name,
28. Thy country's page shall hoard.

29. A nature of that rare and happy cast
30. Which looks, unsteeled, on murder's face;
31. Through what dark scenes of bloodshed hast thou passed,
32. Yet lost no social grace?

33. So, when the bard depicts thee, thou shalt wield
34. The weapon of a tyrant's doom,
35. Round which, inscribed with many a well-fought field,
36. The rose of joy shall bloom.
