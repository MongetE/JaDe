1. If you have seen a richer glow,
2. Pray, tell me where your roses blow!
3. Look! coral-leaved! and -- mark these spots
4. Red staining red in crimson clots,
5. Like a sweet lip bitten through
6. In a pique.  There, where that hue
7. Is spilt in drops, some fairy thing
8. Hath gashed the azure of its wing,
9. Or thence, perhaps, this very morn,
10. Plucked the splinters of a thorn.

11. Rose! I make thy bliss my care!
12. In my lady's dusky hair
13. Thou shalt burn this coming night,
14. With even a richer crimson light.
15. To requite me thou shalt tell --
16. What I might not say as well --
17. How I love her; how, in brief,
18. On a certain crimson leaf
19. In my bosom, is a debt
20. Writ in deeper crimson yet.
21. If she wonder what it be --
22. But she'll guess it, I foresee --
23. Tell her that I date it, pray,
24. From the first sweet night in May.
