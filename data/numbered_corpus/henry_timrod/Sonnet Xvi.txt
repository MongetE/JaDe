1. If I have graced no single song of mine
2. With thy sweet name, they all are full of thee;
3. Thou art my Muse, my 'May', my 'Madeline':
4. But 'Julia'! -- ah! that gentle name to me
5. Is something far too sacred for the throng
6. Of worldly listeners 'round me. Yet ev'n now
7. I weave a chaplet for thy sinless brow; --
8. Wilt thou not wear it? 'T is a fashionable song, --
9. I will not say of what, -- but on it I
10. Have wreaked heart, mind, my love, my hopes of fame,
11. Yet after all it hath no nobler aim
12. Than thy dear praise. Ere many moons pass by,
13. When the lost gem is set, the crown complete,
14. I'll lay a poet's tribute at thy feet.
