1. I

2. It is not winter yet, but that sweet time
3. In autumn when the first cool days are past;
4. A week ago, the leaves were hoar with rime,
5. And some have dropped before the North wind's blast;
6. But the mild hours are back, and at mid-noon,
7. The day hath all the genial warmth of June.

8. II

9. What slender form lies stretched along the mound?
10. Can it be his, the Wanderer's, with that brow
11. Gray in its prime, those eyes that wander round
12. Listlessly, with a jaded glance that now
13. Seems to see nothing where it rests, and then
14. Pores on each trivial object in its ken?

15. III

16. See how a gentle maid's wan fingers clasp
17. The last fond love-notes of some faithless hand;
18. Thus, with a transient interest, his weak grasp
19. Holds a few leaves as when of old he scanned
20. The meaning in their gold and crimson streaks;
21. But the sweet dream has vanished! hush! he speaks!

22. IV

23. "Once more, once more, after long pain and toil,
24. And yet not long, if I should count by years,
25. I breathe my native air, and tread the soil
26. I trod in childhood; if I shed no tears,
27. No happy tears, 't is that their fount is dry,
28. And joy that cannot weep must sigh, must sigh.

29. V

30. "These leaves, my boyish books in days of yore,
31. When, as the weeks sped by, I seemed to stand
32. Ever upon the brink of some wild lore --
33. These leaves shall make my bed, and -- for the hand
34. Of God is on me, chilling brain and breath --
35. I shall not ask a softer couch in death.

36. VI

37. "Here was it that I saw, or dreamed I saw,
38. I know not which, that shape of love and light.
39. Spirit of Song! have I not owned thy law?
40. Have I not taught, or striven to teach the right,
41. And kept my heart as clean, my life as sweet,
42. As mortals may, when mortals mortals meet?

43. VII

44. "Thou know'st how I went forth, my youthful breast
45. On fire with thee, amid the paths of men;
46. Once in my wanderings, my lone footsteps pressed
47. A mountain forest; in a sombre glen,
48. Down which its thundrous boom a cataract flung,
49. A little bird, unheeded, built and sung.

50. VIII

51. "So fell my voice amid the whirl and rush
52. Of human passions; if unto my art
53. Sorrow hath sometimes owed a gentler gush,
54. I know it not; if any Poet-heart
55. Hath kindled at my songs its light divine,
56. I know it not; no ray came back to mine.

57. IX

58. "Alone in crowds, once more I sought to make
59. Of senseless things my friends; the clouds that burn
60. Above the sunset, and the flowers that shake
61. Their odors in the wind -- these would not turn
62. Their faces from me; far from cities, I
63. Forgot the scornful world that passed me by.

64. X

65. "Yet even the world's cold slights I might have borne,
66. Nor fled, though sorrowing; but I shrank at last
67. When one sweet face, too sweet, I thought, for scorn,
68. Looked scornfully upon me; then I passed
69. From all that youth had dreamed or manhood planned,
70. Into the self that none would understand.

71. XI

72. "She was -- I never wronged her womanhood
73. By crowning it with praises not her own --
74. She was all earth's, and earth's, too, in that mood
75. When she brings forth her fairest; I atone
76. Now, in this fading brow and failing frame,
77. That such a soul such soul as mine could tame.

78. XII

79. "Clay to its kindred clay!  I loved, in sooth,
80. Too deeply and too purely to be blest;
81. With something more of lust and less of truth
82. She would have sunk all blushes on my breast;
83. And -- but I must not blame her -- in my ear
84. Death whispers! and the end, thank God! draws near!"

85. XIII

86. Hist! on the perfect silence of the place
87. Comes and dies off a sound like far-off rain
88. With voices mingled; on the Poet's face
89. A shadow, where no shadow should have lain,
90. Falls the next moment:  nothing meets his sight,
91. Yet something moves betwixt him and the light.

92. XIV

93. And a voice murmurs, "Wonder not, but hear!
94. ME to behold again thou need'st not seek;
95. Yet by the dim-felt influence on the air,
96. And by the mystic shadow on thy cheek,
97. Know, though thou mayst not touch with fleshly hands,
98. The genius of thy life beside thee stands!

99. XV

100. "Unto no fault, O weary-hearted one!
101. Unto no fault of man's thou ow'st thy fate;
102. All human hearts that beat this earth upon,
103. All human thoughts and human passions wait
104. Upon the genuine bard, to him belong,
105. And help in their own way the Poet's song.

106. XVI

107. "How blame the world? for the world hast thou wrought?
108. Or wast thou but as one who aims to fling
109. The weight of some unutterable thought
110. Down like a burden? what from questioning
111. Too subtly thy own spirit, and to speech
112. But half subduing themes beyond the reach

113. XVII

114. "Of mortal reason; what from living much
115. In that dark world of shadows, where the soul
116. Wanders bewildered, striving still to clutch
117. Yet never clutching once, a shadowy goal,
118. Which always flies, and while it flies seems near,
119. Thy songs were riddles hard to mortal ear.

120. XVIII

121. "This was the hidden selfishness that marred
122. Thy teachings ever; this the false key-note
123. That on such souls as might have loved thee jarred
124. Like an unearthly language; thou didst float
125. On a strange water; those who stood on land
126. Gazed, but they could not leave their beaten strand.

127. XIX

128. "Your elements were different, and apart --
129. The world's and thine -- and even in those intense
130. And watchful broodings o'er thy inmost heart,
131. It was thy own peculiar difference
132. That thou didst seek; nor didst thou care to find
133. Aught that would bring thee nearer to thy kind.

134. XX

135. "Not thus the Poet, who in blood and brain
136. Would represent his race and speak for all,
137. Weaves the bright woof of that impassioned strain
138. Which drapes, as if for some high festival
139. Of pure delights -- whence few of human birth
140. May rightly be shut out -- the common earth.

141. XXI

142. "As the same law that moulds a planet, rounds
143. A drop of dew, so the great Poet spheres
144. Worlds in himself; no selfish limit bounds
145. A sympathy that folds all characters,
146. All ranks, all passions, and all life almost
147. In its wide circle.  Like some noble host,

148. XXII

149. "He spreads the riches of his soul, and bids
150. Partake who will.  Age has its saws of truth,
151. And love is for the maiden's drooping lids,
152. And words of passion for the earnest youth;
153. Wisdom for all; and when it seeks relief,
154. Tears, and their solace for the heart of grief.

155. XXIII

156. "Nor less on him than thee the mysteries
157. Within him and about him ever weigh --
158. The meanings in the stars, and in the breeze,
159. All the weird wonders of the common day,
160. Truths that the merest point removes from reach,
161. And thoughts that pause upon the brink of speech;

162. XXIV

163. "But on the surface of his song these lie
164. As shadows, not as darkness; and alway,
165. Even though it breathe the secrets of the sky,
166. There is a human purpose in the lay;
167. Thus some tall fir that whispers to the stars
168. Shields at its base a cotter's lattice-bars.

169. XXV

170. "Even such my Poet! for thou still art mine!
171. Thou mightst have been, and now have calmly died,
172. A priest, and not a victim at the shrine;
173. Alas! yet was it all thy fault?  I chide,
174. Perchance, myself within thee, and the fate
175. To which thy power was solely consecrate.

176. XXVI

177. "Thy life hath not been wholly without use,
178. Albeit that use is partly hidden now;
179. In thy unmingled scorn of any truce
180. With this world's specious falsehoods, often thou
181. Hast uttered, through some all unworldly song,
182. Truths that for man might else have slumbered long.

183. XXVII

184. "And these not always vainly on the crowd
185. Have fallen; some are cherished now, and some,
186. In mystic phrases wrapped as in a shroud,
187. Wait the diviner, who as yet is dumb
188. Upon the breast of God -- the gate of birth
189. Closed on a dreamless ignorance of earth.

190. XXVIII

191. "And therefore, though thy name shall pass away,
192. Even as a cloud that hath wept all its showers,
193. Yet as that cloud shall live again one day
194. In the glad grass, and in the happy flowers,
195. So in thy thoughts, though clothed in sweeter rhymes,
196. Thy life shall bear its flowers in future times."
