1. It is a place whither I've often gone
2. For peace, and found it, secret, hushed, and cool,
3. A beautiful recess in neighboring woods.
4. Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall,
5. Arch it o'erhead and column it around,
6. Framing a covert, natural and wild,
7. Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed
8. But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot
9. Unwearied and unweakened.  Sound is here
10. A transient and unfrequent visitor;
11. Yet if the day be calm, not often then,
12. Whilst the high pines in one another's arms
13. Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear
14. Catch the far fall of voices, how remote
15. You know not, and you do not care to know.
16. The turf is soft and green, but not a flower
17. Lights the recess, save one, star-shaped and bright --
18. I do not know its name -- which here and there
19. Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.
20. A narrow opening in the branched roof,
21. A single one, is large enough to show,
22. With that half glimpse a dreamer loves so much,
23. The blue air and the blessing of the sky.
24. Thither I always bent my idle steps,
25. When griefs depressed, or joys disturbed my heart,
26. And found the calm I looked for, or returned
27. Strong with the quiet rapture in my soul.
28. But one day,
29. One of those July days when winds have fled
30. One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind
31. With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt,
32. Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark
33. With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had
34. No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,
35. I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day,
36. Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once
37. No medicinal virtue.
38. Not a leaf
39. Stirred with the whispering welcome which I sought,
40. But in a close and humid atmosphere,
41. Every fair plant and implicated bough
42. Hung lax and lifeless.  Something in the place,
43. Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,
44. And some more secret influence, I thought,
45. Weighed on the sense like sin.  Above I saw,
46. Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,
47. The pallid sky look through a glazed mist
48. Like a blue eye in death.
49. The change, perhaps,
50. Was natural enough; my jaundiced sight,
51. The weather, and the time explain it all:
52. Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot,
53. And shrined it in these verses for my heart.
54. Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought
55. Not less, and in all shades of various moods;
56. But always shun to desecrate the spot
57. By vain repinings, sickly sentiments,
58. Or inconclusive sorrows.  Nature, though
59. Pure as she was in Eden when her breath
60. Kissed the white brow of Eve, doth not refuse,
61. In her own way and with a just reserve,
62. To sympathize with human suffering;
63. But for the pains, the fever, and the fret
64. Engendered of a weak, unquiet heart,
65. She hath no solace; and who seeks her when
66. These be the troubles over which he moans,
67. Reads in her unreplying lineaments
68. Rebukes, that, to the guilty consciousness,
69. Strike like contempt.
