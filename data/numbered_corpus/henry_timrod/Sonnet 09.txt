1. I know not why, but all this weary day,
2. Suggested by no definite grief or pain,
3. Sad fancies have been flitting through my brain;
4. Now it has been a vessel losing way,
5. Rounding a stormy headland; now a gray
6. Dull waste of clouds above a wintry main;
7. And then, a banner, drooping in the rain,
8. And meadows beaten into bloody clay.
9. Strolling at random with this shadowy woe
10. At heart, I chanced to wander hither! Lo!
11. A league of desolate marsh-land, with its lush,
12. Hot grasses in a noisome, tide-left bed,
13. And faint, warm airs, that nestle in the hush,
14. Like whispers round the body of the dead!
