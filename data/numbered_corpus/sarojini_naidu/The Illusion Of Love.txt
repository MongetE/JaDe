1. Beloved, you may be as all men say
2. Only a transient spark
3. Of flickering flame set in loam of clay –
4. I care not …since you kindle all my dark
5. With the immortal lustres of the day.

6. And as all men deem, dearest, you may be
7. Only a common shell
8. Chance-winnowed by the sea-winds from the sea –
9. The subtle murmurs of eternity.

10. And tho’ you are, like men or mortal race,
11. Only a hapless thing
12. That Death may mar and destiny efface –
13. I care not … since unto my heart you bring
14. The very vision of God’s dwelling-place.
