1. In tattered robes that hoard a glittering trace
2. Of bygone colours, broidered to the knee,
3. Behold her, daughter of a wandering race,
4. Tameless, with the bold falcon's agile grace,
5. And the lithe tiger's sinuous majesty.

6. With frugal skill her simple wants she tends,
7. She folds her tawny heifers and her sheep
8. On lonely meadows when the daylight ends,
9. Ere the quick night upon her flock descends
10. Like a black panther from the caves of sleep.

11. Time's river winds in foaming centuries
12. Its changing, swift, irrevocable course
13. To far off and incalculable seas;
14. She is twin-born with primal mysteries,
15. And drinks of life at Time's forgotten source
