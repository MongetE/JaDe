1. LAMP of my life, the lips of Death
2. Hath blown thee out with their sudden breath;
3. Naught shall revive thy vanished spark . . .
4. Love, must I dwell in the living dark?


5. Tree of my life, Death's cruel foot
6. Hath crushed thee down to thy hidden root;
7. Nought shall restore thy glory fled . . .
8. Shall the blossom live when the tree is dead?


9. Life of my life, Death's bitter sword
10. Hath severed us like a broken word,
11. Rent us in twain who are but one . .
12. Shall the flesh survive when the soul is gone?
