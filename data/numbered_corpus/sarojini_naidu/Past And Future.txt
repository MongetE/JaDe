1. The new hath come and now the old retires:
2. And so the past becomes a mountain-cell,
3. Where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell
4. In consecrated calm, forgotten yet
5. Of the keen heart that hastens to forget
6. Old longings in fulfilling new desires.


7. And now the Soul stands in a vague, intense
8. Expectancy and anguish of suspense,
9. On the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees
10. Like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown,
11. His timid future shrinking there alone,
12. Beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries.
