1. O YOUNG through all thy immemorial years!
2. Rise, Mother, rise, regenerate from thy gloom,
3. And, like a bride high-mated with the spheres,
4. Beget new glories from thine ageless womb!


5. The nations that in fettered darkness weep
6. Crave thee to lead them where great mornings break . . . .
7. Mother, O Mother, wherefore dost thou sleep?
8. Arise and answer for thy children's sake!


9. Thy Future calls thee with a manifold sound
10. To crescent honours, splendours, victories vast;
11. Waken, O slumbering Mother and be crowned,
12. Who once wert empress of the sovereign Past.
