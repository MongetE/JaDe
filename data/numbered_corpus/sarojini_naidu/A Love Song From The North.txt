1. Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
2. Wouldst thou recall to my heart, papeeha,
3. Dreams of delight that are gone,
4. When swift to my side came the feet of my lover
5. With stars of the dusk and the dawn?
6. I see the soft wings of the clouds on the river,
7. And jewelled with raindrops the mango-leaves quiver,
8. And tender boughs flower on the plain.....
9. But what is their beauty to me, papeeha,
10. Beauty of blossom and shower, papeeha,
11. That brings not my lover again?
12. Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
13. Wouldst thou revive in my heart, papeeha
14. Grief for the joy that is gone?
15. I hear the bright peacock in glimmering woodlands
16. Cry to its mate in the dawn;
17. I hear the black koel's slow, tremulous wooing,
18. And sweet in the gardens the calling and cooing
19. Of passionate bulbul and dove....
20. But what is their music to me, papeeha
21. Songs of their laughter and love, papeeha,
22. To me, forsaken of love?
