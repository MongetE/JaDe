1. Lightly, O lightly we bear her along,
2. She sways like a flower in the wind of our song;
3. She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream,
4. She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.
5. Gaily, O gaily we glide and we sing,
6. We bear her along like a pearl on a string.
7. Softly, O softly we bear her along,
8. She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;
9. She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,
10. She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride.
11. Lightly, O lightly we glide and we sing,
12. We bear her along like a pearl on a string.
