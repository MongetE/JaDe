1. (Parvati at her lattice)
2. O Love! were you a basil-wreath to twine
3. among my tresses,
4. A jewelled clasp of shining gold to bind around my sleeve,
5. O Love! were you the keora's soul that haunts
6. my silken raiment,
7. A bright, vermilion tassel in the girdles that I weave;

8. O Love! were you the scented fan
9. that lies upon my pillow,
10. A sandal lute, or silver lamp that burns before my shrine,
11. Why should I fear the jealous dawn
12. that spreads with cruel laughter,
13. Sad veils of separation between your face and mine?

14. Haste, O wild-bee hours, to the gardens of the sun set!
15. Fly, wild-parrot day, to the orchards of the west!
16. Come, O tender night, with your sweet,
17. consoling darkness,
18. And bring me my Beloved to the shelter of my breast!

19. (Amar Singh in the saddle)
20. O Love! were you the hooded hawk upon my hand
21. that flutters,
22. Its collar-band of gleaming bells atinkle as I ride,
23. O Love! were you a turban-spray or
24. floating heron-feather,
25. The radiant, swift, unconquered sword
26. that swingeth at my side;

27. O Love! were you a shield against the
28. arrows of my foemen,
29. An amulet of jade against the perils of the way,
30. How should the drum-beats of the dawn
31. divide me from your bosom,
32. Or the union of the midnight be ended with the day?

33. Haste, O wild-deer hours, to the meadows of the sunset!
34. Fly, wild stallion day, to the pastures of the west!
35. Come, O tranquil night, with your soft,
36. consenting darkness,
37. And bear me to the fragrance of my Beloved's breast!
