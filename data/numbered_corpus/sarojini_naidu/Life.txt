1. CHILDREN, ye have not lived, to you it seems
2. Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams,
3. Or carnival of careless joys that leap
4. About your hearts like billows on the deep
5. In flames of amber and of amethyst.


6. Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist
7. Till some resistless hour shall rise and move
8. Your hearts to wake and hunger after love,
9. And thirst with passionate longing for the things
10. That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings.


11. Till ye have battled with great grief and fears,
12. And borne the conflict of dream-shattering years,
13. Wounded with fierce desire and worn with strife,
14. Children, ye have not lived: for this is life.
