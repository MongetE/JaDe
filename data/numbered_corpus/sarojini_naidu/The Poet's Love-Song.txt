1. In noon-tide hours, O Love, secure and strong,
2. I need thee not; mad dreams are mine to bind
3. The world to my desire, and hold the wind
4. A voiceless captive to my conquering song.
5. I need thee not, I am content with these:
6. Keep silence in thy soul, beyond the seas!

7. But in the desolate hour of midnight, when
8. An ectasy of starry silence sleeps
9. And my soul hungers for thy voice, O then,
10. Love, like the magic of wild melodies,
11. Let thy soul answer mine across the seas.
