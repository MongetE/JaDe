1. WHITHER dost thou hide from the magic of my flute-call?
2. In what moonlight-tangled meshes of perfume,
3. Where the clustering keovas guard the squirrel's slumber,
4. Where the deep woods glimmer with the jasmine's bloom?

5. I'll feed thee, O beloved, on milk and wild red honey,
6. I'll bear thee in a basket of rushes, green and white,
7. To a palace-bower where golden-vested maidens
8. Thread with mellow laughter the petals of delight.

9. Whither dost thou loiter, by what murmuring hollows,
10. Where oleanders scatter their ambrosial fire?
11. Come, thou subtle bride of my mellifluous wooing,
12. Come, thou silver-breasted moonbeam of de- sire!
