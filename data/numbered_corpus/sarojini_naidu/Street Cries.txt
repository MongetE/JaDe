1. WHEN dawn's first cymbals beat upon the sky,
2. Rousing the world to labour's various cry,
3. To tend the flock, to bind the mellowing grain,
4. From ardent toil to forge a little gain,
5. And fasting men go forth on hurrying feet,
6. Buy bread, buy bread, rings down the eager street.


7. When the earth falters and the waters swoon
8. With the implacable radiance of noon,
9. And in dim shelters ko√Øls hush their notes,
10. And the faint, thirsting blood in languid throats
11. Craves liquid succour from the cruel heat,
12. Buy fruit, buy fruit, steals down the panting street.


13. When twilight twinkling o'er the gay bazaars,
14. Unfurls a sudden canopy of stars,
15. When lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit
16. On white roof-terraces where lovers sit
17. Drinking together of life's poignant sweet,
18. Buy flowers, buy flowers, floats down the singing street.
