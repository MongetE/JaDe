1. I MUSE among these silent fanes
2. Whose spacious darkness guards your dust;
3. Around me sleep the hoary plains
4. That hold your ancient wars in trust.

5. I pause, my dreaming spirit hears,
6. Across the wind's unquiet tides,
7. The glimmering music of your spears,
8. The laughter of your royal brides.

9. In vain, O Kings, doth time aspire
10. To make your names oblivion's sport,
11. While yonder hill wears like a tier
12. The ruined grandeur of your fort.

13. Though centuries falter and decline,
14. Your proven strongholds shall remain
15. Embodied memories of your line,
16. Incarnate legends of your reign.

17. O Queens, in vain old Fate decreed
18. Your flower-like bodies to the tomb;
19. Death is in truth the vital seed
20. Of your imperishable bloom

21. Each new-born year the bulbuls sing
22. Their songs of your renascent loves;
23. Your beauty wakens with the spring
24. To kindle these pomegranate groves.
