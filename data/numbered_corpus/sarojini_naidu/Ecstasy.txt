1. Cover mine eyes, O my Love!
2. Mine eyes that are weary of bliss
3. As of light that is poignant and strong
4. O silence my lips with a kiss,
5. My lips that are weary of song!
6. Shelter my soul, O my love!
7. My soul is bent low with the pain
8. And the burden of love, like the grace
9. Of a flower that is smitten with rain:
10. O shelter my soul from thy face!
