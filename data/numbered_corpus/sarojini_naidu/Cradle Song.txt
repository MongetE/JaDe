1. FROM groves of spice,
2. O'er fields of rice,
3. Athwart the lotus-stream,
4. I bring for you,
5. Aglint with dew
6. A little lovely dream.

7. Sweet, shut your eyes,
8. The wild fire-fiies
9. Dance through the fairy neem;
10. From the poppy-bole
11. For you I stole
12. A little lovely dream.

13. Dear eyes, good-night,
14. In golden light
15. The stars around you gleam;
16. On you I press
17. With soft caress
18. A little lovely dream.
