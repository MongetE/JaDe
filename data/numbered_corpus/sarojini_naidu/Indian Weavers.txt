1. WEAVERS, weaving at break of day,
2. Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . .
3. Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild,
4. We weave the robes of a new-born child.


5. Weavers, weaving at fall of night,
6. Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . .
7. Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green,
8. We weave the marriage-veils of a queen.


9. Weavers, weaving solemn and still,
10. What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . .
11. White as a feather and white as a cloud,
12. We weave a dead man's funeral shroud.
