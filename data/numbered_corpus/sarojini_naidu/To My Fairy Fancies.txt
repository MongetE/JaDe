1. NAY, no longer I may hold you,
2. In my spirit's soft caresses,
3. Nor like lotus-leaves enfold you
4. In the tangles of my tresses.
5. Fairy fancies, fly away
6. To the white cloud-wildernesses,
7. Fly away!

8. Nay, no longer ye may linger
9. With your laughter-lighted faces,
10. Now I am a thought-worn singer
11. In life's high and lonely places.
12. Fairy fancies, fly away,
13. To bright wind-inwoven spaces,
14. Fly away!
