1. A KOKILA called from a henna-spray:
2. Lira! liree! Lira! liree!
3. Hasten, maidens, hasten away
4. To gather the leaves of the henna-tree.
5. Send your pitchers afloat on the tide,
6. Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old,
7. Grind them in mortars of amber and gold,
8. The fresh green leaves of the henna-tree.


9. A kokila called from a henna-spray:
10. Lira! liree! Lira! liree!
11. Hasten maidens, hasten away
12. To gather the leaves of the henna-tree.
13. The tilka's red for the brow of a bride,
14. And betel-nut's red for lips that are sweet;
15. But, for lily-like fingers and feet,
16. The red, the red of the henna-tree.
