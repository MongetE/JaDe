1. SEE how the speckled sky burns like a pigeon's throat,
2. Jewelled with embers of opal and peridote.


3. See the white river that flashes and scintillates,
4. Curved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates.


5. Hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call
6. Floats like a battle-flag over the city wall.


7. From trellised balconies, languid and luminous
8. Faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous.


9. Leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes,
10. Swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains.


11. Round the high Char Minar sounds of gay cavalcades
12. Blend with the music of cymbals and serenades.


13. Over the city bridge Night comes majestical,
14. Borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival.
