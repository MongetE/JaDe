1. She

2. LIKE a serpent to the calling voice of flutes,
3. Glides my heart into thy fingers, O my Love!
4. Where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above
5. His jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers;
6. And on ripe boughs of many-coloured fruits
7. Bright parrots cluster like vermilion flowers.


8. He

9. Like the perfume in the petals of a rose,
10. Hides thy heart within my bosom, O my love!
11. Like a garland, like a jewel, like a dove
12. That hangs its nest in the asoka-tree.
13. Lie still, O love, until the morning sows
14. Her tents of gold on fields of ivory.
