1. DEIGN, Prince, my tribute to receive,
2. This lyric offering to your name,
3. Who round your jewelled scepter bind
4. The lilies of a poet's fame;
5. Beneath whose sway concordant dwell
6. The peoples whom your laws embrace,
7. In brotherhood of diverse creeds,
8. And harmony of diverse race:

9. The votaries of the Prophet's faith,
10. Of whom you are the crown and chief
11. And they, who bear on Vedic brows
12. Their mystic symbols of belief;
13. And they, who worshipping the sun,
14. Fled o'er the old Iranian sea;
15. And they, who bow to Him who trod
16. The midnight waves of Galilee.

17. Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad
18. The splendours of your court recall,
19. The torches of a Thousand Nights
20. Blaze through a single festival;
21. And Saki-singers down the streets,
22. Pour for us, in a stream divine,
23. From goblets of your love-ghazals
24. The rapture of your Sufi wine.


25. Prince, where your radiant cities smile,
26. Grim hills their sombre vigils keep,
27. Your ancient forests hoard and hold
28. The legends of their centuried sleep;
29. Your birds of peace white-pinioned float
30. O'er ruined fort and storied plain,
31. Your faithful stewards sleepless guard
32. The harvests of your gold and grain.

33. God give you joy, God give you grace
34. To shield the truth and smite the wrong,
35. To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth.
36. To cherish faith and foster song.
37. So may the lustre of your days
38. Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung,
39. Your name within a nation's prayer,
40. Your music on a nation's tongue.
