1. Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,
2. The sunset hangs on a cloud;
3. A golden storm of glittering sheaves,
4. Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,
5. The wild wind blows in a cloud.

6. Hark to a voice that is calling
7. To my heart in the voice of the wind:
8. My heart is weary and sad and alone,
9. For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
10. And why should I stay behind?
