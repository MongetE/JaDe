1. WHEN from my cheek I lift my veil,
2. The roses turn with envy pale,
3. And from their pierced hearts, rich with pain,
4. Send forth their fragrance like a wail.


5. Or if perchance one perfumed tress
6. Be lowered to the wind's caress,
7. The honeyed hyacinths complain,
8. And languish in a sweet distress.


9. And, when I pause, still groves among,
10. (Such loveliness is mine) a throng
11. Of nightingales awake and strain
12. Their souls into a quivering song.
