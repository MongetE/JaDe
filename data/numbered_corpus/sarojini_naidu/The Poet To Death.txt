1. TARRY a while, O Death, I cannot die
2. While yet my sweet life burgeons with its spring;
3. Fair is my youth, and rich the echoing boughs
4. Where dhadikulas sing.


5. Tarry a while, O Death, I cannot die
6. With all my blossoming hopes unharvested,
7. My joys ungarnered, all my songs unsung,
8. And all my tears unshed.


9. Tarry a while, till I am satisfied
10. Of love and grief, of earth and altering sky;
11. Till all my human hungers are fulfilled,
12. O Death, I cannot die!
