1. The serpents are asleep among the poppies,
2. The fireflies light the soundless panther's way
3. To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying,
4. And parrot-plumes outshine the dying day.
5. O soft! the lotus-buds upon the stream
6. Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream.


7. A caste-mark on the azure brows of Heaven,
8. The golden moon burns sacred, solemn, bright
9. The winds are dancing in the forest-temple,
10. And swooning at the holy feet of Night.
11. Hush! in the silence mystic voices sing
12. And make the gods their incense-offering.
