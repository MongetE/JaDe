1. UNWILLING priestess in thy cruel fane,
2. Long hast thou held me, pitiless god of Pain,
3. Bound to thy worship by reluctant vows,
4. My tired breast girt with suffering, and my brows
5. Anointed with perpetual weariness.
6. Long have I borne thy service, through the stress
7. Of rigorous years, sad days and slumberless nights,
8. Performing thine inexorable rites.


9. For thy dark altars, balm nor milk nor rice,
10. But mine own soul thou'st ta'en for sacrifice:

11. All the rich honey of my youth's desire,
12. And all the sweet oils from my crushed life drawn,
13. And all my flower-like dreams and gem-like fire
14. Of hopes up-leaping like the light of dawn.


15. I have no more to give, all that was mine
16. Is laid, a wrested tribute, at thy shrine;
17. Let me depart, for my whole soul is wrung,
18. And all my cheerless orisons are sung;
19. Let me depart, with faint limbs let me creep
20. To some dim shade and sink me down to sleep.
