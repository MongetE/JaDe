1. Nay, do not grieve tho' life be full of sadness,
2. Dawn will not veil her spleandor for your grief,
3. Nor spring deny their bright, appointed beauty
4. To lotus blossom and ashoka leaf.

5. Nay, do not pine, tho' life be dark with trouble,
6. Time will not pause or tarry on his way;
7. To-day that seems so long, so strange, so bitter,
8. Will soon be some forgotten yesterday.

9. Nay, do not weep; new hopes, new dreams, new faces,
10. The unspent joy of all the unborn years,
11. Will prove your heart a traitor to its sorrow,
12. And make your eyes unfaithful to their tears.
