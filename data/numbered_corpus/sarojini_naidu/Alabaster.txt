1. LIKE this alabaster box whose art
2. Is frail as a cassia-flower, is my heart,
3. Carven with delicate dreams and wrought
4. With many a subtle and exquisite thought.


5. Therein I treasure the spice and scent
6. Of rich and passionate memories blent
7. Like odours of cinnamon, sandal and clove,
8. Of song and sorrow and life and love.
