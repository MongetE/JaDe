1. Here, shunning idleness at once and praise,
2. This radiant pile nine rural sisters raise;
3. The glittering emblem of each spotless dame,
4. Clear as her soul and shining as her frame;
5. Beauty which nature only can impart,
6. And such a polish as disgraces art;
7. But Fate disposed them in this humble sort,
8. And hid in deserts what would charm a Court.
