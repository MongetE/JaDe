1. Phryne had talents for mankind,
2. Open she was, and unconfin'd,
3. Like some free port of trade:
4. Merchants unloaded here their freight,

7. Her learning and good breeding such,
8. Whether th' Italian or the Dutch,
9. Spaniards or French came to her:
10. To all obliging she'd appear:

11. 'Twas
12. Si Signior

14. Yaw Mynheer
15. ,
16. 'Twas
17. S'il vous plaist, Monsieur.

18. Obscure by birth, renown'd by crimes,
19. Still changing names, religions, climes,
20. At length she turns a Bride:
21. In di'monds, pearls, and rich brocades,
22. She shines the first of batter'd jades,
23. And flutters in her pride.

24. So have I known those Insects fair
25. (Which curious Germans hold so rare)
26. Still vary shapes and dyes;
27. Still gain new Titles with new forms;
28. First grubs obscene, then wriggling worms,
29. Then painted butterflies.
