1. When wise Ulysses, from his native coast
2. Long kept by wars, and long by tempests toss'd,
3. Arrived at last, poor, old, disguised, alone,
4. To all his friends, and ev'n his Queen unknown,
5. Changed as he was, with age, and toils, and cares,
6. Furrow'd his rev'rend face, and white his hairs,
7. In his own palace forc'd to ask his bread,
8. Scorn'd by those slaves his former bounty fed,
9. Forgot of all his own domestic crew,
10. The faithful Dog alone his rightful master knew!

11. Unfed, unhous'd, neglected, on the clay
12. Like an old servant now cashier'd, he lay;
13. Touch'd with resentment of ungrateful man,
14. And longing to behold his ancient lord again.
15. Him when he saw he rose, and crawl'd to meet,
16. ('Twas all he could) and fawn'd and kiss'd his feet,
17. Seiz'd with dumb joy; then falling by his side,
18. Own'd his returning lord, look'd up, and died!
