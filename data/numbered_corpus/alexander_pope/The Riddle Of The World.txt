2. The proper study of Mankind is Man.
3. Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,
4. A Being darkly wise, and rudely great:
5. With too much knowledge for the Sceptic side,
6. With too much weakness for the Stoic's pride,
7. He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;
8. In doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast;
9. In doubt his mind and body to prefer;
10. Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err;
11. Whether he thinks to little, or too much;
12. Chaos of Thought and Passion, all confus'd;
13. Still by himself, abus'd or disabus'd;
14. Created half to rise and half to fall;
15. Great Lord of all things, yet a prey to all,
16. Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd;
17. The glory, jest and riddle of the world.
