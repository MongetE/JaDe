1. I.
2. To one fair lady out of Court,
3. And two fair ladies in,
4. Who think the Turk and Pope a sport,
5. And wit and love no sin!
6. Come, these soft lines, with nothing stiff in,
7. To Bellenden, Lepell, and Griffin.
8. With a fa, la, la.
9. II.

10. What passes in the dark third row,
11. And what behind the scene,
12. Couches and crippled chairs I know,
13. And garrets hung with green;
14. I know the swing of sinful hack,
15. Where many damsels cry alack.
16. With a fa, la, la.
17. III.
18. Then why to Courts should I repair,
19. Where's such ado with Townsend?
20. To hear each mortal stamp and swear,
21. And every speech with 'Zounds' end;
22. To hear them rail at honest Sunderland,
23. And rashly blame the realm of Blunderland.
24. With a fa, la, la.
25. IV.
26. Alas! like Schutz I cannot pun,
27. Like Grafton court the Germans;
28. Tell Pickenbourg how slim she's grown,
29. Like Meadows run to sermons;
30. To court ambitious men may roam,
31. But I and Marlbro' stay at home.
32. With a fa, la, la.
33. V.
34. In truth, by what I can discern,
35. Of courtiers, 'twixt you three,
36. Some wit you have, and more may learn
37. From Court, than Gay or Me:
38. Perhaps, in time, you'll leave high diet,
39. To sup with us on milk and quiet.
40. With a fa, la, la.
41. VI.
42. At Leicester Fields, a house full nigh,
43. With door all painted green,
44. (A Milliner, I mean);
45. There may you meet us three to three,
46. For Gay can well make two of Me.
47. With a fa, la, la.
48. VII.
49. But should you catch the prudish itch,
50. And each become a coward,
51. Bring sometimes with you lady Rich,
52. And sometimes mistress Howard;
53. For virgins, to keep chaste, must go
54. Abroad with such as are not so.
55. With a fa, la, la.
56. VIII.
57. And thus, fair maids, my ballad ends;
58. God send the king safe landing;
59. And make all honest ladies friends
60. To armies that are standing;
61. Preserve the limits of those nations,
62. And take off ladies' limitations.
63. With a fa, la, la.
