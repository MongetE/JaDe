1. I know the thing that's most uncommon;
2. (Envy be silent and attend!)
3. I know a Reasonable Woman,
4. Handsome and witty, yet a Friend.

5. Not warp'd by Passion, aw'd by Rumour,
6. Not grave thro' Pride, or gay thro' Folly,
7. An equal Mixture of good Humour,
8. And sensible soft Melancholy.

9. `Has she no Faults then (Envy says) Sir?'
10. Yes she has one, I must aver:
11. When all the World comspires to praise her,
12. The Woman's deaf, and does not hear.
