1. You know where you did despise
2. (Tother day) my little Eyes,
3. Little Legs, and little Thighs,
4. And some things, of little Size,
5. You know where.
6. You, tis true, have fine black eyes,
7. Taper legs, and tempting Thighs,
8. Yet what more than all we prize
9. Is a Thing of little Size,
10. You know where.
