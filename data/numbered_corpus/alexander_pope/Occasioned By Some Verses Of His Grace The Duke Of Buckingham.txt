1. Muse, 'tis enough: at length thy labour ends,
2. And thou shalt live, for Buckingham commends.
3. Let Crowds and Critics now my verse assail,
4. Let Dennis write, and nameless numbers rail:
5. This more than pays whole years of thankless pain;
6. Time, health, and fortune are not lost in vain.
7. Sheffield approves, consenting Phoebus bends,
8. And I and Malice from this hour are friends.
