1. In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore,
2. And cite those Sapho's we admire no more:
3. Fate doom'd the Fall of ev'ry Female Wit,
4. But doom'd it then when first Ardelia writ.
5. Of all Examples by the World confest,
6. I knew Ardelia could not quote the best;
7. Who, like her Mistress on Britannia's Throne;
8. Fights, and subdues in Quarrels not her own.
9. To write their Praise you but in vain essay;
10. Ev'n while you write, you take that Praise away:
11. Light to the Stars the Sun does thus restore,
12. But shines himself till they are seen no more.
