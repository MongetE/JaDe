1. Tho' Artemisia talks, by fits,
2. Of councils, classics, fathers, wits;
3. Reads Malbranche, Boyle, and Locke;
4. Yet in some things methinks she fails,
5. 'Twere well if she would pare her nails,
6. And wear a cleaner smock.

7. Haughty and huge as High-Dutch bride,
8. Such nastiness, and so much pride
9. Are oddly join'd by fate:
10. On her large squab you find her spread,
11. Like a fat corpse upon a bed,
12. That lies and stinks in state.

13. She wears no colours (sign of grace)
14. On any part except her face;
15. All white and black beside:
16. Dauntless her look, her gesture proud,
17. Her voice theatrically loud,
18. And masculine her stride.

19. So have I seen, in black and white
20. A prating thing, a Magpye hight,
21. Majestically stalk;
22. A stately, worthless animal,
23. That plies the tongue, and wags the tail,
24. All flutter, pride, and talk.
