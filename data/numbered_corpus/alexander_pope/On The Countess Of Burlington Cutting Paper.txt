1. Pallas grew vapourish once, and odd,
2. She would not do the least right thing,
3. Either for goddess, or for god,
4. Nor work, nor play, nor paint, nor sing.

5. Jove frown'd, and, 'Use,' he cried, 'those eyes
6. So skilful, and those hands so taper;
7. Do something exquisite and wise -'
8. She bow'd, obey'd him, - and cut paper.

9. This vexing him who gave her birth,
10. Thought by all heaven a burning shame;
11. What does she next, but bids, on earth,
12. Her Burlington do just the same.

13. Pallas, you give yourself strange airs;
14. But sure you'll find it hard to spoil
15. The sense and taste of one that bears
16. The name of Saville and of Boyle.

17. Alas! one bad example shown;
18. How quickly all the sex pursue!
19. See, madam, see the arts o'erthrown,
20. Between John Overton and you!
