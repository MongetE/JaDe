1. Begone, ye Critics, and restrain your spite,
2. Codrus writes on, and will for ever write,
3. The heaviest Muse the swiftest course has gone,
4. As clocks run fastest when most lead is on;
5. What tho' no bees around your cradle flew,
6. Nor on your lips distill'd their golden dew;
7. Yet have we oft discover'd in their stead
8. When you, like Orpheus, strike the warbling lyre.
9. Attentive blocks stand round you and admire.
10. Wit pass'd through thee no longer is the same,
11. As meat digested takes a diff'rent name;
12. But sense must sure thy safest plunder be,
13. Since no reprisals can be made on thee.
14. Thus thou may'st rise, and in thy daring flight
15. (Though ne'er so weighty) reach a wondrous height.
16. So, forced from engines, lead itself can fly,
17. Sure Bavius copied Maevius to the full,
18. And Chaerilus taught Codrus to be dull;
19. Therefore, dear friend, at my advice give o'er
20. This needless labour; and contend no more
21. To prove a dull succession to be true,
22. Since 'tis enough we find it so in you.
