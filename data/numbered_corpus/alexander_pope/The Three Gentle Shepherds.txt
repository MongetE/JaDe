1. Of gentle Philips will I ever sing,
2. With gentle Philips shall the valleys ring.
3. My numbers too for ever will I vary,
4. With gentle Budgell and with gentle Carey.
5. Or if in ranging of the names I judge ill,
6. With gentle Carey and with gentle Budgell:
7. Oh! may all gentle bards together place ye,
8. Men of good hearts, and men of delicacy.
9. May satire ne'er befool ye, or beknave ye,
10. And from all wits that have a knack, God save ye.
