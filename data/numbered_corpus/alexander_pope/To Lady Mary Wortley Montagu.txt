10. With musty dull rules,

16. 'Twas a woman at first
17. (Indeed she was curst)

25. Which to your whole sex does belong;

27. From a second bright Eve,
28. The knowledge of right and of wrong.

29. V.

31. Hard doom did receive,
32. When only one apple had she,

35. Who tasting, have robb'd the whole tree?
