1. All hail, once pleasing, once inspiring shade!
2. Scene of my youthful loves and happier hours!
3. Where the kind Muses met me as I stray'd,
4. And gently press'd my hand, and said 'Be ours!-
5. Take all thou e'er shalt have, a constant Muse:
6. At Court thou may'st be liked, but nothing gain:
7. Stock thou may'st buy and sell, but always lose,
8. And love the brightest eyes, but love in vain.'
