1. Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate,
2. All but the page prescrib'd, their present state:
3. From brutes what men, from men what spirits know:
4. Or who could suffer being here below?
5. The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today,
6. Had he thy reason, would he skip and play?
7. Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry food,
8. And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.
9. Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n,
10. That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heav'n:
11. Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,
12. A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,
13. Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,
14. And now a bubble burst, and now a world.

15. Hope humbly then; with trembling pinions soar;
16. Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.
17. What future bliss, he gives not thee to know,
18. But gives that hope to be thy blessing now.
19. Hope springs eternal in the human breast:
20. Man never is, but always to be blest:
21. The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home,
22. Rests and expatiates in a life to come.

23. Lo! the poor Indian, whose untutor'd mind
24. Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
25. His soul, proud science never taught to stray
26. Far as the solar walk, or milky way;
27. Yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n,
28. Behind the cloud topp'd hill, an humbler heav'n;
29. Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,
30. Some happier island in the wat'ry waste,
31. Where slaves once more their native land behold,
32. No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.
33. To be, contents his natural desire,
34. He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;
35. But thinks, admitted to that equal sky.
