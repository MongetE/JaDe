1. Goddess of woods, tremendous in the chase,
2. To mountain wolves and all the savage race,
3. Wide o'er the aerial vault extend thy sway,
4. And o'er the infernal regions void of day.
5. On thy third reign look down; disclose our fate,
6. In what new station shall we fix our seat?
7. When shall we next thy hallow'd altars raise,
8. And choirs of virgins celebrate thy praise?
