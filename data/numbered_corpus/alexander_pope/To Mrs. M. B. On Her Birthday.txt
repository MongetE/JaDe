1. Oh be thou blest with all that Heav'n can send,
2. Long Health, long Youth, long Pleasure, and a Friend:
3. Not with those Toys the female world admire,
4. Riches that vex, and Vanities that tire.
5. With added years if Life bring nothing new,
6. But, like a Sieve, let ev'ry blessing thro',
7. Some joy still lost, as each vain year runs o'er,
8. And all we gain, some sad Reflection more;
9. Is that a Birth-Day? 'tis alas! too clear,
10. 'Tis but the funeral of the former year.
11. Let Joy or Ease, let Affluence or Content,
12. And the gay Conscience of a life well spent,
13. Calm ev'ry thought, inspirit ev'ry grace.
14. Glow in thy heart, and smile upon thy face.
15. Let day improve on day, and year on year,
16. Without a Pain, a Trouble, or a Fear;
17. Till Death unfelt that tender frame destroy,
18. In some soft Dream, or Extasy of joy,
19. Peaceful sleep out the Sabbath of the Tomb,
20. And wake to Raptures in a Life to come.
