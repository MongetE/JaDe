1. .      By night when others soundly slept
2. And hath at once both ease and Rest,
3. My waking eyes were open kept
4. And so to lie I found it best.

5. .
6. I sought him whom my Soul did Love,
7. With tears I sought him earnestly.
8. He bow'd his ear down from Above.
9. In vain I did not seek or cry.
10. .

11. My hungry Soul he fill'd with Good;
12. He in his Bottle put my tears,
13. My smarting wounds washt in his blood,
14. And banisht thence my Doubts and fears.

15. .
16. What to my Saviour shall I give
17. Who freely hath done this for me?
18. I'll serve him here whilst I shall live
19. And Loue him to Eternity
