1. What shall I render to Thy name
2. Or how Thy praises speak?
3. My thanks how shall I testify?
4. O Lord, Thou know'st I'm weak.

5. I owe so much, so little can
6. Return unto Thy name,
7. Confusion seizes on my soul,
8. And I am filled with shame.

9. O Thou that hearest prayers, Lord,
10. To Thee shall come all flesh
11. Thou hast me heard and answered,
12. My plaints have had access.

13. What did I ask for but Thou gav'st?
14. What could I more desire?
15. But thankfulness even all my days
16. I humbly this require.

17. Thy mercies, Lord, have been so great
18. In number numberless,
19. Impossible for to recount
20. Or any way express.

21. O help Thy saints that sought Thy face
22. T' return unto Thee praise
23. And walk before Thee as they ought,
24. In strict and upright ways.
