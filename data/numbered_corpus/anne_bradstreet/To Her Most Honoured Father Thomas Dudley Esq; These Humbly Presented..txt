1. Dear Sir of late delighted with the sight
2. Of your four Sisters cloth'd in black and white,
3. Of fairer Dames the Sun, ne'r saw the face;
4. Though made a pedestal for Adams Race;
5. Their worth so shines in these rich lines you show
6. Their paralels to finde I scarcely know
7. To climbe their Climes, I have nor strength nor skill
8. To mount so high requires an Eagles quill;
9. Yet view thereof did cause my thoughts to soar;
10. My lowly pen might wait upon these four
11. I bring my four times four, now meanly clad
12. To do their homage, unto yours, full glad:
13. Who for their Age, their worth and quality
14. Might seem of yours to claim precedency:
15. But by my humble hand, thus rudely pen'd
16. They are, your bounden handmaids to attend
17. These same are they, from whom we being have
18. These are of all, the Life, the Nurse, the Grave,
19. These are the hot, the cold, the moist, the dry,
20. That sink, that swim, that fill, that upwards fly,
21. Of these consists our bodies, Cloathes and Food,
22. The World, the useful, hurtful, and the good,
23. Sweet harmony they keep, yet jar oft times
24. Their discord doth appear, by these harsh rimes
25. Yours did contest for wealth, for Arts, for Age,
26. My first do shew their good, and then their rage.
27. My other foures do intermixed tell
28. Each others faults, and where themselves excell;
29. How hot and dry contend with moist and cold,
30. How Air and Earth no correspondence hold,
31. And yet in equal tempers, how they 'gree
32. How divers natures make one Unity
33. Something of all (though mean) I did intend
34. But fear'd you'ld judge Du Bartas was my friend
35. I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth
36. My goods are true (though poor) I love no stealth
37. But if I did I durst not send them you
38. Who must reward a Thief, but with his due.
39. I shall not need, mine innocence to clear
40. These ragged lines, will do't, when they appear:
41. On what they are, your mild aspect I crave
42. Accept my best, my worst vouchsafe a Grave.
43. From her that to your self, more duty owes
44. Then water in the boundess Ocean flows.
