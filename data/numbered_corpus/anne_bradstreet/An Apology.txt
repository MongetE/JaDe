1. To finish what's begun, was my intent,
2. My thoughts and my endeavours thereto bent;
3. Essays I many made but still gave out,
4. The more I mus'd, the more I was in doubt:
5. The subject large my mind and body weak,
6. With many moe discouragements did speak.
7. All thoughts of further progress laid aside,
8. Though oft perswaded, I as oft deny'd,
9. At length resolv'd, when many years had past,
10. To prosecute my story to the last;
11. And for the same, I hours not few did spend,
12. And weary lines (though lanke) I many pen'd:
13. But 'fore I could accomplish my desire,
14. My papers fell a prey to th'raging fire.
15. And thus my pains (with better things) I lost,
16. Which none had cause to wail, nor I to boast.
17. No more I'le do sith I have suffer'd wrack,
18. Although my Monarchies their legs do lack:
19. Nor matter is't this last, the world now sees,
20. Hath many Ages been upon his knees.
