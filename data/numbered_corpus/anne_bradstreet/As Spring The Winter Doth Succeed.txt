1. May 13, 1657.
2. As spring the winter doth succeed,
3. And leaues the naked Trees doe dresse,
4. The earth all black is cloth'd in green;
5. At svn-shine each their joy expresse.
6. My Svns returned with healing wings.
7. My Soul and Body doth rejoice;
8. My heart exvlts, and praises sings
9. To him that heard my wailing Voice.
10. My winters past, my stormes are gone,
11. And former clowdes seem now all fled;
12. But, if they mvst eclipse again,
13. I'le rvn where I was succoured.
14. I haue a shelter from the storm,
15. A shadow from the fainting heat;
16. I haue accesse vnto his Throne,
17. Who is a God so wondrous great.
18. O hast thou made my Pilgrimage
19. Thvs pleasant, fair, and good;
20. Bless'd me in Youth and elder Age,
21. My Baca made a springing flood?
22. I studiovs am what I shall doe,
23. To show my Duty with delight;
24. All I can giue is but thine own,
25. And at the most a simple mite.
