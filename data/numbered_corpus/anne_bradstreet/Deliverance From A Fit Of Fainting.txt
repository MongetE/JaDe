1. Worthy art Thou, O Lord, of praise,
2. But ah! It's not in me.
3. My sinking heart I pray Thee raise
4. So shall I give it Thee.

5. My life as spider's webb's cut off,
6. Thus fainting have I said,
7. And living man no more shall see
8. But be in silence laid.

9. My feeble spirit Thou didst revive,
10. My doubting Thou didst chide,
11. And though as dead mad'st me alive,
12. I here a while might 'bide.

13. Why should I live but to Thy praise?
14. My life is hid with Thee.
15. O Lord, no longer be my days
16. Than I may fruitful be.
