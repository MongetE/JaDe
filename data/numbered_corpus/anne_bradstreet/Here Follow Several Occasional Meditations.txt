1. By night when others soundly slept,
2. And had at once both case and rest,
3. My waking eyes were open kept
4. And so to lie I found it best.

5. I sought Him whom my soul did love,
6. With tears I sought Him earnestly;
7. He bowed His ear down from above.
8. In vain I did not seek or cry.

9. My hungry soul He filled with good,
10. He in His bottle put my tears,
11. My smarting wounds washed in His blood,
12. And banished thence my doubts and fears.

13. What to my Savior shall I give,
14. Who freely hath done this for me?
15. I'll serve Him here whilst I shall live
16. And love Him to eternity.
