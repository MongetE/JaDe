1. When feares and sorrowes me besett,
2. Then did'st thou rid me out;
3. When heart did faint and spirits quail,
4. Thou comforts me about.
5. Thou rais'st him vp I feard to loose,
6. Regau'st me him again:
7. Distempers thou didst chase away;
8. With strenght didst him sustain.
9. My thankfull heart, with Pen record
10. The Goodnes of thy God;
11. Let thy obedience testefye
12. He taught thee by his rod.
13. And with his staffe did thee support,
14. That thou by both may'st learn;
15. And 'twixt the good and evill way,
16. At last, thou mig'st discern.
17. Praises to him who hath not left
18. My Soul as destitute;
19. Nor turnd his ear away from me,
20. But graunted hath my Suit.
