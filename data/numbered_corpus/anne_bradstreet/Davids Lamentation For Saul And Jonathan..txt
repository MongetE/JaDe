1. 2. Sam. 1. 19.Alas slain is the Head of Israel,
2. Illustrious Saul whose beauty did excell,
3. Upon thy places mountainous and high,
4. How did the Mighty fall, and falling dye?
5. In Gath let not this things be spoken on,
6. Nor published in streets of Askalon,
7. Lest daughters of the Philistines rejoyce,
8. Lest the uncircumcis'd lift up their voice.
9. O Gilbo Mounts, let never pearled dew,
10. Nor fruitfull showres your barren tops bestrew,
11. Nor fields of offrings ever on you grow,
12. Nor any pleasant thing e're may you show;
13. For there the Mighty Ones did soon decay,
14. The shield of Saul was vilely cast away,
15. There had his dignity so sore a foyle,
16. As if his head ne're felt the sacred oyle.
17. Sometimes from crimson, blood of gastly slain,
18. The bow of Jonathan ne're turn'd in vain:
19. Nor from the fat, and spoils of Mighty men
20. With bloodless sword did Saul turn back agen.
21. Pleasant and lovely, were they both in life,
22. And in their death was found no parting strife.
23. Swifter then swiftest Eagles so were they,
24. Stronger then Lions ramping for their prey.
25. O Israels Dames, o'reflow your beauteous eyes
26. For valiant Saul who on Mount Gilbo lyes,
27. Who cloathed you in Cloath of richest Dye,
28. And choice delights, full of variety,
29. On your array put ornaments of gold,
30. Which made you yet more beauteous to behold.
31. O! how in Battle did the mighty fall
32. In midst of strength not succoured at all.
33. O lovely Jonathan! how wast thou slain?
34. In places high, full low thou didst remain.
35. Distrest for thee I am, dear Jonathan,
36. Thy love was wonderfull, surpassing man,
37. Exceeding all the love that's Feminine,
38. So pleasant hast thou been, dear brother mine,
39. How are the mighty fall'n into decay?
40. And warlike weapons perished away?
