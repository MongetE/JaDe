1. And live I still to see Relations gone,
2. And yet survive to sound this wailing tone;
3. Ah, woe is me, to write thy Funeral Song,
4. Who might in reason yet have lived long,
5. I saw the branches lopt the Tree now fall,
6. I stood so nigh, it crusht me down withal;
7. My bruised heart lies sobbing at the Root,
8. That thou dear Son hath lost both Tree and fruit:
9. Thou then on Seas sailing to forreign Coast;
10. Was ignorant what riches thou hadst lost.
11. But ah too soon those heavy tydings fly,
12. To strike thee with amazing misery;
13. Oh how I simpathize with thy sad heart,
14. And in thy griefs still bear a second part:
15. I lost a daughter dear, but thou a wife,
16. Who lov'd thee more (it seem'd) then her own life.
17. Thou being gone, she longer could not be,
18. Because her Soul she'd sent along with thee.
19. One week she only past in pain and woe,
20. And then her sorrows all at once did go;
21. A Babe she left before, she soar'd above,
22. The fifth and last pledg of her dying love,
23. E're nature would, it hither did arrive,
24. No wonder it no longer did survive.
25. So with her Children four, she's now a rest,
26. All freed from grief (I trust) among the blest;
27. She one hath left, a joy to thee and me,
28. The Heavens vouchsafe she may so ever be.
29. Chear up, (dear Son) thy fainting bleeding heart,
30. In him alone, that caused all this smart;
31. What though thy strokes full sad & grievous be,
32. He knows it is the best for thee and me.
