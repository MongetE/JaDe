1. Great Alexander was wise Philips son,
2. He to Amyntas, Kings of Macedon;
3. The cruel proud Olympias was his Mother,
4. She to Epirus warlike King was daughter.
5. This Prince (his father by Pausanias slain)
6. The twenty first of's age began to reign.
7. Great were the Gifts of nature which he had,
8. His education much to those did adde:
9. By art and nature both he was made fit,
10. To 'complish that which long before was writ.
11. The very day of his Nativity
12. To ground was burnt Dianaes Temple high:
13. An Omen to their near approaching woe,
14. Whose glory to the earth this king did throw.
15. His Rule to Greece he scorn'd should be confin'd,
16. The Universe scarce bound his proud vast mind.
17. This is the He-Goat which from Grecia came,
18. That ran in Choler on the Persian Ram,
19. That brake his horns, that threw him on the ground
20. To save him from his might no man was found:
21. Philip on this great Conquest had an eye,
22. But death did terminate those thoughts so high.
23. The Greeks had chose him Captain General,
24. Which honour to his Son did now befall.
25. (For as Worlds Monarch now we speak not on,
26. But as the King of little Macedon)
27. Restless both day and night his heart then was,
28. His high resolves which way to bring to pass;
29. Yet for a while in Greece is forc'd to stay,
30. Which makes each moment seem more then a day.
31. Thebes and stiff Athens both 'gainst him rebel,
32. Their mutinies by valour doth he quell.
33. This done against both right and natures Laws,
34. His kinsmen put to death, who gave no cause;
35. That no rebellion in in his absence be,
36. Nor making Title unto Sovereignty.
37. And all whom he suspects or fears will climbe,
38. Now taste of death least they deserv'd in time,
39. Nor wonder is t if he in blood begin,
40. For Cruelty was his parental sin,
41. Thus eased now of troubles and of fears,
42. Next spring his course to Asia he steers;
43. Leavs Sage Antipater, at home to sway,
44. And through the Hellispont his Ships made way.
45. Coming to Land, his dart on shore he throws,
46. Then with alacrity he after goes;
47. And with a bount'ous heart and courage brave,
48. His little wealth among his Souldiers gave.
49. And being ask'd what for himself was left,
50. Reply'd, enough, sith only hope he kept.
51. Thirty two thousand made up his Foot force,
52. To which were joyn'd five thousand goodly horse.
53. Then on he marcht, in's way he view'd old Troy,
54. And on Achilles tomb with wondrous joy
55. He offer'd, and for good success did pray
56. To him, his Mothers Ancestors, (men say)
57. When news of Alexander came to Court,
58. To scorn at him Darius had good sport;
59. Sends him a frothy and contemptuous Letter,
60. Stiles him disloyal servant, and no better;
61. Reproves him for his proud audacity
62. To lift his hand 'gainst such a Monarchy.
63. Then to's Lieftenant he in Asia sends
64. That he be ta'ne alive, for he intends
65. To whip him well with rods, and so to bring
66. That boy so mallipert before the King.
67. Ah! fond vain man, whose pen ere while
68. In lower terms was taught a higher stile.
69. To River Granick Alexander hyes
70. Which in Phrygia near Propontike lyes.
71. The Persians ready for encounter stand,
72. And strive to keep his men from off the land;
73. Those banks so steep the Greeks yet scramble up,
74. And beat the coward Persians from the top,
75. And twenty thousand of their lives bereave,
76. Who in their backs did all their wounds receive.
77. This victory did Alexander gain,
78. With loss of thirty four of his there slain;
79. Then Sardis he, and Ephesus did gain,
80. VVhere stood of late, Diana's wondrous Phane,
81. And by Parmenio (of renowned Fame,)
82. Miletus and Pamphilia overcame.
83. Hallicarnassus and Pisidia
84. He for his Master takes with Lycia.
85. Next Alexander marcht towards the black Sea,
86. And easily takes old Gordium in his way;
87. Of Ass ear'd Midas, once the Regal Seat,
88. VVhose touch turn'd all to gold, yea even his meat
89. VVhere the Prophetick knot he cuts in twain,
90. VVhich who so doth, must Lord of all remain.
91. Now news of Memnon's death (the Kings Viceroy)
92. To Alexanders heart's no little joy,
93. For in that Peer, more valour did abide,
94. Then in Darius multitude beside:
95. In's stead, was Arses plac'd, but durst not stay,
96. Yet set one in his room, and ran away;
97. His substitute as fearfull as his master,
98. Runs after two, and leaves all to Disaster.
99. Then Alexander all Cilicia takes,
100. No stroke for it he struck, their hearts so quakes.
101. To Greece he thirty thousand talents sends,
102. To raise more Force to further his intends:
103. Then o're he goes Darius now to meet,
104. Who came with thousand thousands at his feet.
105. Though some there be (perhaps) more likely write
106. He but four hundred thousand had to fight,
107. The rest Attendants, which made up no less,
108. Both Sexes there was almost numberless.
109. For this wise King had brought to see the sport,
110. With him the greatest Ladyes of the Court,
111. His mother, his beauteous Queen and daughters,
112. It seems to see the Macedonian slaughters.
113. Its much beyond my time and little art,
114. To shew how great Darius plaid his part;
115. The splendor and the pomp he marched in,
116. For since the world was no such Pageant seen.
117. Sure 'twas a goodly sight there to behold,
118. The Persians clad in silk, and glistering gold,
119. The stately horses trapt, the lances gilt,
120. As if addrest now all to run a tilt.
121. The holy fire was borne before the host,
122. (For Sun and Fire the Persians worship most)
123. The Priests in their strange habit follow after,
124. An object, not so much of fear as laughter.
125. The King sate in a chariot made of gold,
126. With crown and Robes most glorious to behold,
127. And o're his head his golden Gods on high,
128. Support a party coloured Canopy.
129. A number of spare horses next were led,
130. Lest he should need them in his Chariots stead;
131. But those that saw him in this state to lye,
132. Suppos'd he neither meant to fight nor flye.
133. He fifteen hundred had like women drest;
134. For thus to fright the Greeks he judg'd was best.
135. Their golden ornaments how to set forth,
136. Would ask more time then was their bodies worth
137. Great Sysigambis she brought up the Reer,
138. Then such a world of waggons did appear,
139. Like several houses moving upon wheels,
140. As if she'd drawn whole Shushan at her heels:
141. This brave Virago to the King was mother,
142. And as much good she did as any other.
143. Now lest this gold, and all this goodly stuff
144. Had not been spoyle and booty rich enough
145. A thousand mules and Camels ready wait
146. Loaden with gold, with jewels and with plate:
147. For sure Darius thought at the first sight,
148. The Greeks would all adore, but none would fight
149. But when both Armies met, he might behold
150. That valour was more worth then pearls or gold,
151. And that his wealth serv'd but for baits to 'lure
152. To make his overthrow more fierce and sure.
153. The Greeks came on and with a gallant grace
154. Let fly their arrows in the Persians face.
155. The cowards feeling this sharp stinging charge
156. Most basely ran, and left their king at large:
157. Who from his golden coach is glad to 'light,
158. And cast away his crown for swifter flight:
159. Of late like some immoveable he lay,
160. Now finds both legs and horse to run away.
161. Two hundred thousand men that day were slain,
162. And forty thousand prisoners also tane,
163. Besides the Queens and Ladies of the court,
164. If Curtius be true in his report.
165. The Regal Ornaments were lost, the treasure
166. Divided at the Macedonians pleasure;
167. Yet all this grief, this loss, this overthrow,
168. Was but beginning of his future woe.
169. The royal Captives brought to Alexander
170. T'ward them demean'd himself like a Commander
171. For though their beauties were unparaled,
172. Conquer'd himself now he had conquered,
173. Preserv'd their honour, us'd them bounteously,
174. Commands no man should doe them injury:
175. And this to Alexander is more fame
176. Then that the Persian King he overcame.
177. Two hundred eighty Greeks he lost in fight,
178. By too much heat, not wounds (as authors write)
179. No sooner had this Victor won the field,
180. But all Phenicia to his pleasure yield,
181. Of which the Goverment he doth commit
182. Unto Parmenio of all most fit.
183. Darius now less lofty then before,
184. To Alexander writes he would restore
185. Those mournfull Ladies from Captivity,
186. For whom he offers him a ransome high:
187. But down his haughty stomach could not bring,
188. To give this Conquerour the Stile of King.
189. This Letter Alexander doth disdain,
190. And in short terms sends this reply again,
191. A King he was, and that not only so,
192. But of Darius King, as he should know.
193. Next Alexander unto Tyre doth goe,
194. His valour and his victoryes they know:
195. To gain his love the Tyrians intend,
196. Therefore a crown and great Provision send,
197. Their present he receives with thankfullness,
198. Desires to offer unto Hercules,
199. Protector of their town, by whom defended,
200. And from whom he lineally descended.
201. But they accept not this in any wise,
202. Lest he intend more fraud then sacrifice,
203. Sent word that Hercules his temple stood
204. In the old town, (which then lay like a wood)
205. With this reply he was so deep enrag'd,
206. To win the town, his honour he ingag'd:
207. And now as Babels King did once before,
208. He leaves not till he made the sea firm shore,
209. But far less time and cost he did expend,
210. The former Ruines forwarded his end:
211. Moreover had a Navy at command,
212. The other by his men fetcht all by land.
213. In seven months time he took that wealthy town,
214. Whose glory now a second time's brought down.
215. Two thousand of the chief he crucifi'd,
216. Eight thousand by the sword then also di'd,
217. And thirteen thousand Gally slaves he made,
218. And thus the Tyrians for mistrust were paid.
219. The rule of this he to Philotas gave
220. Who was the son of that Parmenio brave.
221. Cilicia to Socrates doth give,
222. For now's the time Captains like Kings may live.
223. Zidon he on Ephestion bestowes;
224. (For that which freely comes, as freely goes)
225. He scorns to have one worse then had the other,
226. So gives his little Lordship to another.
227. Ephestion having chief command of th'Fleet,
228. At Gaza now must Alexander meet.
229. Darius finding troubles still increase,
230. By his Ambassadors now sues for peace,
231. And layes before great Alexanders eyes
232. The dangers difficultyes like to rise,
233. First at Euphrates what he's like to 'bide,
234. And then at Tygris and Araxis side,
235. These he may scape, and if he so desire,
236. A league of friendship make firm and entire.
237. His eldest daughter he in mariage profers,
238. And a most princely dowry with her offers.
239. All those rich Kingdomes large that do abide
240. Betwixt the Hellespont and Halys side.
241. But he with scorn his courtesie rejects,
242. And the distressed King no whit respects,
243. Tells him, these proffers great, in truth were none
244. For all he offers now was but his own.
245. But quoth Parmenio that brave Commander,
246. Was I as great, as is great Alexander,
247. Darius offers I would not reject,
248. But th'kingdomes and the Lady soon accept.
249. To which proud Alexander made reply,
250. And so if I Parmenio was, would I.
251. He now to Gaza goes, and there doth meet,
252. His Favorite Ephestion with his Fleet,
253. Where valiant Betis stoutly keeps the town,
254. (A loyal Subject to Darius Crown)
255. For more repulse the Grecians here abide
256. Then in the Persian Monarchy beside;
257. And by these walls so many men were slain,
258. That Greece was forc'd to yield supply again.
259. But yet this well defended Town was taken,
260. For 'twas decree'd, that Empire should be shaken;
261. Thus Betis ta'en had holes bor'd through his feet,
262. And by command was drawn through every street
263. To imitate Achilles in his shame,
264. Who did the like to Hector (of more fame)
265. What hast thou lost thy magnimity,
266. Can Alexander deal thus cruelly?
267. Sith valour with Heroicks is renown'd,
268. Though in an Enemy it should be found;
269. If of thy future fame thou hadst regard,
270. Why didst not heap up honours and reward?
271. From Gaza to Jerusalem he goes,
272. But in no hostile way, (as I suppose)
273. Him in his Priestly Robes high Jaddus meets,
274. Whom with great reverence Alexander greets;
275. The Priest shews him good Daniel's Prophesy,
276. How he should overthrow this Monarchy,
277. By which he was so much encouraged,
278. No future dangers he did ever dread.
279. From thence to fruitful Egypt marcht with speed,
280. Where happily in's wars he did succeed;
281. To see how fast he gain'd was no small wonder,
282. For in few dayes he brought that Kingdome under.
283. Then to the Phane of Jupiter he went,
284. To be install'd a God, was his intent.
285. The Pagan Priest through hire, or else mistake,
286. The Son of Jupiter did streight him make:
287. He Diobolical must needs remain,
288. That his humanity will not retain.
289. Thence back to Egypt goes, and in few dayes;
290. Fair Alexandria from the ground doth raise;
291. Then setling all things in less Asia;
292. In Syria, Egypt, and Phenicia,
293. Unto Euphrates marcht and overgoes,
294. For no man's there his Army to oppose;
295. Had Betis now been there but with his band,
296. Great Alexander had been kept from Land.
297. But as the King, so is the multitude,
298. And now of valour both are destitute.
299. Yet he (poor prince) another Host doth muster,
300. Of Persians, Scythians, Indians in a cluster;
301. Men but in shape and name, of valour none
302. Most fit, to blunt the Swords of Macedon.
303. Two hundred fifty thousand by account,
304. Of Horse and Foot his Army did amount;
305. For in his multitudes his trust still lay,
306. But on their fortitude he had small stay;
307. Yet had some hope that on the spacious plain,
308. His numbers might the victory obtain.
309. About this time Darius beautious Queen,
310. Who had sore travail and much sorrow seen,
311. Now bids the world adue, with pain being spent,
312. Whose death her Lord full sadly did lament.
313. Great Alexander mourns as well as he,
314. The more because not set at liberty;
315. When this sad news (at first Darius hears,
316. Some injury was offered he fears:
317. But when inform'd how royally the King,
318. Had used her, and hers, in every thing,
319. He prays the immortal Gods they would reward
320. Great Alexander for this good regard;
321. And if they down his Monarchy will throw,
322. Let them on him this dignity bestow.
323. And now for peace he sues as once before,
324. And offers all he did and Kingdomes more;
325. His eldest daughter for his princely bride,
326. (Nor was such match in all the world beside)
327. And all those Countryes which (betwixt) did lye
328. Phanisian Sea, and great Euphrates high:
329. With fertile Egypt and rich Syria,
330. And all those Kingdomes in less Asia.
331. With thirty thousand Talents to be paid,
332. For the Queen Mother, and the royal maid;
333. And till all this be well perform'd, and sure,
334. Ochus his Son for Hostage should endure.
335. To this stout Alexander gives no ear,
336. No though Parmenio plead, yet will not hear;
337. Which had he done. (perhaps) his fame he'd kept,
338. Nor Infamy had wak'd, when he had slept,
339. For his unlimited prosperity
340. Him boundless made in vice and Cruelty.
341. Thus to Darius he writes back again,
342. The Firmament, two Suns cannot contain.
343. Two Monarchyes on Earth cannot abide,
344. Nor yet two Monarchs in one world reside;
345. The afflicted King finding him set to jar,
346. Prepares against to morrow, for the war,
347. Parmenio, Alexander, wisht that night,
348. To force his Camp, so vanquish them by flight.
349. For tumult in the night doth cause most dread,
350. And weakness of a Foe is covered,
351. But he disdain'd to steal a victory:
352. The Sun should witness of his valour be,
353. And careless in his bed, next morne he lyes,
354. By Captains twice is call'd before hee'l rise,
355. The Armyes joyn'd a while, the Persians fight,
356. And spilt the Greeks some bloud before their flight
357. But long they stood not e're they're forc'd to run,
358. So made an end, As soon as well begun.
359. Forty five thousand Alexander had,
360. But is not known what slaughter here was made,
361. Some write th'other had a million, some more,
362. But Quintus Curtius as before.
363. At Arbela this victory was gain'd,
364. Together with the Town also obtain'd;
365. Darius stript of all to Media came,
366. Accompan'ed with sorrow, fear, and shame,
367. At Arbela left his Ornaments and Treasure,
368. Which Alexander deals as suits his pleasure.
369. This conqueror to Babylon then goes,
370. Is entertain'd with joy and pompous showes,
371. With showrs of flours the streets along are strown,
372. And incense burnt the silver Altars on.
373. The glory of the Castle he admires,
374. The strong Foundation and the lofty Spires,
375. In this, a world of gold and Treasure lay,
376. Which in few hours was carried all away.
377. With greedy eyes he views this City round,
378. Whose fame throughout the world was so renownd
379. And to possess he counts no little bliss
380. The towres and bowres of proud Semiramis,
381. Though worne by time, and rac'd by foes full sore,
382. Yet old foundations shew'd and somewhat more.
383. With all the pleasures that on earth are found,
384. This city did abundantly abound,
385. Where four and thirty dayes he now did stay,
386. And gave himself to banqueting and play:
387. He and his souldiers wax effeminate,
388. And former discipline begin to hate.
389. Whilst revelling at Babylon he lyes,
390. Antipater from Greece sends fresh supplyes.
391. He then to Shushan goes with his new bands,
392. But needs no force, tis rendred to his hands.
393. He likewise here a world of treasure found;
394. For 'twas the seat of Persian Kings renownd.
395. Here stood the royal Houses of delight,
396. Where Kings have shown their glory wealth and might
397. The sumptuous palace of Queen Esther here,
398. And of good Mordicai, her kinsman dear,
399. Those purple hangings, mixt with green and white
400. Those beds of gold, and couches of delight.
401. And furniture the richest in all lands,
402. Now fall into the Macedonians hands.
403. From Shushan to Persipolis he goes,
404. Which news doth still augment Darius woes.
405. In his approach the governour sends word,
406. For his receipt with joy they all accord,
407. With open gates the wealthy town did stand,
408. And all in it was at his high command.
409. Of all the Cities that on earth was found,
410. None like to this in riches did abound:
411. Though Babylon was rich and Shushan too
412. Yet to compare with this they might not doe:
413. Here lay the bulk of all those precious things
414. That did pertain unto the Persian Kings:
415. For when the souldiers rifled had their pleasure,
416. And taken money plate and golden treasure,
417. Statues some gold, and silver numberless,
418. Yet after all, as storyes do express
419. The share of Alexander did amount
420. To an hundred thousand talents by account.
421. Here of his own he sets a Garison,
422. (As first at Shushan and at Babylon)
423. On their old Governours titles he laid,
424. But on their faithfulness he never staid,
425. Their place gave to his Captains (as was just)
426. For such revolters false, what King can trust?
427. The riches and the pleasures of this town
428. Now makes this King his virtues all to drown,
429. That wallowing in all licentiousness,
430. In pride and cruelty to high excess.
431. Being inflam'd with wine upon a season,
432. Filled with madness, and quite void of reason,
433. He at a bold proud strumpets leud desire,
434. Commands to set this goodly town on fire.
435. Parmenio wise intreats him to desist
436. And layes before his eyes if he persist
437. His fames dishonour, loss unto his state,
438. And just procuring of the Persians hate:
439. But deaf to reason, bent to have his will,
440. Those stately streets with raging flame did fill.
441. Then to Darius he directs his way,
442. Who was retir'd as far as Media,
443. And there with sorrows, fears & cares surrounded
444. Had now his army fourth and last compounded.
445. Which forty thousand made, but his intent
446. Was these in Bactria soon to augment:
447. But hearing Alexander was so near,
448. Thought now this once to try his fortunes here,
449. And rather chose an honourable death,
450. Then still with infamy to draw his breath:
451. But Bessus false, who was his chief Commander
452. Perswades him not to fight with Alexander.
453. With sage advice he sets before his eyes
454. The little hope of profit like to rise:
455. If when he'd multitudes the day he lost,
456. Then with so few, how likely to be crost.
457. This counsel for his safety he pretended,
458. But to deliver him to's foe intended.
459. Next day this treason to Darius known
460. Transported sore with grief and passion,
461. Grinding his teeth, and plucking off his hair,
462. Sate overwhelm'd with sorrow and dispair:
463. Then bids his servant Artabasus true,
464. Look to himself, and leave him to that crew,
465. Who was of hopes and comforts quite bereft,
466. And by his guard and Servitors all left.
467. Straight Bessus comes, & with his trait'rous hands
468. Layes hold on's Lord, and binding him with bands
469. Throws him into a Cart, covered with hides,
470. Who wanting means t'resist these wrongs abides,
471. Then draws the cart along with chains of gold,
472. In more despight the thraled prince to hold,
473. And thus t'ward Alexander on he goes,
474. Great recompence for this, he did propose:
475. But some detesting this his wicked fact,
476. To Alexander flyes and tells this act,
477. Who doubling of his march, posts on amain,
478. Darius from that traitors hands to gain.
479. Bessus gets knowledg his disloyalty
480. Had Alexanders wrath incensed high,
481. Whose army now was almost within sight,
482. His hopes being dasht prepares himself for flight:
483. Unto Darius first he brings a horse,
484. And bids him save himself by speedy course:
485. The wofull King his courtesie refuses,
486. Whom thus the execrable wretch abuses,
487. By throwing darts gave him his mortal wound,
488. Then slew his Servants that were faithfull found,
489. Yea wounds the beasts that drew him unto death,
490. And leaves him thus to gasp out his last breath.
491. Bessus his partner in this tragedy,
492. Was the false Governour of Media.
493. This done, they with their host soon speed away,
494. To hide themselves remote in Bactria.
495. Darius bath'd in blood, sends out his groans,
496. Invokes the heav'ns and earth to hear his moans:
497. His lost felicity did grieve him sore,
498. But this unheard of treachery much more:
499. But above all, that neither Ear nor Eye
500. Should hear nor see his dying misery;
501. As thus he lay, Polistrates a Greek,
502. Wearied with his long march, did water seek,
503. So chanc'd these bloudy Horses to espy,
504. Whose wounds had made their skins of purple dye
505. To them repairs then looking in the Cart,
506. Finds poor Darius pierced to the heart,
507. Who not a little chear'd to have some eye,
508. The witness of this horrid Tragedy;
509. Prays him to Alexander to commend
510. The just revenge of this his woful end:
511. And not to pardon such disloyalty,
512. Of Treason, Murther, and base Cruelty.
513. If not, because Darius thus did pray,
514. Yet that succeeding Kings in safety may
515. Their lives enjoy, their Crowns and dignity,
516. And not by Traitors hands untimely dye.
517. He also sends his humble thankfulness,
518. For all the Kingly grace he did express;
519. To's Mother, Children dear, and wife now gone.
520. Which made their long restraint seem to be none:
521. Praying the immortal Gods, that Sea and Land
522. Might be subjected to his royal hand,
523. And that his Rule as far extended be,
524. As men the rising, setting Sun shall see,
525. This said, the Greek for water doth intreat,
526. To quench his thirst, and to allay his heat:
527. Of all good things (quoth he) once in my power,
528. I've nothing left, at this my dying hour;
529. Thy service and compassion to reward,
530. But Alexander will, for this regard.
531. This said, his fainting breath did fleet away,
532. And though a Monarch late, now lyes like clay;
533. And thus must every Son of Adam lye,
534. Though Gods on Earth like Sons of men they dye.
535. Now to the East, great Alexander goes,
536. To see if any dare his might oppose,
537. For scarce the world or any bounds thereon,
538. Could bound his boundless fond Ambition;
539. Such as submits again he doth restore
540. Their riches, and their honours he makes more,
541. On Artabaces more then all bestow'd,
542. For his fidelity to's Master show'd.
543. Thalestris Queen of th'Amazons now brought
544. Her Train to Alexander, (as 'tis thought.)
545. Though most of reading best and soundest mind,
546. Such Country there, nor yet such people find.
547. Then tell her errand, we had better spare
548. To th'ignorant, her title will declare:
549. As Alexander in his greatness grows,
550. So dayly of his virtues doth he lose.
551. He baseness counts, his former Clemency,
552. And not beseeming such a dignity;
553. His past sobriety doth also bate,
554. As most incompatible to his State;
555. His temperance is but a sordid thing,
556. No wayes becoming such a mighty King;
557. His greatness now he takes to represent
558. His fancy'd Gods above the Firmament.
559. And such as shew'd but reverence before,
560. Now are commanded strictly to adore;
561. With Persian Robes himself doth dignifie,
562. Charging the same on his nobility,
563. His manners habit, gestures, all did fashion
564. After that conquer'd and luxurious Nation.
565. His Captains that were virtuously inclin'd,
566. Griev'd at this change of manners and of mind.
567. The ruder sort did openly deride,
568. His feigned Diety and foolish pride;
569. The certainty of both comes to his Ears,
570. But yet no notice takes of what he hears:
571. With those of worth he still desires esteem,
572. So heaps up gifts his credit to redeem
573. And for the rest new wars and travails finds,
574. That other matters might take up their minds,
575. And hearing Bessus, makes himself a King,
576. Intends that Traitor to his end to bring.
577. Now that his Host from luggage might be free,
578. And with his burthen no man burthened be;
579. Commands forthwith each man his fardle bring,
580. Into the market place before the King;
581. VVhich done, sets fire upon those goodly spoyles,
582. The recompence of travails wars and toyles.
583. And thus unwisely in a mading fume,
584. The wealth of many Kingdomes did consume,
585. But marvell 'tis that without mutiny,
586. The Souldiers should let pass this injury;
587. Nor wonder less to Readers may it bring,
588. Here to observe the rashness of the King.
589. Now with his Army doth he post away
590. False Bessus to find out in Bactria:
591. But much distrest for water in their march,
592. The drought and heat their bodies sore did parch.
593. At length they came to th'river Oxus brink,
594. Where so immoderately these thirsty drink,
595. Which more mortality to them did bring,
596. Then all their warrs against the Persian King.
597. Here Alexander's almost at a stand,
598. To pass the River to the other land.
599. For boats here's none, nor near it any wood,
600. To make them Rafts to waft them o're the flood:
601. But he that was resolved in his mind,
602. Would without means some transportation find.
603. Then from the Carriages the hides he takes,
604. And stuffing them with straw, he bundles makes.
605. On these together ti'd, in six dayes space,
606. They all pass over to the other place.
607. Had Bessus had but valour to his will,
608. With little pain there might have kept them still:
609. But Coward durst not fight, nor could he fly,
610. Hated of all for's former treachery,
611. Is by his own now bound in iron chains,
612. A Coller of the same, his neck contains.
613. And in this sort they rather drag then bring
614. This Malefactor vile before the King,
615. Who to Darius brother gives the wretch,
616. With racks and tortures every limb to stretch.
617. Here was of Greeks a town in Bactria,
618. Whom Xerxes from their Country led away,
619. These not a little joy'd, this day to see,
620. Wherein their own had got the sov'raignty
621. And now reviv'd, with hopes held up their head
622. From bondage long to be Enfranchised.
623. But Alexander puts them to the sword
624. Without least cause from them in deed or word;
625. Nor Sex, nor age, nor one, nor other spar'd,
626. But in his cruelty alike they shar'd:
627. Nor reason could he give for this great wrong,
628. But that they had forgot their mother tongue.
629. While thus some time he spent in Bactria,
630. And in his camp strong and securely lay,
631. Down from the mountains twenty thousand came
632. And there most fiercely set upon the same:
633. Repelling these, two marks of honour got
634. Imprinted in his leg, by arrows shot.
635. The Bactrians against him now rebel;
636. But he their stubborness in time doth quell.
637. From hence he to Jaxartis River goes,
638. Where Scythians rude his army doth oppose,
639. And with their outcryes in an hideous sort
640. Beset his camp, or military court,
641. Of darts and arrows, made so little spare,
642. They flew so thick, they seem'd to dark the air:
643. But soon his souldiers forc'd them to a flight,
644. Their nakedness could not endure their might.
645. Upon this rivers bank in seventeen dayes
646. A goodly City doth compleatly raise,
647. Which Alexandria he doth likewise name,
648. And sixty furlongs could but round the same.
649. A third Supply Antipater now sent,
650. Which did his former forces much augment;
651. And being one hundred twenty thousand strong;
652. He enters then the Indian Kings among:
653. Those that submit, he gives them rule again,
654. Such as do not, both them and theirs are slain.
655. His warrs with sundry nations I'le omit,
656. And also of the Mallians what is writ.
657. His Fights, his dangers, and the hurts he had,
658. How to submit their necks at last they're glad.
659. To Nisa goes by Bacchus built long since,
660. Whose feasts are celebrated by this prince;
661. Nor had that drunken god one who would take
662. His Liquors more devoutly for his sake.
663. When thus ten days his brain with wine he'd soakt,
664. And with delicious meats his palate choakt:
665. To th'River Indus next his course he bends,
666. Boats to prepare, Ephestion first he sends,
667. Who coming thither long before his Lord,
668. Had to his mind made all things to accord,
669. The vessels ready were at his command,
670. And Omphis King of that part of the land,
671. Through his perswasion Alexander meets,
672. And as his Sov'raign Lord him humbly greets
673. Fifty six Elephants he brings to's hand,
674. And tenders him the strength of all his land;
675. Presents himself first with a golden crown,
676. Then eighty talents to his captains down:
677. But Alexander made him to behold
678. He glory sought, no silver nor no gold;
679. His presents all with thanks he did restore,
680. And of his own a thousand talents more.
681. Thus all the Indian Kings to him submit,
682. But Porus stout, who will not yeild as yet:
683. To him doth Alexander thus declare,
684. His pleasure is that forthwith he repair
685. Unto his Kingdomes borders, and as due,
686. His homage to himself as Soveraign doe:
687. But kingly Porus this brave answer sent,
688. That to attend him there was his intent,
689. And come as well provided as he could,
690. But for the rest, his sword advise him should.
691. Great Alexander vext at this reply,
692. Did more his valour then his crown envy,
693. Is now resolv'd to pass Hydaspes flood,
694. And there by force his soveraignty make good.
695. Stout Porus on the banks doth ready stand
696. To give him welcome when he comes to land.
697. A potent army with him like a King,
698. And ninety Elephants for warr did bring:
699. Had Alexander such resistance seen
700. On Tygris side, here now he had not been.
701. Within this spacious River deep and wide
702. Did here and there Isles full of trees abide.
703. His army Alexander doth divide
704. With Ptolemy sends part to th'other side;
705. Porus encounters them and thinks all's there,
706. When covertly the rest get o're else where,
707. And whilst the first he valiantly assail'd,
708. The last set on his back, and so prevail'd.
709. Yet work enough here Alexander found,
710. For to the last stout Porus kept his ground:
711. Nor was't dishonour at the length to yield,
712. When Alexander strives to win the field.
713. The kingly Captive 'fore the Victor's brought,
714. In looks or gesture not abased ought,
715. But him a Prince of an undaunted mind
716. Did Alexander by his answers find:
717. His fortitude his royal foe commends,
718. Restores him and his bounds farther extends.
719. Now eastward Alexander would goe still,
720. But so to doe his souldiers had no will,
721. Long with excessive travails wearied,
722. Could by no means be farther drawn or led,
723. Yet that his fame might to posterity
724. Be had in everlasting memory,
725. Doth for his Camp a greater circuit take,
726. And for his souldiers larger Cabbins make.
727. His mangers he erected up so high
728. As never horse his Provender could eye.
729. Huge bridles made, which here and there he left,
730. Which might be found, and for great wonders kept
731. Twelve altars then for monuments he rears,
732. Whereon his acts and travels long appears.
733. But doubting wearing time might these decay,
734. And so his memory would fade away,
735. He on the fair Hydaspes pleasant side,
736. Two Cities built, his name might there abide,
737. First Nicea, the next Bucephalon,
738. Where he entomb'd his stately Stalion.
739. His fourth and last supply was hither sent,
740. Then down Hydaspes with his Fleet he went;
741. Some time he after spent upon that shore,
742. Whether Ambassadors, ninety or more,
743. Came with submission from the Indian Kings,
744. Bringing their presents rare, and precious things,
745. These all he feasts in state on beds of gold,
746. His Furniture most sumptuous to behold;
747. His meat & drink, attendants, every thing,
748. To th'utmost shew'd the glory of a King.
749. With rich rewards he sent them home again,
750. Acknowledged their Masters sovereign;
751. Then sailing South, and coming to that shore,
752. Those obscure Nations yielded as before:
753. A City here he built, call'd by his Name,
754. Which could not sound too oft with too much fame
755. Then sailing by the mouth of Indus floud,
756. His Gallyes stuck upon the flats and mud;
757. Which the stout Macedonians amazed sore,
758. Depriv'd at once the use of Sail and Oar:
759. Observing well the nature of the Tide,
760. In those their fears they did not long abide.
761. Passing fair Indus mouth his course he steer'd
762. To th'coast which by Euphrates mouth appear'd;
763. Whose inlets near unto, he winter spent,
764. Unto his starved Souldiers small content,
765. By hunger and by cold so many slain,
766. That of them all the fourth did scarce remain.
767. Thus winter, Souldiers, and provisions spent,
768. From hence he then unto Gedrosia went.
769. And thence he marcht into Carmania,
770. And so at length drew near to Persia,
771. Now through these goodly Countryes as he past,
772. Much time in feasts and ryoting did waste;
773. Then visits Cyrus Sepulchre in's way,
774. Who now obscure at Passagardis lay:
775. Upon his Monument his Robe he spread,
776. And set his Crown on his supposed head.
777. From hence to Babylon, some time there spent,
778. He at the last to royal Shushan went;
779. A wedding Feast to's Nobles then he makes,
780. And Statyra, Darius daughter takes,
781. Her Sister gives to his Ephestian dear,
782. That by this match he might be yet more near;
783. He fourscore Persian Ladies also gave,
784. At this same time unto his Captains brave:
785. Six thousand guests unto this Feast invites,
786. Whose Sences all were glutted with delights.
787. It far exceeds my mean abilities
788. To shadow forth these short felicities,
789. Spectators here could scarce relate the story,
790. They were so rapt with this external glory:
791. If an Ideal Paradise a man would frame,
792. He might this Feast imagine by the same;
793. To every guess a cup of gold he sends,
794. So after many dayes the Banquet ends.
795. Now Alexanders conquests all are done,
796. And his long Travails past and overgone;
797. His virtues dead, buried, and quite forgot,
798. But vice remains to his Eternal blot.
799. 'Mongst those that of his cruelty did tast,
800. Philotus was not least, nor yet the last,
801. Accus'd because he did not certifie
802. The King of treason and conspiracy:
803. Upon suspition being apprehended,
804. Nothing was prov'd wherein he had offended
805. But silence, which was of such consequence,
806. He was judg'd guilty of the same offence,
807. But for his fathers great deserts the King
808. His royal pardon gave for this foul thing.
809. Yet is Phylotas unto judgment brought,
810. Must suffer, not for what is prov'd, but thought.
811. His master is accuser, judge and King,
812. Who to the height doth aggravate each thing,
813. Inveighs against his father now absent,
814. And's brethren who for him their lives had spent.
815. But Philotas his unpardonable crime,
816. No merit could obliterate, or time:
817. He did the Oracle of Jove deride,
818. By which his Majesty was diefi'd.
819. Philotas thus o'recharg'd with wrong and grief
820. Sunk in despair without hope of Relief,
821. Fain would have spoke and made his own defence,
822. The King would give no ear, but went from thence
823. To his malicious Foes delivers him,
824. To wreak their spight and hate on every limb.
825. Philotas after him sends out this cry,
826. O Alexander, thy free clemency
827. My foes exceeds in malice, and their hate
828. Thy kingly word can easily terminate.
829. Such torments great as wit could worst invent,
830. Or flesh and life could bear, till both were spent
831. Were now inflicted on Parmenio's son
832. He might accuse himself, as they had done,
833. At last he did, so they were justifi'd,
834. And told the world, that for his guilt he di'd.
835. But how these Captains should, or yet their master
836. Look on Parmenio, after this disaster
837. They knew not, wherefore best now to be done,
838. Was to dispatch the father as the son.
839. This sound advice at heart pleas'd Alexander,
840. Who was so much ingag'd to this Commander,
841. As he would ne're confess, nor yet reward,
842. Nor could his Captains bear so great regard:
843. Wherefore at once, all these to satisfie,
844. It was decreed Parmenio should dye:
845. Polidamus, who seem'd Parmenio's friend
846. To do this deed they into Media send:
847. He walking in his garden to and fro,
848. Fearing no harm, because he none did doe,
849. Most wickedly was slain without least crime,
850. (The most renowned captain of his time)
851. This is Parmenio who so much had done
852. For Philip dead, and his surviving son,
853. Who from a petty King of Macedon
854. By him was set upon the Persian throne,
855. This that Parmenio who still overcame,
856. Yet gave his Master the immortal fame,
857. Who for his prudence, valour, care and trust
858. Had this reward, most cruel and unjust.
859. The next, who in untimely death had part,
860. Was one of more esteem, but less desert;
861. Clitus belov'd next to Ephestian,
862. And in his cups his chief companion;
863. When both were drunk, Clitus was wont to jeer,
864. Alexander to rage, to kill, and swear;
865. Nothing more pleasing to mad Clitus tongue,
866. Then's Masters Godhead to defie and wrong;
867. Nothing toucht Alexander to the quick,
868. Like this against his Diety to kick:
869. Both at a Feast when they had tippled well,
870. Upon this dangerous Theam fond Clitus fell;
871. From jest to earnest, and at last so bold,
872. That of Parmenio's death him plainly told.
873. Which Alexanders wrath incens'd so high,
874. Nought but his life for this could satisfie;
875. From one stood by he snatcht a partizan,
876. And in a rage him through the body ran,
877. Next day he tore his face for what he'd done,
878. And would have slain himself for Clitus gone:
879. This pot Companion he did more bemoan,
880. Then all the wrongs to brave Parmenio done.
881. The next of worth that suffered after these,
882. Was learned, virtuous, wise Calisthenes,
883. VVho lov'd his Master more then did the rest,
884. As did appear, in flattering him the least;
885. In his esteem a God he could not be,
886. Nor would adore him for a Diety:
887. For this alone and for no other cause,
888. Against his Sovereign, or against his Laws,
889. He on the Rack his Limbs in pieces rent,
890. Thus was he tortur'd till his life was spent.
891. Of this unkingly act doth Seneca
892. This censure pass, and not unwisely say,
893. Of Alexander this th'eternal crime,
894. VVhich shall not be obliterate by time.
895. VVhich virtues fame can ne're redeem by far,
896. Nor all felicity of his in war.
897. VVhen e're 'tis said he thousand thousands slew,
898. Yea, and Calisthenes to death he drew.
899. The mighty Persian King he overcame,
900. Yea, and he kill'd Calistthenes of fame.
901. All Countryes, Kingdomes, Provinces, he wan
902. From Hellispont, to th'farthest Ocean.
903. All this he did, who knows' not to be true?
904. But yet withal, Catisthenes he slew.
905. From Macedon, his Empire did extend
906. Unto the utmost bounds o' th'orient:
907. All this he did, yea, and much more, 'tis true,
908. But yet withal, Catisthenes he slew.
909. Now Alexander goes to Media,
910. Finds there the want of wise Parmenio;
911. Here his chief favourite Ephestian dies,
912. He celebrates his mournful obsequies:
913. Hangs his Physitian, the Reason why
914. He suffered, his friend Ephestian dye.
915. This act (me-thinks) his Godhead should a shame,
916. To punish where himself deserved blame;
917. Or of necessity he must imply,
918. The other was the greatest Diety.
919. The Mules and Horses are for sorrow shorne,
920. The battlements from off the walls are torne.
921. Of stately Ecbatane who now must shew,
922. A rueful face in this so general woe;
923. Twelve thousand Talents also did intend,
924. Upon a sumptuous monument to spend:
925. What e're he did, or thought not so content,
926. His messenger to Jupiter he sent,
927. That by his leave his friend Ephestion,
928. Among the Demy Gods they might inthrone.
929. From Media to Babylon he went,
930. To meet him there t'Antipater he'd sent,
931. That he might act also upon the Stage,
932. And in a Tragedy there end his age.
933. The Queen Olimpias bears him deadly hate,
934. Not suffering her to meddle with the State,
935. And by her Letters did her Son incite,
936. This great indignity he should requite;
937. His doing so, no whit displeas'd the King,
938. Though to his Mother he disprov'd the thing.
939. But now Antipater had liv'd so long,
940. He might well dye though he had done no wrong;
941. His service great is suddenly forgot,
942. Or if remembred, yet regarded not:
943. The King doth intimate 'twas his intent,
944. His honours and his riches to augment;
945. Of larger Provinces the rule to give,
946. And for his Counsel near the King to live.
947. So to be caught, Antipater's too wise,
948. Parmenio's death's too fresh before his eyes;
949. He was too subtil for his crafty foe.
950. Nor by his baits could be insnared so:
951. But his excuse with humble thanks he sends,
952. His Age and journy long he then pretends;
953. And pardon craves for his unwilling stay,
954. He shews his grief, he's forc'd to disobey.
955. Before his Answer came to Babylon,
956. The thread of Alexanders life was spun;
957. Poyson had put an end to's dayes ('twas thought)
958. By Philip and Cassander to him brought,
959. Sons to Antipater, and bearers of his Cup,
960. Lest of such like their Father chance to sup;
961. By others thought, and that more generally,
962. That through excessive drinking he did dye:
963. The thirty third of's Age do all agree,
964. This Conquerour did yield to destiny.
965. When this sad news came to Darius Mother,
966. She laid it more to heart, then any other,
967. Nor meat, nor drink, nor comfort would she take,
968. But pin'd in grief till life did her forsake;
969. All friends she shuns, yea, banished the light,
970. Till death inwrapt her in perpetual night.
971. This Monarchs fame must last whilst world doth stand,
972. And Conquests be talkt of whilest there is land;
973. His Princely qualities had he retain'd,
974. Unparalled for ever had remain'd.
975. But with the world his virtues overcame,
976. And so with black beclouded, all his fame;
977. Wise Aristotle Tutor to his youth.
978. Had so instructed him in moral Truth:
979. The principles of what he then had learn'd
980. Might to the last (when sober) be discern'd.
981. Learning and learned men he much regarded,
982. And curious Artist evermore rewarded:
983. The Illiads of Homer he still kept.
984. And under's pillow laid them when he slept.
985. Achilles happiness he did envy,
986. 'Cause Homer kept his acts to memory.
987. Profusely bountifull without desert,
988. For such as pleas'd him had both wealth and heart
989. Cruel by nature and by custome too,
990. As oft his acts throughout his reign doth shew:
991. Ambitious so, that nought could satisfie,
992. Vain, thirsting after immortality,
993. Still fearing that his name might hap to dye,
994. And fame not last unto eternity.
995. This Conqueror did oft lament (tis said)
996. There were no more worlds to be conquered.
997. This folly great Augustus did deride,
998. For had he had but wisdome to his pride,
999. He would had found enough there to be done,
1000. To govern that he had already won.
1001. His thoughts are perisht, he aspires no more,
1002. Nor can he kill or save as heretofore.
1003. A God alive, him all must Idolize,
1004. Now like a mortal helpless man he lyes.
1005. Of all those Kingdomes large which he had got,
1006. To his Posterity remain'd no jot;
1007. For by that hand which still revengeth bloud,
1008. None of his kindred, nor his race long stood:
1009. But as he took delight much bloud to spill,
1010. So the same cup to his, did others fill.
1011. Four of his Captains now do all divide,
1012. As Daniel before had prophysi'd.
1013. The Leopard down, the four wings 'gan to rise,
1014. The great horn broke, the less did tyranize.
1015. What troubles and contentions did ensue
1016. We may hereafter shew in season due.
1017. Aridæus.
1018. Great Alexander dead, his Armyes left,
1019. Like to that Giant of his Eye bereft;
1020. When of his monstrous bulk it was the guide,
1021. His matchless force no creature could abide.
1022. But by Ulisses having lost his sight,
1023. All men began streight to contemn his might;
1024. For aiming still amiss, his dreadful blows
1025. Did harm himself, but never reacht his Foes.
1026. Now Court and Camp all in confusion be,
1027. A King they'l have, but who, none can agree;
1028. Each Captain wisht this prize to bear away,
1029. But none so hardy found as so durst say:
1030. Great Alexander did leave Issue none,
1031. Except by Artabasus daughter one;
1032. And Roxane fair whom late he married,
1033. Was near her time to be delivered.
1034. By natures right these had enough to claim,
1035. But meaness of their mothers bar'd the same,
1036. Alledg'd by those who by their subtile Plea
1037. Had hope themselves to bear the Crown away.
1038. A Sister Alexander had, but she
1039. Claim'd not, perhaps, her Sex might hindrance be.
1040. After much tumult they at last proclaim'd
1041. His base born brother Aridæus nam'd,
1042. That so under his feeble wit and reign,
1043. Their ends they might the better still attain.
1044. This choice Perdiccas vehemently disclaim'd,
1045. And Babe unborn of Roxane he proclaim'd;
1046. Some wished him to take the style of King,
1047. Because his Master gave to him his Ring,
1048. And had to him still since Ephestion di'd
1049. More then to th'rest his favour testifi'd.
1050. But he refus'd, with feigned modesty,
1051. Hoping to be elect more generally.
1052. He hold on this occasion should have laid,
1053. For second offer there was never made.
1054. 'Mongst these contentions, tumults, jealousies,
1055. Seven dayes the corps of their great master lies
1056. Untoucht, uncovered slighted and neglected,
1057. So much these princes their own ends respected:
1058. A Contemplation to astonish Kings,
1059. That he who late possest all earthly things,
1060. And yet not so content unless that he
1061. Might be esteemed for a Diety;
1062. Now lay a Spectacle to testifie,
1063. The wretchedness of mans mortality.
1064. After some time, when stirs began to calm,
1065. His body did the Egyptians embalme;
1066. His countenance so lively did appear,
1067. That for a while they durst not come so near:
1068. No sign of poyson in his intrails sound,
1069. But all his bowels coloured, well and sound.
1070. Perdiccas seeing Arideus must be King,
1071. Under his name began to rule each thing.
1072. His chief Opponent who Control'd his sway,
1073. Was Meleager whom he would take away,
1074. And by a wile he got him in his power,
1075. So took his life unworthily that hour.
1076. Using the name, and the command of th'King
1077. To authorize his acts in every thing.
1078. The princes seeing Perdiccas power and pride,
1079. For their security did now provide.
1080. Antigonus for his share Asia takes,
1081. And Ptolemy next sure of Egypt makes:
1082. Seleucus afterward held Babylon,
1083. Antipater had long rul'd Macedon.
1084. These now to govern for the king pretends,
1085. But nothing less each one himself intends.
1086. Perdiccas took no province like the rest,
1087. But held command of th'Army (which was best)
1088. And had a higher project in his head,
1089. His Masters sister secretly to wed:
1090. So to the Lady, covertly he sent,
1091. (That none might know, to frustrate his intent)
1092. But Cleopatra this Suitor did deny,
1093. For Leonatus more lovely in her eye,
1094. To whom she sent a message of her mind,
1095. That if he came good welcome he should find.
1096. In these tumultuous dayes the thralled Greeks,
1097. Their Ancient Liberty afresh now seeks.
1098. And gladly would the yoke shake off, laid on
1099. Sometimes by Philip and his conquering son.
1100. The Athenians force Antipater to fly
1101. To Lamia where he shut up doth lye.
1102. To brave Craterus then he sends with speed
1103. For succours to relieve him in his need.
1104. The like of Leonatus he requires,
1105. (Which at this time well suited his desires)
1106. For to Antipater he now might goe,
1107. His Lady take in th'way, and no man know.
1108. Antiphilus the Athenian General
1109. With speed his Army doth together call;
1110. And Leonatus seeks to stop, that so
1111. He joyne not with Antipater their foe.
1112. The Athenian Army was the greater far,
1113. (Which did his Match with Cleopatra mar)
1114. For fighting still, while there did hope remain
1115. The valiant Chief amidst his foes was slain.
1116. 'Mongst all the princes of great Alexander
1117. For personage, none like to this Commander.
1118. Now to Antipater Craterus goes,
1119. Blockt up in Lamia still by his foes,
1120. Long marches through Cilicia he makes,
1121. And the remains of Leonatus takes:
1122. With them and his he into Grecia went,
1123. Antipater releas'd from prisonment:
1124. After which time the Greeks did never more
1125. Act any thing of worth, as heretofore:
1126. But under servitude their necks remain'd,
1127. Nor former liberty or glory gain'd.
1128. Now di'd about the end of th'Lamian war
1129. Demosthenes, that sweet-tongue'd Orator,
1130. Who fear'd Antipater would take his life
1131. For animating the Athenian strife:
1132. To end his dayes by poison rather chose
1133. Then fall into the hands of mortal foes.
1134. Craterus and Antipater now joyne,
1135. In love and in affinity combine,
1136. Craterus doth his daughter Phila wed
1137. Their friendship might the more be strengthened.
1138. Whilst they in Macedon do thus agree,
1139. In Asia they all asunder be.
1140. Perdiccas griev'd to see the princes bold
1141. So many Kingdomes in their power to hold,
1142. Yet to regain them, how he did not know,
1143. His souldiers 'gainst those captains would not goe
1144. To suffer them go on as they begun,
1145. Was to give way himself might be undone.
1146. With Antipater to joyne he sometimes thought,
1147. That by his help, the rest might low be brought,
1148. But this again dislikes; he would remain,
1149. If not in stile, in deed a soveraign;
1150. (For all the princes of great Alexander
1151. Acknowledged for Chief that old Commander)
1152. Desires the King to goe to Macedon,
1153. Which once was of his Ancestors the throne,
1154. And by his presence there to nullifie
1155. The acts of his Vice-Roy now grown so high.
1156. Antigonus of treason first attaints,
1157. And summons him to answer his complaints.
1158. This he avoids, and ships himself and son,
1159. goes to Antipater and tells what's done.
1160. He and Craterus, both with him do joyne,
1161. And 'gainst Perdiccas all their strength combine.
1162. Brave Ptolemy, to make a fourth then sent
1163. To save himself from danger imminent.
1164. In midst of these garboyles, with wondrous state
1165. His masters funeral doth celebrate:
1166. In Alexandria his tomb he plac'd,
1167. Which eating time hath scarcely yet defac'd.
1168. Two years and more, since natures debt he paid,
1169. And yet till now at quiet was not laid.
1170. Great love did Ptolemy by this act gain,
1171. And made the souldiers on his side remain.
1172. Perdiccas hears his foes are all combin'd,
1173. 'Gainst which to goe, is not resolv'd in mind.
1174. But first 'gainst Ptolemy he judg'd was best,
1175. Neer'st unto him, and farthest from the rest,
1176. Leaves Eumenes the Asian Coast to free
1177. From the invasions of the other three,
1178. And with his army unto Egypt goes
1179. Brave Ptolemy to th'utmost to oppose.
1180. Perdiccas surly cariage, and his pride
1181. Did alinate the souldiers from his side.
1182. But Ptolemy by affability
1183. His sweet demeanour and his courtesie,
1184. Did make his own, firm to his cause remain,
1185. And from the other side did dayly gain.
1186. Perdiccas in his pride did ill intreat
1187. Python of haughty mind, and courage great.
1188. Who could not brook so great indignity,
1189. But of his wrongs his friends doth certifie;
1190. The souldiers 'gainst Perdiccas they incense,
1191. Who vow to make this captain recompence,
1192. And in a rage they rush into his tent,
1193. Knock out his brains: to Ptolemy then went
1194. And offer him his honours, and his place,
1195. With stile of the Protector, him to grace.
1196. Next day into the camp came Ptolemy,
1197. And is receiv'd of all most joyfully.
1198. Their proffers he refus'd with modesty,
1199. Yields them to Python for his courtesie.
1200. With what he held he was now more content,
1201. Then by more trouble to grow eminent.
1202. Now comes there news of a great victory
1203. That Eumenes got of the other three.
1204. Had it but in Perdiccas life ariv'd,
1205. With greater joy it would have been receiv'd.
1206. Thus Ptolemy rich Egypt did retain,
1207. And Python turn'd to Asia again.
1208. Whilst Perdiccas encamp'd in Affrica,
1209. Antigonus did enter Asia,
1210. And fain would Eumenes draw to their side,
1211. But he alone most faithfull did abide:
1212. The other all had Kingdomes in their eye,
1213. But he was true to's masters family,
1214. Nor could Craterus, whom he much did love.
1215. From his fidelity once make him move:
1216. Two Battles fought, and had of both the best,
1217. And brave Craterus slew among the rest:
1218. For this sad strife he poures out his complaints,
1219. And his beloved foe full sore laments.
1220. I should but snip a story into bits
1221. And his great Acts and glory much eclipse,
1222. To shew the dangers Eumenes befel,
1223. His stratagems wherein he did excel:
1224. His Policies, how he did extricate
1225. Himself from out of Lab'rinths intricate:
1226. He that at large would satisfie his mind,
1227. In Plutarchs Lives his history may find.
1228. For all that should be said, let this suffice,
1229. He was both valiant, faithfull, patient, wise.
1230. Python now chose Protector of the state,
1231. His rule Queen Euridice begins to hate,
1232. Sees Arrideus must not King it long,
1233. If once young Alexander grow more strong,
1234. But that her husband serve for supplement,
1235. To warm his seat, was never her intent.
1236. She knew her birth-right gave her Macedon,
1237. Grand-child to him who once sat on that throne
1238. Who was Perdiccas, Philips eldest brother,
1239. She daughter to his son, who had no other.
1240. Pythons commands, as oft she countermands;
1241. What he appoints, she purposely withstands.
1242. He wearied out at last would needs be gone,
1243. Resign'd his place, and so let all alone:
1244. In's room the souldiers chose Antipater,
1245. Who vext the Queen more then the other far.
1246. From Macedon to Asia he came,
1247. That he might settle matters in the same.
1248. He plac'd, displac'd, control'd rul'd as he list,
1249. And this no man durst question or resist;
1250. For all the nobles of King Alexander
1251. Their bonnets vail'd to him as chief Commander.
1252. When to his pleasure all things they had done,
1253. The King and Queen he takes to Macedon,
1254. Two sons of Alexander, and the rest,
1255. All to be order'd there as he thought best.
1256. The Army to Antigonus doth leave,
1257. And Government of Asia to him gave.
1258. And thus Antipater the ground-work layes,
1259. On which Antigonus his height doth raise,
1260. Who in few years, the rest so overtops,
1261. For universal Monarchy he hopes.
1262. With Eumenes he diverse Battels fought,
1263. And by his slights to circumvent him sought:
1264. But vain it was to use his policy,
1265. 'Gainst him that all deceits could scan and try.
1266. In this Epitome too long to tell
1267. How finely Eumenes did here excell,
1268. And by the self same Traps the other laid,
1269. He to his cost was righteously repaid.
1270. But while these Chieftains doe in Asia fight,
1271. To Greece and Macedon lets turn our sight.
1272. When great Antipater the world must leave,
1273. His place to Polisperchon did bequeath,
1274. Fearing his son Cassander was unstaid,
1275. Too rash to bear that charge, if on him laid.
1276. Antigonus hearing of his decease
1277. On most part of Assyria doth seize.
1278. And Ptolemy next to incroach begins,
1279. All Syria and Phenicia he wins,
1280. Then Polisperchon 'gins to act in's place,
1281. Recalls Olimpias the Court to grace.
1282. Antipater had banish'd her from thence
1283. Into Epire for her great turbulence;
1284. This new Protector's of another mind,
1285. Thinks by her Majesty much help to find.
1286. Cassander like his Father could not see,
1287. This Polisperchons great ability,
1288. Slights his Commands, his actions he disclaims,
1289. And to be chief himself now bends his aims;
1290. Such as his Father had advanc'd to place,
1291. Or by his favours any way had grac'd
1292. Are now at the devotion of the Son,
1293. Prest to accomplish what he would have done;
1294. Besides he was the young Queens favourite,
1295. On whom (t'was thought) she set her chief delight:
1296. Unto these helps at home he seeks out more,
1297. Goes to Antigonus and doth implore,
1298. By all the Bonds 'twixt him and's Father past,
1299. And for that great gift which he gave him last.
1300. By these and all to grant him some supply,
1301. To take down Polisperchon grown so high;
1302. For this Antigonus did need no spurs,
1303. Hoping to gain yet more by these new stirs,
1304. Streight furnish'd him with a sufficient aid,
1305. And so he quick returns thus well appaid,
1306. With Ships at Sea, an Army for the Land,
1307. His proud opponent hopes soon to withstand.
1308. But in his absence Polisperchon takes
1309. Such friends away as for his Interest makes
1310. By death, by prison, or by banishment,
1311. That no supply by these here might be lent,
1312. Cassander with his Host to Grecia goes,
1313. Whom Polisperchon labours to oppose;
1314. But beaten was at Sea, and foil'd at Land,
1315. Cassanders forces had the upper hand,
1316. Athens with many Towns in Greece beside,
1317. Firm (for his Fathers sake) to him abide.
1318. Whil'st hot in wars these two in Greece remain,
1319. Antigonus doth all in Asia gain;
1320. Still labours Eumenes, would with him side,
1321. But all in vain, he faithful did abide:
1322. Nor Mother could, nor Sons of Alexander,
1323. Put trust in any but in this Commander.
1324. The great ones now began to shew their mind,
1325. And act as opportunity they find.
1326. Aridæus the scorn'd and simple King,
1327. More then he bidden was could act no thing.
1328. Polisperchon for office hoping long,
1329. Thinks to inthrone the Prince when riper grown;
1330. Euridice this injury disdains,
1331. And to Cassandar of this wrong complains.
1332. Hateful the name and house of Alexander,
1333. Was to this proud vindicative Cassander;
1334. He still kept lockt within his memory,
1335. His Fathers danger, with his Family;
1336. Nor thought he that indignity was small,
1337. When Alexander knockt his head to th'wall.
1338. These with his love unto the amorous Queen,
1339. Did make him vow her servant to be seen.
1340. Olimpias, Aridæus deadly hates,
1341. As all her Husbands, Children by his mates,
1342. She gave him poyson formerly ('tis thought)
1343. Which damage both to mind and body brought;
1344. She now with Polisperchon doth combine,
1345. To make the King by force his Seat resigne:
1346. And her young grand-child in his State inthrone,
1347. That under him, she might rule, all alone.
1348. For aid she goes t'Epire among her friends,
1349. The better to accomplish these her ends;
1350. Euridice hearing what she intends,
1351. In haste unto her friend Cassander sends,
1352. To leave his siege at Tegea, and with speed,
1353. To save the King and her in this their need:
1354. Then by intreaties, promises and Coyne,
1355. Some forces did procure with her to joyn.
1356. Olimpias soon enters Macedon,
1357. The Queen to meet her bravely marches on,
1358. But when her Souldiers saw their ancient Queen,
1359. Calling to mind what sometime she had been;
1360. The wife and Mother of their famous Kings,
1361. Nor darts, nor arrows, now none shoots or flings.
1362. The King and Queen seeing their destiny,
1363. To save their lives t'Amphipolis do fly;
1364. But the old Queen pursues them with her hate,
1365. And needs will have their lives as well as State:
1366. The King by extream torments had his end,
1367. And to the Queen these presents she did send;
1368. A Halter, cup of poyson, and a Sword,
1369. Bids chuse her death, such kindness she'l afford.
1370. The Queen with many a curse, and bitter check,
1371. At length yields to the Halter her fair neck;
1372. Praying that fatal day might quickly haste,
1373. On which Olimpias of the like might taste.
1374. This done the cruel Queen rests not content,
1375. 'Gainst all that lov'd Cassander she was bent;
1376. His Brethren, Kinsfolk and his chiefest friends,
1377. That fell within her reach came to their ends:
1378. Dig'd up his brother dead, 'gainst natures right,
1379. And threw his bones about to shew her spight:
1380. The Courtiers wondring at her furious mind,
1381. Wisht in Epire she had been still confin'd.
1382. In Peloponesus then Cassander lay,
1383. Where hearing of this news he speeds away,
1384. With rage, and with revenge he's hurried on,
1385. To find this cruel Queen in Macedon;
1386. But being stopt, at streight Thermopoly,
1387. Sea passage gets, and lands in Thessaly:
1388. His Army he divides, sends post away,
1389. Polisperchon to hold a while in play;
1390. And with the rest Olimpias pursues,
1391. For all her cruelty, to give her dues.
1392. She with the chief o' th'Court to Pydna flyes,
1393. Well fortifi'd, (and on the Sea it lyes)
1394. There by Cassander she's blockt up so long,
1395. Untill the Famine grows exceeding strong,
1396. Her Couzen of Epire did what he might,
1397. To raise the Siege, and put her Foes to flight.
1398. Cassander is resolved there to remain,
1399. So succours and endeavours proves but vain;
1400. Fain would this wretched Queen capitulate,
1401. Her foe would give no Ear, (such is his hate)
1402. The Souldiers pinched with this scarcity,
1403. By stealth unto Cassander dayly fly;
1404. Olimpias means to hold out to the last,
1405. Expecting nothing but of death to tast:
1406. But his occasions calling him away,
1407. Gives promise for her life, so wins the day.
1408. No sooner had he got her in his hand,
1409. But made in judgement her accusers stand;
1410. And plead the blood of friends and kindreds spilt,
1411. Desiring justice might be done for guilt;
1412. And so was he acquitted of his word,
1413. For justice sake she being put to th'Sword:
1414. This was the end of this most cruel Queen,
1415. Whose fury scarcely parallel'd hath been.
1416. The daughter, sister, Mother, Wife to Kings,
1417. But Royalty no good conditions brings;
1418. To Husbands death ('tis thought) she gave consent,
1419. The murtherer she did so much lament:
1420. With Garlands crown'd his head, bemoan'd his fates,
1421. His Sword unto Apollo consecrates.
1422. Her Outrages too tedious to relate,
1423. How for no cause but her inveterate hate;
1424. Her Husbands wives and Children after's death,
1425. Some slew, some fry'd, of others stopt the breath:
1426. Now in her Age she's forc'd to tast that Cup,
1427. Which she had others often made to sup.
1428. Now many Towns in Macedon supprest,
1429. And Pellas fain to yield among the rest;
1430. The Funerals Cassander celebrates,
1431. Of Aridæus and his Queen with State:
1432. Among their Ancestors by him they're laid,
1433. And shews of lamentation for them made.
1434. Old Thebes he then rebuilt so much of fame,
1435. And Cassandria rais'd after his name.
1436. But leave him building, others in their Urne,
1437. Let's for a while, now into Asia turn.
1438. True Eumenes endeavours by all Skill,
1439. To keep Antigonus from Shushan still;
1440. Having command o'th' Treasure he can hire,
1441. Such as no threats, nor favour could acquire.
1442. In divers Battels he had good success,
1443. Antigonus came off still honourless;
1444. When Victor oft he'd been, and so might still,
1445. Peucestes did betray him by a wile.
1446. T'Antigonus, who took his Life unjust,
1447. Because he never would forgoe his trust;
1448. Thus lost he all for his fidelity,
1449. Striving t'uphold his Masters Family.
1450. But to a period as that did haste,
1451. So Eumenes (the prop) of death must tast;
1452. All Persia now Antigonus doth gain,
1453. And Master of the Treasure sole remain:
1454. Then with Seleucus streight at odds doth fall,
1455. And he for aid to Ptolomy doth call,
1456. The Princes all begin now to envy
1457. Antigonus, he growing up so high;
1458. Fearing his force, and what might hap e're long,
1459. Enters into a Combination strong,
1460. Seleucus, Ptolemy, Cassander joynes,
1461. Lysimachus to make a fourth combines:
1462. Antigonus desirous of the Greeks,
1463. To make Cassander odious to them seeks,
1464. Sends forth his declarations near and far,
1465. And clears what cause he had to make this war,
1466. Cassanders outrages at large doth tell,
1467. Shews his ambitious practises as well.
1468. The mother of their King to death he'd put,
1469. His wife and son in prison close had shut:
1470. And aiming now to make himself a king,
1471. And that some title he might seem to bring,
1472. Thessalonica he had newly wed,
1473. Daughter to Philip their renowned head:
1474. Had built and call'd a City by his name,
1475. Which none e're did, but those of royal fame:
1476. And in despight of their two famous Kings
1477. Hatefull Olinthians to Greece rebrings.
1478. Rebellious Thebes he had reedified,
1479. Which their late King in dust had damnified,
1480. Requires them therefore to take up their arms
1481. And to requite this traitor for these harms.
1482. Then Ptolemy would gain the Greeks likewise,
1483. And he declares the others injuryes:
1484. First how he held the Empire in his hands,
1485. Seleucus driven from Goverment and lands,
1486. The valiant Eumenes unjustly slain,
1487. And Lord of royal Shushan did remain;
1488. Therefore requests their help to take him down
1489. Before he wear the universal Crown.
1490. These princes at the sea soon had a fight,
1491. Where great Antigonus was put to flight:
1492. His son at Gaza likewise lost the field,
1493. So Syria to Ptolemy did yield:
1494. And Seleucus recovers Babylon,
1495. Still gaining Countryes eastward he goes on.
1496. Demetrius with Ptolemy did fight,
1497. And coming unawares, put him to flight;
1498. But bravely sends the prisoners back again,
1499. With all the spoyle and booty he had tane.
1500. Courteous as noble Ptolemy, or more,
1501. VVho at Gaza did the like to him before.
1502. Antigonus did much rejoyce, his son
1503. VVith victory, his lost repute had won.
1504. At last these princes tired out with warrs,
1505. Sought for a peace, and laid aside their jarrs:
1506. The terms of their agreement, thus express
1507. That each should hold what now he did possess,
1508. Till Alexander unto age was grown,
1509. VVho then should be enstalled in the throne.
1510. This toucht Cassander sore for what he'd done,
1511. Imprisoning both the mother and the son:
1512. He sees the Greeks now favour their young Prince
1513. Whom he in durance held, now, and long since,
1514. That in few years he must be forc'd or glad,
1515. To render up such Kingdomes as he had;
1516. Resolves to quit his fears by one deed done,
1517. So puts to death the Mother and her Son.
1518. This Roxane for her beauty all commend,
1519. But for one act she did, just was her end.
1520. No sooner was great Alexander dead,
1521. But she Darius daughters murthered.
1522. Both thrown into a well to hide her blot,
1523. Perdiccas was her Partner in this plot.
1524. The heavens seem'd slow in paying her the same;
1525. But at the last the hand of vengeance came.
1526. And for that double fact which she had done,
1527. The life of her must goe, and of her son
1528. Perdiccas had before for his amiss,
1529. But by their hands who thought not once of this.
1530. Cassanders deed the princes do detest,
1531. But 'twas in shew; in heart it pleas'd them best.
1532. That he is odious to the world, they'r glad:
1533. And now they were free Lords of what they had.
1534. When this foul tragedy was past and done,
1535. Polysperchon brings the other son
1536. Call'd Hercules, and elder then his brother,
1537. (But Olimpias would prefer the other)
1538. The Greeks toucht with the murther done of late,
1539. This Orphan prince 'gan to compassionate,
1540. Begin to mutter much 'gainst proud Cassander,
1541. And place their hopes on th'heir of Alexander.
1542. Cassander fear'd what might of this ensue,
1543. So Polisperchon to his counsel drew,
1544. And gives Peloponesus for his hire,
1545. Who slew the prince according to desire.
1546. Thus was the race and house of Alexander
1547. Extinct by this inhumane wretch Cassander.
1548. Antigonus, for all this doth not mourn,
1549. He knows to's profit, this at last will turn,
1550. But that some Title now he might pretend,
1551. To Cleopatra doth for marriage send;
1552. Lysimachus and Ptolemy the same,
1553. And lewd Cassander too, sticks not for shame:
1554. She then in Lydia at Sardis lay,
1555. Where by Embassage all these Princes pray.
1556. Choice above all, of Ptolemy she makes,
1557. With his Embassador her journy takes;
1558. Antigonus Lieutenant stayes her still,
1559. Untill he further know his Masters will:
1560. Antigonus now had a Wolf by th'Ears,
1561. To hold her still, or let her go he fears.
1562. Resolves at last the Princess should be slain,
1563. So hinders him of her, he could not gain;
1564. Her women are appointed for this deed,
1565. They for their great reward no better speed:
1566. For by command, they streight were put to death,
1567. As vile Conspirators that stopt her breath.
1568. And now he hopes, he's order'd all so well,
1569. The world must needs believe what he doth tell;
1570. Thus Philips house was quite extinguished,
1571. Except Cassanders wife who yet not dead.
1572. And by their means who thought of nothing less,
1573. Then vengeance just, against them to express;
1574. Now blood was paid with blood for what was done
1575. By cruel Father, Mother, cruel Son:
1576. Thus may we hear, and fear, and ever say,
1577. That hand is righteous still which doth repay.
1578. These Captains now the stile of Kings do take,
1579. For to their Crowns their's none can Title make;
1580. Demetrius first the royal stile assum'd,
1581. By his Example all the rest presum'd.
1582. Antigonus himself to ingratiate,
1583. Doth promise liberty to Athens State;
1584. With Arms and with provision stores them well,
1585. The better 'gainst Cassander to rebel.
1586. Demetrius thether goes, is entertain'd
1587. Not like a King, but like some God they feign'd;
1588. Most grosly base was their great Adulation,
1589. Who Incense burnt, and offered oblation:
1590. These Kings afresh fall to their wars again,
1591. Demetrius of Ptolemy doth gain.
1592. 'Twould be an endless Story to relate
1593. Their several Battels and their several fate,
1594. Their fights by Sea, their victories by Land,
1595. How some when down, straight got the upper hand
1596. Antigonus and Seleucus then fight
1597. Near Ephesus, each bringing all his might,
1598. And he that Conquerour shall now remain,
1599. The Lordship of all Asia shall retain;
1600. This day 'twixt these two Kings ends all the strife,
1601. For here Antigonus lost rule and life:
1602. Nor to his Son, did e're one foot remain
1603. Of those vast Kingdomes, he did sometimes gain.
1604. Demetrius with his Troops to Athens flyes,
1605. Hopes to find succours in his miseries;
1606. But they adoring in prosperity,
1607. Now shut their gates in his adversity:
1608. He sorely griev'd at this his desperate State
1609. Tryes Foes, sith friends will not compassionate.
1610. His peace he then with old Seleucus makes,
1611. Who his fair daughter Stratonica takes,
1612. Antiochus, Seleucus, dear lov'd Son,
1613. Is for this fresh young Lady quite undone;
1614. Falls so extreamly sick, all fear'd his life,
1615. Yet durst not say, he lov'd his Fathers wife,
1616. When his disease the skill'd Physitian found,
1617. His Fathers mind he wittily did sound,
1618. Who did no sooner understand the same,
1619. But willingly resign'd the beautious Dame:
1620. Cassander now must dye his race is run,
1621. And leaves the ill got Kingdomes he had won.
1622. Two Sons he left, born of King Philips daughter,
1623. Who had an end put to their dayes by slaughter;
1624. Which should succeed at variance they fell,
1625. The Mother would, the youngest might excell:
1626. The eld'st inrag'd did play the Vipers part,
1627. And with his Sword did run her through the heart:
1628. Rather then Philips race should longer live,
1629. He whom she gave his life her death shall give.
1630. This by Lysimacus was after slain,
1631. Whose daughter he not long before had ta'ne;
1632. Demetrius is call'd in by th'youngest Son,
1633. Against Lysimachus who from him won.
1634. But he a Kingdome more then's friend did eye,
1635. Seaz'd upon that, and slew him traitrously.
1636. Thus Philips and Cassander's race both gone,
1637. And so falls out to be extinct in one;
1638. And though Cassander died in his bed,
1639. His Seed to be extirpt, was destined;
1640. For blood, which was decre'd that he should spill,
1641. Yet must his Children pay for Fathers ill;
1642. Jehu in killing Ahab's house did well,
1643. Yet be aveng'd must blood of Jezerel.
1644. Demetrius thus Cassander's Kingdoms gains,
1645. And now in Macedon as King he reigns;
1646. Though men and mony both he hath at will,
1647. In neither finds content if he sits still:
1648. That Seleucus holds Asia grievs him sore,
1649. Those Countryes large his Father got before.
1650. These to recover, musters all his might,
1651. And with his Son in Law will needs go fight;
1652. A mighty Navy rig'd, an Army stout,
1653. With these he hopes to turn the world about:
1654. Leaving Antigonus his eldest Son,
1655. In his long absence to rule Macedon.
1656. Demetrius with so many troubles met,
1657. As Heaven and Earth against him had been set;
1658. Disaster on disaster him pursue,
1659. His story seems a Fable more then true.
1660. At last he's taken and imprisoned
1661. Within an Isle that was with pleasures fed,
1662. Injoy'd what ere beseem'd his Royalty,
1663. Only restrained of his liberty:
1664. After three years he died, left what he'd won,
1665. In Greece unto Antigonus his Son.
1666. For his Posterity unto this day,
1667. Did ne're regain one foot in Asia;
1668. His Body Seleucus sends to his Son,
1669. Whose obsequies with wondrous pomp was done.
1670. Next di'd the brave and noble Ptolemp,
1671. Renown'd for bounty, valour, clemency,
1672. Rich Egypt left, and what else he had won,
1673. To Philadelphus his more worthy Son.
1674. Of the old Heroes, now but two remain,
1675. Seleucus and Lysimachus these twain,
1676. Must needs go try their fortune and their might,
1677. And so Lysimachus was slain in fight;
1678. 'Twas no small joy unto Seleucus breast,
1679. That now he had out-lived all the rest:
1680. Possession of Europe thinks to take,
1681. And so himself the only Monarch make;
1682. Whilst with these hopes in Greece he did remain,
1683. He was by Ptolemy Ceraunus slain.
1684. The second Son of the first Ptolemy,
1685. Who for Rebellion unto him did fly;
1686. Seleucus was a Father and a friend,
1687. Yet by him had this most unworthy end.
1688. Thus with these Kingly Captains have we done,
1689. A little now how the Succession run,
1690. Antigonus, Seleucus and Cassander,
1691. With Ptolemy, reign'd after Alexander;
1692. Cassander's Sons soon after's death were slain,
1693. So three Successors only did remain:
1694. Antigonus his Kingdomes lost and life,
1695. Unto Seleucus, Author of that strife.
1696. His Son Demetrius, all Cassanders gains,
1697. And his posterity, the same retains;
1698. Demetrius Son was call'd Antigonus,
1699. And his again was nam'd Demetrius.
1700. I must let pass those many Battels fought,
1701. Betwixt those Kings, and noble Pyrrhus stout,
1702. And his Son Alexander of Epire,
1703. Whereby immortal honour they acquire;
1704. Demetrius had Philip to his Son,
1705. (Part of whose Kingdomes Titus Quintius won)
1706. Philip had Perseus, who was made a Thrale
1707. T'Emilius the Roman General;
1708. Him with his Sons in Triumph lead did he,
1709. Such riches too as Rome did never see:
1710. This of Antigonus, his Seed's the Fate,
1711. VVhose Empire was subdu'd to th'Roman State.
1712. Longer Seleucus held the royalty,
1713. In Syria by his Posterity;
1714. Antiochus Soter his Son was nam'd,
1715. To whom the old Berosus (so much fam'd,)
1716. His Book of Assurs Monarchs dedicates,
1717. Tells of their names, their wars, their riches, fates;
1718. But this is perished with many more,
1719. VVhich oft we wish was extant as before.
1720. Antiochus Theos was Soter's Son,
1721. VVho a long war with Egypts King begun;
1722. The Affinityes and Wars Daniel sets forth,
1723. And calls them there the Kings of South & North,
1724. This Theos murther'd was by his lewd wife,
1725. Seleucus reign'd, when he had lost his life.
1726. A third Seleucus next sits on the Seat,
1727. And then Antiochus sirnam'd the great,
1728. VVhose large Dominions after was made small,
1729. By Scipio the Roman General;
1730. Fourth Seleucus Antiochus succeeds,
1731. And next Epiphanes whose wicked deeds,
1732. Horrid Massacres, Murthers, cruelties,
1733. Amongst the Jews we read in Machabees.
1734. Antiochus Eupater was the next,
1735. By Rebels and Impostors dayly vext;
1736. So many Princes still were murthered,
1737. The Royal Blood was nigh extinguished;
1738. Then Tygranes the great Armenian King,
1739. To take the Government was called in,
1740. Lucullus, Him, (the Roman General)
1741. Vanquish'd in fight, and took those Kingdomes all;
1742. Of Greece and Syria thus the rule did end,
1743. In Egypt next, a little time wee'l spend.
1744. First Ptolemy being dead, his famous Son
1745. Call'd Philadelphus, did possess the Throne.
1746. At Alexandria a Library did build,
1747. And with seven hundred thousand Volumes fill'd;
1748. The seventy two Interpreters did seek,
1749. They might translate the Bible into Greek.
1750. His Son was Evergetes the last Prince,
1751. That valour shew'd, virtue, or excellence,
1752. Philopater was Evergetes Son,
1753. After Epiphanes sate on the Throne;
1754. Philometor, Evergetes again,
1755. And after him, did false Lathurus reign:
1756. Then Alexander in Lathurus stead,
1757. Next Auletes, who cut off Pompeys head.
1758. To all these names, we Ptolemy must add,
1759. For since the first, they still that Title had.
1760. Fair Cleopatra next, last of that race,
1761. Whom Julius Cæsar set in Royal place,
1762. She with her Paramour, Mark Anthony
1763. Held for a time, the Egyptian Monarchy,
1764. Till great Augustus had with him a fight
1765. At Actium, where his Navy's put to flight;
1766. He seeing his honour lost, his Kingdome end,
1767. Did by his Sword his life soon after send.
1768. His brave Virago Aspes sets to her Arms,
1769. To take her life, and quit her from all harms;
1770. For 'twas not death nor danger she did dread,
1771. But some disgrace in triumph to be led.
1772. Here ends at last the Grecian Monarchy,
1773. Which by the Romans had its destiny;
1774. Thus King & Kingdomes have their times & dates,
1775. Their standings, overturnings, bounds and fates:
1776. Now up, now down now chief, & then broght under,
1777. The heavn's thus rule, to fil the world with wonder
1778. The Assyrian Monarchy long time did stand,
1779. But yet the Persian got the upper hand;
1780. The Grecian them did utterly subdue,
1781. And millions were subjected unto few:
1782. The Grecian longer then the Persian stood,
1783. Then came the Roman like a raging flood;
1784. And with the torrent of his rapid course,
1785. Their Crowns their Titles, riches bears by force.
1786. The first was likened to a head of gold.
1787. Next Arms and breast of silver to behold,
1788. The third, Belly and Thighs of brass in sight,
1789. And last was Iron, which breaketh all with might;
1790. The stone out of the mountain then did rise,
1791. and smote those feet those legs, those arms & thighs
1792. Then gold, silver, brass, Iron and all the store,
1793. Became like Chaff upon the threshing Floor.
1794. The first a Lion, second was a Bear,
1795. The third a Leopard, which four wings did rear;
1796. The last more strong and dreadful then the rest,
1797. Whose Iron teeth devoured every Beast,
1798. And when he had no appetite to eat,
1799. The residue he stamped under feet;
1800. Yet shall this Lion, Bear, this Leopard, Ram,
1801. All trembling stand before the powerful Lamb.
1802. With these three Monarchyes now have I done,
1803. But how the fourth, their Kingdomes from them won,
1804. And how from small beginnings it did grow,
1805. To fill the world with terrour and with woe;
1806. My tyred brain leavs to some better pen,
1807. This task befits not women like to men:
1808. For what is past, I blush, excuse to make,
1809. But humbly stand, some grave reproof to take;
1810. Pardon to crave for errours, is but vain,
1811. The Subject was too high, beyond my strain,
1812. To frame Apology for some offence,
1813. Converts our boldness into impudence:
1814. This my presumption some now to requite,
1815. Ne sutor ultra crepidum may write.
1816. The End of the Grecian Monarchy.
