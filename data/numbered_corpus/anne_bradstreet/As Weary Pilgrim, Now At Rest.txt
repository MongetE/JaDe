1. As weary pilgrim, now at rest,
2. Hugs with delight his silent nest
3. His wasted limbes, now lye full soft
4. That myrie steps, haue troden oft
5. Blesses himself, to think vpon
6. his dangers past, and travailes done
7. The burning sun no more shall heat
8. Nor stormy raines, on him shall beat.
9. The bryars and thornes no more shall scratch
10. nor hungry wolues at him shall catch
11. He erring pathes no more shall tread
12. nor wild fruits eate, in stead of bread,
13. for waters cold he doth not long
14. for thirst no more shall parch his tongue
15. No rugged stones his feet shall gaule
16. nor stumps nor rocks cause him to fall
17. All cares and feares, he bids farwell
18. and meanes in safity now to dwell.
19. A pilgrim I, on earth, perplext
20. wth sinns wth cares and sorrows vext
21. By age and paines brought to decay
22. and my Clay house mouldring away
23. Oh how I long to be at rest
24. and soare on high among the blest.
25. This body shall in silence sleep
26. Mine eyes no more shall ever weep
27. No fainting fits shall me assaile
28. nor grinding paines my body fraile
29. Wth cares and fears ne'r cumbred be
30. Nor losses know, nor sorrowes see
31. What tho my flesh shall there consume
32. it is the bed Christ did perfume
33. And when a few yeares shall be gone
34. this mortall shall be cloth'd vpon
35. A Corrupt Carcasse downe it lyes
36. a glorious body it shall rise
37. In weaknes and dishonour sowne
38. in power 'tis rais'd by Christ alone
39. Then soule and body shall vnite
40. and of their maker haue the sight
41. Such lasting ioyes shall there behold
42. as eare ne'r heard nor tongue e'er told
43. Lord make me ready for that day
44. then Come deare bridgrome Come away.
