1. In secret place where once I stood
2. Close by the Banks of Lacrim flood,
3. I heard two sisters reason on
4. Things that are past and things to come.
5. One Flesh was call'd, who had her eye
6. On worldly wealth and vanity;
7. The other Spirit, who did rear
8. Her thoughts unto a higher sphere.
9. "Sister," quoth Flesh, "what liv'st thou on
10. Nothing but Meditation?
11. Doth Contemplation feed thee so
12. Regardlessly to let earth go?
13. Can Speculation satisfy
14. Notion without Reality?
15. Dost dream of things beyond the Moon
16. And dost thou hope to dwell there soon?
17. Hast treasures there laid up in store
18. That all in th' world thou count'st but poor?
19. Art fancy-sick or turn'd a Sot
20. To catch at shadows which are not?
21. Come, come. I'll show unto thy sense,
22. Industry hath its recompence.
23. What canst desire, but thou maist see
24. True substance in variety?
25. Dost honour like? Acquire the same,
26. As some to their immortal fame;
27. And trophies to thy name erect
28. Which wearing time shall ne'er deject.
29. For riches dost thou long full sore?
30. Behold enough of precious store.
31. Earth hath more silver, pearls, and gold
32. Than eyes can see or hands can hold.
33. Affects thou pleasure? Take thy fill.
34. Earth hath enough of what you will.
35. Then let not go what thou maist find
36. For things unknown only in mind."
