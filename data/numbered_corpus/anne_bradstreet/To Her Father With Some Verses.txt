1. Most truly honoured, and as truly dear,
2. If worth in me or ought I do appear,
3. Who can of right better demand the same
4. Than may your worthy self from whom it came?
5. The principal might yield a greater sum,
6. Yet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb;
7. My stock's so small I know not how to pay,
8. My bond remains in force unto this day;
9. Yet for part payment take this simple mite,
10. Where nothing's to be had, kings loose their right.
11. Such is my debt I may not say forgive,
12. But as I can, I'll pay it while I live;
13. Such is my bond, none can discharge but I,
14. Yet paying is not paid until I die.
