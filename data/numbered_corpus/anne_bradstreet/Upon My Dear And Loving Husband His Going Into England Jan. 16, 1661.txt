1. O thou Most High who rulest all
2. And hear'st the prayers of thine,
3. O hearken, Lord, unto my suit
4. And my petition sign.

5. Into Thy everlasting arms Of mercy
6. I commend Thy servant, Lord.
7. Keep and preserve My husband,
8. my dear friend.

9. At Thy command, O Lord, he went,
10. Nor nought could keep him back.
11. Then let Thy promise joy his heart,
12. O help and be not slack.

13. Uphold my heart in Thee, O God.
14. Thou art my strength and stay,
15. Thou see'st how weak and frail I am,
16. Hide not Thy face away.

17. I in obedience to Thy will
18. Thou knowest did submit.
19. It was my duty so to do;
20. O Lord, accept of it.

21. Unthankfulness for mercies past
22. Impute Thou not to me.
23. O Lord, Thou know'st my weak desire
24. Was to sing praise to Thee.

25. Lord, be Thou pilot to the ship
26. And send them prosperous gales.
27. In storms and sickness, Lord, preserve.
28. Thy goodness never fails.

29. Unto Thy work he hath in hand
30. Lord, grant Thou good success
31. And favour in their eyes to whom
32. He shall make his address.

33. Remember, Lord, Thy folk whom Thou
34. To wilderness hast brought;
35. Let not Thine own inheritance
36. Be sold away for nought.

37. But tokens of Thy favour give,
38. With joy send back my dear
39. That I and all Thy servants may
40. Rejoice with heavenly cheer.

41. Lord, let my eyes see once again
42. Him whom Thou gavest me
43. That we together may sing praise
44. Forever unto Thee.

45. And the remainder of our days
46. Shall consecrated be
47. With an engaged heart to sing
48. All praises unto Thee.
