1. The Fire, Air, Earth and water did contest
2. Which was the strongest, noblest and the best,
3. Who was of greatest use and might'est force;
4. In placide Terms they thought now to discourse,
5. That in due order each her turn should speak;
6. But enmity this amity did break
7. All would be chief, and all scorn'd to be under
8. Whence issu'd winds & rains, lightning & thunder
9. The quaking earth did groan, the Sky lookt black
10. The Fire, the forced Air, in sunder crack;
11. The sea did threat the heav'ns, the heavn's the earth,
12. All looked like a Chaos or new birth:
13. Fire broyled Earth, & scorched Earth it choaked
14. Both by their darings, water so provoked
15. That roaring in it came, and with its source
16. Soon made the Combatants abate their force
17. The rumbling hissing, puffing was so great
18. The worlds confusion, it did seem to threat
19. Till gentle Air, Contention so abated
20. That betwixt hot and cold, she arbitrated
21. The others difference, being less did cease
22. All storms now laid, and they in perfect peace
23. That Fire should first begin, the rest consent,
24. The noblest and most active Element.
