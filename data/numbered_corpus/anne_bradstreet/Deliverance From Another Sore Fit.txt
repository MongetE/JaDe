1. In my distress I sought the Lord
2. When naught on earth could comfort give,
3. And when my soul these things abhorred,
4. Then, Lord, Thou said'st unto me, "Live."

5. Thou knowest the sorrows that I felt;
6. My plaints and groans were heard of Thee,
7. And how in sweat I seemed to melt
8. Thou help'st and Thou regardest me.

9. My wasted flesh Thou didst restore,
10. My feeble loins didst gird with strength,
11. Yea, when I was most low and poor,
12. I said I shall praise Thee at length.

13. What shall I render to my God
14. For all His bounty showed to me?
15. Even for His mercies in His rod,
16. Where pity most of all I see.

17. My heart I wholly give to Thee;
18. O make it fruitful, faithful Lord.
19. My life shall dedicated be
20. To praise in thought, in deed, in word.

21. Thou know'st no life I did require
22. Longer than still Thy name to praise,
23. Nor ought on earth worthy desire,
24. In drawing out these wretched days.

25. Thy name and praise to celebrate,
26. O Lord, for aye is my request.
27. O grant I do it in this state,
28. And then with Thee, which is the best.
