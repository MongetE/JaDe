1. What God is like to him I serve,
2. What Saviour like to mine?
3. O, never let me from thee swerue,
4. For truly I am thine.
5. My thankfull mouth shall speak thy praise,
6. My Tongue shall talk of Thee:
7. On High my heart, O, doe thou raise,
8. For what thou'st done for me.
9. Goe, Worldlings, to your Vanities,
10. And heathen to your Gods;
11. Let them help in Adversities,
12. And sanctefye their rods.
13. My God he is not like to yours,
14. Your selves shall Judges bee;
15. I find his Love, I know his Pow'r,
16. A Succourer of mee.
17. He is not man that he should lye,
18. Nor son of man to vnsay;
19. His word he plighted hath on high,
20. And I shall liue for aye.
21. And for his sake that faithfull is,
22. That dy'd but now doth liue,
23. The first and last, that liues for aye,
24. Me lasting life shall giue.
