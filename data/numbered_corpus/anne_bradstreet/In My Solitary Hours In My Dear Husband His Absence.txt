1. O Lord, Thou hear'st my daily moan
2. And see'st my dropping tears.
3. My troubles all are Thee before,
4. My longings and my fears.

5. Thou hitherto hast been my God;
6. Thy help my soul hath found.
7. Though loss and sickness me assailed,
8. Through Thee I've kept my ground.

9. And Thy abode Thou'st made with me;
10. With Thee my soul can talk;
11. In secret places Thee I find
12. Where I do kneel or walk.

13. Though husband dear be from me gone,
14. Whom I do love so well,
15. I have a more beloved one
16. Whose comforts far excel.

17. O stay my heart on Thee. my God,
18. Uphold my fainting soul.
19. And when I know not what to do,
20. I'll on Thy mercies roll.

21. My weakness. Thou dost know full well
22. Of body and of mind;
23. I in this world no comfort have,
24. But what from Thee I find.

25. Though children Thou has given me,
26. And friends I have also,
27. Yet if I see Thee not through them
28. They are no joy, but woe.

29. O shine upon me, blessed Lord,
30. Ev'n for my Saviour's sake;
31. In Thee alone is more than all,
32. And there content I'll take.

33. O hear me, Lord, in this request
34. As Thou before hast done,
35. Bring back my husband, I beseech,
36. As Thou didst once my son.

37. So shall I celebrate Thy praise
38. Ev'n while my days shall last
39. And talk to my beloved one
40. Of all Thy goodness past.

41. So both of us Thy kindness, Lord,
42. With praises shall recount
43. And serve Thee better than before
44. Whose blessings thus surmount.

45. But give me, Lord, a better heart,
46. Then better shall I be,
47. To pay the vows which I do owe
48. Forever unto Thee.

49. Unless Thou help, what can I do
50. But still my frailty show?
51. If Thou assist me, Lord,
52. I shall Return Thee what I owe.
