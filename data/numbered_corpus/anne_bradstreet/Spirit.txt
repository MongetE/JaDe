1. Be still, thou unregenerate part,
2. Disturb no more my settled heart,
3. For I have vow'd (and so will do)
4. Thee as a foe still to pursue,
5. And combat with thee will and must
6. Until I see thee laid in th' dust.
7. Sister we are, yea twins we be,
8. Yet deadly feud 'twixt thee and me,
9. For from one father are we not.
10. Thou by old Adam wast begot,
11. But my arise is from above,
12. Whence my dear father I do love.
13. Thou speak'st me fair but hat'st me sore.
14. Thy flatt'ring shews I'll trust no more.
15. How oft thy slave hast thou me made
16. When I believ'd what thou hast said
17. And never had more cause of woe
18. Than when I did what thou bad'st do.
19. I'll stop mine ears at these thy charms
20. And count them for my deadly harms.
21. Thy sinful pleasures I do hate,
22. Thy riches are to me no bait.
23. Thine honours do, nor will I love,
24. For my ambition lies above.
25. My greatest honour it shall be
26. When I am victor over thee,
27. And Triumph shall, with laurel head,
28. When thou my Captive shalt be led.
29. How I do live, thou need'st not scoff,
30. For I have meat thou know'st not of.
31. The hidden Manna I do eat;
32. The word of life, it is my meat.
33. My thoughts do yield me more content
34. Than can thy hours in pleasure spent.
35. Nor are they shadows which I catch,
36. Nor fancies vain at which I snatch
37. But reach at things that are so high,
38. Beyond thy dull Capacity.
39. Eternal substance I do see
40. With which inriched I would be.
41. Mine eye doth pierce the heav'ns and see
42. What is Invisible to thee.
43. My garments are not silk nor gold,
44. Nor such like trash which Earth doth hold,
45. But Royal Robes I shall have on,
46. More glorious than the glist'ring Sun.
47. My Crown not Diamonds, Pearls, and gold,
48. But such as Angels' heads infold.
49. The City where I hope to dwell,
50. There's none on Earth can parallel.
51. The stately Walls both high and trong
52. Are made of precious Jasper stone,
53. The Gates of Pearl, both rich and clear,
54. And Angels are for Porters there.
55. The Streets thereof transparent gold
56. Such as no Eye did e're behold.
57. A Crystal River there doth run
58. Which doth proceed from the Lamb's Throne.
59. Of Life, there are the waters sure
60. Which shall remain forever pure.
61. Nor Sun nor Moon they have no need
62. For glory doth from God proceed.
63. No Candle there, nor yet Torch light,
64. For there shall be no darksome night.
65. From sickness and infirmity
66. Forevermore they shall be free.
67. Nor withering age shall e're come there,
68. But beauty shall be bright and clear.
69. This City pure is not for thee,
70. For things unclean there shall not be.
71. If I of Heav'n may have my fill,
72. Take thou the world, and all that will."
