1. Thou mighty God of Sea and Land,
2. I here resigne into thy hand
3. The Son of Prayers, of vowes, of teares,
4. The child I stay'd for many yeares.
5. Thou heard'st me then, and gav'st him me;
6. Hear me again, I giue him Thee.
7. He's mine, but more, O Lord, thine own,
8. For sure thy Grace on him is shown.
9. No freind I haue like Thee to trust,
10. For mortall helpes are brittle Dvst.
11. Preserve, O Lord, from stormes and wrack,
12. Protect him there, and bring him back;
13. And if thou shalt spare me a space,
14. That I again may see his face,
15. Then shall I celebrate thy Praise,
16. And Blesse the for't even all my Dayes.
17. If otherwise I goe to Rest,
18. Thy Will bee done, for that is best;
19. Perswade my heart I shall him see
20. For ever happefy'd with Thee.
