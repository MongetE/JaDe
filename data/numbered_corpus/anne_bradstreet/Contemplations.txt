1. 1     Sometime now past in the Autumnal Tide,
2. 2     When Ph{oe}bus wanted but one hour to bed,
3. 3     The trees all richly clad, yet void of pride,
4. 4     Were gilded o're by his rich golden head.
5. 5     Their leaves and fruits seem'd painted but was true
6. 6     Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew,
7. 7     Rapt were my senses at this delectable view.

8. 2

9. 8     I wist not what to wish, yet sure thought I,
10. 9     If so much excellence abide below,
11. 10   How excellent is he that dwells on high?
12. 11   Whose power and beauty by his works we know.
13. 12   Sure he is goodness, wisdom, glory, light,
14. 13   That hath this under world so richly dight.
15. 14   More Heaven than Earth was here, no winter and no night.

16. 3

17. 15   Then on a stately Oak I cast mine Eye,
18. 16   Whose ruffling top the Clouds seem'd to aspire.
19. 17   How long since thou wast in thine Infancy?
20. 18   Thy strength and stature, more thy years admire,
21. 19   Hath hundred winters past since thou wast born?
22. 20   Or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn?
23. 21   If so, all these as nought, Eternity doth scorn.

24. 4

25. 22   Then higher on the glistering Sun I gaz'd,
26. 23   Whose beams was shaded by the leafy Tree.
27. 24   The more I look'd, the more I grew amaz'd
28. 25   And softly said, what glory's like to thee?
29. 26   Soul of this world, this Universe's Eye,
30. 27   No wonder some made thee a Deity.
31. 28   Had I not better known (alas) the same had I.

32. 5

33. 29   Thou as a Bridegroom from thy Chamber rushes
34. 30   And as a strong man joys to run a race.
35. 31   The morn doth usher thee with smiles and blushes.
36. 32   The Earth reflects her glances in thy face.
37. 33   Birds, insects, Animals with Vegative,
38. 34   Thy heat from death and dullness doth revive
39. 35   And in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive.

40. 6

41. 36   Thy swift Annual and diurnal Course,
42. 37   Thy daily straight and yearly oblique path,
43. 38   Thy pleasing fervour, and thy scorching force,
44. 39   All mortals here the feeling knowledge hath.
45. 40   Thy presence makes it day, thy absence night,
46. 41   Quaternal seasons caused by thy might.
47. 42   Hail Creature, full of sweetness, beauty, and delight!

48. 7

49. 43   Art thou so full of glory that no Eye
50. 44   Hath strength thy shining Rays once to behold?
51. 45   And is thy splendid Throne erect so high
52. 46   As, to approach it, can no earthly mould?
53. 47   How full of glory then must thy Creator be!
54. 48   Who gave this bright light luster unto thee.
55. 49   Admir'd, ador'd for ever be that Majesty!

56. 8

57. 50   Silent alone where none or saw or heard,
58. 51   In pathless paths I lead my wand'ring feet.
59. 52   My humble Eyes to lofty Skies I rear'd
60. 53   To sing some Song my mazed Muse thought meet.
61. 54   My great Creator I would magnify
62. 55   That nature had thus decked liberally,
63. 56   But Ah and Ah again, my imbecility!

64. 9

65. 57   I heard the merry grasshopper then sing,
66. 58   The black clad Cricket bear a second part.
67. 59   They kept one tune and played on the same string,
68. 60   Seeming to glory in their little Art.
69. 61   Shall creatures abject thus their voices raise
70. 62   And in their kind resound their maker's praise
71. 63   Whilst I, as mute, can warble forth no higher lays?



72. 64   When present times look back to Ages past
73. 65   And men in being fancy those are dead,
74. 66   It makes things gone perpetually to last
75. 67   And calls back months and years that long since fled.
76. 68   It makes a man more aged in conceit
77. 69   Than was Methuselah or's grand-sire great,
78. 70   While of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat.



79. 71   Sometimes in Eden fair he seems to be,
80. 72   See glorious Adam there made Lord of all,
81. 73   Fancies the Apple dangle on the Tree
82. 74   That turn'd his Sovereign to a naked thrall,
83. 75   Who like a miscreant's driven from that place
84. 76   To get his bread with pain and sweat of face.
85. 77   A penalty impos'd on his backsliding Race.



86. 78   Here sits our Grand-dame in retired place
87. 79   And in her lap her bloody Cain new born.
88. 80   The weeping Imp oft looks her in the face,
89. 81   Bewails his unknown hap and fate forlorn.
90. 82   His Mother sighs to think of Paradise
91. 83   And how she lost her bliss to be more wise,
92. 84   Believing him that was and is Father of lies.



93. 85   Here Cain and Abel come to sacrifice,
94. 86   Fruits of the Earth and Fatlings each do bring.
95. 87   On Abel's gift the fire descends from Skies,
96. 88   But no such sign on false Cain's offering.
97. 89   With sullen hateful looks he goes his ways,
98. 90   Hath thousand thoughts to end his brother's days,
99. 91   Upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise.



100. 92   There Abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks,
101. 93   His brother comes, then acts his fratricide.
102. 94   The Virgin Earth of blood her first draught drinks,
103. 95   But since that time she often hath been cloy'd.
104. 96   The wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind
105. 97   Thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind,
106. 98   Though none on Earth but kindred near then could he find.



107. 99   Who fancies not his looks now at the Bar,
108. 100   His face like death, his heart with horror fraught.
109. 101   Nor Male-factor ever felt like war,
110. 102   When deep despair with wish of life hath fought,
111. 103   Branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes,
112. 104   A Vagabond to Land of Nod he goes,
113. 105   A City builds that walls might him secure from foes.



114. 106   Who thinks not oft upon the Father's ages?
115. 107   Their long descent, how nephews' sons they saw,
116. 108   The starry observations of those Sages,
117. 109   And how their precepts to their sons were law,
118. 110   How Adam sigh'd to see his Progeny
119. 111   Cloth'd all in his black, sinful Livery,
120. 112   Who neither guilt not yet the punishment could fly.



121. 113   Our life compare we with their length of days.
122. 114   Who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive?
123. 115   And though thus short, we shorten many ways,
124. 116   Living so little while we are alive.
125. 117   In eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight
126. 118   So unawares comes on perpetual night
127. 119   And puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight.



128. 120   When I behold the heavens as in their prime
129. 121   And then the earth (though old) still clad in green,
130. 122   The stones and trees, insensible of time,
131. 123   Nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen.
132. 124   If winter come and greenness then do fade,
133. 125   A Spring returns, and they more youthful made,
134. 126   But Man grows old, lies down, remains where once he's laid.



135. 127   By birth more noble than those creatures all,
136. 128   Yet seems by nature and by custom curs'd,
137. 129   No sooner born but grief and care makes fall
138. 130   That state obliterate he had at first:
139. 131   Nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again,
140. 132   Nor habitations long their names retain
141. 133   But in oblivion to the final day remain.



142. 134   Shall I then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth,
143. 135   Because their beauty and their strength last longer?
144. 136   Shall I wish there, or never to had birth,
145. 137   Because they're bigger and their bodies stronger?
146. 138   Nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and die,
147. 139   And when unmade, so ever shall they lie.
148. 140   But man was made for endless immortality.



149. 141   Under the cooling shadow of a stately Elm
150. 142   Close sate I by a goodly River's side,
151. 143   Where gliding streams the Rocks did overwhelm.
152. 144   A lonely place, with pleasures dignifi'd.
153. 145   I once that lov'd the shady woods so well,
154. 146   Now thought the rivers did the trees excel,
155. 147   And if the sun would ever shine, there would I dwell.



156. 148   While on the stealing stream I fixt mine eye,
157. 149   Which to the long'd-for Ocean held its course,
158. 150   I markt nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lie
159. 151   Could hinder ought but still augment its force.
160. 152   O happy Flood, quoth I, that holds thy race
161. 153   Till thou arrive at thy beloved place,
162. 154   Nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace.



163. 155   Nor is't enough that thou alone may'st slide,
164. 156   But hundred brooks in thy clear waves do meet,
165. 157   So hand in hand along with thee they glide
166. 158   To Thetis' house, where all imbrace and greet.
167. 159   Thou Emblem true of what I count the best,
168. 160   O could I lead my Rivolets to rest,
169. 161   So may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest.



170. 162   Ye Fish which in this liquid Region 'bide
171. 163   That for each season have your habitation,
172. 164   Now salt, now fresh where you think best to glide
173. 165   To unknown coasts to give a visitation,
174. 166   In Lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry.
175. 167   So Nature taught, and yet you know not why,
176. 168   You watry folk that know not your felicity.



177. 169   Look how the wantons frisk to task the air,
178. 170   Then to the colder bottom straight they dive;
179. 171   Eftsoon to Neptune's glassy Hall repair
180. 172   To see what trade they, great ones, there do drive,
181. 173   Who forrage o're the spacious sea-green field
182. 174   And take the trembling prey before it yield,
183. 175   Whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield.



184. 176   While musing thus with contemplation fed,
185. 177   And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain,
186. 178   The sweet-tongu'd Philomel percht o're my head
187. 179   And chanted forth a most melodious strain
188. 180   Which rapt me so with wonder and delight
189. 181   I judg's my hearing better than my sight
190. 182   And wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight.



191. 183   O merry Bird (said I) that fears no snares,
192. 184   That neither toils nor hoards up in thy barn,
193. 185   Feels no sad thoughts nor cruciating cares
194. 186   To gain more good or shun what might thee harm--
195. 187   Thy clothes ne'er wear, thy meat is everywhere,
196. 188   Thy bed a bough, thy drink the water clear--
197. 189   Reminds not what is past, nor what's to come dost fear.



198. 190   The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent,
199. 191   Sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew,
200. 192   So each one tunes his pretty instrument
201. 193   And warbling out the old, begin anew,
202. 194   And thus they pass their youth in summer season,
203. 195   Then follow thee into a better Region,
204. 196   Where winter's never felt by that sweet airy legion.



205. 197   Man at the best a creature frail and vain,
206. 198   In knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak,
207. 199   Subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain,
208. 200   Each storm his state, his mind, his body break--
209. 201   From some of these he never finds cessation
210. 202   But day or night, within, without, vexation,
211. 203   Troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near'st Relation.



212. 204   And yet this sinful creature, frail and vain,
213. 205   This lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow,
214. 206   This weather-beaten vessel wrackt with pain,
215. 207   Joys not in hope of an eternal morrow.
216. 208   Nor all his losses, crosses, and vexation,
217. 209   In weight, in frequency and long duration
218. 210   Can make him deeply groan for that divine Translation.



219. 211   The Mariner that on smooth waves doth glide
220. 212   Sings merrily and steers his Barque with ease
221. 213   As if he had command of wind and tide
222. 214   And now becomes great Master of the seas,
223. 215   But suddenly a storm spoils all the sport
224. 216   And makes him long for a more quiet port,
225. 217   Which 'gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort.



226. 218   So he that faileth in this world of pleasure,
227. 219   Feeding on sweets that never bit of th' sour,
228. 220   That's full of friends, of honour, and of treasure,
229. 221   Fond fool, he takes this earth ev'n for heav'ns bower,
230. 222   But sad affliction comes and makes him see
231. 223   Here's neither honour, wealth, or safety.
232. 224   Only above is found all with security.



233. 225   O Time the fatal wrack of mortal things
234. 226   That draws oblivion's curtains over kings,
235. 227   Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not;
236. 228   Their names with a Record are forgot,
237. 229   Their parts, their ports, their pomp's all laid in th' dust.
238. 230   Nor wit, nor gold, nor buildings scape time's rust,
239. 231   But he whose name is grav'd in the white stone
240. 232   Shall last and shine when all of these are gone.
