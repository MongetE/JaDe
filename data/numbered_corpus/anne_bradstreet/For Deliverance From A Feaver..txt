1. When Sorrowes had begyrt me rovnd,
2. And Paines within and out,
3. When in my flesh no part was sovnd,
4. Then didst thou rid me out.
5. My burning flesh in sweat did boyle,
6. My aking head did break;
7. From side to side for ease I toyle,
8. So faint I could not speak.
9. Beclouded was my Soul with fear
10. Of thy Displeasure sore,
11. Nor could I read my Evidence
12. Which oft I read before.
13. Hide not thy face from me, I cry'd,
14. From Burnings keep my soul;
15. Thov know'st my heart, and hast me try'd;
16. I on thy Mercyes Rowl.
17. O, heal my Soul, thov know'st I said,
18. Tho' flesh consume to novght;
19. What tho' in dust it shall bee lay'd,
20. To Glory't shall bee brovght.
21. Thou heardst, thy rod thou didst remove,
22. And spar'd my Body frail,
23. Thou shew'st to me thy tender Love,
24. My heart no more might quail.
25. O, Praises to my mighty God,
26. Praise to my Lord, I say,
27. Who hath redeem'd my Soul from pitt:
28. Praises to him for Aye!
