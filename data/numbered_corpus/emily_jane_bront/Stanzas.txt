1. I'll not weep that thou art going to leave me,
2. There's nothing lovely here;
3. And doubly will the dark world grieve me,
4. While thy heart suffers there.

5. I'll not weep, because the summer's glory
6. Must always end in gloom;
7. And, follow out the happiest story -
8. It closes with a tomb!

9. And I am weary of the anguish
10. Increasing winters bear;
11. Weary to watch the spirit languish
12. Through years of dead despair.

13. So, if a tear, when thou art dying,
14. Should haply fall from me,
15. It is but that my soul is sighing,
16. To go and rest with thee.
