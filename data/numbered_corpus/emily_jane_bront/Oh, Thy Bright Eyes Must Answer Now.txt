1. Oh, thy bright eyes must answer now,
2. When Reason, with a scornful brow,
3. Is mocking at my overthrow!
4. Oh, thy sweet tongue must plead for me
5. And tell why I have chosen thee!.
6. Stern Reason is to judgment come,
7. Arrayed in all her forms of gloom:
8. Wilt thou, my advocate, be dumb?
9. No, radiant angel, speak and say
10. Why I did cast the world away,

11. Why I have persevered to shun
12. The common paths that others run;
13. And on a strange road journeyed on,
14. Heedless, alike of wealth and power
15. Of glory's wreath and pleasure's flower.

16. These, once, indeed, seemed Beings Divine;
17. And they, perchance, heard vows of mine,
18. And saw my offerings on their shrine;
19. But careless gifts are seldom prized,
20. And mine were worthily despised.

21. So, with a ready heart, I swore
22. To seek their altar-stone no more;
23. And gave my spirit to adore
24. Thee, ever-present, phantom thing
25. My slave, my comrade, and my king.

26. A slave, because I rule thee still;
27. Incline thee to my changeful will,
28. And make thy influence good or ill:
29. A comrade, for by day and night
30. Thou art my intimate delight,

31. My darling pain that wounds and sears,
32. And wrings a blessing out from tears
33. By deadening me to earthly cares;
34. And yet, a king, though Prudence well
35. Have taught thy subject to rebel.

36. And am I wrong to worship where
37. Faith cannot doubt, nor hope despair,
38. Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
39. Speak, God of visions, plead for me,
40. And tell why I have chosen thee!.
