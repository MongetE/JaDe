1. Mild the mist upon the hill
2. Telling not of storms tomorrow;
3. No, the day has wept its fill,
4. Spent its store of silent sorrow.

5. O, I'm gone back to the days of youth,
6. I am a child once more,
7. And 'neath my father's sheltering roof
8. And near the old hall door

9. I watch this cloudy evening fall
10. After a day of rain;
11. Blue mists, sweet mists of summer pall
12. The horizon's mountain chain.

13. The damp stands on the long green grass
14. As thick as morning's tears,
15. And dreamy scents of fragrance pass
16. That breathe of other years.
