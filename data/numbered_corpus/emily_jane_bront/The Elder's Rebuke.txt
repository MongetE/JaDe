1. 'Listen! When your hair, like mine,
2. Takes a tint of silver gray;
3. When your eyes, with dimmer shine,
4. Watch life's bubbles float away:

5. When you, young man, have borne like me
6. The weary weight of sixty-three,
7. Then shall penance sore be paid
8. For those hours so wildly squandered;
9. And the words that now fall dead
10. On your ear, be deeply pondered—
11. Pondered and approved at last:
12. But their virtue will be past!

13. 'Glorious is the prize of Duty,
14. Though she be 'a serious power';
15. Treacherous all the lures of Beauty,
16. Thorny bud and poisonous flower!

17. 'Mirth is but a mad beguiling
18. Of the golden-gifted time;
19. Love—a demon-meteor, wiling
20. Heedless feet to gulfs of crime.

21. 'Those who follow earthly pleasure,
22. Heavenly knowledge will not lead;
23. Wisdom hides from them her treasure,
24. Virtue bids them evil-speed!

25. 'Vainly may their hearts repenting.
26. Seek for aid in future years;
27. Wisdom, scorned, knows no relenting;
28. Virtue is not won by fears.'

29. Thus spake the ice-blooded elder gray;
30. The young man scoffed as he turned away,
31. Turned to the call of a sweet lute's measure,
32. Waked by the lightsome touch of pleasure:
33. Had he ne'er met a gentler teacher,
34. Woe had been wrought by that pitiless preacher.
