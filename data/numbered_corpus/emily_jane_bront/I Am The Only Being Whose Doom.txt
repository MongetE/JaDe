1. I am the only being whose doom
2. No tongue would ask no eye would mourn
3. I never caused a thought of gloom
4. A smile of joy since I was born

5. In secret pleasure - secret tears
6. This changeful life has slipped away
7. As friendless after eighteen years
8. As lone as on my natal day

9. There have been times I cannot hide
10. There have been times when this was drear
11. When my sad soul forgot its pride
12. And longed for one to love me here

13. But those were in the early glow
14. Of feelings since subdued by care
15. And they have died so long ago
16. I hardly now believe they were

17. First melted off the hope of youth
18. Then Fancy's rainbow fast withdrew
19. And then experience told me truth
20. In mortal bosoms never grew

21. 'Twas grief enough to think mankind
22. All hollow servile insincere -
23. But worse to trust to my own mind
24. And find the same corruption there
