1. Love is like the wild rose-briar,
2. Friendship like the holly-tree --
3. The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms
4. But which will bloom most contantly?
5. The wild-rose briar is sweet in the spring,
6. Its summer blossoms scent the air;
7. Yet wait till winter comes again
8. And who wil call the wild-briar fair?
9. Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
10. And deck thee with the holly's sheen,
11. That when December blights thy brow
12. He may still leave thy garland green.
