1. Yes, holy be thy resting place
2. Wherever thou may'st lie;
3. The sweetest winds breathe on thy face,
4. The softest of the sky.

5. And will not guardian Angles send
6. Kind dreams and thoughts of love,
7. Though I no more may watchful bend
8. Thy longed repose above?

9. And will not heaven itself bestow
10. A beam of glory there
11. That summer's grass more green may grow,
12. And summer's flowers more fair?

13. Farewell, farewell, 'tis hard to part
14. Yet, loved one, it must be:
15. I would not rend another heart
16. Not even by blessing thee.

17. Go! We must break affection's chain,
18. Forget the hopes of years:
19. Nay, grieve not - willest thou remain
20. To waken wilder tears

21. This herald breeze with thee and me,
22. Roved in the dawning day:
23. And thou shouldest be where it shall be
24. Ere evening, far away.
