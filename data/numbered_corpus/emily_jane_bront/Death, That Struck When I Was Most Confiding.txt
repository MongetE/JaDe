1. Death! that struck when I was most confiding
2. In my certain faith of joy to be -
3. Strike again, Time's withered branch dividing
4. From the fresh root of Eternity!

5. Leaves, upon Time's branch, were growing brightly,
6. Full of sap, and full of silver dew;
7. Birds beneath its shelter gathered nightly;
8. Daily round its flowers the wild bees flew.

9. Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom;
10. Guilt stripped off the foliage in its pride;
11. But, within its parent's kindly bosom,
12. Flowed for ever Life's restoring-tide.

13. Little mourned I for the parted gladness,
14. For the vacant nest and silent song -
15. Hope was there, and laughed me out of sadness;
16. Whispering, ' Winter will not linger long!'

17. And, behold! with tenfold increase blessing,
18. Spring adorned the beauty-burdened spray;
19. Wind and rain and fervent heat, caressing,
20. Lavished glory on that second May!

21. High it rose - no winged grief could sweep it;
22. Sin was scared to distance with its shine;
23. Love, and its own life, had power to keep it
24. From all wrong - from every blight but thine!

25. Cruel Death! The young leaves droop and languish;
26. Evening's gentle air may still restore -
27. No! the morning sunshine mocks my anguish -
28. Time, for me, must never blossom more!

29. Strike it down, that other boughs may flourish
30. Where that perished sapling used to be;
31. Thus, at least, its mouldering corpse will nourish
32. That from which it sprung - Eternity.
