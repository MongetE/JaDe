1. 'Tis moonlight, summer moonlight,
2. All soft and still and fair;
3. The solemn hour of midnight
4. Breathes sweet thoughts everywhere,

5. But most where trees are sending
6. Their breezy boughs on high,
7. Or stooping low are lending
8. A shelter from the sky.

9. And there in those wild bowers
10. A lovely form is laid;
11. Green grass and dew-steeped flowers
12. Wave gently round her head.
