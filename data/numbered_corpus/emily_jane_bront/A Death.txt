1. "O day! he cannot die
2. When thou so fair art shining!
3. O Sun, in such a glorious sky,
4. So tranquilly declining;

5. He cannot leave thee now,
6. While fresh west winds are blowing,
7. And all around his youthful brow
8. Thy cheerful light is glowing!

9. Edward, awake, awake -
10. The golden evening gleams
11. Warm and bright on Arden's lake -
12. Arouse thee from thy dreams!

13. Beside thee, on my knee,
14. My dearest friend! I pray
15. That thou, to cross the eternal sea,
16. Wouldst yet one hour delay:

17. I hear its billows roar -
18. I see them foaming high;
19. But no glimpse of a further shore
20. Has blest my straining eye.

21. Believe not what they urge
22. Of Eden isles beyond;
23. Turn back, from that tempestuous surge,
24. To thy own native land.

25. It is not death, but pain
26. That struggles in thy breast -
27. Nay, rally, Edward, rouse again;
28. I cannot let thee rest!"

29. One long look, that sore reproved me
30. For the woe I could not bear -
31. One mute look of suffering moved me
32. To repent my useless prayer:

33. And, with sudden check, the heaving
34. Of distraction passed away;
35. Not a sign of further grieving
36. Stirred my soul that awful day.

37. Paled, at length, the sweet sun setting;
38. Sunk to peace the twilight breeze:
39. Summer dews fell softly, wetting
40. Glen, and glade, and silent trees.

41. Then his eyes began to weary,
42. Weighed beneath a mortal sleep;
43. And their orbs grew strangely dreary,
44. Clouded, even as they would weep.

45. But they wept not, but they changed not,
46. Never moved, and never closed;
47. Troubled still, and still they ranged not -
48. Wandered not, nor yet reposed!

49. So I knew that he was dying -
50. Stooped, and raised his languid head;
51. Felt no breath, and heard no sighing,
52. So I knew that he was dead.
