1. The night is darkening round me,
2. The wild winds coldly blow ;
3. But a tyrant spell has bound me,
4. And I cannot, cannot go.

5. The giant trees are bending
6. Their bare boughs weighed with snow ;
7. The storm is fast descending,
8. And yet I cannot go.

9. Clouds beyond clouds above me,
10. Wastes beyond wastes below ;
11. But nothing drear can move me :
12. I will not, cannot go.
