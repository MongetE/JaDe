1. The linnet in the rocky dells,
2. The moor - lark in the air,
3. The bee among the heather - bells
4. That hide my lady fair:

5. The wild deer browse above her breast;
6. The wild birds raise their brood;
7. And they, her smiles of love caressed,
8. Have left their solitude!

9. I ween, that when the grave's dark wall
10. Did first her form retain,
11. They thought their hearts could ne'er recall
12. The light of joy again.

13. They thought the tide of grief would flow
14. Unchecked through future years,
15. But where is all their anguish now,
16. And where are all their tears?

17. Well, let them fight for Honour's breath,
18. Or Pleasure's shade pursue -
19. The Dweller in the land of Death
20. Is changed and careless too.

21. And if their eyes should watch and weep
22. Till sorrow's source were dry
23. She would not, in her tranquil sleep,
24. Return a single sigh!

25. Blow, west wind, by the lonely mound,
26. And murmur, summer streams -
27. There is no need of other sound
28. To soothe my Lady's dreams.
