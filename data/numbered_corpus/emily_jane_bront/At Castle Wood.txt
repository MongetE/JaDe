1. The day is done, the winter sun
2. Is setting in its sullen sky;
3. And drear the course that has been run,
4. And dim the hearts that slowly die.

5. No star will light my coming night;
6. No morn of hope for me will shine;
7. I mourn not heaven would blast my sight,
8. And I ne'er longed for joys divine.

9. Through life's hard task I did not ask
10. Celestial aid, celestial cheer;
11. I saw my fate without its mask,
12. And met it too without a tear.

13. The grief that pressed my aching breast
14. Was heavier far than earth can be;
15. And who would dread eternal rest
16. When labour's hour was agony?

17. Dark falls the fear of this despair
18. On spirits born of happiness;
19. But I was bred the mate of care,
20. The foster-child of sore distress.

21. No sighs for me, no sympathy,
22. No wish to keep my soul below;
23. The heart is dead in infancy,
24. Unwept-for let the body go.
