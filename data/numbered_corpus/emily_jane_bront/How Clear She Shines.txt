1. How clear she shines! How quietly
2. I lie beneath her guardian light;
3. While heaven and earth are whispering me,
4. " Tomorrow, wake, but, dream to-night."
5. Yes, Fancy, come, my Fairy love!
6. These throbbing temples softly kiss;
7. And bend my lonely couch above
8. And bring me rest, and bring me bliss.

9. The world is going; dark world, adieu!
10. Grim world, conceal thee till the day;
11. The heart, thou canst not all subdue,
12. Must still resist, if thou delay!

13. Thy love I will not, will not share;
14. Thy hatred only wakes a smile;
15. Thy griefs may wound - thy wrongs may tear,
16. But, oh, thy lies shall ne'er beguile!
17. While gazing on the stars that glow
18. Above me, in that stormless sea,
19. I long to hope that all the woe
20. Creation knows, is held in thee!

21. And, this shall be my dream to-night;
22. I'll think the heaven of glorious spheres
23. Is rolling on its course of light
24. In endless bliss, through endless years;
25. I'll think, there's not one world above,
26. Far as these straining eyes can see,
27. Where Wisdom ever laughed at Love,
28. Or Virtue crouched to Infamy;

29. Where, writhing 'neath the strokes of Fate,
30. The mangled wretch was forced to smile;
31. To match his patience 'gainst her hate,
32. His heart rebellious all the while.
33. Where Pleasure still will lead to wrong,
34. And helpless Reason warn in vain;
35. And Truth is weak, and Treachery strong;
36. And Joy the surest path to Pain;
37. And Peace, the lethargy of Grief;
38. And Hope, a phantom of the soul;
39. And Life, a labour, void and brief;
40. And Death, the despot of the whole!
