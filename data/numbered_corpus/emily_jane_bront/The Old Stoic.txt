1. Riches I hold in light esteem;
2. And Love I laugh to scorn;
3. And lust of fame was but a dream
4. That vanished with the morn:

5. And if I pray, the only prayer
6. That moves my lips for me
7. Is, 'Leave the heart that now I bear,
8. And give me liberty! '

9. Yes, as my swift days near their goal,
10. 'Tis all that I implore;
11. In life and death, a chainless soul,
12. With courage to endure.
