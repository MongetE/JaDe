1. A little while, a little while,
2. The noisy crowd are barred away;
3. And I can sing and I can smile
4. A little while I've holyday !

5. Where wilt thou go my harassed heart ?
6. Full many a land invites thee now;
7. And places near, and far apart
8. Have rest for thee, my weary brow -

9. There is a spot 'mid barren hills
10. Where winter howls and driving rain
11. But if the dreary tempest chills
12. There is a light that warms again

13. The house is old, the trees are bare
14. And moonless bends the misty dome
15. But what on earth is half so dear -
16. So longed for as the hearth of home ?

17. The mute bird sitting on the stone,
18. The dank moss dripping from the wall,
19. The garden-walk with weeds o'ergrown
20. I love them - how I love them all !

21. Shall I go there? or shall I seek
22. Another clime, another sky,
23. Where tongues familiar music speak
24. In accents dear to memory ?

25. Yes, as I mused, the naked room,
26. The flickering firelight died away
27. And from the midst of cheerless gloom
28. I passed to bright unclouded day -

29. A little and a lone green lane
30. That opened on a common wide
31. A distant, dreamy, dim blue chain
32. Of mountains circling every side -

33. A heaven so clear, an earth so calm,
34. So sweet, so soft, so hushed in air
35. And, deepening still the dreamlike charm,
36. Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere -

37. That was the scene - I knew it well
38. I knew the pathways far and near
39. That winding o'er each billowy swell
40. Marked out the tracks of wandering deer

41. Could I have lingered but an hour
42. It well had paid a week of toil
43. But truth has banished fancy's power
44. I hear my dungeon bars recoil -

45. Even as I stood with raptured eye
46. Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear
47. My hour of rest had fleeted by
48. And given me back to weary care -
