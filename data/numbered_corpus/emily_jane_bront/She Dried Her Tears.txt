1. She dried her tears and they did smile
2. To see her cheeks' returning glow
3. How little dreaming all the while
4. That full heart throbbed to overflow

5. With that sweet look and lively tone
6. And bright eye shining all the day
7. They could not guess at midnight lone
8. How she would weep the time away
