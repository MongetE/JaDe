1. For him who struck thy foreign string,
2. I ween this heart has ceased to care;
3. Then why dost thou such feelings bring
4. To my sad spiritâ€”old Guitar?

5. It is as if the warm sunlight
6. In some deep glen should lingering stay,
7. When clouds of storm, or shades of night,
8. Have wrapt the parent orb away.

9. It is as if the glassy brook
10. Should image still its willows fair,
11. Though years ago the woodman's stroke
12. Laid low in dust their Dryad-hair.

13. Even so, Guitar, thy magic tone
14. Hath moved the tear and waked the sigh;
15. Hath bid the ancient torrent moan,
16. Although its very source is dry.
