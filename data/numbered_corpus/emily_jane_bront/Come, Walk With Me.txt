1. Come, walk with me,
2. There's only thee
3. To bless my spirit now -
4. We used to love on winter nights
5. To wander through the snow;
6. Can we not woo back old delights?
7. The clouds rush dark and wild
8. They fleck with shade our mountain heights
9. The same as long ago
10. And on the horizon rest at last
11. In looming masses piled;
12. While moonbeams flash and fly so fast
13. We scarce can say they smiled -

14. Come walk with me, come walk with me;
15. We were not once so few
16. But Death has stolen our company
17. As sunshine steals the dew -
18. He took them one by one and we
19. Are left the only two;
20. So closer would my feelings twine
21. Because they have no stay but thine -

22. 'Nay call me not - it may not be
23. Is human love so true?
24. Can Friendship's flower droop on for years
25. And then revive anew?
26. No, though the soil be wet with tears,
27. How fair soe'er it grew
28. The vital sap once perished
29. Will never flow again
30. And surer than that dwelling dread,
31. The narrow dungeon of the dead
32. Time parts the hearts of men -'
