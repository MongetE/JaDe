1. Oh, for the time when I shall sleep
2. Without identity,
3. And never care how rain may steep,
4. Or snow may cover me!
5. No promised heaven these wild desires
6. Could all, or half, fulful;
7. No threatened hell, with quenchless fires,
8. Subdue this quenchless will!

9. So said I, and still say the same;
10. Still, to my death, will sayâ€”
11. Three gods within this little frame
12. Are warring night and day:
13. Heaven could not hold them all, and yet
14. They all are held in me;
15. And must be mine till I forget
16. My present entity!

17. Oh, for the time when in my breast
18. Their struggles will be o'er!
19. Oh, for the day when I shall rest,
20. And never suffer more!
