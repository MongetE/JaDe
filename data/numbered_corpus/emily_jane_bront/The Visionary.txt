1. Silent is the house: all are laid asleep:
2. One alone looks out o’er the snow-wreaths deep,
3. Watching every cloud, dreading every breeze
4. That whirls the wildering drift, and bends the groaning trees.

5. Cheerful is the hearth, soft the matted floor;
6. Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door;
7. The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot strong and far:
8. I trim it well, to be the wanderer’s guiding-star.

9. Frown, my haughty sire! chide, my angry dame!
10. Set your slaves to spy; threaten me with shame:
11. But neither sire nor dame nor prying serf shall know,
12. What angel nightly tracks that waste of frozen snow.

13. What I love shall come like visitant of air,
14. Safe in secret power from lurking human snare;
15. What loves me, no word of mine shall e’er betray,
16. Though for faith unstained my life must forfeit pay.

17. Burn, then, little lamp; glimmer straight and clear—
18. Hush! a rustling wing stirs, methinks, the air:
19. He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me;
20. Strange Power! I trust thy might; trust thou my constancy.
