1. Far, far away is mirth withdrawn
2. 'Tis three long hours before the morn
3. And I watch lonely, drearily -
4. So come thou shade commune with me

5. Deserted one ! thy corpse lies cold
6. And mingled with a foreign mould -
7. Year after year the grass grows green
8. Above the dust where thou hast been.

9. I will not name thy blighted name
10. Tarnished by unforgotton shame
11. Though not because my bosom torn
12. Joins the mad world in all its scorn -

13. Thy phantom face is dark with woe
14. Tears have left ghastly traces there,
15. Those ceaseless tears ! I wish their flow
16. Could quench thy wild despair.

17. They deluge my heart like the rain
18. On cursed Gomorrah's howling plain -
19. Yet when I hear thy foes deride
20. I must cling closely to thy side -

21. Our mutual foes - they will not rest
22. From trampling on thy buried breast -
23. Glutting there hatred with the doom
24. They picture thine, beyond the tomb -

25. But God is not like human kind
26. Man cannot read the Almighty mind
27. Vengeance will never tortue they
28. Nor hunt thy soul eternally

29. Then do not in this night of grief
30. This time of over whelming fear
31. O do not think that God can leave
32. Forget, forsake, refuse to hear ! -

33. What have I dreamt ? He lies asleep
34. With whom my heart would vainly weep
35. He rests - and I endure the woe
36. That left his spirit long ago -
