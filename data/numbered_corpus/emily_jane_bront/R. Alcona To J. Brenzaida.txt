1. Cold in the earth, and the deep snow piled above thee!
2. Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!
3. Have I forgot, my Only Love, to love thee,
4. Severed at last by Time's all-wearing wave?
5. Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover
6. Over the mountains on Angora's shore;
7. Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover
8. That noble heart for ever, ever more?

9. Cold in the earth, and fifteen wild Decembers
10. From those brown hills have melted into spring--
11. Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
12. After such years of change and suffering!

13. Sweet Love of youth, forgive if I forget thee
14. While the World's tide is bearing me along:
15. Sterner desires and darker hopes beset me,
16. Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong.

17. No other Sun has lightened up my heaven;
18. No other Star has ever shone for me:
19. All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given
20. All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee.

21. But when the days of golden dreams had perished
22. And even Despair was powerless to destroy,
23. Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,
24. Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy;

25. Then did I check the tears of useless passion,
26. Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;
27. Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
28. Down to that tomb already more than mine!

29. And even yet, I dare not let it languish,
30. Dare not indulge in Memory's rapturous pain;
31. Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,
32. How could I seek the empty world again?

33. (March 3, 1845)
