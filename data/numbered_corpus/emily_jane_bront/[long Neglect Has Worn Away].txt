1. Long neglect has worn away
2. Half the sweet enchanting smile;
3. Time has turned the bloom to gray;
4. Mold and damp the face defile.

5. But that lock of silky hair,
6. Still beneath the picture twined,
7. Tells what once those features were,
8. Paints their image on the mind.

9. Fair the hand that traced that line,
10. “Dearest, ever deem me true”;
11. Swiftly flew the fingers fine
12. When the pen that motto drew.
