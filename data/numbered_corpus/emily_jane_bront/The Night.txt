1. In summer's mellow midnight,
2. A cloudless moon shone through
3. Our open parlour window,
4. And rose-trees wet with dew.

5. I sat in silent musing;
6. The soft wind waved my hair;
7. It told me heaven was glorious,
8. And sleeping earth was fair.

9. I needed not its breathing
10. To bring such thoughts to me;
11. But still it whispered lowly,
12. 'How dark the woods would be!

13. 'The thick leaves in my murmur
14. Are rustling like a dream,
15. And all their myriad voices
16. Instinct with spirit seem.'

17. I said, 'Go, gentle singer,
18. Thy wooing voice is kind:
19. But do not think its music
20. Has power to reach my mind.

21. 'Play with the scented flower,
22. The young tree's supply bough,
23. And leave my human feelings
24. In their own course to flow.'

25. The wanderer would not heed me:
26. Its kiss grew warmer still:
27. 'Oh Come!' it sighed so sweetly;
28. 'I'll win thee 'gainst thy will.

29. 'Were we not friends from childhood?
30. Have I not loved thee long?
31. As long as thou, the solemn night,
32. Whose silence wakes my song.

33. 'And when thy heart is resting
34. Beneath the church-aisle stone,
35. I shall have time for mourning,
36. And thou for being alone.'
