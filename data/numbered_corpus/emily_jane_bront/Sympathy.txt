1. There should be no despair for you
2. While nightly stars are burning,
3. While evening pours its silent dew
4. And sunshine gilds the morning.
5. There should be no despair - though tears
6. May flow down like a river:
7. Are not the best beloved of years
8. Around your heart forever?

9. They weep - you weep - it must be so;
10. Winds sigh as you are sighing,
11. And Winter sheds his grief in snow
12. Where Autumn's leaves are lying:
13. Yet these revive, and from their fate
14. Your fate cannot be parted,
15. Then journey on, if not elate,
16. Still, never broken-hearted!
