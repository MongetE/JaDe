1. When weary with the long day's care,
2. And earthly change from pain to pain,
3. And lost and ready to despair,
4. Thy kind voice calls me back again:
5. Oh, my true friend! I am not lone,
6. While thou canst speak with such a tone!

7. So hopeless is the world without;
8. The world within I doubly prize;
9. Thy world, where guile, and hate, and doubt,
10. And cold suspicion never rise;
11. Where thou, and I, and Liberty,
12. Have undisputed sovereignty.

13. What matters it, that, all around,
14. Danger, and guilt, and darkness lie,
15. If but within our bosom's bound
16. We hold a bright, untroubled sky,
17. Warm with ten thousand mingled rays
18. Of suns that know no winter days?

19. Reason, indeed, may oft complain
20. For Nature's sad reality,
21. And tell the suffering heart, how vain
22. Its cherished dreams must always be;
23. And Truth may rudely trample down
24. The flowers of Fancy, newly-blown:

25. But, thou art ever there, to bring
26. The hovering vision back, and breathe
27. New glories o'er the blighted spring,
28. And call a lovelier Life from Death,
29. And whisper, with a voice divine,
30. Of real worlds, as bright as thine.

31. I trust not to thy phantom bliss,
32. Yet, still, in evening's quiet hour,
33. With never-failing thankfulness,
34. I welcome thee, Benignant Power;
35. Sure solacer of human cares,
36. And sweeter hope, when hope despairs!
