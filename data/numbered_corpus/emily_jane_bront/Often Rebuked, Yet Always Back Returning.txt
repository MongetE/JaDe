1. Often rebuked, yet always back returning
2. To those first feelings that were born with me,
3. And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
4. For idle dreams of things which cannot be:
5. To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region;
6. Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;
7. And visions rising, legion after legion,
8. Bring the unreal world too strangely near.

9. I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces,
10. And not in paths of high morality,
11. And not among the half-distinguished faces,
12. The clouded forms of long-past history.

13. I'll walk where my own nature would be leading:
14. It vexes me to choose another guide:
15. Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding;
16. Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side

17. What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?
18. More glory and more grief than I can tell:
19. The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
20. Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell.


21. Harold Bloom calls this Emily BrontÃ«'s finest poem; however, C.W. Hatfield, who edited her poems, speculates that Charlotte wrote or revised this poem. It first appeared in the 1850 edition of Emily's novel and poems; no manuscript version of this poem is known.
