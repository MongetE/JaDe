1. I see around me tombstones grey
2. Stretching their shadows far away.
3. Beneath the turf my footsteps tread
4. Lie low and lone the silent dead -
5. Beneath the turf - beneath the mould -
6. Forever dark, forever cold -
7. And my eyes cannot hold the tears
8. That memory hoards from vanished years
9. For Time and Death and Mortal pain
10. Give wounds that will not heal again -
11. Let me remember half the woe
12. I've seen and heard and felt below,
13. And Heaven itself - so pure and blest,
14. Could never give my spirit rest -
15. Sweet land of light! thy children fair
16. Know nought akin to our despair -
17. Nor have they felt, nor can they tell
18. What tenants haunt each mortal cell,
19. What gloomy guests we hold within -
20. Torments and madness, tears and sin!
21. Well - may they live in ectasy
22. Their long eternity of joy;
23. At least we would not bring them down
24. With us to weep, with us to groan,
25. No - Earth would wish no other sphere
26. To taste her cup of sufferings drear;
27. She turns from Heaven with a careless eye
28. And only mourns that we must die!
29. Ah mother, what shall comfort thee
30. In all this boundless misery?
31. To cheer our eager eyes a while
32. We see thee smile; how fondly smile!
33. But who reads not through that tender glow
34. Thy deep, unutterable woe:
35. Indeed no dazzling land above
36. Can cheat thee of thy children's love.
37. We all, in life's departing shine,
38. Our last dear longings blend with thine;
39. And struggle still and strive to trace
40. With clouded gaze, thy darling face.
41. We would not leave our native home
42. For any world beyond the Tomb.
43. No - rather on thy kindly breast
44. Let us be laid in lasting rest;
45. Or waken but to share with thee
46. A mutual immortality -
