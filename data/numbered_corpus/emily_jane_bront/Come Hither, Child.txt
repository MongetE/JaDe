1. Come hither, child--who gifted thee
2. With power to touch that string so well?
3. How darest thou rouse up thoughts in me,
4. Thoughts that I would--but cannot quell?

5. Nay, chide not, lady; long ago
6. I heard those notes in Ula's hall,
7. And had I known they'd waken woe
8. I'd weep their music to recall.

9. But thus it was: one festal night
10. When I was hardly six years old
11. I stole away from crowds and light
12. And sought a chamber dark and cold.

13. I had no one to love me there,
14. I knew no comrade and no friend;
15. And so I went to sorrow where
16. Heaven, only heaven saw me bend.

17. Loud blew the wind; 'twas sad to stay
18. From all that splendour barred away.
19. I imaged in the lonely room
20. A thousand forms of fearful gloom.

21. And with my wet eyes raised on high
22. I prayed to God that I might die.
23. Suddenly in that silence drear
24. A sound of music reached my ear,

25. And then a note, I hear it yet,
26. So full of soul, so deeply sweet,
27. I thought that Gabriel's self had come
28. To take me to thy father's home.

29. Three times it rose, that seraph strain,
30. Then died, nor breathed again;
31. But still the words and still the tone
32. Dwell round my heart when all alone.
