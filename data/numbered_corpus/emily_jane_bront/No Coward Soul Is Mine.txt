1. No coward soul is mine,
2. No trembler in the world,s storm-troubled sphere:
3. I see Heaven's glories shine,
4. And Faith shines equal arming me from Fear.

5. O God within my breast.
6. Almighty ever-present Deity!
7. Life , that in me has rest,
8. As I Undying Life, have power in thee!

9. Vain are the thousand creeds
10. That move men's hearts, unutterably vain;
11. Worthless as withered weeds,
12. Or idlest froth amid the boundless main,

13. To waken doubt in one
14. Holding so fast by Thy infinity;
15. So surely anchored on
16. The steadfast rock of Immortality.

17. With wide-embracing love
18. Thy Spirit animates eternal years,
19. Pervades and broods above,
20. Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.

21. Though Earth and moon were gone,
22. And suns and universes ceased to be,
23. And Thou wert left alone,
24. Every Existence would exist in thee.

25. There is not room for Death,
26. Nor atom that his might could render void:
27. Since thou art Being and Breath,
28. And what thou art may never be destroyed.
