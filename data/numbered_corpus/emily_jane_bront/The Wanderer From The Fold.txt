1. How few, of all the hearts that loved,
2. Are grieving for thee now;
3. And why should mine to-night be moved
4. With such a sense of woe?

5. Too often thus, when left alone,
6. Where none my thoughts can see,
7. Comes back a word, a passing tone
8. From thy strange history.

9. Sometimes I seem to see thee rise,
10. A glorious child again;
11. All virtues beaming from thine eyes
12. That ever honoured men:

13. Courage and truth, a generous breast
14. Where sinless sunshine lay:
15. A being whose very presence blest
16. Like gladsome summer-day.

17. O, fairly spread thy early sail,
18. And fresh, and pure, and free,
19. Was the first impulse of the gale
20. Which urged life's wave for thee!

21. Why did the pilot, too confiding,
22. Dream o'er that ocean's foam,
23. And trust in Pleasure's careless guiding
24. To bring his vessel home?

25. For well he knew what dangers frowned,
26. What mists would gather, dim;
27. What rocks and shelves, and sands lay round
28. Between his port and him.

29. The very brightness of the sun
30. The splendour of the main,
31. The wind which bore him wildly on
32. Should not have warned in vain.

33. An anxious gazer from the shore—
34. I marked the whitening wave,
35. And wept above thy fate the more
36. Because—I could not save.

37. It recks not now, when all is over:
38. But yet my heart will be
39. A mourner still, though friend and lover
40. Have both forgotten thee!
