1. Tell me, tell me, smiling child,
2. What the past is like to thee ?
3. 'An Autumn evening soft and mild
4. With a wind that sighs mournfully.'

5. Tell me, what is the present hour ?
6. 'A green and flowery spray
7. Where a young bird sits gathering its power
8. To mount and fly away.'

9. And what is the future, happy one ?
10. 'A sea beneath a cloudless sun ;
11. A mighty, glorious, dazzling sea
12. Stretching into infinity.'
