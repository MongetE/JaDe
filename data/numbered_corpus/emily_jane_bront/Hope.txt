1. Hope was but a timid friend;
2. She sat without the grated den,
3. Watching how my fate would tend,
4. Even as selfish-hearted men.

5. She was cruel in her fear;
6. Through the bars, one dreary day,
7. I looked out to see her there,
8. And she turned her face away!

9. Like a false guard, false watch keeping,
10. Still, in strife, she whispered peace;
11. She would sing while I was weeping;
12. If I listened, she would cease.

13. False she was, and unrelenting;
14. When my last joys strewed the ground,
15. Even Sorrow saw, repenting,
16. Those sad relics scattered round;

17. Hope, whose whisper would have given
18. Balm to all my frenzied pain,
19. Stretched her wings, and soared to heaven,
20. Went, and ne'er returned again!
