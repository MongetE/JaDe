1. On a sunny brae, alone I lay
2. One summer afternoon;
3. It was the marriage-time of May
4. With her young lover, June.

5. From her mother's heart, seemed loath to part
6. That queen of bridal charms,
7. But her father smiled on the fairest child
8. He ever held in his arms.

9. The trees did wave their plumy crests,
10. The glad birds caroled clear;
11. And I, of all the wedding guests,
12. Was only sullen there!

13. There was not one, but wished to shun
14. My aspect void of cheer;
15. The very grey rocks, looking on,
16. Asked, "What do you here?"

17. And I could utter no reply;
18. In sooth, I did not know
19. Why I had brought a clouded eye
20. To greet the general glow.

21. So, resting on a heathy bank,
22. I took my heart to me;
23. And we together sadly sank
24. Into a reverie.

25. We thought, "When winter comes again,
26. Where will these bright things be?
27. All vanished, like a vision vain,
28. An unreal mockery!

29. The birds that now so blithely sing,
30. Through deserts, frozen dry,
31. Poor spectres of the perished spring,
32. In famished troops, will fly.

33. And why should we be glad at all?
34. The leaf is hardly green,
35. Before a token of its fall
36. Is on the surface seen!"

37. Now, whether it were really so,
38. I never could be sure;
39. But as in fit of peevish woe,
40. I stretched me on the moor.

41. A thousand thousand gleaming fires
42. Seemed kindling in the air;
43. A thousand thousand silvery lyres
44. Resounded far and near:

45. Methought, the very breath I breathed
46. Was full of sparks divine,
47. And all my heather-couch was wreathed
48. By that celestial shine!

49. And, while the wide earth echoing rung
50. To their strange minstrelsy,
51. The little glittering spirits sung,
52. Or seemed to sing, to me.

53. "O mortal! mortal! let them die;
54. Let time and tears destroy,
55. That we may overflow the sky
56. With universal joy!

57. Let grief distract the sufferer's breast,
58. And night obscure his way;
59. They hasten him to endless rest,
60. And everlasting day.

61. To thee the world is like a tomb,
62. A desert's naked shore;
63. To us, in unimagined bloom,
64. It brightens more and more!

65. And could we lift the veil, and give
66. One brief glimpse to thine eye,
67. Thou wouldst rejoice for those that live,
68. Because they live to die."

69. The music ceased; the noonday dream,
70. Like dream of night, withdrew;
71. But Fancy, still, will sometimes deem
72. Her fond creation true.
