1. Me thinks this heart should rest awhile
2. So stilly round the evening falls
3. The veiled sun sheds no parting smile
4. Nor mirth nor music wakes my Halls

5. I have sat lonely all the day
6. Watching the drizzly mist descend
7. And first conceal the hills in grey
8. And then along the valleys wend

9. And I have sat and watched the trees
10. And the sad flowers how drear they blow
11. Those flowers were formed to feel the breeze
12. Wave their light leaves in summer's glow

13. Yet their lives passed in gloomy woe
14. And hopeless comes its dark decline
15. And I lament because I know
16. That cold departure pictures mine
