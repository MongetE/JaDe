1. How still, how happy! Those are words
2. That once would scarce agree together;
3. I loved the plashing of the surge -
4. The changing heaven the breezy weather,

5. More than smooth seas and cloudless skies
6. And solemn, soothing, softened airs
7. That in the forest woke no sighs
8. And from the green spray shook no tears.

9. How still, how happy! now I feel
10. Where silence dwells is sweeter far
11. Than laughing mirth's most joyous swell
12. However pure its raptures are.

13. Come, sit down on this sunny stone:
14. 'Tis wintry light o'er flowerless moors -
15. But sit - for we are all alone
16. And clear expand heaven's breathless shores.

17. I could think in the withered grass
18. Spring's budding wreaths we might discern;
19. The violet's eye might shyly flash
20. And young leaves shoot among the fern.

21. It is but thought - full many a night
22. The snow shall clothe those hills afar
23. And storms shall add a drearier blight
24. And winds shall wage a wilder war,

25. Before the lark may herald in
26. Fresh foliage twined with blossoms fair
27. And summer days again begin
28. Their glory - haloed crown to wear.

29. Yet my heart loves December's smile
30. As much as July's golden beam;
31. Then let us sit and watch the while
32. The blue ice curdling on the stream -
