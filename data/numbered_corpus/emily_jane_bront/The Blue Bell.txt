1. The blue bell is the sweetest flower
2. That waves in summer air;
3. Its blossoms have the mightiest power
4. To soothe my spirit's care.

5. There is a spell in purple heath
6. Too wildly, sadly dear;
7. The violet has a fragrant breath
8. But fragrance will not cheer.

9. The trees are bare, the sun is cold;
10. And seldom, seldom seen;
11. The heavens have lost their zone of gold
12. The earth its robe of green;

13. And ice upon the glancing stream
14. Has cast its sombre shade
15. And distant hills and valleys seem
16. In frozen mist arrayed -


17. The blue bell cannot charm me now
18. The heath has lost its bloom,
19. The violets in the glen below
20. They yield no sweet perfume.

21. But though I mourn the heather-bell
22. 'Tis better far, away;
23. I know how fast my tears would swell
24. To see it smile today;

25. And that wood flower that hides so shy
26. Beneath the mossy stone
27. Its balmy scent and dewy eye:
28. 'Tis not for them I moan.

29. It is the slight and stately stem,
30. The blossom's silvery blue,
31. The buds hid like a sapphire gem
32. In sheaths of emerald hue.

33. 'Tis these that breathe upon my heart
34. A calm and softening spell
35. That if it makes the tear-drop start
36. Has power to soothe as well.

37. For these I weep, so long divided
38. Through winter's dreary day,
39. In longing weep--but most when guided
40. On withered banks to stray.

41. If chilly then the light should fall
42. Adown the dreary sky
43. And gild the dank and darkened wall
44. With transient brilliancy,

45. How do I yearn, how do I pine
46. For the time of flowers to come,
47. And turn me from that fading shine
48. To mourn the fields of home -
