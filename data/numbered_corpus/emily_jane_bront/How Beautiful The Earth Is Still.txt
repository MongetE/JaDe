1. How beautiful the Earth is still
2. To thee–how full of Happiness;
3. How little fraught with real ill
4. Or shadowy phantoms of distress;
5. How Spring can bring thee glory yet
6. And Summer win thee to forget
7. December's sullen time!
8. Why dost thou hold the treasure fast
9. Of youth's delight, when youth is past
10. And thou art near thy prime?

11. When those who were thy own compeers,
12. Equal in fortunes and in years,
13. Have seen their morning melt in tears,
14. To dull unlovely day;
15. Blest, had they died unproved and young
16. Before their hearts were wildly wrung,
17. Poor slaves, subdued by passions strong,
18. A weak and helpless prey!

19. 'Because, I hoped while they enjoyed,
20. And by fulfilment, hope destroyed
21. As children hope, with trustful breast,
22. I waited Bliss and cherished Rest.

23. 'A thoughtful Spirit taught me soon
24. That we must long till life be done;
25. That every phase of earthly joy
26. Will always fade and always cloy--

27. 'This I foresaw, and would not chase
28. The fleeting treacheries,
29. But with firm foot and tranquil face
30. Held backward from the tempting race,
31. Gazed o'er the sands the waves efface
32. To the enduring seas–

33. 'There cast my anchor of Desire
34. Deep in unknown Eternity;
35. Nor ever let my Spirit tire
36. With looking for What is to be.

37. 'It is Hope's spell that glorifies
38. Like youth to my maturer eyes
39. All Nature's million mysteries--
40. The fearful and the fair–

41. 'Hope soothes me in the griefs I know,
42. She lulls my pain for others' woe
43. And makes me strong to undergo
44. What I am born to bear.
45. 'Glad comforter, will I not brave
46. Unawed the darkness of the grave?
47. Nay, smile to hear Death's billows rave,
48. My Guide, sustained by thee?

49. The more unjust seems present fate
50. The more my Spirit springs elate
51. Strong in thy strength, to anticipate
52. Rewarding Destiny!
