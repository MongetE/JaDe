1. That wind I used to hear it swelling
2. With joy divinely deep
3. You might have seen my hot tears welling
4. But rapture made me weep

5. I used to love on winter nights
6. To lie and dream alone
7. Of all the hopes and real delights
8. My early years had known

9. And oh above the rest of those
10. That coming time should [bear]
11. Like heaven's own glorious stars they rose
12. Still beaming bright and fair
