1. Shall Earth no more inspire thee,
2. Thou lonely dreamer now ?
3. Since passion may not fire thee
4. Shall nature cease to bow ?

5. Thy mind is ever moving
6. In regions dark to thee;
7. Recall its useless roving -
8. Come back and dwell with me -

9. I know my mountain breezes
10. Enchant annd soothe thee still -
11. I know my sunshine pleases
12. Despite thy wayward will -

13. When day with evening blending
14. Sinks from the summer sky,
15. I've seen thy spirit bending
16. In fond idolotry -

17. I've watched thee every hour -
18. I know my mighty sway -
19. I know my magic power
20. To drive thy griefs away -

21. Few hearts to mortal given
22. On earth so wildly pine
23. Yet none would ask a Heaven
24. More like this Earth than thine -

25. Then let my winds caress thee -
26. Thy comrade let me be -
27. Since nought beside can bless thee
28. Return and dwell with me -
