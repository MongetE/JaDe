1. The sun has set, and the long grass now
2. Waves dreamily in the evening wind;
3. And the wild bird has flown from that old gray stone
4. In some warm nook a couch to find.

5. In all the lonely landscape round
6. I see no light and hear no sound,
7. Except the wind that far away
8. Come sighing o'er the healthy sea.
