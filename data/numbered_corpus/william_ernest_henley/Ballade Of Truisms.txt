14. Though, they say,
15. Man the cup of heaven may drain;
16. Though, his little world to sway,
17. He display
18. Hoard on hoard of pith and brain:
19. Autumn brings a mist and rain
20. That constrain

21. Him and his to know decay,
22. Where undimmed the lights that wane
23. Would remain,
24. If it could be always May.

32. To explain

42. Jack with Jane -
43. If it could be always May.
