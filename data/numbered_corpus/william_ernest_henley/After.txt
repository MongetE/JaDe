1. Like as a flamelet blanketed in smoke,
2. So through the anaesthetic shows my life;
3. So flashes and so fades my thought, at strife
4. With the strong stupor that I heave and choke
5. And sicken at, it is so foully sweet.
6. Faces look strange from space-and disappear.
7. Far voices, sudden loud, offend my ear -
8. And hush as sudden. Then my senses fleet:
9. All were a blank, save for this dull, new pain
10. That grinds my leg and foot; and brokenly
11. Time and the place glimpse on to me again;
12. And, unsurprised, out of uncertainty,
13. I wake-relapsing-somewhat faint and fain,
14. To an immense, complacent dreamery.
