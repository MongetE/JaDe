1. A black and glassy float, opaque and still,
2. The loch, at furthest ebb supine in sleep,
3. Reversing, mirrored in its luminous deep
4. The calm grey skies; the solemn spurs of hill;
5. Heather, and corn, and wisps of loitering haze;
6. The wee white cots, black-hatted, plumed with smoke;
7. The braes beyond--and when the ripple awoke,
8. They wavered with the jarred and wavering glaze.
9. The air was hushed and dreamy. Evermore
10. A noise of running water whispered near.
11. A straggling crow called high and thin. A bird
12. Trilled from the birch-leaves. Round the shingled shore,
13. Yellow with weed, there wandered, vague and clear,
14. Strange vowels, mysterious gutturals, idly heard.
