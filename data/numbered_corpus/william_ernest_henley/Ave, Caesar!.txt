1. From the winter's grey despair,
2. From the summer's golden languor,
3. Death, the lover of Life,
4. Frees us for ever.

5. Inevitable, silent, unseen,
6. Everywhere always,
7. Shadow by night and as light in the day,
8. Signs she at last to her chosen;
9. And, as she waves them forth,
10. Sorrow and Joy
11. Lay by their looks and their voices,
12. Set down their hopes, and are made
13. One in the dim Forever.

14. Into the winter's grey delight,
15. Into the summer's golden dream,
16. Holy and high and impartial,
17. Death, the mother of Life,
18. Mingles all men for ever.
