1. Not to the staring Day,
2. For all the importunate questionings he pursues
3. In his big, violent voice,
4. Shall those mild things of bulk and multitude,
5. The Trees--God's sentinels
6. Over His gift of live, life-giving air,
7. Yield of their huge, unutterable selves.
8. Midsummer-manifold, each one
9. Voluminous, a labyrinth of life,
10. They keep their greenest musings, and the dim dreams
11. That haunt their leafier privacies,
12. Dissembled, baffling the random gapeseed still
13. With blank full-faces, or the innocent guile
14. Of laughter flickering back from shine to shade,
15. And disappearances of homing birds,
16. And frolicsome freaks
17. Of little boughs that frisk with little boughs.

18. But at the word
19. Of the ancient, sacerdotal Night,
20. Night of the many secrets, whose effect -
21. Transfiguring, hierophantic, dread -
22. Themselves alone may fully apprehend,
23. They tremble and are changed.
24. In each, the uncouth individual soul
25. Looms forth and glooms
26. Essential, and, their bodily presences
27. Touched with inordinate significance,
28. Wearing the darkness like the livery
29. Of some mysterious and tremendous guild,
30. They brood--they menace--they appal;
31. Or the anguish of prophecy tears them, and they wring
32. Wild hands of warning in the face
33. Of some inevitable advance of the doom;
34. Or, each to the other bending, beckoning, signing
35. As in some monstrous market-place,
36. They pass the news, these Gossips of the Prime,
37. In that old speech their forefathers
38. Learned on the lawns of Eden, ere they heard
39. The troubled voice of Eve
40. Naming the wondering folk of Paradise.

41. Your sense is sealed, or you should hear them tell
42. The tale of their dim life, with all
43. Its compost of experience: how the Sun
44. Spreads them their daily feast,
45. Sumptuous, of light, firing them as with wine;
46. Of the old Moon's fitful solicitude
47. And those mild messages the Stars
48. Descend in silver silences and dews;
49. Or what the sweet-breathing West,
50. Wanton with wading in the swirl of the wheat,
51. Said, and their leafage laughed;
52. And how the wet-winged Angel of the Rain
53. Came whispering . . . whispering; and the gifts of the Year -
54. The sting of the stirring sap
55. Under the wizardry of the young-eyed Spring,
56. Their summer amplitudes of pomp,
57. Their rich autumnal melancholy, and the shrill,
58. Embittered housewifery
59. Of the lean Winter: all such things,
60. And with them all the goodness of the Master,
61. Whose right hand blesses with increase and life,
62. Whose left hand honours with decay and death.

63. Thus under the constraint of Night
64. These gross and simple creatures,
65. Each in his scores of rings, which rings are years,
66. A servant of the Will!
67. And God, the Craftsman, as He walks
68. The floor of His workshop, hearkens, full of cheer
69. In thus accomplishing
70. The aims of His miraculous artistry.
