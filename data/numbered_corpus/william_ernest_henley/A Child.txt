1. A child,
2. Curious and innocent,
3. Slips from his Nurse, and rejoicing
4. Loses himself in the Fair.

5. Thro' the jostle and din
6. Wandering, he revels,
7. Dreaming, desiring, possessing;
8. Till, of a sudden
9. Tired and afraid, he beholds
10. The sordid assemblage
11. Just as it is; and he runs
12. With a sob to his Nurse
13. (Lighting at last on him),
14. And in her motherly bosom
15. Cries him to sleep.

16. Thus thro' the World,
17. Seeing and feeling and knowing,
18. Goes Man: till at last,
19. Tired of experience, he turns
20. To the friendly and comforting breast
21. Of the old nurse, Death.
