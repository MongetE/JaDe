1. Take any station, pavement, circus, corner,
2. Where men their styles of print may call or choose,
3. And there-ten times more on it than Jack Horner-
4. There you shall find him swathed in sheets of news.
5. Nothing can stay the placing of his wares-
6. Not 'bus, nor cab, nor dray! The very Slop,
7. That imp of power, is powerless! Ever he dares,
8. And, daring, lands his public neck and crop.
9. Even the many-tortured London ear,
10. The much-enduring, loathes his Speeshul yell,
11. His shriek of Winnur! But his dart and leer
12. And poise are irresistible. Pall Mall
13. Joys in him, and Mile End; for his vocation
14. Is to purvey the stuff of conversation.
