1. An ill March noon; the flagstones gray with dust;
2. An all-round east wind volleying straws and grit;
3. St. Martin's Steps, where every venomous gust
4. Lingers to buffet, or sneap, the passing cit;
5. And in the gutter, squelching a rotten boot,
6. Draped in a wrap that, modish ten-year syne,
7. Partners, obscene with sweat and grease and soot,
8. A horrible hat, that once was just as fine;
9. The drunkard's mouth a-wash for something drinkable,
10. The drunkard's eye alert for causal toppers,
11. The drunkard's neck stooped to a lot scarce thinkable,
12. A living crawling blazoning of Hot-Coppers,
13. He trails his mildews towards a Kingdom-Come
14. Compact of sausage-and-mash and two-o'rum!
