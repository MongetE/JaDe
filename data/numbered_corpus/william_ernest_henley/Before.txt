1. Behold me waiting-waiting for the knife.
2. A little while, and at a leap I storm
3. The thick, sweet mystery of chloroform,
4. The drunken dark, the little death-in-life.
5. The gods are good to me: I have no wife,
6. No innocent child, to think of as I near
7. The fateful minute; nothing all-too dear
8. Unmans me for my bout of passive strife.
9. Yet am I tremulous and a trifle sick,
10. And, face to face with chance, I shrink a little:
11. My hopes are strong, my will is something weak.
12. Here comes the basket? Thank you. I am ready.
13. But, gentlemen my porters, life is brittle:
14. You carry Caesar and his fortunes-steady!
