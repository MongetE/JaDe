1. O gather me the rose, the rose,
2. While yet in flower we find it,
3. For summer smiles, but summer goes,
4. And winter waits behind it.

5. For with the dream foregone, foregone,
6. The deed foreborn forever,
7. The worm Regret will canker on,
8. And time will turn him never.

9. So were it well to love, my love,
10. And cheat of any laughter
11. The fate beneath us, and above,
12. The dark before and after.

13. The myrtle and the rose, the rose,
14. The sunshine and the swallow,
15. The dream that comes, the wish that goes
16. The memories that follow!
