1. We flash across the level.
2. We thunder thro' the bridges.
3. We bicker down the cuttings.
4. We sway along the ridges.

5. A rush of streaming hedges,
6. Of jostling lights and shadows,
7. Of hurtling, hurrying stations,
8. Of racing woods and meadows.

9. We charge the tunnels headlong -
10. The blackness roars and shatters.
11. We crash between embankments -
12. The open spins and scatters.

13. We shake off the miles like water,
14. We might carry a royal ransom;
15. And I think of her waiting, waiting,
16. And long for a common hansom.
