1. Friends… old friends…
2. One sees how it ends.
3. A woman looks
4. Or a man lies,
5. And the pleasant brooks
6. And the quiet skies,
7. Ruined with brawling
8. And caterwauling,
9. Enchant no more
10. As they did before,
11. And so it ends
12. With friends.

13. Friends… old friends…
14. And what if it ends?
15. Shall we dare to shirk
16. What we live to learn?
17. It has done its work,
18. It has served its turn;
19. And, forgive and forget
20. Or hanker and fret,
21. We can be no more
22. As we were before.
23. When it ends, it ends
24. With friends.

25. Friends… old friends…
26. So it breaks, so it ends.
27. There let it rest!
28. It has fought and won,
29. And is still the best
30. That either has done.
31. Each as he stands
32. The work of its hands
33. Which shall be more
34. As he was before?…
35. What is it ends
36. With friends?
