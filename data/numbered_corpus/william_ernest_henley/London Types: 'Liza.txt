1. 'Liza's old man's perhaps a little shady,
2. 'Liza's old woman's prone to booze and cring;
3. But 'Liza deems herself a perfect lady,
4. And proves it in her feathers and her fringe.
5. For 'Liza has a bloke her heart to cheer,
6. With pearlies and a barrer and a jack,
7. So all the vegetables of the year
8. Are duly represented on her back.
9. Her boots are sacrifices to her hats,
10. Which knock you speechless-like a load of bricks!
11. Her summer velvets dazzle Wanstead Flats,
12. And cost, at times, a good eighteen-and-six.
13. Withal, outside the gay and giddy whirl,
14. 'Liza's a stupid, straight, hard-working girl.
