1. Beside the idle summer sea,
2. And in the vacant summer days,
3. Light Love came fluting down the ways,
4. Where you were loitering with me.

5. Who have not welcomed even as we,
6. That jocund minstrel and his lays
7. Beside the idle summer sea
8. And in the vacant summer days?

9. We listened, we were fancy-free;
10. And lo! in terror and amaze
11. We stood alone â€“ alone and gaze
12. With an implacable memory
13. Beside the idle summer sea.
