1. Two and thirty is the ploughman.
2. He's a man of gallant inches,
3. And his hair is close and curly,
4. And his beard;
5. But his face is wan and sunken,
6. And his eyes are large and brilliant,
7. And his shoulder-blades are sharp,
8. And his knees.

9. He is weak of wits, religious,
10. Full of sentiment and yearning,
11. Gentle, faded-with a cough
12. And a snore.
13. When his wife (who was a widow,
14. And is many years his elder)
15. Fails to write, and that is always,
16. He desponds.

17. Let his melancholy wander,
18. And he'll tell you pretty stories
19. Of the women that have wooed him
20. Long ago;
21. Or he'll sing of bonnie lasses
22. Keeping sheep among the heather,
23. With a crackling, hackling click
24. In his voice.
