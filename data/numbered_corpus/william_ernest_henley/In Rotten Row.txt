1. In Rotten Row a cigarette
2. I sat and smoked, with no regret
3. For all the tumult that had been.
4. The distances were still and green,
5. And streaked with shadows cool and wet.

6. Two sweethearts on a bench were set,
7. Two birds among the boughs were met;
8. So love and song were heard and seen
9. In Rotten Row.
10. A horse or two there was to fret
11. The soundless sand; but work and debt,
12. Fair flowers and falling leaves between,
13. While clocks are chiming clear and keen,
14. A man may very well forget
15. In Rotten Row.
