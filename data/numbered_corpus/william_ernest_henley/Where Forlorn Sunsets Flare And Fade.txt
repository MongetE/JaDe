1. Where forlorn sunsets flare and fade
2. On desolate sea and lonely sand,
3. Out of the silence and the shade
4. What is the voice of strange command
5. Calling you still, as friend calls friend
6. With love that cannot brook delay
7. To rise and follow the ways that wend
8. Over the hills and far away?

9. Hark in the city, street on street
10. A roaring reach of death and life,
11. Of vortices that clash and fleet
12. And ruin in appointed strife,
13. Hark to it calling, calling clear,
14. Calling until you cannot stay
15. From dearer things than your own most dear
16. Over the hills and far away?

17. Out of the sound of the ebb-and-flow,
18. Out of the sight of the lamp and star,
19. It calls you where the good winds blow,
20. And the unchanging meadows are;
21. From faded hopes and hopes agleam,
22. It calls you, calls you night and day
23. Beyond the dark into the dream
24. Over the hills and far away.
