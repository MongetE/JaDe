1. Her little face is like a walnut shell
2. With wrinkling lines; her soft, white hair adorns
3. Her withered brows in quaint, straight curls, like horns;
4. And all about her clings an old, sweet smell.
5. Prim is her gown and quakerlike her shawl.
6. Well might her bonnets have been born on her.
7. Can you conceive a Fairy Godmother
8. The subject of a strong religious call?
9. In snow or shine, from bed to bed she runs,
10. All twinkling smiles and texts and pious tales,
11. Her mittened hands, that ever give or pray,
12. Bearing a sheaf of tracts, a bag of buns:
13. A wee old maid that sweeps the Bridegroom's way,
14. Strong in a cheerful trust that never fails.
