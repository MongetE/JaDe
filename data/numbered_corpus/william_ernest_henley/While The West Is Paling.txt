1. While the west is paling
2. Starshine is begun.
3. While the dusk is failing
4. Glimmers up the sun.

5. So, till darkness cover
6. Life's retreating gleam,
7. Lover follows lover,
8. Dream succeeds to dream.

9. Stoop to my endeavour,
10. O my love, and be
11. Only and for ever
12. Sun and stars to me.
