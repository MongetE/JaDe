1. To GARRYOWEN upon an organ ground
2. Two girls are jigging. Riotously they trip,
3. With eyes aflame, quick bosoms, hand on hip,
4. As in the tumult of a witches' round.
5. Youngsters and youngsters round them prance and bound.
6. Two solemn babes twirl ponderously, and skip.
7. The artist's teeth gleam from his bearded lip.
8. High from the kennel howls a tortured hound.
9. The music reels and hurtles, and the night
10. Is full of stinks and cries; a naphtha-light
11. Flares from a barrow; battered and obtused
12. With vices, wrinkles, life and work and rags,
13. Each with her inch of clay, two loitering hags
14. Look on dispassionate--critical--something 'mused.
