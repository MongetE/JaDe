1. Forth from the dust and din,
2. The crush, the heat, the many-spotted glare,
3. The odour and sense of life and lust aflare,
4. The wrangle and jangle of unrests,
5. Let us take horse, Dear Heart, take horse and win -
6. As from swart August to the green lap of May -
7. To quietness and the fresh and fragrant breasts
8. Of the still, delicious night, not yet aware
9. In any of her innumerable nests
10. Of that first sudden plash of dawn,
11. Clear, sapphirine, luminous, large,
12. Which tells that soon the flowing springs of day
13. In deep and ever deeper eddies drawn
14. Forward and up, in wider and wider way,
15. Shall float the sands, and brim the shores,
16. On this our lith of the World, as round it roars
17. And spins into the outlook of the Sun
18. (The Lord's first gift, the Lord's especial charge),
19. With light, with living light, from marge to marge
20. Until the course He set and staked be run.

21. Through street and square, through square and street,
22. Each with his home-grown quality of dark
23. And violated silence, loud and fleet,
24. Waylaid by a merry ghost at every lamp,
25. The hansom wheels and plunges. Hark, O, hark,
26. Sweet, how the old mare's bit and chain
27. Ring back a rough refrain
28. Upon the marked and cheerful tramp
29. Of her four shoes! Here is the Park,
30. And O, the languid midsummer wafts adust,
31. The tired midsummer blooms!
32. O, the mysterious distances, the glooms
33. Romantic, the august
34. And solemn shapes! At night this City of Trees
35. Turns to a tryst of vague and strange
36. And monstrous Majesties,
37. Let loose from some dim underworld to range
38. These terrene vistas till their twilight sets:
39. When, dispossessed of wonderfulness, they stand
40. Beggared and common, plain to all the land
41. For stooks of leaves! And lo! the Wizard Hour,
42. His silent, shining sorcery winged with power!
43. Still, still the streets, between their carcanets
44. Of linking gold, are avenues of sleep.
45. But see how gable ends and parapets
46. In gradual beauty and significance
47. Emerge! And did you hear
48. That little twitter-and-cheep,
49. Breaking inordinately loud and clear
50. On this still, spectral, exquisite atmosphere?
51. 'Tis a first nest at matins! And behold
52. A rakehell cat--how furtive and acold!
53. A spent witch homing from some infamous dance -
54. Obscene, quick-trotting, see her tip and fade
55. Through shadowy railings into a pit of shade!
56. And now! a little wind and shy,
57. The smell of ships (that earnest of romance),
58. A sense of space and water, and thereby
59. A lamplit bridge ouching the troubled sky,
60. And look, O, look! a tangle of silver gleams
61. And dusky lights, our River and all his dreams,
62. His dreams that never save in our deaths can die.

63. What miracle is happening in the air,
64. Charging the very texture of the gray
65. With something luminous and rare?
66. The night goes out like an ill-parcelled fire,
67. And, as one lights a candle, it is day.
68. The extinguisher, that perks it like a spire
69. On the little formal church, is not yet green
70. Across the water: but the house-tops nigher,
71. The corner-lines, the chimneys--look how clean,
72. How new, how naked! See the batch of boats,
73. Here at the stairs, washed in the fresh-sprung beam!
74. And those are barges that were goblin floats,
75. Black, hag-steered, fraught with devilry and dream!
76. And in the piles the water frolics clear,
77. The ripples into loose rings wander and flee,
78. And we--we can behold that could but hear
79. The ancient River singing as he goes,
80. New-mailed in morning, to the ancient Sea.
81. The gas burns lank and jaded in its glass:
82. The old Ruffian soon shall yawn himself awake,
83. And light his pipe, and shoulder his tools, and take
84. His hobnailed way to work!

85. Let us too pass -
86. Pass ere the sun leaps and your shadow shows -
87. Through these long, blindfold rows
88. Of casements staring blind to right and left,
89. Each with his gaze turned inward on some piece
90. Of life in death's own likeness--Life bereft
91. Of living looks as by the Great Release -
92. Pass to an exquisite night's more exquisite close!

93. Reach upon reach of burial--so they feel,
94. These colonies of dreams! And as we steal
95. Homeward together, but for the buxom breeze,
96. Fitfully frolicking to heel
97. With news of dawn-drenched woods and tumbling seas,
98. We might--thus awed, thus lonely that we are -
99. Be wandering some dispeopled star,
100. Some world of memories and unbroken graves,
101. So broods the abounding Silence near and far:
102. Till even your footfall craves
103. Forgiveness of the majesty it braves.
