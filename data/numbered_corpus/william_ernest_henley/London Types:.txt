1. Time, the old humourist, has a trick to-day
2. Of moving landmarks and of levelling down,
3. Till into Town the Suburbs edge their way,
4. And in the Suburbs you may scent the Town.
5. With Mount Street thus approaching Muswell Hill,

7. You get a Hammersmith that fills the bill,
8. A Hampstead with a serious sense of style.
9. So this fair creature, pictured in The Row,
10. As one of that 'gay adulterous world,' whose round
11. Is by the Serpentine, as well would show,
12. And might, I deem, as readily be found
13. On Streatham's Hill, or Wimbledon's, or where
14. Brixtonian kitchens lard the late-dining air.
