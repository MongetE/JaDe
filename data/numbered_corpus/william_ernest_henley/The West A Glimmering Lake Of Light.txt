1. The West a glimmering lake of light,
2. A dream of pearly weather,
3. The first of stars is burning white -
4. The star we watch together.
5. Is April dead? The unresting year
6. Will shape us our September,
7. And April's work is done, my dear -
8. Do you not remember?

9. O gracious eve! O happy star,
10. Still-flashing, glowing, sinking! -
11. Who lives of lovers near or far
12. So glad as I in thinking?
13. The gallant world is warm and green,
14. For May fulfils November.
15. When lights and leaves and loves have been,
16. Sweet, will you remember?

17. O star benignant and serene,
18. I take the good to-morrow,
19. That fills from verge to verge my dream,
20. With all its joy and sorrow!
21. The old, sweet spell is unforgot
22. That turns to June December;
23. And, tho' the world remembered not,
24. Love, we would remember.
