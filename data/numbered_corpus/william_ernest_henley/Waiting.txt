1. A square, squat room (a cellar on promotion),
2. Drab to the soul, drab to the very daylight;
3. Plasters astray in unnatural-looking tinware;
4. Scissors and lint and apothecary's jars.

5. Here, on a bench a skeleton would writhe from,
6. Angry and sore, I wait to be admitted:
7. Wait till my heart is lead upon my stomach,
8. While at their ease two dressers do their chores.

9. One has a probe-it feels to me a crowbar.
10. A small boy sniffs and shudders after bluestone.
11. A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers.
12. Life is (I think) a blunder and a shame.
