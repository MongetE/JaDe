1. The sands are alive with sunshine,
2. The bathers lounge and throng,
3. And out in the bay a bugle
4. Is lilting a gallant song.

5. The clouds go racing eastward,
6. The blithe wind cannot rest,
7. And a shard on the shingle flashes
8. Like the shining soul of a jest;

9. While children romp in the surges,
10. And sweethearts wander free,
11. And the Firth as with laughter dimples . . .
12. I would it were deep over me!
