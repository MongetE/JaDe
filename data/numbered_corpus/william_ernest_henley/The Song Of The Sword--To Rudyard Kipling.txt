1. The Sword
2. Singing -
3. The voice of the Sword from the heart of the Sword
4. Clanging imperious
5. Forth from Time's battlements
6. His ancient and triumphing Song.

7. In the beginning,
8. Ere God inspired Himself
9. Into the clay thing
10. Thumbed to His image,
11. The vacant, the naked shell
12. Soon to be Man:
13. Thoughtful He pondered it,
14. Prone there and impotent,
15. Fragile, inviting
16. Attack and discomfiture;
17. Then, with a smile -
18. As He heard in the Thunder
19. That laughed over Eden
20. The voice of the Trumpet,
21. The iron Beneficence,
22. Calling his dooms
23. To the Winds of the world -
24. Stooping, He drew
25. On the sand with His finger
26. A shape for a sign
27. Of his way to the eyes
28. That in wonder should waken,
29. For a proof of His will
30. To the breaking intelligence.
31. That was the birth of me:
32. I am the Sword.

33. Bleak and lean, grey and cruel,
34. Short-hilted, long shafted,
35. I froze into steel;
36. And the blood of my elder,
37. His hand on the hafts of me,
38. Sprang like a wave
39. In the wind, as the sense
40. Of his strength grew to ecstasy;
41. Glowed like a coal
42. In the throat of the furnace;
43. As he knew me and named me
44. The War-Thing, the Comrade,
45. Father of honour
46. And giver of kingship,
47. The fame-smith, the song-master,
48. Bringer of women
49. On fire at his hands
50. For the pride of fulfilment,
51. PRIEST (saith the Lord)
52. OF HIS MARRIAGE WITH VICTORY
53. Ho! then, the Trumpet,
54. Handmaid of heroes,
55. Calling the peers
56. To the place of espousals!
57. Ho! then, the splendour
58. And glare of my ministry,
59. Clothing the earth
60. With a livery of lightnings!
61. Ho! then, the music
62. Of battles in onset,
63. And ruining armours,
64. And God's gift returning
65. In fury to God!
66. Thrilling and keen
67. As the song of the winter stars,
68. Ho! then, the sound
69. Of my voice, the implacable
70. Angel of Destiny! -
71. I am the Sword.

72. Heroes, my children,
73. Follow, O, follow me!
74. Follow, exulting
75. In the great light that breaks
76. From the sacred Companionship!
77. Thrust through the fatuous,
78. Thrust through the fungous brood,
79. Spawned in my shadow
80. And gross with my gift!
81. Thrust through, and hearken
82. O, hark, to the Trumpet,
83. The Virgin of Battles,
84. Calling, still calling you
85. Into the Presence,
86. Sons of the Judgment,
87. Pure wafts of the Will!
88. Edged to annihilate,
89. Hilted with government,
90. Follow, O, follow me,
91. Till the waste places
92. All the grey globe over
93. Ooze, as the honeycomb
94. Drips, with the sweetness
95. Distilled of my strength,
96. And, teeming in peace
97. Through the wrath of my coming,
98. They give back in beauty
99. The dread and the anguish
100. They had of me visitant!
101. Follow, O follow, then,
102. Heroes, my harvesters!
103. Where the tall grain is ripe
104. Thrust in your sickles!
105. Stripped and adust
106. In a stubble of empire,
107. Scything and binding
108. The full sheaves of sovranty:
109. Thus, O, thus gloriously,
110. Shall you fulfil yourselves!
111. Thus, O, thus mightily,
112. Show yourselves sons of mine -
113. Yea, and win grace of me:
114. I am the Sword!

115. I am the feast-maker:
116. Hark, through a noise
117. Of the screaming of eagles,
118. Hark how the Trumpet,
119. The mistress of mistresses,
120. Calls, silver-throated
121. And stern, where the tables
122. Are spread, and the meal
123. Of the Lord is in hand!
124. Driving the darkness,
125. Even as the banners
126. And spears of the Morning;
127. Sifting the nations,
128. The slag from the metal,
129. The waste and the weak
130. From the fit and the strong;
131. Fighting the brute,
132. The abysmal Fecundity;
133. Checking the gross,
134. Multitudinous blunders,
135. The groping, the purblind
136. Excesses in service
137. Of the Womb universal,
138. The absolute drudge;
139. Firing the charactry
140. Carved on the World,
141. The miraculous gem
142. In the seal-ring that burns
143. On the hand of the Master -
144. Yea! and authority
145. Flames through the dim,
146. Unappeasable Grisliness
147. Prone down the nethermost
148. Chasms of the Void! -
149. Clear singing, clean slicing;
150. Sweet spoken, soft finishing;
151. Making death beautiful,
152. Life but a coin
153. To be staked in the pastime
154. Whose playing is more
155. Than the transfer of being;
156. Arch-anarch, chief builder,
157. Prince and evangelist,
158. I am the Will of God:
159. I am the Sword.

160. The Sword
161. Singing -
162. The voice of the Sword from the heart of the Sword
163. Clanging majestical,
164. As from the starry-staired
165. Courts of the primal Supremacy,
166. His high, irresistible song.
