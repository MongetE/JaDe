1. Hist? . . .
2. Through the corridor's echoes,
3. Louder and nearer
4. Comes a great shuffling of feet.
5. Quick, every one of you,
6. Strighten your quilts, and be decent!
7. Here's the Professor.

8. In he comes first
9. With the bright look we know,
10. From the broad, white brows the kind eyes
11. Soothing yet nerving you. Here at his elbow,
12. White-capped, white-aproned, the Nurse,
13. Towel on arm and her inkstand
14. Fretful with quills.
15. Here in the ruck, anyhow,
16. Surging along,
17. Louts, duffers, exquisites, students, and prigs -
18. Whiskers and foreheads, scarf-pins and spectacles -
19. Hustles the Class! And they ring themselves
20. Round the first bed, where the Chief
21. (His dressers and clerks at attention),
22. Bends in inspection already.

23. So shows the ring
24. Seen from behind round a conjurer
25. Doing his pitch in the street.
26. High shoulders, low shoulders, broad shoulders, narrow ones,
27. Round, square, and angular, serry and shove;
28. While from within a voice,
29. Gravely and weightily fluent,
30. Sounds; and then ceases; and suddenly
31. (Look at the stress of the shoulders!)
32. Out of a quiver of silence,
33. Over the hiss of the spray,
34. Comes a low cry, and the sound
35. Of breath quick intaken through teeth
36. Clenched in resolve. And the Master
37. Breaks from the crowd, and goes,
38. Wiping his hands,
39. To the next bed, with his pupils
40. Flocking and whispering behind him.

41. Now one can see.
42. Case Number One
43. Sits (rather pale) with his bedclothes
44. Stripped up, and showing his foot
45. (Alas for God's Image!)
46. Swaddled in wet, white lint
47. Brilliantly hideous with red.
