1. O, the fun, the fun and frolic
2. That The Wind that Shakes the Barley
3. Scatters through a penny-whistle
4. Tickled with artistic fingers!

5. Kate the scrubber (forty summers,
6. Stout but sportive) treads a measure,
7. Grinning, in herself a ballet,
8. Fixed as fate upon her audience.

9. Stumps are shaking, crutch-supported;
10. Splinted fingers tap the rhythm;
11. And a head all helmed with plasters
12. Wags a measured approbation.

13. Of their mattress-life oblivious,
14. All the patients, brisk and cheerful,
15. Are encouraging the dancer,
16. And applauding the musician.

17. Dim the gas-lights in the output
18. Of so many ardent smokers,
19. Full of shadow lurch the corners,
20. And the doctor peeps and passes.

21. There are, maybe, some suspicions
22. Of an alcoholic presence . . .
23. 'Tak' a sup of this, my wumman!' . . .
24. New Year comes but once a twelvemonth.
