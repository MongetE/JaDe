1. What is to come we know not. But we know
2. That what has been was good--was good to show,
3. Better to hide, and best of all to bear.
4. We are the masters of the days that were:
5. We have lived, we have loved, we have suffered . . . even so.

6. Shall we not take the ebb who had the flow?
7. Life was our friend. Now, if it be our foe -
8. Dear, though it spoil and break us!--need we care
9. What is to come?

10. Let the great winds their worst and wildest blow,
11. Or the gold weather round us mellow slow:
12. We have fulfilled ourselves, and we can dare
13. And we can conquer, though we may not share
14. In the rich quiet of the afterglow
15. What is to come.
