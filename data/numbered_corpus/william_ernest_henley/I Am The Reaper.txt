1. I am the Reaper.
2. All things with heedful hook
3. Silent I gather.
4. Pale roses touched with the spring,
5. Tall corn in summer,
6. Fruits rich with autumn, and frail winter blossoms—
7. Reaping, still reaping—
8. All things with heedful hook
9. Timely I gather.

10. I am the Sower.
11. All the unbodied life
12. Runs through my seed-sheet.
13. Atom with atom wed,
14. Each quickening the other,
15. Fall through my hands, ever changing, still changeless.
16. Ceaselessly sowing,
17. Life, incorruptible life,
18. Flows from my seed-sheet.

19. Maker and breaker,
20. I am the ebb and the flood,
21. Here and Hereafter,
22. Sped through the tangle and coil
23. Of infinite nature,
24. Viewless and soundless I fashion all being.
25. Taker and giver,
26. I am the womb and the grave,
27. The Now and the Ever
