1. Something is dead . . .
2. The grace of sunset solitudes, the march
3. Of the solitary moon, the pomp and power
4. Of round on round of shining soldier-stars
5. Patrolling space, the bounties of the sun -
6. Sovran, tremendous, unimaginable -
7. The multitudinous friendliness of the sea,
8. Possess no more--no more.

9. Something is dead . . .
10. The Autumn rain-rot deeper and wider soaks
11. And spreads, the burden of Winter heavier weighs,
12. His melancholy close and closer yet
13. Cleaves, and those incantations of the Spring
14. That made the heart a centre of miracles
15. Grow formal, and the wonder-working bours
16. Arise no more--no more.

17. Something is dead . . .
18. 'Tis time to creep in close about the fire
19. And tell grey tales of what we were, and dream
20. Old dreams and faded, and as we may rejoice
21. In the young life that round us leaps and laughs,
22. A fountain in the sunshine, in the pride
23. Of God's best gift that to us twain returns,
24. Dear Heart, no more--no more.
