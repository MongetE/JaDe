1. You are carried in a basket,
2. Like a carcase from the shambles,
3. To the theatre, a cockpit
4. Where they stretch you on a table.

5. Then they bid you close your eyelids,
6. And they mask you with a napkin,
7. And the anaesthetic reaches
8. Hot and subtle through your being.

9. And you gasp and reel and shudder
10. In a rushing, swaying rapture,
11. While the voices at your elbow
12. Fade-receding-fainter-farther.

13. Li ghts about you shower and tumble,
14. And your blood seems crystallising -
15. Edged and vibrant, yet within you
16. Racked and hurried back and forward.

17. Then the lights grow fast and furious,
18. And you hear a noise of waters,
19. And you wrestle, blind and dizzy,
20. In an agony of effort,

21. Till a sudden lull accepts you,
22. And you sound an utter darkness . . .
23. And awaken . . . with a struggle . . .
24. On a hushed, attentive audience.
