12. England, my England,
13. Match the master-work you've done,

21. Ever the faith endures,
22. England, my England:-
23. 'Take and break us: we are yours,
24. 'England, my own!
25. 'Life is good, and joy runs high
26. 'Between English earth and sky:
27. 'Death is death; but we shall die
28. 'To the Song on your bugles blown,
29. 'England -

36. Of such teeming destinies
37. You could know nor dread nor ease
38. Were the Song on your bugles blown,
39. England,
40. Round the Pit on your bugles blown!

41. Mother of Ships whose might,
42. England, my England,
43. Is the fierce old Sea's delight,
44. England, my own,
45. Chosen daughter of the Lord,
46. Spouse-in-Chief of the ancient sword,
