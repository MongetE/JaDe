1. From brief delights that rise to me
2. Out of unfathomable dole,
3. I thank whatever gods there be
4. For mine unconquerable soul.
5. In the strong clutch of Circumstance
6. It has not winced, nor groaned aloud.
7. Before the blows of eyeless chance
8. My head is bloody, but unbowed.
9. I front unfeared the threat of space
10. And dwindle into dark again.
11. My work is done, I take my place
12. Among the years that wait for men.
13. My life, my broken life must be
14. One unsuccourable dole.
15. I thank the gods- they gave to me
16. A dauntless and defiant soul.
