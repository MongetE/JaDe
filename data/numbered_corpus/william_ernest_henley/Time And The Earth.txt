1. Time and the Earth -
2. The old Father and Mother -
3. Their teeming accomplished,
4. Their purpose fulfilled,
5. Close with a smile
6. For a moment of kindness,
7. Ere for the winter
8. They settle to sleep.

9. Failing yet gracious,
10. Slow pacing, soon homing,
11. A patriarch that strolls
12. Through the tents of his children,
13. The Sun, as he journeys
14. His round on the lower
15. Ascents of the blue,
16. Washes the roofs
17. And the hillsides with clarity;
18. Charms the dark pools
19. Till they break into pictures;
20. Scatters magnificent
21. Alms to the beggar trees;
22. Touches the mist-folk,
23. That crowd to his escort,
24. Into translucencies
25. Radiant and ravishing:
26. As with the visible
27. Spirit of Summer
28. Gloriously vaporised,
29. Visioned in gold!

30. Love, though the fallen leaf
31. Mark, and the fleeting light
32. And the loud, loitering
33. Footfall of darkness
34. Sign to the heart
35. Of the passage of destiny,
36. Here is the ghost
37. Of a summer that lived for us,
38. Here is a promise
39. Of summers to be.
