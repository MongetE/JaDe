1. On the way to Kew,
2. By the river old and gray,
3. Where in the Long Ago,
4. We laughed and loitered so,
5. I met a ghost to-day,
6. A ghost that told of you –
7. A ghost of old replies
8. And sweet, inscrutable eyes
9. Coming up from Richmond
10. As you used to do.

11. By the river old and gray,
12. The enchanted Long Ago
13. Murmured and smiled anew.
14. On the way to Kew,
15. March had the laugh of May,
16. The bare boughs looked aglow,
17. And old immortal words
18. Sang in my breast like birds,
19. Coming up from Richmond
20. As I used with you.

21. With the life of Long Ago
22. Lived my thought of you.
23. By the river old and gray
24. Flowing his appointed way
25. As I watched I knew
26. What is good to know –
27. Not in vain, not in vain,
28. Shall I look for you again
29. Coming up from Richmond
30. On the way to Kew.
