1. When you wake in your crib,
2. You, an inch of experience -
3. Vaulted about
4. With the wonder of darkness;
5. Wailing and striving
6. To reach from your feebleness
7. Something you feel
8. Will be good to and cherish you,
9. Something you know
10. And can rest upon blindly:
11. O, then a hand
12. (Your mother's, your mother's!)
13. By the fall of its fingers
14. All knowledge, all power to you,
15. Out of the dreary,
16. Discouraging strangenesses
17. Comes to and masters you,
18. Takes you, and lovingly
19. Woos you and soothes you
20. Back, as you cling to it,
21. Back to some comforting
22. Corner of sleep.

23. So you wake in your bed,
24. Having lived, having loved;
25. But the shadows are there,
26. And the world and its kingdoms
27. Incredibly faded;
28. And you group through the Terror
29. Above you and under
30. For the light, for the warmth,
31. The assurance of life;
32. But the blasts are ice-born,
33. And your heart is nigh burst
34. With the weight of the gloom
35. And the stress of your strangled
36. And desperate endeavour:
37. Sudden a hand -
38. Mother, O Mother! -
39. God at His best to you,
40. Out of the roaring,
41. Impossible silences,
42. Falls on and urges you,
43. Mightily, tenderly,
44. Forth, as you clutch at it,
45. Forth to the infinite
46. Peace of the Grave.
