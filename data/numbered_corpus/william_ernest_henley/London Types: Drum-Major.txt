1. Who says Drum-Major says a man of mould,
2. Shaking the meek earth with tremendous tread,
3. And pacing still, a triumph to behold,
4. Of his own spine at least two yards ahead!
5. Attorney, grocer, surgeon, broker, duke-
6. His calling may be anything, who comes
7. Into a room, his presence a rebuke
8. To the dejected, as the pipes and drums
9. Inspired his port!-who mounts his office stairs
10. As though he led great armies to the fight!
11. His bulk itself's pure genius, and he wears
12. His avoirdupois with so much fire and spright
13. That, though the creature stands but five feet five,
14. You take him for the tallest He alive.
