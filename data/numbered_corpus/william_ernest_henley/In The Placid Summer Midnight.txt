1. In the placid summer midnight,
2. Under the drowsy sky,
3. I seem to hear in the stillness
4. The moths go glimmering by.

5. One by one from the windows
6. The lights have all been sped.
7. Never a blind looks conscious -
8. The street is asleep in bed!

9. But I come where a living casement
10. Laughs luminous and wide;
11. I hear the song of a piano
12. Break in a sparkling tide;

13. And I feel, in the waltz that frolics
14. And warbles swift and clear,
15. A sudden sense of shelter
16. And friendliness and cheer . . .

17. A sense of tinkling glasses,
18. Of love and laughter and light -
19. The piano stops, and the window
20. Stares blank out into the night.

21. The blind goes out, and I wander
22. To the old, unfriendly sea,
23. The lonelier for the memory
24. That walks like a ghost with me.
