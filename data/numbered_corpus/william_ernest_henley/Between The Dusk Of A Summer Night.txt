1. Between the dusk of a summer night
2. And the dawn of a summer day,
3. We caught at a mood as it passed in flight,
4. And we bade it stoop and stay.
5. And what with the dawn of night began
6. With the dusk of day was done;
7. For that is the way of woman and man,
8. When a hazard has made them one.
9. Arc upon arc, from shade to shine,
10. The World went thundering free;
11. And what was his errand but hers and mine --
12. The lords of him, I and she?
13. O, it's die we must, but it's live we can,
14. And the marvel of earth and sun
15. Is all for the joy of woman and man
16. And the longing that makes them one.
