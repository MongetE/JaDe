1. Was I a Samurai renowned,
2. Two-sworded, fierce, immense of bow?
3. A histrion angular and profound?
4. A priest? a porter?--Child, although
5. I have forgotten clean, I know
6. That in the shade of Fujisan,
7. What time the cherry-orchards blow,
8. I loved you once in old Japan.

9. As here you loiter, flowing-gowned
10. And hugely sashed, with pins a-row
11. Your quaint head as with flamelets crowned,
12. Demure, inviting--even so,
13. When merry maids in Miyako
14. To feel the sweet o' the year began,
15. And green gardens to overflow,
16. I loved you once in old Japan.

17. Clear shine the hills; the rice-fields round
18. Two cranes are circling; sleepy and slow,
19. A blue canal the lake's blue bound
20. Breaks at the bamboo bridge; and lo!
21. Touched with the sundown's spirit and glow,
22. I see you turn, with flirted fan,
23. Against the plum-tree's bloomy snow . . .
24. I loved you once in old Japan!

25. Envoy

26. Dear, 'twas a dozen lives ago;
27. But that I was a lucky man
28. The Toyokuni here will show:
29. I loved you--once--in old Japan.
