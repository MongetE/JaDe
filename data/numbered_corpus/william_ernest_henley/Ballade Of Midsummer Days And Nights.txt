1. With a ripple of leaves and a tinkle of streams
2. The full world rolls in a rhythm of praise,
3. And the winds are one with the clouds and beams -
4. Midsummer days! Midsummer days!
5. The dusk grows vast; in a purple haze,
6. While the West from a rapture of sunset rights,
7. Faint stars their exquisite lamps upraise -
8. Midsummer nights! O midsummer nights!
9. The wood's green heart is a nest of dreams,
10. The lush grass thickens and springs and sways,
11. The rathe wheat rustles, the landscape gleams -
12. Midsummer days! Midsummer days!
13. In the stilly fields, in the stilly ways,
14. All secret shadows and mystic lights,
15. Late lovers murmur and linger and gaze -
16. Midsummer nights! O midsummer nights!
17. There's a music of bells from the trampling teams,
18. Wild skylarks hover, the gorses blaze,
19. The rich, ripe rose as with incense steams -
20. Midsummer days! Midsummer days!
21. A soul from the honeysuckle strays,
22. And the nightingale as from prophet heights
23. Sings to the Earth of her million Mays -
24. Midsummer nights! O midsummer nights!
25. Envoy

26. And it's O, for my dear and the charm that stays -
27. Midsummer days! Midsummer days!
28. It's O, for my Love and the dark that plights -
29. Midsummer nights! O midsummer nights!
