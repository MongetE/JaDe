1. Down the quiet eve,
2. Thro' my window with the sunset
3. Pipes to me a distant organ
4. Foolish ditties;

5. And, as when you change
6. Pictures in a magic lantern,
7. Books, beds, bottles, floor, and ceiling
8. Fade and vanish,

9. And I'm well once more . . .
10. August flares adust and torrid,
11. But my heart is full of April
12. Sap and sweetness.

13. In the quiet eve
14. I am loitering, longing, dreaming . . .
15. Dreaming, and a distant organ
16. Pipes me ditties.

17. I can see the shop,
18. I can smell the sprinkled pavement,
19. Where she serves-her chestnut chignon
20. Thrills my senses!

21. O, the sight and scent,
22. Wistful eve and perfumed pavement!
23. In the distance pipes an organ . . .
24. The sensation

25. Comes to me anew,
26. And my spirit for a moment
27. Thro' the music breathes the blessed
28. Airs of London.
