1. The skies are strown with stars,
2. The streets are fresh with dew
3. A thin moon drifts to westward,
4. The night is hushed and cheerful.
5. My thought is quick with you.

6. Near windows gleam and laugh,
7. And far away a train
8. Clanks glowing through the stillness:
9. A great content's in all things,
10. And life is not in vain.
