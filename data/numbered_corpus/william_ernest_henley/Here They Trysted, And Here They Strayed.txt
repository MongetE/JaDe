1. Here they trysted, here they strayed,
2. In the leafage dewy and boon,
3. Many a man and many a maid,
4. And the morn was merry June.
5. 'Death is fleet, Life is sweet,'
6. Sang the blackbird in the may;
7. And the hour with flying feet,
8. While they dreamed, was yesterday.

9. Many a maid and many a man
10. Found the leafage close and boon;
11. Many a destiny began -
12. O, the morn was merry June!
13. Dead and gone, dead and gone,
14. (Hark the blackbird in the may!),
15. Life and Death went hurrying on,
16. Cheek on cheek--and where were they?

17. Dust on dust engendering dust
18. In the leafage fresh and boon,
19. Man and maid fulfil their trust -
20. Still the morn turns merry June.
21. Mother Life, Father Death
22. (O, the blackbird in the may!),
23. Each the other's breath for breath,
24. Fleet the times of the world away.
