1. The shadow of Dawn;
2. Stillness and stars and over-mastering dreams
3. Of Life and Death and Sleep;
4. Heard over gleaming flats, the old, unchanging sound
5. Of the old, unchanging Sea.

6. My soul and yours -
7. O, hand in hand let us fare forth, two ghosts,
8. Into the ghostliness,
9. The infinite and abounding solitudes,
10. Beyond--O, beyond!--beyond . . .

11. Here in the porch
12. Upon the multitudinous silences
13. Of the kingdoms of the grave,
14. We twain are you and I--two ghosts Omnipotence
15. Can touch no more . . . no more!
