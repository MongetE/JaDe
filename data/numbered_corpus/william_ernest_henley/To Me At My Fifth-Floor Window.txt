1. To me at my fifth-floor window
2. The chimney-pots in rows
3. Are sets of pipes pandean
4. For every wind that blows;

5. And the smoke that whirls and eddies
6. In a thousand times and keys
7. Is really a visible music
8. Set to my reveries.

9. O monstrous pipes, melodious
10. With fitful tune and dream,
11. The clouds are your only audience,
12. Her thought is your only theme!
