1. Joy of the Milliner, Envy of the Line,
2. Star of the Parks, jack-booted, sworded, helmed,
3. He sits between his holsters, solid of spine;
4. Nor, as it seems, though Westminster were whelmed,
5. With the great globe, in earthquake and eclipse,
6. Would he and his charger cease from mounting guard,
7. This Private in the Blues, nor would his lips
8. Move, though his gorge with throttled oaths were charred!
9. He wears his inches weightily, as he wears
10. His old-world armours; and with his port and pride,
11. His sturdy graces and enormous airs,
12. He towers, in speech his Colonel countrified,
13. A triumph, waxing statelier year by year,
14. Of British blood, and bone, and beef, and beer.
