1. From the brake the Nightingale
2. Sings exulting to the Rose;
3. Though he sees her waxing pale
4. In her passionate repose,
5. While she triumphs waxing frail,
6. Fading even while she glows;
7. Though he knows
8. How it goes -
9. Knows of last year's Nightingale
10. Dead with last year's Rose.

11. Wise the enamoured Nightingale,
12. Wise the well-beloved Rose!
13. Love and life shall still prevail,
14. Nor the silence at the close
15. Break the magic of the tale
16. In the telling, though it shows -
17. Who but knows
18. How it goes! -
19. Life a last year's Nightingale,
20. Love a last year's Rose.
