1. There's a regret
2. So grinding, so immitigably sad,
3. Remorse thereby feels tolerant, even glad. ...
4. Do you not know it yet?

5. For deeds undone
6. Rnakle and snarl and hunger for their due,
7. Till there seems naught so despicable as you
8. In all the grin o' the sun.

9. Like an old shoe
10. The sea spurns and the land abhors, you lie
11. About the beach of Time, till by and by
12. Death, that derides you too --

13. Death, as he goes
14. His ragman's round, espies you, where you stray,
15. With half-an-eye, and kicks you out of his way
16. And then -- and then, who knows

17. But the kind Grave
18. Turns on you, and you feel the convict Worm,
19. In that black bridewell working out his term,
20. Hanker and grope and crave?

21. "Poor fool that might --
22. That might, yet would not, dared not, let this be,
23. Think of it, here and thus made over to me
24. In the implacable night!"

25. And writhing, fain
26. And like a triumphing lover, he shall take,
27. His fill where no high memory lives to make
28. His obscene victory vain.
