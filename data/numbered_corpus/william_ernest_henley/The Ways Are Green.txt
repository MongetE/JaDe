1. The ways are green with the gladdening sheen
2. Of the young year's fairest daughter.
3. O, the shadows that fleet o'er the springing wheat!
4. O, the magic of running water!
5. The spirit of spring is in every thing,
6. The banners of spring are streaming,
7. We march to a tune from the fifes of June,
8. And life's a dream worth dreaming.

9. It's all very well to sit and spell
10. At the lesson there's no gainsaying;
11. But what the deuce are wont and use
12. When the whole mad world's a-maying?
13. When the meadow glows, and the orchard snows,
14. And the air's with love-motes teeming,
15. When fancies break, and the senses wake,
16. O, life's a dream worth dreaming!

17. What Nature has writ with her lusty wit
18. Is worded so wisely and kindly
19. That whoever has dipped in her manuscript
20. Must up and follow her blindly.
21. Now the summer prime is her blithest rhyme
22. In the being and the seeming,
23. And they that have heard the overword
24. Know life's a dream worth dreaming.
