1. She's tall and gaunt, and in her hard, sad face
2. With flashes of the old fun's animation
3. There lowers the fixed and peevish resignation
4. Bred of a past where troubles came apace.
5. She tells me that her husband, ere he died,
6. Saw seven of their children pass away,
7. And never knew the little lass at play
8. Out on the green, in whom he's deified.
9. Her kin dispersed, her friends forgot and gone,
10. All simple faith her honest Irish mind,
11. Scolding her spoiled young saint, she labours on:
12. Telling her dreams, taking her patients' part,
13. Trailing her coat sometimes: and you shall find
14. No rougher, quainter speech, nor kinder heart.
