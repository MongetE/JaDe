1. Your heart has trembled to my tongue,
2. Your hands in mine have lain,
3. Your thought to me has leaned and clung,
4. Again and yet again,
5. My dear,
6. Again and yet again.

7. Now die the dream, or come the wife,
8. The past is not in vain,
9. For wholly as it was your life
10. Can never be again,
11. My dear,
12. Can never be again.
