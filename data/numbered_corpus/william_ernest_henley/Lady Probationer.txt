1. Some three, or five, or seven, and thirty years;
2. A Roman nose; a dimpling double-chin;
3. Dark eyes and shy that, ignorant of sin,
4. Are yet acquainted, it would seem, with tears;
5. A comely shape; a slim, high-coloured hand,
6. Graced, rather oddly, with a signet ring;
7. A bashful air, becoming everything;
8. A well-bred silence always at command.
9. Her plain print gown, prim cap, and bright steel chain
10. Look out of place on her, and I remain
11. Absorbed in her, as in a pleasant mystery.
12. Quick, skilful, quiet, soft in speech and touch . . .
13. 'Do you like nursing?' 'Yes, Sir, very much.'
14. Somehow, I rather think she has a history.
