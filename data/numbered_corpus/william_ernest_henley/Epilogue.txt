1. These, to you now, O, more than ever now -
2. Now that the Ancient Enemy
3. Has passed, and we, we two that are one, have seen
4. A piece of perfect Life
5. Turn to so ravishing a shape of Death
6. The Arch-Discomforter might well have smiled
7. In pity and pride,
8. Even as he bore his lovely and innocent spoil
9. From those home-kingdoms he left desolate!

10. Poor windlestraws
11. On the great, sullen, roaring pool of Time
12. And Chance and Change, I know!
13. But they are yours, as I am, till we attain
14. That end for which me make, we two that are one:
15. A little, exquisite Ghost
16. Between us, smiling with the serenest eyes
17. Seen in this world, and calling, calling still
18. In that clear voice whose infinite subtleties
19. Of sweetness, thrilling back across the grave,
20. Break the poor heart to hear: -
21. 'Come, Dadsie, come!
22. Mama, how long--how long!'
