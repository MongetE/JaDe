1. WITH strawberries we filled a tray,
2. And then we drove away, away
3. Along the links beside the sea,
4. Where wave and wind were light and free,
5. And August felt as fresh as May.
6. And where the springy turf was gay
7. With thyme and balm and many a spray
8. Of wild roses, you tempted me
9. With strawberries.
10. A shadowy sail, silent and gray,
11. Stole like a ghost across the bay;
12. But none could hear me ask my fee,
13. And none could know what came to be.
14. Can sweethearts all their thirst allay
15. With strawberries?
