1. O, Time and Change, they range and range
2. From sunshine round to thunder! -
3. They glance and go as the great winds blow,
4. And the best of our dreams drive under:
5. For Time and Change estrange, estrange -
6. And, now they have looked and seen us,
7. O, we that were dear, we are all-too near
8. With the thick of the world between us.

9. O, Death and Time, they chime and chime
10. Like bells at sunset falling! -
11. They end the song, they right the wrong,
12. They set the old echoes calling:
13. For Death and Time bring on the prime
14. Of God's own chosen weather,
15. And we lie in the peace of the Great Release
16. As once in the grass together.
