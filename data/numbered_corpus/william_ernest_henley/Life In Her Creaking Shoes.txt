1. Life in her creaking shoes
2. Goes, and more formal grows,
3. A round of calls and cues:
4. Love blows as the wind blows.
5. Blows! . . . in the quiet close
6. As in the roaring mart,
7. By ways no mortal knows
8. Love blows into the heart.
9. The stars some cadence use,
10. Forthright the river flows,
11. In order fall the dews,
12. Love blows as the wind blows:
13. Blows! . . . and what reckoning shows
14. The courses of his chart?
15. A spirit that comes and goes,
16. Love blows into the heart.
