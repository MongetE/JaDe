1. Crosses and troubles a-many have proved me.
2. One or two women (God bless them) have loved me.
3. I have worked and dreamed, and I’ve talked at will.
4. Of art and drink I have had my fill.
5. I’ve comforted here, and I succoured there.
6. I’ve faced my foes, and I backed my friends.
7. I’ve blundered, and sometimes made amends.
8. I’ve prayed for light, and I’ve known despair.
9. Now I look before, as I look behind,
10. Come storm, come shine, whatever befall,
11. With a grateful heart and a constant mind,
12. For the end I know is the best of all.
