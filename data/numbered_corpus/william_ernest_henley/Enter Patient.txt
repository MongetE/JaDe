1. The morning mists still haunt the stony street;
2. The northern summer air is shrill and cold;
3. And lo, the Hospital, grey, quiet, old,
4. Where Life and Death like friendly chafferers meet.
5. Thro' the loud spaciousness and draughty gloom
6. A small, strange child-so aged yet so young! -
7. Her little arm besplinted and beslung,
8. Precedes me gravely to the waiting-room.
9. I limp behind, my confidence all gone.
10. The grey-haired soldier-porter waves me on,
11. And on I crawl, and still my spirits fail:
12. A tragic meanness seems so to environ
13. These corridors and stairs of stone and iron,
14. Cold, naked, clean-half-workhouse and half-jail.
