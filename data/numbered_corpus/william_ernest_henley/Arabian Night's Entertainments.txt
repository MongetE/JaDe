1. Once on a time
2. There was a little boy: a master-mage
3. By virtue of a Book
4. Of magic--O, so magical it filled
5. His life with visionary pomps
6. Processional! And Powers
7. Passed with him where he passed. And Thrones
8. And Dominations, glaived and plumed and mailed,
9. Thronged in the criss-cross streets,
10. The palaces pell-mell with playing-fields,
11. Domes, cloisters, dungeons, caverns, tents, arcades,
12. Of the unseen, silent City, in his soul
13. Pavilioned jealously, and hid
14. As in the dusk, profound,
15. Green stillnesses of some enchanted mere. -

16. I shut mine eyes . . . And lo!
17. A flickering snatch of memory that floats
18. Upon the face of a pool of darkness five
19. And thirty dead years deep,
20. Antic in girlish broideries
21. And skirts and silly shoes with straps
22. And a broad-ribanded leghorn, he walks
23. Plain in the shadow of a church
24. (St. Michael's: in whose brazen call
25. To curfew his first wails of wrath were whelmed),
26. Sedate for all his haste
27. To be at home; and, nestled in his arm,
28. Inciting still to quiet and solitude,
29. Boarded in sober drab,
30. With small, square, agitating cuts
31. Let in a-top of the double-columned, close,
32. Quakerlike print, a Book! . . .
33. What but that blessed brief
34. Of what is gallantest and best
35. In all the full-shelved Libraries of Romance?
36. The Book of rocs,
37. Sandalwood, ivory, turbans, ambergris,
38. Cream-tarts, and lettered apes, and calendars,
39. And ghouls, and genies--O, so huge
40. They might have overed the tall Minster Tower
41. Hands down, as schoolboys take a post!
42. In truth, the Book of Camaralzaman,
43. Schemselnihar and Sindbad, Scheherezade
44. The peerless, Bedreddin, Badroulbadour,
45. Cairo and Serendib and Candahar,
46. And Caspian, and the dim, terrific bulk -
47. Ice-ribbed, fiend-visited, isled in spells and storms -
48. Of Kaf! . . . That centre of miracles,
49. The sole, unparalleled Arabian Nights!

50. Old friends I had a-many--kindly and grim
51. Familiars, cronies quaint
52. And goblin! Never a Wood but housed
53. Some morrice of dainty dapperlings. No Brook
54. But had his nunnery
55. Of green-haired, silvry-curving sprites,
56. To cabin in his grots, and pace
57. His lilied margents. Every lone Hillside
58. Might open upon Elf-Land. Every Stalk
59. That curled about a Bean-stick was of the breed
60. Of that live ladder by whose delicate rungs
61. You climbed beyond the clouds, and found
62. The Farm-House where the Ogre, gorged
63. And drowsy, from his great oak chair,
64. Among the flitches and pewters at the fire,
65. Called for his Faery Harp. And in it flew,
66. And, perching on the kitchen table, sang
67. Jocund and jubilant, with a sound
68. Of those gay, golden-vowered madrigals
69. The shy thrush at mid-May
70. Flutes from wet orchards flushed with the triumphing dawn;
71. Or blackbirds rioting as they listened still,
72. In old-world woodlands rapt with an old-world spring,
73. For Pan's own whistle, savage and rich and lewd,
74. And mocked him call for call!

75. I could not pass
76. The half-door where the cobbler sat in view
77. Nor figure me the wizen Leprechaun,
78. In square-cut, faded reds and buckle-shoes,
79. Bent at his work in the hedge-side, and know
80. Just how he tapped his brogue, and twitched
81. His wax-end this and that way, both with wrists
82. And elbows. In the rich June fields,
83. Where the ripe clover drew the bees,
84. And the tall quakers trembled, and the West Wind
85. Lolled his half-holiday away
86. Beside me lolling and lounging through my own,
87. 'Twas good to follow the Miller's Youngest Son
88. On his white horse along the leafy lanes;
89. For at his stirrup linked and ran,
90. Not cynical and trapesing, as he loped
91. From wall to wall above the espaliers,
92. But in the bravest tops
93. That market-town, a town of tops, could show:
94. Bold, subtle, adventurous, his tail
95. A banner flaunted in disdain
96. Of human stratagems and shifts:
97. King over All the Catlands, present and past
98. And future, that moustached
99. Artificer of fortunes, Puss-in-Boots!
100. Or Bluebeard's Closet, with its plenishing
101. Of meat-hooks, sawdust, blood,
102. And wives that hung like fresh-dressed carcases -
103. Odd-fangled, most a butcher's, part
104. A faery chamber hazily seen
105. And hazily figured--on dark afternoons
106. And windy nights was visiting of the best.
107. Then, too, the pelt of hoofs
108. Out in the roaring darkness told
109. Of Herne the Hunter in his antlered helm
110. Galloping, as with despatches from the Pit,
111. Between his hell-born Hounds.
112. And Rip Van Winkle . . . often I lurked to hear,
113. Outside the long, low timbered, tarry wall,
114. The mutter and rumble of the trolling bowls
115. Down the lean plank, before they fluttered the pins;
116. For, listening, I could help him play
117. His wonderful game,
118. In those blue, booming hills, with Mariners
119. Refreshed from kegs not coopered in this our world.

120. But what were these so near,
121. So neighbourly fancies to the spell that brought
122. The run of Ali Baba's Cave
123. Just for the saying 'Open Sesame,'
124. With gold to measure, peck by peck,
125. In round, brown wooden stoups
126. You borrowed at the chandler's? . . . Or one time
127. Made you Aladdin's friend at school,
128. Free of his Garden of Jewels, Ring and Lamp
129. In perfect trim? . . . Or Ladies, fair
130. For all the embrowning scars in their white breasts
131. Went labouring under some dread ordinance,
132. Which made them whip, and bitterly cry the while,
133. Strange Curs that cried as they,
134. Till there was never a Black Bitch of all
135. Your consorting but might have gone
136. Spell-driven miserably for crimes
137. Done in the pride of womanhood and desire . . .
138. Or at the ghostliest altitudes of night,
139. While you lay wondering and acold,
140. Your sense was fearfully purged; and soon
141. Queen Labe, abominable and dear,
142. Rose from your side, opened the Box of Doom,
143. Scattered the yellow powder (which I saw
144. Like sulphur at the Docks in bulk),
145. And muttered certain words you could not hear;
146. And there! a living stream,
147. The brook you bathed in, with its weeds and flags
148. And cresses, glittered and sang
149. Out of the hearthrug over the nakedness,
150. Fair-scrubbed and decent, of your bedroom floor! . . .

151. I was--how many a time! -
152. That Second Calendar, Son of a King,
153. On whom 'twas vehemently enjoined,
154. Pausing at one mysterious door,
155. To pry no closer, but content his soul
156. With his kind Forty. Yet I could not rest
157. For idleness and ungovernable Fate.
158. And the Black Horse, which fed on sesame
159. (That wonder-working word!),
160. Vouchsafed his back to me, and spread his vans,
161. And soaring, soaring on
162. From air to air, came charging to the ground
163. Sheer, like a lark from the midsummer clouds,
164. And, shaking me out of the saddle, where I sprawled
165. Flicked at me with his tail,
166. And left me blinded, miserable, distraught
167. (Even as I was in deed,
168. When doctors came, and odious things were done
169. On my poor tortured eyes
170. With lancets; or some evil acid stung
171. And wrung them like hot sand,
172. And desperately from room to room
173. Fumble I must my dark, disconsolate way),
174. To get to Bagdad how I might. But there
175. I met with Merry Ladies. O you three -
176. Safie, Amine, Zobeide--when my heart
177. Forgets you all shall be forgot!
178. And so we supped, we and the rest,
179. On wine and roasted lamb, rose-water, dates,
180. Almonds, pistachios, citrons. And Haroun
181. Laughed out of his lordly beard
182. On Giaffar and Mesrour (I knew the Three
183. For all their Mossoul habits). And outside
184. The Tigris, flowing swift
185. Like Severn bend for bend, twinkled and gleamed
186. With broken and wavering shapes of stranger stars;
187. The vast, blue night
188. Was murmurous with peris' plumes
189. And the leathern wings of genies; words of power
190. Were whispering; and old fishermen,
191. Casting their nets with prayer, might draw to shore
192. Dead loveliness: or a prodigy in scales
193. Worth in the Caliph's Kitchen pieces of gold:
194. Or copper vessels, stopped with lead,
195. Wherein some Squire of Eblis watched and railed,
196. In durance under potent charactry
197. Graven by the seal of Solomon the King . . .

198. Then, as the Book was glassed
199. In Life as in some olden mirror's quaint,
200. Bewildering angles, so would Life
201. Flash light on light back on the Book; and both
202. Were changed. Once in a house decayed
203. From better days, harbouring an errant show
204. (For all its stories of dry-rot
205. Were filled with gruesome visitants in wax,
206. Inhuman, hushed, ghastly with Painted Eyes),
207. I wandered; and no living soul
208. Was nearer than the pay-box; and I stared
209. Upon them staring--staring. Till at last,
210. Three sets of rafters from the streets,
211. I strayed upon a mildewed, rat-run room,
212. With the two Dancers, horrible and obscene,
213. Guarding the door: and there, in a bedroom-set,
214. Behind a fence of faded crimson cords,
215. With an aspect of frills
216. And dimities and dishonoured privacy
217. That made you hanker and hesitate to look,
218. A Woman with her litter of Babes--all slain,
219. All in their nightgowns, all with Painted Eyes
220. Staring--still staring; so that I turned and ran
221. As for my neck, but in the street
222. Took breath. The same, it seemed,
223. And yet not all the same, I was to find,
224. As I went up! For afterwards,
225. Whenas I went my round alone -
226. All day alone--in long, stern, silent streets,
227. Where I might stretch my hand and take
228. Whatever I would: still there were Shapes of Stone,
229. Motionless, lifelike, frightening--for the Wrath
230. Had smitten them; but they watched,
231. This by her melons and figs, that by his rings
232. And chains and watches, with the hideous gaze,
233. The Painted Eyes insufferable,
234. Now, of those grisly images; and I
235. Pursued my best-beloved quest,
236. Thrilled with a novel and delicious fear.
237. So the night fell--with never a lamplighter;
238. And through the Palace of the King
239. I groped among the echoes, and I felt
240. That they were there,
241. Dreadfully there, the Painted staring Eyes,
242. Hall after hall . . . Till lo! from far
243. A Voice! And in a little while
244. Two tapers burning! And the Voice,
245. Heard in the wondrous Word of God, was--whose?
246. Whose but Zobeide's,
247. The lady of my heart, like me
248. A True Believer, and like me
249. An outcast thousands of leagues beyond the pale! . . .

250. Or, sailing to the Isles
251. Of Khaledan, I spied one evenfall
252. A black blotch in the sunset; and it grew
253. Swiftly . . . and grew. Tearing their beards,
254. The sailors wept and prayed; but the grave ship,
255. Deep laden with spiceries and pearls, went mad,
256. Wrenched the long tiller out of the steersman's hand,
257. And, turning broadside on,
258. As the most iron would, was haled and sucked
259. Nearer, and nearer yet;
260. And, all awash, with horrible lurching leaps
261. Rushed at that Portent, casting a shadow now
262. That swallowed sea and sky; and then,
263. Anchors and nails and bolts
264. Flew screaming out of her, and with clang on clang,
265. A noise of fifty stithies, caught at the sides
266. Of the Magnetic Mountain; and she lay,
267. A broken bundle of firewood, strown piecemeal
268. About the waters; and her crew
269. Passed shrieking, one by one; and I was left
270. To drown. All the long night I swam;
271. But in the morning, O, the smiling coast
272. Tufted with date-trees, meadowlike,
273. Skirted with shelving sands! And a great wave
274. Cast me ashore; and I was saved alive.
275. So, giving thanks to God, I dried my clothes,
276. And, faring inland, in a desert place
277. I stumbled on an iron ring -
278. The fellow of fifty built into the Quays:
279. When, scenting a trap-door,
280. I dug, and dug; until my biggest blade
281. Stuck into wood. And then,
282. The flight of smooth-hewn, easy-falling stairs,
283. Sunk in the naked rock! The cool, clean vault,
284. So neat with niche on niche it might have been
285. Our beer-cellar but for the rows
286. Of brazen urns (like monstrous chemist's jars)
287. Full to the wide, squat throats
288. With gold-dust, but a-top
289. A layer of pickled-walnut-looking things
290. I knew for olives! And far, O, far away,
291. The Princess of China languished! Far away
292. Was marriage, with a Vizier and a Chief
293. Of Eunuchs and the privilege
294. Of going out at night
295. To play--unkenned, majestical, secure -
296. Where the old, brown, friendly river shaped
297. Like Tigris shore for shore! Haply a Ghoul
298. Sat in the churchyard under a frightened moon,
299. A thighbone in his fist, and glared
300. At supper with a Lady: she who took
301. Her rice with tweezers grain by grain.
302. Or you might stumble--there by the iron gates
303. Of the Pump Room--underneath the limes -
304. Upon Bedreddin in his shirt and drawers,
305. Just as the civil Genie laid him down.
306. Or those red-curtained panes,
307. Whence a tame cornet tenored it throatily
308. Of beer-pots and spittoons and new long pipes,
309. Might turn a caravansery's, wherein
310. You found Noureddin Ali, loftily drunk,
311. And that fair Persian, bathed in tears,
312. You'd not have given away
313. For all the diamonds in the Vale Perilous
314. You had that dark and disleaved afternoon
315. Escaped on a roc's claw,
316. Disguised like Sindbad--but in Christmas beef!
317. And all the blissful while
318. The schoolboy satchel at your hip
319. Was such a bulse of gems as should amaze
320. Grey-whiskered chapmen drawn
321. From over Caspian: yea, the Chief Jewellers
322. Of Tartary and the bazaars,
323. Seething with traffic, of enormous Ind. -

324. Thus cried, thus called aloud, to the child heart
325. The magian East: thus the child eyes
326. Spelled out the wizard message by the light
327. Of the sober, workaday hours
328. They saw, week in week out, pass, and still pass
329. In the sleepy Minster City, folded kind
330. In ancient Severn's arm,
331. Amongst her water-meadows and her docks,
332. Whose floating populace of ships -
333. Galliots and luggers, light-heeled brigantines,
334. Bluff barques and rake-hell fore-and-afters--brought
335. To her very doorsteps and geraniums
336. The scents of the World's End; the calls
337. That may not be gainsaid to rise and ride
338. Like fire on some high errand of the race;
339. The irresistible appeals
340. For comradeship that sound
341. Steadily from the irresistible sea.
342. Thus the East laughed and whispered, and the tale,
343. Telling itself anew
344. In terms of living, labouring life,
345. Took on the colours, busked it in the wear
346. Of life that lived and laboured; and Romance,
347. The Angel-Playmate, raining down
348. His golden influences
349. On all I saw, and all I dreamed and did,
350. Walked with me arm in arm,
351. Or left me, as one bediademed with straws
352. And bits of glass, to gladden at my heart
353. Who had the gift to seek and feel and find
354. His fiery-hearted presence everywhere.
355. Even so dear Hesper, bringer of all good things,
356. Sends the same silver dews
357. Of happiness down her dim, delighted skies
358. On some poor collier-hamlet--(mound on mound
359. Of sifted squalor; here a soot-throated stalk
360. Sullenly smoking over a row
361. Of flat-faced hovels; black in the gritty air
362. A web of rails and wheels and beams; with strings
363. Of hurtling, tipping trams) -
364. As on the amorous nightingales
365. And roses of Shiraz, or the walls and towers
366. Of Samarcand--the Ineffable--whence you espy
367. The splendour of Ginnistan's embattled spears,
368. Like listed lightnings.
369. Samarcand!
370. That name of names! That star-vaned belvedere
371. Builded against the Chambers of the South!
372. That outpost on the Infinite!
373. And behold!
374. Questing therefrom, you knew not what wild tide
375. Might overtake you: for one fringe,
376. One suburb, is stablished on firm earth; but one
377. Floats founded vague
378. In lubberlands delectable--isles of palm
379. And lotus, fortunate mains, far-shimmering seas,
380. The promise of wistful hills -
381. The shining, shifting Sovranties of Dream.
