1. The spring, my dear,
2. Is no longer spring.
3. Does the blackbird sing
4. What he sang last year?
5. Are the skies the old
6. Immemorial blue?
7. Or am I, or are you,
8. Grown cold?

9. Though life be change,
10. It is hard to bear
11. When the old sweet air
12. Sounds forced and strange.
13. To be out of tune,
14. Plain You and I . . .
15. It were better to die,
16. And soon!
