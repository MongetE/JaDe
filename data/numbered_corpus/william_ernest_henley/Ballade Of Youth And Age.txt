1. Spring at her height on a morn at prime,
2. Sails that laugh from a flying squall,
3. Pomp of harmony, rapture of rhyme -
4. Youth is the sign of them, one and all.
5. Winter sunsets and leaves that fall,
6. An empty flagon, a folded page,
7. A tumble-down wheel, a tattered ball -
8. These are a type of the world of Age.
9. Bells that clash in a gaudy chime,
10. Swords that clatter in onsets tall,
11. The words that ring and the fames that climb -
12. Youth is the sign of them, one and all.
13. Hymnals old in a dusty stall,
14. A bald, blind bird in a crazy cage,
15. The scene of a faded festival -
16. These are a type of the world of Age.
17. Hours that strut as the heirs of time,
18. Deeds whose rumour's a clarion-call,
19. Songs where the singers their souls sublime -
20. Youth is the sign of them, one and all.
21. A staff that rests in a nook of wall,
22. A reeling battle, a rusted gage,
23. The chant of a nearing funeral -
24. These are a type of the world of Age.
25. Envoy

26. Struggle and turmoil, revel and brawl -
27. Youth is the sign of them, one and all.
28. A smouldering hearth and a silent stage -
29. These are a type of the world of Age.
