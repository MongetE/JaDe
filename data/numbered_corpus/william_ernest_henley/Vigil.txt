1. Lived on one's back,
2. In the long hours of repose,
3. Life is a practical nightmare -
4. Hideous asleep or awake.

5. Shoulders and loins
6. Ache-- -!
7. Ache, and the mattress,
8. Run into boulders and hummocks,
9. Glows like a kiln, while the bedclothes -
10. Tumbling, importunate, daft -
11. Ramble and roll, and the gas,
12. Screwed to its lowermost,
13. An inevitable atom of light,
14. Haunts, and a stertorous sleeper
15. Snores me to hate and despair.

16. All the old time
17. Surges malignant before me;
18. Old voices, old kisses, old songs
19. Blossom derisive about me;
20. While the new days
21. Pass me in endless procession:
22. A pageant of shadows
23. Silently, leeringly wending
24. On . . . and still on . . . still on!

25. Far in the stillness a cat
26. Languishes loudly. A cinder
27. Falls, and the shadows
28. Lurch to the leap of the flame. The next man to me
29. Turns with a moan; and the snorer,
30. The drug like a rope at his throat,
31. Gasps, gurgles, snorts himself free, as the night-nurse,
32. Noiseless and strange,
33. Her bull's eye half-lanterned in apron,
34. (Whispering me, 'Are ye no sleepin' yet?'),
35. Passes, list-slippered and peering,
36. Round . . . and is gone.

37. Sleep comes at last -
38. Sleep full of dreams and misgivings -
39. Broken with brutal and sordid
40. Voices and sounds that impose on me,
41. Ere I can wake to it,
42. The unnatural, intolerable day.
