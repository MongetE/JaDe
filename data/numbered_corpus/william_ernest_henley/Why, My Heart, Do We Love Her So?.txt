1. Why, my heart, do we love her so?
2. (Geraldine, Geraldine!)
3. Why does the great sea ebb and flow? -
4. Why does the round world spin?
5. Geraldine, Geraldine,
6. Bid me my life renew:
7. What is it worth unless I win,
8. Love--love and you?

9. Why, my heart, when we speak her name
10. (Geraldine, Geraldine!)
11. Throbs the word like a flinging flame? -
12. Why does the Spring begin?
13. Geraldine, Geraldine,
14. Bid me indeed to be:
15. Open your heart, and take us in,
16. Love--love and me.
