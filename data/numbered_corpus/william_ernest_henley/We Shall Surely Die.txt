1. We shall surely die:
2. Must we needs grow old?
3. Grow old and cold,
4. And we know not why?

5. O, the By-and-By,
6. And the tale that’s told!
7. We shall surely die:
8. Must we needs grow old?

9. Grow old and sigh,
10. Grudge and withhold,
11. Resent and scold?…
12. Not you and I?
13. We shall surely die!
