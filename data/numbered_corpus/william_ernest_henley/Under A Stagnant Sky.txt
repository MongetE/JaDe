1. Under a stagnant sky,
2. Gloom out of gloom uncoiling into gloom,
3. The River, jaded and forlorn,
4. Welters and wanders wearily--wretchedly--on;
5. Yet in and out among the ribs
6. Of the old skeleton bridge, as in the piles
7. Of some dead lake-built city, full of skulls,
8. Worm-worn, rat-riddled, mouldy with memories,
9. Lingers to babble to a broken tune
10. (Once, O, the unvoiced music of my heart!)
11. So melancholy a soliloquy
12. It sounds as it might tell
13. The secret of the unending grief-in-grain,
14. The terror of Time and Change and Death,
15. That wastes this floating, transitory world.

16. What of the incantation
17. That forced the huddled shapes on yonder shore
18. To take and wear the night
19. Like a material majesty?
20. That touched the shafts of wavering fire
21. About this miserable welter and wash -
22. (River, O River of Journeys, River of Dreams!) -
23. Into long, shining signals from the panes
24. Of an enchanted pleasure-house,
25. Where life and life might live life lost in life
26. For ever and evermore?

27. O Death! O Change! O Time!
28. Without you, O, the insuperable eyes
29. Of these poor Might-Have-Beens,
30. These fatuous, ineffectual Yesterdays!
