1. At the barren heart of midnight,
2. When the shadow shuts and opens
3. As the loud flames pulse and flutter,
4. I can hear a cistern leaking.

5. Dripping, dropping, in a rhythm,
6. Rough, unequal, half-melodious,
7. Like the measures aped from nature
8. In the infancy of music;

9. Like the buzzing of an insect,
10. Still, irrational, persistent . . .
11. I must listen, listen, listen
12. In a passion of attention;

13. Till it taps upon my heartstrings,
14. And my very life goes dripping,
15. Dropping, dripping, drip-drip-dropping,
16. In the drip-drop of the cistern.
