1. He's called The General from the brazen craft
2. And dash with which he sneaks a bit of road
3. And all its fares; challenged, or chafed, or chaffed,
4. Back-answers of the newest he'll explode;
5. He reins his horses with an air; he treats
6. With scoffing calm whatever powers there be;
7. He gets it straight, puts a bit on, and meets
8. His losses with both lip and Â£ s. d.;
9. He arrogates a special taste in short;
10. Is loftily grateful for a flagrant smoke;
11. At all the smarter housemaids winks his court,
12. And taps them for half-crowns; being stoney-broke,
13. Lives lustily; is ever on the make;
14. And hath, I fear, none other gods but Fake.
