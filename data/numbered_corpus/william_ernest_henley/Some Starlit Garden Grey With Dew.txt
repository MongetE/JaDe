1. Some starlit garden grey with dew,
2. Some chamber flushed with wine and fire,
3. What matters where, so I and you
4. Are worthy our desire?

5. Behind, a past that scolds and jeers
6. For ungirt loins and lamps unlit;
7. In front, the unmanageable years,
8. The trap upon the Pit;

9. Think on the shame of dreams for deeds,
10. The scandal of unnatural strife,
11. The slur upon immortal needs,
12. The treason done to life:

13. Arise! no more a living lie,
14. And with me quicken and control
15. Some memory that shall magnify
16. The universal Soul.
