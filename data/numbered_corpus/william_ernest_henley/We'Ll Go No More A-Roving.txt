1. We'll go no more a-roving by the light of the moon.
2. November glooms are barren beside the dusk of June.
3. The summer flowers are faded, the summer thoughts are sere.
4. We'll go no more a-roving, lest worse befall, my dear.

5. We'll go no more a-roving by the light of the moon.
6. The song we sang rings hollow, and heavy runs the tune.
7. Glad ways and words remembered would shame the wretched year.
8. We'll go no more a-roving, nor dream we did, my dear.

9. We'll go no more a-roving by the light of the moon.
10. If yet we walk together, we need not shun the noon.
11. No sweet thing left to savour, no sad thing left to fear,
12. We'll go no more a-roving, but weep at home, my dear.
