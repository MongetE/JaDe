1. Space and dread and the dark -
2. Over a livid stretch of sky
3. Cloud-monsters crawling, like a funeral train
4. Of huge, primeval presences
5. Stooping beneath the weight
6. Of some enormous, rudimentary grief;
7. While in the haunting loneliness
8. The far sea waits and wanders with a sound
9. As of the trailing skirts of Destiny,
10. Passing unseen
11. To some immitigable end
12. With her grey henchman, Death.

13. What larve, what spectre is this
14. Thrilling the wilderness to life
15. As with the bodily shape of Fear?
16. What but a desperate sense,
17. A strong foreboding of those dim
18. Interminable continents, forlorn
19. And many-silenced, in a dusk
20. Inviolable utterly, and dead
21. As the poor dead it huddles and swarms and styes
22. In hugger-mugger through eternity?

23. Life--life--let there be life!
24. Better a thousand times the roaring hours
25. When wave and wind,
26. Like the Arch-Murderer in flight
27. From the Avenger at his heel,
28. Storm through the desolate fastnesses
29. And wild waste places of the world!

30. Life--give me life until the end,
31. That at the very top of being,
32. The battle-spirit shouting in my blood,
33. Out of the reddest hell of the fight
34. I may be snatched and flung
35. Into the everlasting lull,
36. The immortal, incommunicable dream.
