1. The big teetotum twirls,
2. And epochs wax and wane
3. As chance subsides or swirls;
4. But of the loss and gain
5. The sum is always plain.
6. Read on the mighty pall,
7. The weed of funeral
8. That covers praise and blame,
9. The -isms and the -anities,
10. Magnificence and shame:--
11. "O Vanity of Vanities!"
12. The Fates are subtle girls!
13. They give us chaff for grain.
14. And Time, the Thunderer, hurls,
15. Like bolted death, disdain
16. At all that heart and brain
17. Conceive, or great or small,
18. Upon this earthly ball.
19. Would you be knight and dame?
20. Or woo the sweet humanities?
21. Or illustrate a name?
22. O Vanity of Vanities!

23. We sound the sea for pearls,
24. Or drown them in a drain;
25. We flute it with the merles,
26. Or tug and sweat and strain;
27. We grovel, or we reign;
28. We saunter, or we brawl;
29. We search the stars for Fame,
30. Or sink her subterranities;
31. The legend's still the same:--
32. "O Vanity of Vanities!"
33. Here at the wine one birls,
34. There some one clanks a chain.
35. The flag that this man furls
36. That man to float is fain.
37. Pleasure gives place to pain:
38. These in the kennel crawl,
39. While others take the wall.
40. She has a glorious aim,
41. He lives for the inanities.
42. What come of every claim?
43. O Vanity of Vanities!

44. Alike are clods and earls.
45. For sot, and seer, and swain,
46. For emperors and for churls,
47. For antidote and bane,
48. There is but one refrain:
49. But one for king and thrall,
50. For David and for Saul,
51. For fleet of foot and lame,
52. For pieties and profanities,
53. The picture and the frame:--
54. "O Vanity of Vanities!"
55. Life is a smoke that curls--
56. Curls in a flickering skein,
57. That winds and whisks and whirls,
58. A figment thin and vain,
59. Into the vast Inane.
60. One end for hut and hall!
61. One end for cell and stall!
62. Burned in one common flame
63. Are wisdoms and insanities.
64. For this alone we came:--
65. "O Vanity of Vanities!"
66. Envoy
67. Prince, pride must have a fall.
68. What is the worth of all
69. Your state's supreme urbanities?
70. Bad at the best's the game.
71. Well might the Sage exclaim:--
72. "O Vanity of Vanities!"
