1. Fill a glass with golden wine,
2. And the while your lips are wet
3. Set your perfume unto mine,
4. And forget.
5. Every kiss we take and give
6. Leaves us less of life to live.

7. Yet again! Your whim and mine
8. In a happy while have met.
9. All your sweets to me resign,
10. Nor regret
11. That we press with every breath,
12. Sighed or singing, nearer death.
