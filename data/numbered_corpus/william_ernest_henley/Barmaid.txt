1. Though, if you ask her name, she says Elise,
2. Being plain Elizabeth, e'en let it pass,
3. And own that, if her aspirates take their ease,
4. She ever makes a point, in washing glass,
5. Handling the engine, turning taps for tots,
6. And countering change, and scorning what men say,
7. Of posing as a dove among the pots,
8. Nor often gives her dignity away.
9. Her head's a work of art, and, if her eyes
10. Be tired and ignorant, she has a waist;
11. Cheaply the Mode she shadows; and she tries
12. From penny novels to amend her taste;
13. And, having mopped the zinc for certain years,
14. And faced the gas, she fades and disappears.
