1. Carry me out
2. Into the wind and the sunshine,
3. Into the beautiful world.

4. O, the wonder, the spell of the streets!
5. The stature and strength of the horses,
6. The rustle and echo of footfalls,
7. The flat roar and rattle of wheels!
8. A swift tram floats huge on us . . .
9. It's a dream?
10. The smell of the mud in my nostrils
11. Blows brave-like a breath of the sea!

12. As of old,
13. Ambulant, undulant drapery,
14. Vaguery and strangely provocative,
15. Fluttersd and beckons. O, yonder -
16. Is it?-the gleam of a stocking!
17. Sudden, a spire
18. Wedged in the mist! O, the houses,
19. The long lines of lofty, grey houses,
20. Cross-hatched with shadow and light!
21. These are the streets . . .
22. Each is an avenue leading
23. Whither I will!

24. Free . . . !
25. Dizzy, hysterical, faint,
26. I sit, and the carriage rolls on with me
27. Into the wonderful world.
