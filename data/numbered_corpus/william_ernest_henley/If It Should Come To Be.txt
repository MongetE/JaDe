1. If it should come to be,
2. This proof of you and me,
3. This type and sign
4. Of hours that smiled and shone,
5. And yet seemed dead and gone
6. As old-world wine:

7. Of Them Within the Gate
8. Ask we no richer fate,
9. No boon above,
10. For girl child or for boy,
11. My gift of life and joy,
12. Your gift of love.
