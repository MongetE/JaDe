1. Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Crook
2. And the rope of the Black Election,
3. 'Tis the faith of the Fool that a race you rule
4. Can never achieve perfection:
5. So 'It's O, for the time of the new Sublime
6. And the better than human way,
7. When the Rat (poor beast) shall come to his own
8. And the Wolf shall have his day!'

9. For Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Beam
10. And the power of provocation,
11. You have cockered the Brute with your dreadful fruit
12. Till your fruit is mere stupration:
13. And 'It's how should we rise to be pure and wise,
14. And how can we choose but fall,
15. So long as the Hangman makes us dread,
16. And the Noose floats free for all?'

17. So Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Coign
18. And the trick there's no recalling,
19. They will haggle and hew till they hack you through
20. And at last they lay you sprawling:
21. When 'Hey! for the hour of the race in flower
22. And the long good-bye to sin!'
23. And for the lack the fires of Hell gone out
24. Of the fuel to keep them in!'

25. But Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Bough
26. And the ghastly Dreams that tend you,
27. Your growth began with the life of Man,
28. And only his death can end you.
29. They may tug in line at your hempen twine,
30. They may flourish with axe and saw;
31. But your taproot drinks of the Sacred Springs
32. In the living rock of Law.

33. And Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Fork,
34. When the spent sun reels and blunders
35. Down a welkin lit with the flare of the Pit
36. As it seethes in spate and thunders,
37. Stern on the glare of the tortured air
38. Your lines august shall gloom,
39. And your master-beam be the last thing whelmed
40. In the ruining roar of Doom.
