1. Trees and the menace of night;
2. Then a long, lonely, leaden mere
3. Backed by a desolate fell,
4. As by a spectral battlement; and then,
5. Low-brooding, interpenetrating all,
6. A vast, gray, listless, inexpressive sky,
7. So beggared, so incredibly bereft
8. Of starlight and the song of racing worlds,
9. It might have bellied down upon the Void
10. Where as in terror Light was beginning to be.

11. Hist! In the trees fulfilled of night
12. (Night and the wretchedness of the sky)
13. Is it the hurry of the rain?
14. Or the noise of a drive of the Dead,
15. Streaming before the irresistible Will
16. Through the strange dusk of this, the Debateable Land
17. Between their place and ours?

18. Like the forgetfulness
19. Of the work-a-day world made visible,
20. A mist falls from the melancholy sky.
21. A messenger from some lost and loving soul,
22. Hopeless, far wandered, dazed
23. Here in the provinces of life,
24. A great white moth fades miserably past.

25. Thro' the trees in the strange dead night,
26. Under the vast dead sky,
27. Forgetting and forgot, a drift of Dead
28. Sets to the mystic mere, the phantom fell,
29. And the unimagined vastitudes beyond.
