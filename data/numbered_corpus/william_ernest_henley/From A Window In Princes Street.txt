1. Above the Crags that fade and gloom
2. Starts the bare knee of Arthur's Seat;
3. Ridged high against the evening bloom,
4. The Old Town rises, street on street;
5. With lamps bejewelled, straight ahead,
6. Like rampired walls the houses lean,
7. All spired and domed and turreted,
8. Sheer to the valley's darkling green;
9. Ranged in mysterious disarray,
10. The Castle, menacing and austere,
11. Looms through the lingering last of day;
12. And in the silver dusk you hear,
13. Reverberated from crag and scar,
14. Bold bugles blowing points of war.
