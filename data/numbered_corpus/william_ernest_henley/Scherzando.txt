1. Down through the ancient Strand
2. The spirit of October, mild and boon
3. And sauntering, takes his way
4. This golden end of afternoon,
5. As though the corn stood yellow in all the land,
6. And the ripe apples dropped to the harvest-moon.

7. Lo! the round sun, half-down the western slope -
8. Seen as along an unglazed telescope -
9. Lingers and lolls, loth to be done with day:
10. Gifting the long, lean, lanky street
11. And its abounding confluences of being
12. With aspects generous and bland;
13. Making a thousand harnesses to shine
14. As with new ore from some enchanted mine,
15. And every horse's coat so full of sheen
16. He looks new-tailored, and every 'bus feels clean,
17. And never a hansom but is worth the feeing;
18. And every jeweller within the pale
19. Offers a real Arabian Night for sale;
20. And even the roar
21. Of the strong streams of toil, that pause and pour
22. Eastward and westward, sounds suffused -
23. Seems as it were bemused
24. And blurred, and like the speech
25. Of lazy seas on a lotus-haunted beach -
26. With this enchanted lustrousness,
27. This mellow magic, that (as a man's caress
28. Brings back to some faded face, beloved before,
29. A heavenly shadow of the grace it wore
30. Ere the poor eyes were minded to beseech)
31. Old things transfigures, and you hail and bless
32. Their looks of long-lapsed loveliness once more:
33. Till Clement's, angular and cold and staid,
34. Gleams forth in glamour's very stuffs arrayed;
35. And Bride's, her aery, unsubstantial charm
36. Through flight on flight of springing, soaring stone
37. Grown flushed and warm,
38. Laughs into life full-mooded and fresh-blown;
39. And the high majesty of Paul's
40. Uplifts a voice of living light, and calls -
41. Calls to his millions to behold and see
42. How goodly this his London Town can be!

43. For earth and sky and air
44. Are golden everywhere,
45. And golden with a gold so suave and fine
46. The looking on it lifts the heart like wine.
47. Trafalgar Square
48. (The fountains volleying golden glaze)
49. Shines like an angel-market. High aloft
50. Over his couchant Lions, in a haze
51. Shimmering and bland and soft,
52. A dust of chrysoprase,
53. Our Sailor takes the golden gaze
54. Of the saluting sun, and flames superb,
55. As once he flamed it on his ocean round.
56. The dingy dreariness of the picture-place,
57. Turned very nearly bright,
58. Takes on a luminous transiency of grace,
59. And shows no more a scandal to the ground.
60. The very blind man pottering on the kerb,
61. Among the posies and the ostrich feathers
62. And the rude voices touched with all the weathers
63. Of the long, varying year,
64. Shares in the universal alms of light.
65. The windows, with their fleeting, flickering fires,
66. The height and spread of frontage shining sheer,
67. The quiring signs, the rejoicing roofs and spires -
68. 'Tis El Dorado--El Dorado plain,
69. The Golden City! And when a girl goes by,
70. Look! as she turns her glancing head,
71. A call of gold is floated from her ear!
72. Golden, all golden! In a golden glory,
73. Long-lapsing down a golden coasted sky,
74. The day, not dies but, seems
75. Dispersed in wafts and drifts of gold, and shed
76. Upon a past of golden song and story
77. And memories of gold and golden dreams.
