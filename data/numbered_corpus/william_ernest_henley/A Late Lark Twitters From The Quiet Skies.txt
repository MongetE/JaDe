1. the quiet skies:
2. And from the west,
3. Where the sun, his day's work ended,
4. Lingers as in content,
5. There falls on the old, gray city
6. An influence luminous and serene,
7. A shining peace.

8. The smoke ascends
9. In a rosy-and-golden haze. The spires
10. Shine and are changed. In the valley
11. Shadows rise. The lark sings on. The sun,
12. Closing his benediction,
13. Sinks, and the darkening air
14. Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night-
15. Night with her train of stars
16. And her great gift of sleep.

17. So be my passing!
18. My task accomplish'd and the long day done,
19. My wages taken, and in my heart
20. Some late lark singing,
21. Let me be gather'd to the quiet west,
22. The sundown splendid and serene,
23. Death.
