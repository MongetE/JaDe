1. Fountains that frisk and sprinkle
2. The moss they overspill;
3. Pools that the breezes crinkle;
4. The wheel beside the mill,
5. With its wet, weedy frill;
6. Wind-shadows in the wheat;
7. A water-cart in the street;
8. The fringe of foam that girds
9. An islet's ferneries;
10. A green sky's minor thirds -
11. To live, I think of these!
12. Of ice and glass the tinkle,
13. Pellucid, silver-shrill;
14. Peaches without a wrinkle;
15. Cherries and snow at will,
16. From china bowls that fill
17. The senses with a sweet
18. Incuriousness of heat;
19. A melon's dripping sherds;
20. Cream-clotted strawberries;
21. Dusk dairies set with curds -
22. To live, I think of these!
23. Vale-lily and periwinkle;
24. Wet stone-crop on the sill;
25. The look of leaves a-twinkle
26. With windlets clear and still;
27. The feel of a forest rill
28. That wimples fresh and fleet
29. About one's naked feet;
30. The muzzles of drinking herds;
31. Lush flags and bulrushes;
32. The chirp of rain-bound birds -
33. To live, I think of these!
34. Envoy

35. Dark aisles, new packs of cards,
36. Mermaidens' tails, cool swards,
37. Dawn dews and starlit seas,
38. White marbles, whiter words -
39. To live, I think of these!
