1. Or ever the knightly years were gone
2. With the old world to the grave,
3. I was a King in Babylon
4. And you were a Christian Slave.

5. I saw, I took, I cast you by,
6. I bent and broke your pride.
7. You loved me well, or I heard them lie,
8. But your longing was denied.
9. Surely I knew that by and by
10. You cursed your gods and died.

11. And a myriad suns have set and shone
12. Since then upon the grave
13. Decreed by the King in Babylon
14. To her that had been his Slave.

15. The pride I trampled is now my scathe,
16. For it tramples me again.
17. The old resentment lasts like death,
18. For you love, yet you refrain.
19. I break my heart on your hard unfaith,
20. And I break my heart in vain.

21. Yet not for an hour do I wish undone
22. The deed beyond the grave,
23. When I was a King in Babylon
24. And you were a Virgin Slave.
