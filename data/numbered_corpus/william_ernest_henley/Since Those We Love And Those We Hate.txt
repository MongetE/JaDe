1. SINCE those we love and those we hate,
2. With all things mean and all things great,
3. Pass in a desperate disarray
4. Over the hills and far away:

5. It must be, Dear, that, late or soon,
6. Out of the ken of the watching moon,
7. We shall abscond with yesterday
8. Over the hills and far away.
9. What does it matter? As I deem,
10. We shall but follow as brave a dream
11. As ever smiled a wanton May
12. Over the hills and far away.
13. We shall remember, and, in pride,
14. Fare forth, fulfilled and satisfied,
15. Into the land of Ever-and-Aye,
16. Over the hills and far away.
