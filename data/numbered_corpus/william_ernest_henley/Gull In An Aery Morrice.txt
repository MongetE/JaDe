1. Gulls in an aery morrice
2. Gleam and vanish and gleam . . .
3. The full sea, sleepily basking,
4. Dreams under skies of dream.

5. Gulls in an aery morrice
6. Circle and swoop and close . . .
7. Fuller and ever fuller
8. The rose of the morning blows.

9. Gulls, in an aery morrice
10. Frolicking, float and fade . . .
11. O, the way of a bird in the sunshine,
12. The way of a man with a maid!
