1. Midsummer midnight skies,
2. Midsummer midnight influences and airs,
3. The shining, sensitive silver of the sea
4. Touched with the strange-hued blazonings of dawn;
5. And all so solemnly still I seem to hear
6. The breathing of Life and Death,
7. The secular Accomplices,
8. Renewing the visible miracle of the world.

9. The wistful stars
10. Shine like good memories. The young morning wind
11. Blows full of unforgotten hours
12. As over a region of roses. Life and Death
13. Sound on--sound on . . . And the night magical,
14. Troubled yet comforting, thrills
15. As if the Enchanted Castle at the heart
16. Of the wood's dark wonderment
17. Swung wide his valves, and filled the dim sea-banks
18. With exquisite visitants:
19. Words fiery-hearted yet, dreams and desires
20. With living looks intolerable, regrets
21. Whose voice comes as the voice of an only child
22. Heard from the grave: shapes of a Might-Have-Been -
23. Beautiful, miserable, distraught -
24. The Law no man may baffle denied and slew.

25. The spell-bound ships stand as at gaze
26. To let the marvel by. The grey road glooms . . .
27. Glimmers . . . goes out . . . and there, O, there where it fades,
28. What grace, what glamour, what wild will,
29. Transfigure the shadows? Whose,
30. Heart of my heart, Soul of my soul, but yours?

31. Ghosts--ghosts--the sapphirine air
32. Teems with them even to the gleaming ends
33. Of the wild day-spring! Ghosts,
34. Everywhere--everywhere--till I and you
35. At last--dear love, at last! -
36. Are in the dreaming, even as Life and Death,
37. Twin-ministers of the unoriginal Will.
