1. The ways of Death are soothing and serene,
2. And all the words of Death are grave and sweet.
3. From camp and church, the fireside and the street,
4. She beckons forth – and strife and song have been.

5. A summer night descending cool and green
6. And dark on daytime’s dust and stress and heat,
7. The ways of death are soothing and serene,
8. And all the words of Death are grave and sweet.

9. O, glad and sorrowful, with triumphant mien
10. And radiant faces, look upon and greet
11. This last of all your lovers, and to meet
12. The kiss, the Comforter’s, your spirit lean ….
13. The ways of Death are soothing and serene.
