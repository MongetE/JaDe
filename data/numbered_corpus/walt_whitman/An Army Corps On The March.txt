1. WITH its cloud of skirmishers in advance,
2. With now the sound of a single shot, snapping like a whip, and now an
3. irregular volley,
4. The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on;
5. Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover'd men,
6. In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,
7. With artillery interspers'd--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,
8. As the army corps advances.
