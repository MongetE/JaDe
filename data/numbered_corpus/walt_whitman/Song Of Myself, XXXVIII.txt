1. Enough! enough! enough!
2. Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!
3. Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,
4. I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.

5. That I could forget the mockers and insults!
6. That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludg- eons and hammers!
7. That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.
8. I remember now,
9. I resume the overstaid fraction,
10. The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,
11. Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.

12. I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,
13. Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,
14. Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,
15. The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.

16. Eleves, I salute you! come forward!
17. Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.
