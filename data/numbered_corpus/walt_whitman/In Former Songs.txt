1. IN former songs Pride have I sung, and Love, and passionate, joyful
2. Life,
3. But here I twine the strands of Patriotism and Death.

4. And now, Life, Pride, Love, Patriotism and Death,
5. To you, O FREEDOM, purport of all!
6. (You that elude me most--refusing to be caught in songs of mine,)
7. I offer all to you.


8. 'Tis not for nothing, Death,
9. I sound out you, and words of you, with daring tone--embodying you,
10. In my new Democratic chants--keeping you for a close,
11. For last impregnable retreat--a citadel and tower,
12. For my last stand--my pealing, final cry.
