1. There is that in me—I do not know what it is—but I know it is in me.

2. Wrench'd and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,
3. I sleep—I sleep long.

4. I do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid,
5. It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.

6. Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,
7. To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.

8. Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.

9. Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
10. It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is Happiness.
