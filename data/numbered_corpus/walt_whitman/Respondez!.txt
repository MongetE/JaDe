24. one line of my poems contradict another!
25. Let the people sprawl with yearning, aimless hands! let their tongues
26. be broken! let their eyes be discouraged! let none descend into
27. their hearts with the fresh lusciousness of love!
28. (Stifled, O days! O lands! in every public and private corruption!
29. Smother'd in thievery, impotence, shamelessness, mountain-high;
30. Brazen effrontery, scheming, rolling like ocean's waves around and
31. upon you, O my days! my lands!
32. For not even those thunderstorms, nor fiercest lightnings of the war,
33. have purified the atmosphere;)
34. --Let the theory of America still be management, caste, comparison!
35. (Say! what other theory would you?)

42. Let the heart of the young man still exile itself from the heart of
43. the old man! and let the heart of the old man be exiled from
44. that of the young man!
45. Let the sun and moon go! let scenery take the applause of the
46. audience! let there be apathy under the stars!
47. Let freedom prove no man's inalienable right! every one who can
48. tyrannize, let him tyrannize to his satisfaction!
49. Let none but infidels be countenanced!
50. Let the eminence of meanness, treachery, sarcasm, hate, greed,
51. indecency, impotence, lust, be taken for granted above all! let
52. writers, judges, governments, households, religions,
53. philosophies, take such for granted above all!
54. Let the worst men beget children out of the worst women!
55. Let the priest still play at immortality!
56. Let death be inaugurated!
57. Let nothing remain but the ashes of teachers, artists, moralists,
58. lawyers, and learn'd and polite persons!
59. Let him who is without my poems be assassinated!
60. Let the cow, the horse, the camel, the garden-bee--let the mudfish,
61. the lobster, the mussel, eel, the sting-ray, and the grunting
62. pig-fish--let these, and the like of these, be put on a perfect
63. equality with man and woman!
64. Let churches accommodate serpents, vermin, and the corpses of those
65. who have died of the most filthy of diseases!
66. Let marriage slip down among fools, and be for none but fools!
67. Let men among themselves talk and think forever obscenely of women!
68. and let women among themselves talk and think obscenely of men!

71. handled and examined by whoever chooses!
72. Let nothing but copies at second hand be permitted to exist upon the
73. earth!
74. Let the earth desert God, nor let there ever henceforth be mention'd
75. the name of God!
76. Let there be no God!
77. Let there be money, business, imports, exports, custom, authority,
78. precedents, pallor, dyspepsia, smut, ignorance, unbelief!
79. Let judges and criminals be transposed! let the prison-keepers be put
80. in prison! let those that were prisoners take the keys! Say!
81. why might they not just as well be transposed?)
82. Let the slaves be masters! let the masters become slaves!
83. Let the reformers descend from the stands where they are forever
84. bawling! let an idiot or insane person appear on each of the
85. stands!
86. Let the Asiatic, the African, the European, the American, and the
87. Australian, go armed against the murderous stealthiness of each
88. other! let them sleep armed! let none believe in good will!
89. Let there be no unfashionable wisdom! let such be scorn'd and derided
90. off from the earth!
91. Let a floating cloud in the sky--let a wave of the sea--let growing
92. mint, spinach, onions, tomatoes--let these be exhibited as
93. shows, at a great price for admission!
94. Let all the men of These States stand aside for a few smouchers! let
95. the few seize on what they choose! let the rest gawk, giggle,
96. starve, obey!
97. Let shadows be furnish'd with genitals! let substances be deprived of
98. their genitals!
99. Let there be wealthy and immense cities--but still through any of
100. them, not a single poet, savior, knower, lover!
101. Let the infidels of These States laugh all faith away!
102. If one man be found who has faith, let the rest set upon him!
103. Let them affright faith! let them destroy the power of breeding
104. faith!
105. Let the she-harlots and the he-harlots be prudent! let them dance on,
106. while seeming lasts! (O seeming! seeming! seeming!)
107. Let the preachers recite creeds! let them still teach only what they
108. have been taught!
109. Let insanity still have charge of sanity!
110. Let books take the place of trees, animals, rivers, clouds!
111. Let the daub'd portraits of heroes supersede heroes!
112. Let the manhood of man never take steps after itself!
113. Let it take steps after eunuchs, and after consumptive and genteel
114. persons!
115. Let the white person again tread the black person under his heel!
116. (Say! which is trodden under heel, after all?)
117. Let the reflections of the things of the world be studied in mirrors!
118. let the things themselves still continue unstudied!
