1. Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask—lie over!
2. You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.

3. Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,
4. Say, old top-knot, what do you want?

5. Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,
6. And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,
7. And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.

8. Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,
9. When I give I give myself.

10. You there, impotent, loose in the knees,
11. Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,
12. Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,
13. I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,
14. And any thing I have I bestow.

15. I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,
16. You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.

17. To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,
18. On his right cheek I put the family kiss,
19. And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.

20. On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes,
21. (This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)

22. To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door,
23. Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,
24. Let the physician and the priest go home.

25. I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,
26. O despairer, here is my neck,
27. By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.

28. I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,
29. Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,
30. Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.

31. Sleep—I and they keep guard all night,
32. Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,
33. I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,
34. And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.
