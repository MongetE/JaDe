1. NO labor-saving machine,
2. Nor discovery have I made;
3. Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found a
4. hospital or library,
5. Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage, for America,
6. Nor literary success, nor intellect--nor book for the book-shelf;
7. Only a few carols, vibrating through the air, I leave,
8. For comrades and lovers.
