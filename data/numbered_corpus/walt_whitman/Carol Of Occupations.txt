1. COME closer to me;
2. Push close, my lovers, and take the best I possess;
3. Yield closer and closer, and give me the best you possess.

4. This is unfinish'd business with me--How is it with you?
5. (I was chill'd with the cold types, cylinder, wet paper between us.)

6. Male and Female!
7. I pass so poorly with paper and types, I must pass with the contact
8. of bodies and souls.

9. American masses!
10. I do not thank you for liking me as I am, and liking the touch of
11. me--I know that it is good for you to do so.


12. This is the carol of occupations;
13. In the labor of engines and trades, and the labor of fields, I find the developments,
14. And find the eternal meanings.

15. Workmen and Workwomen!
16. Were all educations, practical and ornamental, well display'd out of
17. me, what would it amount to?
18. Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman,
19. what would it amount to?
20. Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that
21. satisfy you?

22. The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms;
23. A man like me, and never the usual terms.

24. Neither a servant nor a master am I;
25. I take no sooner a large price than a small price--I will have my
26. own, whoever enjoys me;
27. I will be even with you, and you shall be even with me.

28. If you stand at work in a shop, I stand as nigh as the nighest in the
29. same shop;
30. If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, I demand as
31. good as your brother or dearest friend;
32. If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I must be
33. personally as welcome;
34. If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for your
35. sake;
36. If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do you think I
37. cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw'd deeds?
38. If you carouse at the table, I carouse at the opposite side of the
39. table;
40. If you meet some stranger in the streets, and love him or her--why I
41. often meet strangers in the street, and love them.

42. Why, what have you thought of yourself?
43. Is it you then that thought yourself less?
44. Is it you that thought the President greater than you?
45. Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?

46. Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you were once drunk, or a
47. thief,
48. Or diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute--or are so now;
49. Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, and never
50. saw your name in print,
51. Do you give in that you are any less immortal?


52. Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard,
53. untouchable and untouching;
54. It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether you
55. are alive or no;
56. I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.

57. Grown, half-grown, and babe, of this country and every country, in-
58. doors and out-doors, one just as much as the other, I see,
59. And all else behind or through them.

60. The wife--and she is not one jot less than the husband;
61. The daughter--and she is just as good as the son;
62. The mother--and she is every bit as much as the father.

63. Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,
64. Young fellows working on farms, and old fellows working on farms,
65. Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,
66. All these I see--but nigher and farther the same I see;
67. None shall escape me, and none shall wish to escape me.

68. I bring what you much need, yet always have,
69. Not money, amours, dress, eating, but as good;
70. I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but
71. offer the value itself.

72. There is something that comes home to one now and perpetually;
73. It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed--it eludes discussion
74. and print;
75. It is not to be put in a book--it is not in this book;
76. It is for you, whoever you are--it is no farther from you than your
77. hearing and sight are from you;
78. It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest--it is ever provoked by
79. them.

80. You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it;
81. You may read the President's Message, and read nothing about it
82. there;
83. Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury
84. department, or in the daily papers or the weekly papers,
85. Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts
86. of stock.


87. The sun and stars that float in the open air;
88. The apple-shaped earth, and we upon it--surely the drift of them is
89. something grand!
90. I do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and that it is
91. happiness,
92. And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation, or
93. bon-mot, or reconnoissance,
94. And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us,
95. and without luck must be a failure for us,
96. And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain
97. contingency.

98. The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the
99. greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things, the
100. endless pride and out-stretching of man, unspeakable joys and
101. sorrows,
102. The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders
103. that fill each minute of time forever,
104. What have you reckon'd them for, camerado?
105. Have you reckon'd them for a trade, or farm-work? or for the profits
106. of a store?
107. Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's leisure,
108. or a lady's leisure?

109. Have you reckon'd the landscape took substance and form that it might
110. be painted in a picture?
111. Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?
112. Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious
113. combinations, and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the
114. savans?
115. Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?
116. Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?
117. Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or
118. agriculture itself?

119. Old institutions--these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and
120. the practice handed along in manufactures--will we rate them so
121. high?
122. Will we rate our cash and business high?--I have no objection;
123. I rate them as high as the highest--then a child born of a woman and
124. man I rate beyond all rate.

125. We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand;
126. I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are;
127. I am this day just as much in love with them as you;
128. Then I am in love with you, and with all my fellows upon the earth.

129. We consider bibles and religions divine--I do not say they are not
130. divine;
131. I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still;
132. It is not they who give the life--it is you who give the life;
133. Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,
134. than they are shed out of you.


135. When the psalm sings instead of the singer;
136. When the script preaches instead of the preacher;
137. When the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the carver that carved
138. the supporting desk;
139. When I can touch the body of books, by night or by day, and when they
140. touch my body back again;
141. When a university course convinces, like a slumbering woman and child
142. convince;
143. When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's
144. daughter;
145. When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly
146. companions;
147. I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as I do of
148. men and women like you.

149. The sum of all known reverence I add up in you, whoever you are;
150. The President is there in the White House for you--it is not you who
151. are here for him;
152. The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you--not you here for
153. them;
154. The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you;
155. Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the
156. going and coming of commerce and mails, are all for you.

157. List close, my scholars dear!
158. All doctrines, all politics and civilization, exurge from you;
159. All sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed anywhere, are
160. tallied in you;
161. The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records
162. reach, is in you this hour, and myths and tales the same;
163. If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?
164. The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and plays would be
165. vacuums.

166. All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it;
167. (Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines of the
168. arches and cornices?)

169. All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the
170. instruments;
171. It is not the violins and the cornets--it is not the oboe nor the
172. beating drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing
173. his sweet romanza--nor that of the men's chorus, nor that of
174. the women's chorus,
175. It is nearer and farther than they.


176. Will the whole come back then?
177. Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass? is
178. there nothing greater or more?
179. Does all sit there with you, with the mystic, unseen Soul?

180. Strange and hard that paradox true I give;
181. Objects gross and the unseen Soul are one.

182. House-building, measuring, sawing the boards;
183. Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering, tin-roofing,
184. shingle-dressing,
185. Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, ferrying, flagging of side-
186. walks by flaggers,
187. The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal-kiln and
188. brick-kiln,
189. Coal-mines, and all that is down there,--the lamps in the darkness,
190. echoes, songs, what meditations, what vast native thoughts
191. looking through smutch'd faces,
192. Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains, or by the river-banks--men
193. around feeling the melt with huge crowbars--lumps of ore, the
194. due combining of ore, limestone, coal--the blast-furnace and
195. the puddling-furnace, the loup-lump at the bottom of the melt
196. at last--the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars of pig-iron, the
197. strong, clean-shaped T-rail for railroads;
198. Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house, steam-saws,
199. the great mills and factories;
200. Stone-cutting, shapely trimmings for façades, or window or door-
201. lintels--the mallet, the tooth-chisel, the jib to protect the
202. thumb,
203. Oakum, the oakum-chisel, the caulking-iron--the kettle of boiling
204. vault-cement, and the fire under the kettle,
205. The cotton-bale, the stevedore's hook, the saw and buck of the
206. sawyer, the mould of the moulder, the working-knife of the
207. butcher, the ice-saw, and all the work with ice,
208. The implements for daguerreotyping--the tools of the rigger,
209. grappler, sail-maker, block-maker,
210. Goods of gutta-percha, papier-maché, colors, brushes, brush-making,
211. glazier's implements,

212. O you robust, sacred!
213. I cannot tell you how I love you;
214. All I love America for, is contained in men and women like you.

215. The veneer and glue-pot, the confectioner's ornaments, the decanter
216. and glasses, the shears and flat-iron,
217. The awl and knee-strap, the pint measure and quart measure, the
218. counter and stool, the writing-pen of quill or metal--the
219. making of all sorts of edged tools,
220. The brewery, brewing, the malt, the vats, every thing that is done by
221. brewers, also by wine-makers, also vinegar-makers,
222. Leather-dressing, coach-making, boiler-making, rope-twisting,
223. distilling, sign-painting, lime-burning, cotton-picking--
224. electro-plating, electrotyping, stereotyping,
225. Stave-machines, planing-machines, reaping-machines, ploughing-
226. machines, thrashing-machines, steam wagons,
227. The cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponderous dray;
228. Pyrotechny, letting off color'd fire-works at night, fancy figures
229. and jets;
230. Beef on the butcher's stall, the slaughter-house of the butcher, the
231. butcher in his killing-clothes,
232. The pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog-hook, the
233. scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver, the packer's
234. maul, and the plenteous winter-work of pork-packing;
235. Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice--the barrels and the
236. half and quarter barrels, the loaded barges, the high piles on
237. wharves and levees;
238. The men, and the work of the men, on railroads, coasters, fish-boats,
239. canals;
240. The daily routine of your own or any man's life--the shop, yard,
241. store, or factory;
242. These shows all near you by day and night--workman! whoever you are,
243. your daily life!
244. In that and them the heft of the heaviest--in them far more than you
245. estimated, and far less also;
246. In them realities for you and me--in them poems for you and me;
247. In them, not yourself--you and your Soul enclose all things,
248. regardless of estimation;
249. In them the development good--in them, all themes and hints.

250. I do not affirm what you see beyond is futile--I do not advise you to
251. stop;
252. I do not say leadings you thought great are not great;
253. But I say that none lead to greater, than those lead to.


254. Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at last,
255. In things best known to you, finding the best, or as good as the
256. best,
257. In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest, lovingest;
258. Happiness, knowledge, not in another place, but this place--not for
259. another hour, but this hour;
260. Man in the first you see or touch--always in friend, brother, nighest
261. neighbor--Woman in mother, lover, wife;
262. The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or any
263. where,
264. You workwomen and workmen of These States having your own divine and
265. strong life,
266. And all else giving place to men and women like you.
