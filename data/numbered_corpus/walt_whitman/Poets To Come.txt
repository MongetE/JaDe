1. POETS to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!
2. Not to-day is to justify me, and answer what I am for;
3. But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than
4. before known,
5. Arouse! Arouse--for you must justify me--you must answer.

6. I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future,
7. I but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness.

8. I am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a
9. casual look upon you, and then averts his face,
10. Leaving it to you to prove and define it,
11. Expecting the main things from you.
