1. NOT heat flames up and consumes,
2. Not sea-waves hurry in and out,
3. Not the air, delicious and dry, the air of the ripe summer, bears
4. lightly along white down-balls of myriads of seeds,
5. Wafted, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may;
6. Not these--O none of these, more than the flames of me, consuming,
7. burning for his love whom I love!
8. O none, more than I, hurrying in and out:
9. --Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up? O I the
10. same;
11. O nor down-balls, nor perfumes, nor the high, rain-emitting clouds,
12. are borne through the open air,
13. Any more than my Soul is borne through the open air,
14. Wafted in all directions, O love, for friendship, for you.
