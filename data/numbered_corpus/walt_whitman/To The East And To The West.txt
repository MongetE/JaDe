2. To the man of the Seaside State, and of Pennsylvania,
3. To the Kanadian of the North--to the Southerner I love;

5. all men;
6. I believe the main purport of These States is to found a superb
7. friendship, exalt√©, previously unknown,
8. Because I perceive it waits, and has been always waiting, latent in
9. all men.
