1. SOMETHING startles me where I thought I was safest;
2. I withdraw from the still woods I loved;
3. I will not go now on the pastures to walk;
4. I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea;
5. I will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other flesh, to renew
6. me.

7. O how can it be that the ground does not sicken?
8. How can you be alive, you growths of spring?
9. How can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, orchards,
10. grain?
11. Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?
12. Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour dead?

13. Where have you disposed of their carcasses?
14. Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations;
15. Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
16. I do not see any of it upon you to-day--or perhaps I am deceiv'd;
17. I will run a furrow with my plough--I will press my spade through the
18. sod, and turn it up underneath;
19. I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.


20. Behold this compost! behold it well!
21. Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick person--Yet behold!
22. The grass of spring covers the prairies,
23. The bean bursts noislessly through the mould in the garden,
24. The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,
25. The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,
26. The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its
27. graves,
28. The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,
29. The he-birds carol mornings and evenings, while the she-birds sit on
30. their nests,
31. The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,
32. The new-born of animals appear--the calf is dropt from the cow, the
33. colt from the mare,
34. Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green
35. leaves,
36. Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk--the lilacs bloom in the
37. door-yards;
38. The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata
39. of sour dead.

40. What chemistry!
41. That the winds are really not infectious,
42. That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea, which
43. is so amorous after me,
44. That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its
45. tongues,
46. That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited
47. themselves in it,
48. That all is clean forever and forever.
49. That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,
50. That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,
51. That the fruits of the apple-orchard, and of the orange-orchard--that
52. melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,
53. That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,
54. Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once a
55. catching disease.


56. Now I am terrified at the Earth! it is that calm and patient,
57. It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,
58. It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless
59. successions of diseas'd corpses,
60. It distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,
61. It renews with such unwitting looks, its prodigal, annual, sumptuous
62. crops,
63. It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from
64. them at last.
