1. How dare one say it?
2. After the cycles, poems, singers, plays,
3. Vaunted Ionia's, India's -Homer, Shakespeare -the long, long times, thick
4. dotted roads, areas,
5. The shining clusters and the Milky Ways of stars -Nature's pulses reaped,
6. All retrospective passions, heroes, war, love, adoration,
7. All ages' plummets dropped to their utmost depths,
8. All human lives, throats, wishes, brains -all experiences' utterance;
9. After the countless songs, or long or short, all tongues, all lands,
10. Still something not yet told in poesy's voice or print -something lacking,
11. (Who knows? the best yet unexpressed and lacking.)
