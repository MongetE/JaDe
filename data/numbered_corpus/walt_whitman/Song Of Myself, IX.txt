1. The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
2. The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,
3. The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
4. The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.

5. I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,
6. I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
7. I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,
8. And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.
