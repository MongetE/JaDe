1. WHERE the city's ceaseless crowd moves on, the live-long day,
2. Withdrawn, I join a group of children watching--I pause aside with
3. them.

4. By the curb, toward the edge of the flagging,
5. A knife-grinder works at his wheel, sharpening a great knife;
6. Bending over, he carefully holds it to the stone--by foot and knee,
7. With measur'd tread, he turns rapidly--As he presses with light but
8. firm hand,
9. Forth issue, then, in copious golden jets,
10. Sparkles from the wheel.

11. The scene, and all its belongings--how they seize and affect me!
12. The sad, sharp-chinn'd old man, with worn clothes, and broad
13. shoulder-band of leather;
14. Myself, effusing and fluid--a phantom curiously floating--now here
15. absorb'd and arrested;

16. The group, (an unminded point, set in a vast surrounding;)
17. The attentive, quiet children--the loud, proud, restive base of the
18. streets;
19. The low, hoarse purr of the whirling stone--the light-press'd blade,
20. Diffusing, dropping, sideways-darting, in tiny showers of gold,
21. Sparkles from the wheel.
