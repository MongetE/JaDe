1. EARTH! my likeness!
2. Though you look so impassive, ample and spheric there,
3. I now suspect that is not all;
4. I now suspect there is something fierce in you, eligible to burst
5. forth;
6. For an athlete is enamour'd of me--and I of him;
7. But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me, eligible
8. to burst forth,
9. I dare not tell it in words--not even in these songs.
