1. BY the City Dead-House, by the gate,
2. As idly sauntering, wending my way from the clangor,
3. I curious pause--for lo! an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute
4. brought;
5. Her corpse they deposit unclaim'd--it lies on the damp brick
6. pavement;
7. The divine woman, her body--I see the Body--I look on it alone,
8. That house once full of passion and beauty--all else I notice not;
9. Nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odors
10. morbific impress me;
11. But the house alone--that wondrous house--that delicate fair house--
12. that ruin!
13. That immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings ever built!
14. Or white-domed Capitol itself, with majestic figure surmounted--or
15. all the old high-spired cathedrals;
16. That little house alone, more than them all--poor, desperate house!
17. Fair, fearful wreck! tenement of a Soul! itself a Soul!
18. Unclaim'd, avoided house! take one breath from my tremulous lips;
19. Take one tear, dropt aside as I go, for thought of you,
20. Dead house of love! house of madness and sin, crumbled! crush'd!
21. House of life--erewhile talking and laughing--but ah, poor house!
22. dead, even then;
23. Months, years, an echoing, garnish'd house--but dead, dead, dead.
