1. O SUN of real peace! O hastening light!
2. O free and extatic! O what I here, preparing, warble for!
3. O the sun of the world will ascend, dazzling, and take his height--
4. and you too, O my Ideal, will surely ascend!
5. O so amazing and broad--up there resplendent, darting and burning!
6. O vision prophetic, stagger'd with weight of light! with pouring
7. glories!
8. O lips of my soul, already becoming powerless!
9. O ample and grand Presidentiads! Now the war, the war is over!
10. New history! new heroes! I project you!
11. Visions of poets! only you really last! sweep on! sweep on!
12. O heights too swift and dizzy yet!
13. O purged and luminous! you threaten me more than I can stand!
14. (I must not venture--the ground under my feet menaces me--it will not
15. support me:
16. O future too immense,)--O present, I return, while yet I may, to you.
