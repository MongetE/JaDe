1. FROM Paumanock starting, I fly like a bird,
2. Around and around to soar, to sing the idea of all;
3. To the north betaking myself, to sing there arctic songs,
4. To Kanada, till I absorb Kanada in myself--to Michigan then,
5. To Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, to sing their songs, (they are
6. inimitable;)
7. Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs--to Missouri and Kansas and
8. Arkansas, to sing theirs,
9. To Tennessee and Kentucky--to the Carolinas and Georgia, to sing
10. theirs,
11. To Texas, and so along up toward California, to roam accepted
12. everywhere;
13. To sing first, (to the tap of the war-drum, if need be,)
14. The idea of all--of the western world, one and inseparable.
15. And then the song of each member of These States.
