1. Hush'd be the camps today,
2. And soldiers let us drape our war-worn weapons,
3. And each with musing soul retire to celebrate,
4. Our dear commander's death.

5. No more for him life's stormy conflicts,
6. Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time's dark events,
7. Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.

8. But sing poet in our name,
9. Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it truly.

10. As they invault the coffin there,
11. Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,
12. For the heavy hearts of soldiers.
