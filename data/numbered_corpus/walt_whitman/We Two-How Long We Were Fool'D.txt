1. WE two--how long we were fool'd!
2. Now transmuted, we swiftly escape, as Nature escapes;
3. We are Nature--long have we been absent, but now we return;
4. We become plants, leaves, foliage, roots, bark;
5. We are bedded in the ground--we are rocks;
6. We are oaks--we grow in the openings side by side;
7. We browse--we are two among the wild herds, spontaneous as any;
8. We are two fishes swimming in the sea together;
9. We are what the locust blossoms are--we drop scent around the lanes,
10. mornings and evenings;
11. We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals;
12. We are two predatory hawks--we soar above, and look down;
13. We are two resplendent suns--we it is who balance ourselves, orbic
14. and stellar--we are as two comets;
15. We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods--we spring on prey;
16. We are two clouds, forenoons and afternoons, driving overhead;
17. We are seas mingling--we are two of those cheerful waves, rolling
18. over each other, and interwetting each other;
19. We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious,
20. impervious:
21. We are snow, rain, cold, darkness--we are each product and influence
22. of the globe;
23. We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again--we two
24. have;
25. We have voided all but freedom, and all but our own joy.
