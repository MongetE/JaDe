1. CITY of orgies, walks and joys!
2. City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make
3. you illustrious,
4. Not the pageants of you--not your shifting tableaux, your spectacles,
5. repay me;
6. Not the interminable rows of your houses--nor the ships at the
7. wharves,
8. Nor the processions in the streets, nor the bright windows, with
9. goods in them;
10. Nor to converse with learn'd persons, or bear my share in the soiree
11. or feast;
12. Not those--but, as I pass, O Manhattan! your frequent and swift flash
13. of eyes offering me love,
14. Offering response to my own--these repay me;
15. Lovers, continual lovers, only repay me.
