1. WHY reclining, interrogating? Why myself and all drowsing?
2. What deepening twilight! scum floating atop of the waters!
3. Who are they, as bats and night-dogs, askant in the Capitol?
4. What a filthy Presidentiad! (O south, your torrid suns! O north, your
5. arctic freezings!)
6. Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that the
7. President?
8. Then I will sleep awhile yet--for I see that These States sleep, for
9. reasons;
10. (With gathering murk--with muttering thunder and lambent shoots, we
11. all duly awake,
12. South, north, east, west, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)
