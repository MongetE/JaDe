1. WHISPERS of heavenly death, murmur'd I hear;
2. Labial gossip of night--sibilant chorals;
3. Footsteps gently ascending--mystical breezes, wafted soft and low;
4. Ripples of unseen rivers--tides of a current, flowing, forever
5. flowing;
6. (Or is it the plashing of tears? the measureless waters of human
7. tears?)

8. I see, just see, skyward, great cloud-masses;
9. Mournfully, slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing;
10. With, at times, a half-dimm'd, sadden'd, far-off star,
11. Appearing and disappearing.

12. (Some parturition, rather--some solemn, immortal birth:
13. On the frontiers, to eyes impenetrable,
14. Some Soul is passing over.)
