1. WE two boys together clinging,
2. One the other never leaving,
3. Up and down the roads going--North and South excursions making,
4. Power enjoying--elbows stretching--fingers clutching,
5. Arm'd and fearless--eating, drinking, sleeping, loving,
6. No law less than ourselves owning--sailing, soldiering, thieving,
7. threatening,
8. Misers, menials, priests alarming--air breathing, water drinking, on
9. the turf or the sea-beach dancing,
10. Cities wrenching, ease scorning, statutes mocking, feebleness
11. chasing,
12. Fulfilling our foray.
