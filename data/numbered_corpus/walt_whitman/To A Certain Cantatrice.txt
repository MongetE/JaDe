1. HERE, take this gift!
2. I was reserving it for some hero, speaker, or General,
3. One who should serve the good old cause, the great Idea, the progress
4. and freedom of the race;
5. Some brave confronter of despots--some daring rebel;
6. --But I see that what I was reserving, belongs to you just as much as
7. to any.
