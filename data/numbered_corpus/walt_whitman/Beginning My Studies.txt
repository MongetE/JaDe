1. BEGINNING my studies, the first step pleas'd me so much,
2. The mere fact, consciousness--these forms--the power of motion,
3. The least insect or animal--the senses--eyesight--love;
4. The first step, I say, aw'd me and pleas'd me so much,
5. I have hardly gone, and hardly wish'd to go, any farther,
6. But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs.
