1. To a Common Prostitute

2. BE composed--be at ease with me--I am Walt Whitman, liberal and lusty
3. as Nature;
4. Not till the sun excludes you, do I exclude you;
5. Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you, and the leaves to
6. rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for
7. you.

8. My girl, I appoint with you an appointment--and I charge you that you
9. make preparation to be worthy to meet me,
10. And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.

11. Till then, I salute you with a significant look, that you do not
12. forget me.
