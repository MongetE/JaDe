1. I see before me now a traveling army halting,
2. Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,
3. Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high,
4. Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen,
5. The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the mountain,
6. The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,
7. And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, Studded, breaking out, the eternal stars.
