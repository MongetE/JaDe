1. TO THE garden, the world, anew ascending,
2. Potent mates, daughters, sons, preluding,
3. The love, the life of their bodies, meaning and being,
4. Curious, here behold my resurrection, after slumber;
5. The revolving cycles, in their wide sweep, have brought me again,
6. Amorous, mature--all beautiful to me--all wondrous;
7. My limbs, and the quivering fire that ever plays through them, for
8. reasons, most wondrous;
9. Existing, I peer and penetrate still,
10. Content with the present--content with the past,
11. By my side, or back of me, Eve following,
12. Or in front, and I following her just the same.
