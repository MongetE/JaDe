1. PENSIVE, on her dead gazing, I heard the Mother of All,
2. Desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle-
3. fields gazing;
4. (As the last gun ceased--but the scent of the powder-smoke linger'd;)
5. As she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd:
6. Absorb them well, O my earth, she cried--I charge you, lose not my
7. sons! lose not an atom;
8. And you streams, absorb them well, taking their dear blood;
9. And you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly,
10. And all you essences of soil and growth--and you, my rivers' depths;
11. And you, mountain sides--and the woods where my dear children's
12. blood, trickling, redden'd;
13. And you trees, down in your roots, to bequeath to all future
14. trees,
15. My dead absorb--my young men's beautiful bodies absorb--and their
16. precious, precious, precious blood;
17. Which holding in trust for me, faithfully back again give me, many a
18. year hence,
19. In unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence;
20. In blowing airs from the fields, back again give me my darlings--give
21. my immortal heroes;
22. Exhale me them centuries hence--breathe me their breath--let not an
23. atom be lost;
24. O years and graves! O air and soil! O my dead, an aroma sweet!
25. Exhale them perennial, sweet death, years, centuries hence.
