1. I SAW in Louisiana a live-oak growing,
2. All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the branches;
3. Without any companion it grew there, uttering joyous leaves of dark
4. green,
5. And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself;
6. But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves, standing alone
7. there, without its friend, its lover near--for I knew I could
8. not;
9. And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and
10. twined around it a little moss,
11. And brought it away--and I have placed it in sight in my room;
12. It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,
13. (For I believe lately I think of little else than of them;)
14. Yet it remains to me a curious token--it makes me think of manly
15. love;
16. For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana,
17. solitary, in a wide flat space,
18. Uttering joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a lover, near,
19. I know very well I could not.
