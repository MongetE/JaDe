1. I SEE before me now, a traveling army halting;
2. Below, a fertile valley spread, with barns, and the orchards of
3. summer;
4. Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt in places, rising
5. high;
6. Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes, dingily
7. seen;
8. The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the
9. mountain;
10. The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized flickering;
11. And over all, the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,
12. breaking out, the eternal stars.
