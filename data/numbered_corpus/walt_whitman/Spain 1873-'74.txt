1. OUT of the murk of heaviest clouds,
2. Out of the feudal wrecks, and heap'd-up skeletons of kings,
3. Out of that old entire European debris--the shatter'd mummeries,
4. Ruin'd cathedrals, crumble of palaces, tombs of priests,
5. Lo! Freedom's features, fresh, undimm'd, look forth--the same
6. immortal face looks forth;
7. (A glimpse as of thy mother's face, Columbia,
8. A flash significant as of a sword,
9. Beaming towards thee.)

10. Nor think we forget thee, Maternal;
11. Lag'd'st thou so long? Shall the clouds close again upon thee?
12. Ah, but thou hast Thyself now appear'd to us--we know thee;
13. Thou hast given us a sure proof, the glimpse of Thyself;
14. Thou waitest there, as everywhere, thy time.
