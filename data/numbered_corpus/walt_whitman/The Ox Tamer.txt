1. IN a faraway northern county, in the placid, pastoral region,
2. Lives my farmer friend, the theme of my recitative, a famous Tamer of
3. Oxen:
4. There they bring him the three-year-olds and the four-year-olds, to
5. break them;
6. He will take the wildest steer in the world, and break him and tame
7. him;
8. He will go, fearless, without any whip, where the young bullock
9. chafes up and down the yard;
10. The bullock's head tosses restless high in the air, with raging eyes;
11. Yet, see you! how soon his rage subsides--how soon this Tamer tames
12. him:
13. See you! on the farms hereabout, a hundred oxen, young and old--and
14. he is the man who has tamed them;
15. They all know him--all are affectionate to him;
16. See you! some are such beautiful animals--so lofty looking!
17. Some are buff color'd--some mottled--one has a white line running
18. along his back--some are brindled,
19. Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)--See you! the bright
20. hides;
21. See, the two with stars on their foreheads--See, the round bodies and
22. broad backs;
23. See, how straight and square they stand on their legs--See, what
24. fine, sagacious eyes;
25. See, how they watch their Tamer--they wish him near them--how they
26. turn to look after him!
27. What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from
28. them:
29. --Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics,
30. poems depart--all else departs;)
31. I confess I envy only his fascination--my silent, illiterate friend,
32. Whom a hundred oxen love, there in his life on farms,
33. In the northern county far, in the placid, pastoral region.
