1. AT the last, tenderly,
2. From the walls of the powerful, fortress'd house,
3. From the clasp of the knitted locks--from the keep of the well-closed
4. doors,
5. Let me be wafted.

6. Let me glide noiselessly forth;
7. With the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper
8. Set ope the doors, O soul!

9. Tenderly! be not impatient!
10. (Strong is your hold, O mortal flesh!
11. Strong is your hold, O love!)
