1. RECORDERS ages hence!
2. Come, I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior--I will
3. tell you what to say of me;
4. Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest
5. lover,
6. The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was
7. fondest,
8. Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love
9. within him--and freely pour'd it forth,
10. Who often walk'd lonesome walks, thinking of his dear friends, his
11. lovers,
12. Who pensive, away from one he lov'd, often lay sleepless and
13. dissatisfied at night,
14. Who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he lov'd might
15. secretly be indifferent to him,
16. Whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in woods, on
17. hills, he and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain,
18. apart from other men,
19. Who oft as he saunter'd the streets, curv'd with his arm the shoulder
20. of his friend--while the arm of his friend rested upon him
21. also.
