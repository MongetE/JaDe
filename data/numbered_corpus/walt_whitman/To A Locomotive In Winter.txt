1. THEE for my recitative!
2. Thee in the driving storm, even as now--the snow--the winter-day
3. declining;
4. Thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and thy beat
5. convulsive;
6. Thy black cylindric body, golden brass, and silvery steel;
7. Thy ponderous side-bars, parallel and connecting rods, gyrating,
8. shuttling at thy sides;
9. Thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar--now tapering in the
10. distance;
11. Thy great protruding head-light, fix'd in front;
12. Thy long, pale, floating vapor-pennants, tinged with delicate purple;
13. The dense and murky clouds out-belching from thy smoke-stack;
14. Thy knitted frame--thy springs and valves--the tremulous twinkle of
15. thy wheels;
16. Thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily-following,
17. Through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily careering:
18. Type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse of the
19. continent!
20. For once, come serve the Muse, and merge in verse, even as here I see
21. thee,
22. With storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling snow;
23. By day, thy warning, ringing bell to sound its notes,
24. By night, thy silent signal lamps to swing.

25. Fierce-throated beauty!
26. Roll through my chant, with all thy lawless music! thy swinging lamps
27. at night;
28. Thy piercing, madly-whistled laughter! thy echoes, rumbling like an
29. earthquake, rousing all!
30. Law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding;
31. (No sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,)
32. Thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd,
33. Launch'd o'er the prairies wide--across the lakes,
34. To the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.
