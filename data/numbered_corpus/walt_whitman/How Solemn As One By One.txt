1. HOW solemn, as one by one,
2. As the ranks returning, all worn and sweaty--as the men file by where
3. I stand;
4. As the faces, the masks appear--as I glance at the faces, studying
5. the masks;
6. (As I glance upward out of this page, studying you, dear friend,
7. whoever you are;)
8. How solemn the thought of my whispering soul, to each in the ranks,
9. and to you;
10. I see behind each mask, that wonder, a kindred soul;
11. O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,
12. Nor the bayonet stab what you really are:
13. ... The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,
14. Waiting, secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,
15. Nor the bayonet stab, O friend!
