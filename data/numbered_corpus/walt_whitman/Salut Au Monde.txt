1. O TAKE my hand, Walt Whitman!
2. Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!
3. Such join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next!
4. Each answering all--each sharing the earth with all.

5. What widens within you, Walt Whitman?
6. What waves and soils exuding?
7. What climes? what persons and lands are here?
8. Who are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?
9. Who are the girls? who are the married women?
10. Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about each
11. other's necks?
12. What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?
13. What are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?
14. What myriads of dwellings are they, fill'd with dwellers?


15. Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;
16. Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east--America is provided for in the
17. west;
18. Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,
19. Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends;
20. Within me is the longest day--the sun wheels in slanting rings--it
21. does not set for months;
22. Stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the
23. horizon, and sinks again;
24. Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,
25. Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.


26. What do you hear, Walt Whitman?

27. I hear the workman singing, and the farmer's wife singing;
28. I hear in the distance the sounds of children, and of animals early
29. in the day;
30. I hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Tennessee and
31. Kentucky, hunting on hills;
32. I hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing the wild horse;
33. I hear the Spanish dance, with castanets, in the chestnut shade, to
34. the rebeck and guitar;
35. I hear continual echoes from the Thames;
36. I hear fierce French liberty songs;

38. poems;

40. in the glare of pine-knots;
41. I hear the strong baritone of the 'long-shore-men of Mannahatta;
42. I hear the stevedores unlading the cargoes, and singing;
43. I hear the screams of the water-fowl of solitary north-west lakes;
44. I hear the rustling pattering of locusts, as they strike the grain
45. and grass with the showers of their terrible clouds;
46. I hear the Coptic refrain, toward sundown, pensively falling on the
47. breast of the black venerable vast mother, the Nile;
48. I hear the bugles of raft-tenders on the streams of Kanada;
49. I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule;
50. I hear the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of the mosque;
51. I hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches--I hear
52. the responsive bass and soprano;
53. I hear the wail of utter despair of the white-hair'd Irish
54. grandparents, when they learn the death of their grandson;
55. I hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice, putting to sea
56. at Okotsk;
57. I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, as the slaves march on--as the
58. husky gangs pass on by twos and threes, fasten'd together with
59. wrist-chains and ankle-chains;
60. I hear the entreaties of women tied up for punishment--I hear the
61. sibilant whisk of thongs through the air;
62. I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms;
63. I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong legends of
64. the Romans;
65. I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death of the beautiful
66. God--the Christ;
67. I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the loves, wars,
68. adages, transmitted safely to this day, from poets who wrote
69. three thousand years ago.


70. What do you see, Walt Whitman?
71. Who are they you salute, and that one after another salute you?

72. I see a great round wonder rolling through the air;
73. I see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, grave-yards, jails, factories,
74. palaces, hovels, huts of barbarians, tents of nomads, upon the
75. surface;
76. I see the shaded part on one side, where the sleepers are sleeping--
77. and the sun-lit part on the other side,
78. I see the curious silent change of the light and shade,
79. I see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants of them, as
80. my land is to me.

81. I see plenteous waters;

105. islands,
106. The inland fresh-tasted seas of North America,
107. The White Sea, and the sea around Greenland.

108. I behold the mariners of the world;
109. Some are in storms--some in the night, with the watch on the look-
110. out;
111. Some drifting helplessly--some with contagious diseases.

112. I behold the sail and steamships of the world, some in clusters in
113. port, some on their voyages;

129. Cambodia;
130. Others wait at the wharves of Manhattan, steam'd up, ready to start;

137. I see the tracks of the rail-roads of the earth;
138. I see them welding State to State, city to city, through North
139. America;
140. I see them in Great Britain, I see them in Europe;
141. I see them in Asia and in Africa.

142. I see the electric telegraphs of the earth;

160. I see the place of the idea of the Deity incarnated by avatars in
161. human forms;

164. exhorters;
165. I see where druids walked the groves of Mona--I see the mistletoe and
166. vervain;
167. I see the temples of the deaths of the bodies of Gods--I see the old
168. signifiers.

169. I see Christ once more eating the bread of his last supper, in the
170. midst of youths and old persons;
171. I see where the strong divine young man, the Hercules, toil'd
172. faithfully and long, and then died;
173. I see the place of the innocent rich life and hapless fate of the
174. beautiful nocturnal son, the full-limb'd Bacchus;
175. I see Kneph, blooming, drest in blue, with the crown of feathers on
176. his head;
177. I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-beloved, saying to the people,
178. Do not weep for me,
179. This is not my true country, I have lived banish'd from my true
180. country--I now go back there,
181. I return to the celestial sphere, where every one goes in his
182. turn.


183. I see the battle-fields of the earth--grass grows upon them, and
184. blossoms and corn;
185. I see the tracks of ancient and modern expeditions.

186. I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages of the unknown
187. events, heroes, records of the earth.

188. I see the places of the sagas;
189. I see pine-trees and fir-trees torn by northern blasts;
190. I see granite boulders and cliffs--I see green meadows and lakes;
191. I see the burial-cairns of Scandinavian warriors;
192. I see them raised high with stones, by the marge of restless oceans,
193. that the dead men's spirits, when they wearied of their quiet
194. graves, might rise up through the mounds, and gaze on the
195. tossing billows, and be refresh'd by storms, immensity,

214. I see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of Paumanok, quite
215. still;
216. I see ten fishermen waiting--they discover now a thick school of
217. mossbonkers--they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,
218. The boats separate--they diverge and row off, each on its rounding
219. course to the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers;
220. The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,
221. Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats--others stand negligently
222. ankle-deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs;
223. The boats are partly drawn up--the water slaps against them;
224. On the sand, in heaps and winrows, well out from the water, lie the
225. green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.


226. I see the despondent red man in the west, lingering about the banks
227. of Moingo, and about Lake Pepin;

239. them;
240. I am a real Parisian;
241. I am a habitan of Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Constantinople;
242. I am of Adelaide, Sidney, Melbourne;

244. I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons, Brussels, Berne,
245. Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin, Florence;
246. I belong in Moscow, Cracow, Warsaw--or northward in Christiania or
247. Stockholm--or in Siberian Irkutsk--or in some street in
248. Iceland;
249. I descend upon all those cities, and rise from them again.


250. I see vapors exhaling from unexplored countries;
251. I see the savage types, the bow and arrow, the poison'd splint, the

264. I see Egypt and the Egyptians--I see the pyramids and obelisks;
265. I look on chisel'd histories, songs, philosophies, cut in slabs of
266. sand-stone, or on granite-blocks;
267. I see at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mummies, embalm'd, swathed in
268. linen cloth, lying there many centuries;
269. I look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes, the side-drooping
270. neck, the hands folded across the breast.

271. I see the menials of the earth, laboring;
272. I see the prisoners in the prisons;
273. I see the defective human bodies of the earth;
274. I see the blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunchbacks, lunatics;
275. I see the pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers, slave-makers of the
276. earth;
277. I see the helpless infants, and the helpless old men and women.

278. I see male and female everywhere;
279. I see the serene brotherhood of philosophs;
280. I see the constructiveness of my race;
281. I see the results of the perseverance and industry of my race;
282. I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations--I go among them--I
283. mix indiscriminately,
284. And I salute all the inhabitants of the earth.

329. Health to you! Good will to you all--from me and America sent.

330. Each of us inevitable;
331. Each of us limitless--each of us with his or her right upon the

355. (You will come forward in due time to my side.)

356. My spirit has pass'd in compassion and determination around the whole
357. earth;
358. I have look'd for equals and lovers, and found them ready for me in
359. all lands;
360. I think some divine rapport has equalized me with them.


361. O vapors! I think I have risen with you, and moved away to distant
362. continents, and fallen down there, for reasons;
363. I think I have blown with you, O winds;
364. O waters, I have finger'd every shore with you.

365. I have run through what any river or strait of the globe has run
366. through;
367. I have taken my stand on the bases of peninsulas, and on the high
368. embedded rocks, to cry thence.

369. Salut au monde!
370. What cities the light or warmth penetrates, I penetrate those cities
371. myself;
372. All islands to which birds wing their way, I wing my way myself.

373. Toward all,
374. I raise high the perpendicular hand--I make the signal,
375. To remain after me in sight forever,
376. For all the haunts and homes of men.
