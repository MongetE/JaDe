1. SMALL is the theme of the following Chant, yet the greatest--namely,
2. One's-Self--that wondrous thing a simple, separate person.
3. That, for the use of the New World, I sing.
4. Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy
5. alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse;--I say the Form
6. complete is worthier far. The female equal with the male, I
7. sing,
8. Nor cease at the theme of One's-Self. I speak the word of the modern,
9. the word En-Masse:
10. My Days I sing, and the Lands--with interstice I knew of hapless War.

11. O friend whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to commence, I feel
12. through every leaf the pressure of your hand, which I return.
13. And thus upon our journey link'd together let us go.
