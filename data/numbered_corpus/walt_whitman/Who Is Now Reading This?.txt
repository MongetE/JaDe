1. May-be one is now reading this who knows some wrong-doing of my past
2. life,
3. Or may-be a stranger is reading this who has secretly loved me,
4. Or may-be one who meets all my grand assumptions and egotisms with
5. derision,
6. Or may-be one who is puzzled at me.

7. As if I were not puzzled at myself!
8. Or as if I never deride myself! (O conscience-struck! O self-
9. convicted!)
10. Or as if I do not secretly love strangers! (O tenderly, a long time,
11. and never avow it;)
12. Or as if I did not see, perfectly well, interior in myself, the stuff
13. of wrong-doing,
14. Or as if it could cease transpiring from me until it must cease.
