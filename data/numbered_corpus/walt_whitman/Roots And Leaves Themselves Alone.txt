1. ROOTS and leaves themselves alone are these;
2. Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods, and from the
3. pond-side,
4. Breast-sorrel and pinks of love--fingers that wind around tighter
5. than vines,
6. Gushes from the throats of birds, hid in the foliage of trees, as the
7. sun is risen;
8. Breezes of land and love--breezes set from living shores out to you
9. on the living sea--to you, O sailors!
10. Frost-mellow'd berries, and Third-month twigs, offer'd fresh to young
11. persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up,
12. Love-buds, put before you and within you, whoever you are,
13. Buds to be unfolded on the old terms;
14. If you bring the warmth of the sun to them, they will open, and bring
15. form, color, perfume, to you;
16. If you become the aliment and the wet, they will become flowers,
17. fruits, tall blanches and trees.
