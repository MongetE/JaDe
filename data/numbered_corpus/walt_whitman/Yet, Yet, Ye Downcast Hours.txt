1. YET, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also;
2. Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles!
3. Earth to a chamber of mourning turns--I hear the o'erweening, mocking
4. voice,
5. Matter is conqueror--matter, triumphant only, continues onward.


6. Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me,
7. The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain,
8. The Sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,
9. Come tell me where I am speeding--tell me my destination.


10. I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,
11. I approach, hear, behold--the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,
12. your mute inquiry,
13. Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me:
14. Old age, alarm'd, uncertain--A young woman's voice, appealing to me
15. for comfort;
16. A young man's voice, Shall I not escape?
