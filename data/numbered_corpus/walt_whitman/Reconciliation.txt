1. WORD over all, beautiful as the sky!
2. Beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be
3. utterly lost;
4. That the hands of the sisters Death and Night, incessantly softly
5. wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world:
6. ... For my enemy is dead--a man divine as myself is dead;
7. I look where he lies, white-faced and still, in the coffin--I draw
8. near;
9. I bend down, and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the
10. coffin.
