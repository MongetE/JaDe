1. ONCE I pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my brain, for
2. future use, with its shows, architecture, customs, and
3. traditions;
4. Yet now, of all that city, I remember only a woman I casually met
5. there, who detain'd me for love of me;
6. Day by day and night by night we were together,--All else has long
7. been forgotten by me;
8. I remember, I say, only that woman who passionately clung to me;
9. Again we wander--we love--we separate again;
10. Again she holds me by the hand--I must not go!
11. I see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremulous.
