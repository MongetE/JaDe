1. DELICATE cluster! flag of teeming life!
2. Covering all my lands! all my sea-shores lining!
3. Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle
4. pressing!
5. How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)
6. Flag cerulean! sunny flag! with the orbs of night dappled!
7. Ah my silvery beauty! ah my woolly white and crimson!
8. Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!
9. My sacred one, my mother.
