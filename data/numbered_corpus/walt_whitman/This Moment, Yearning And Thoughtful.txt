1. THIS moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone,
2. It seems to me there are other men in other lands, yearning and
3. thoughtful;
4. It seems to me I can look over and behold them, in Germany, Italy,
5. France, Spain--or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or
6. India--talking other dialects;
7. And it seems to me if I could know those men, I should become
8. attached to them, as I do to men in my own lands;
9. O I know we should be brethren and lovers,
10. I know I should be happy with them.
