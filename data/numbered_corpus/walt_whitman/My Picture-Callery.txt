1. IN a little house keep I pictures suspended, it is not a fix'd house,
2. It is round, it is only a few inches from one side to the other;
3. Yet behold, it has room for all the shows of the world, all memories?
4. Here the tableaus of life, and here the groupings of death;
5. Here, do you know this? this is cicerone himself,
6. With finger rais'd he points to the prodigal pictures.
