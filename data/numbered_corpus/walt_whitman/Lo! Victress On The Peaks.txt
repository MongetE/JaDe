1. LO! Victress on the peaks!
2. Where thou, with mighty brow, regarding the world,
3. (The world, O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee;)
4. Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all;
5. Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,
6. Flauntest now unharm'd, in immortal soundness and bloom--lo! in these
7. hours supreme,
8. No poem proud, I, chanting, bring to thee--nor mastery's rapturous
9. verse;
10. But a book, containing night's darkness, and blood-dripping wounds,
11. And psalms of the dead.
