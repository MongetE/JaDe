1. FROM far Dakota's ca√±ons,
2. Lands of the wild ravine, the dusky Sioux, the lonesome stretch, the
3. silence,
4. Haply to-day a mournful wail, haply a trumpet-note for heroes.

5. The battle-bulletin,
6. The Indian ambuscade, the craft, the fatal environment,
7. The cavalry companies fighting to the last in sternest heroism,
8. In the midst of their little circle, with their slaughter'd horses
9. for breastworks,
10. The fall of Custer and all his officers and men.

11. Continues yet the old, old legend of our race,
12. The loftiest of life upheld by death,
13. The ancient banner perfectly maintain'd,
14. O lesson opportune, O how I welcome thee!
15. As sitting in dark days,
16. Lone, sulky, through the time's thick murk looking in vain for light,
17. for hope,
18. From unsuspected parts a fierce and momentary proof,
19. (The sun there at the centre though conceal'd,
20. Electric life forever at the centre,)
21. Breaks forth a lightning flash.

22. Thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle,
23. I erewhile saw, with erect head, pressing ever in front, bearing a
24. bright sword in thy hand,
25. Now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds,
26. (I bring no dirge for it or thee, I bring a glad triumphal sonnet,)
27. Desperate and glorious, aye in defeat most desperate, most glorious,
28. After thy many battles in which never yielding up a gun or a color
29. Leaving behind thee a memory sweet to soldiers,
30. Thou yieldest up thyself.
