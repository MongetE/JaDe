1. I HEARD you, solemn-sweet pipes of the organ, as last Sunday morn I
2. pass'd the church;
3. Winds of autumn!--as I walk'd the woods at dusk, I heard your long-
4. stretch'd sighs, up above, so mournful;
5. I heard the perfect Italian tenor, singing at the opera--I heard the
6. soprano in the midst of the quartet singing;
7. ... Heart of my love!--you too I heard, murmuring low, through one of
8. the wrists around my head;
9. Heard the pulse of you, when all was still, ringing little bells last
10. night under my ear.
