1. And who art thou? said I to the soft-falling shower,
2. Which, strange to tell, gave me an answer, as here translated:
3. I am the Poem of Earth, said the voice of the rain,
4. Eternal I rise impalpable out of the land and the bottomless sea,
5. Upward to heaven, whence, vaguely form'd, altogether changed, and
6. yet the same,
7. I descend to lave the drouths, atomies, dust-layers of the globe,
8. And all that in them without me were seeds only, latent, unborn;
9. And forever, by day and night, I give back life to my own origin,
10. and make pure and beautify it;
11. (For song, issuing from its birth-place, after fulfilment, wandering,
12. Reck'd or unreck'd, duly with love returns.)
