1. LONG, too long, O land,
2. Traveling roads all even and peaceful, you learn'd from joys and
3. prosperity only;
4. But now, ah now, to learn from crises of anguish--advancing,
5. grappling with direst fate, and recoiling not;
6. And now to conceive, and show to the world, what your children
7. en-masse really are;
8. (For who except myself has yet conceiv'd what your children en-masse
9. really are?)
