1. ON journeys through the States we start,
2. (Ay, through the world--urged by these songs,
3. Sailing henceforth to every land--to every sea;)
4. We, willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all.

5. We have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves, and passing on,
6. We have said, Why should not a man or woman do as much as the
7. seasons, and effuse as much?

8. We dwell a while in every city and town;
9. We pass through Kanada, the north-east, the vast valley of the
10. Mississippi, and the Southern States;
11. We confer on equal terms with each of The States,
12. We make trial of ourselves, and invite men and women to hear;
13. We say to ourselves, Remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the body
14. and the Soul;
15. Dwell a while and pass on--Be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic,
16. And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return,
17. And may be just as much as the seasons.
