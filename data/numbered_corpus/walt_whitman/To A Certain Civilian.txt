1. DID YOU ask dulcet rhymes from me?
2. Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?
3. Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?
4. Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor
5. am I now;
6. (I have been born of the same as the war was born;
7. The drum-corps' harsh rattle is to me sweet music--I love well the
8. martial dirge,
9. With slow wail, and convulsive throb, leading the officer's funeral:)
10. --What to such as you, anyhow, such a poet as I?--therefore leave my
11. works,
12. And go lull yourself with what you can understand--and with piano-
13. tunes;
14. For I lull nobody--and you will never understand me.
