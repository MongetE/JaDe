1. IN the new garden, in all the parts,
2. In cities now, modern, I wander,
3. Though the second or third result, or still further, primitive yet,
4. Days, places, indifferent--though various, the same,
5. Time, Paradise, the Mannahatta, the prairies, finding me unchanged,
6. Death indifferent--Is it that I lived long since? Was I buried very
7. long ago?
8. For all that, I may now be watching you here, this moment;
9. For the future, with determined will, I seek--the woman of the
10. future,
11. You, born years, centuries after me, I seek.
