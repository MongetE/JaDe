1. OF him I love day and night, I dream'd I heard he was dead;
2. And I dream'd I went where they had buried him I love--but he was not
3. in that place;
4. And I dream'd I wander'd, searching among burial-places, to find him;
5. And I found that every place was a burial-place;
6. The houses full of life were equally full of death, (this house is
7. now;)
8. The streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the Chicago,
9. Boston, Philadelphia, the Mannahatta, were as full of the dead
10. as of the living,
11. And fuller, O vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living;
12. --And what I dream'd I will henceforth tell to every person and age,
13. And I stand henceforth bound to what I dream'd;
14. And now I am willing to disregard burial-places, and dispense with
15. them;
16. And if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently
17. everywhere, even in the room where I eat or sleep, I should be
18. satisfied;
19. And if the corpse of any one I love, or if my own corpse, be duly
20. render'd to powder, and pour'd in the sea, I shall be
21. satisfied;
22. Or if it be distributed to the winds, I shall be satisfied.
