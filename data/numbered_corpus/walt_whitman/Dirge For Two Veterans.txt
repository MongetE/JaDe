1. THE last sunbeam
2. Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,
3. On the pavement here--and there beyond, it is looking,
4. Down a new-made double grave.


5. Lo! the moon ascending!
6. Up from the east, the silvery round moon;
7. Beautiful over the house tops, ghastly phantom moon;
8. Immense and silent moon.


9. I see a sad procession,
10. And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles;
11. All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,
12. As with voices and with tears.


13. I hear the great drums pounding,
14. And the small drums steady whirring;
15. And every blow of the great convulsive drums,
16. Strikes me through and through.


17. For the son is brought with the father;
18. In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell;
19. Two veterans, son and father, dropt together,
20. And the double grave awaits them.


21. Now nearer blow the bugles,
22. And the drums strike more convulsive;
23. And the day-light o'er the pavement quite has faded,
24. And the strong dead-march enwraps me.


25. In the eastern sky up-buoying,
26. The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd;
27. ('Tis some mother's large, transparent face,
28. In heaven brighter growing.)


29. O strong dead-march, you please me!
30. O moon immense, with your silvery face you soothe me!
31. O my soldiers twain! O my veterans, passing to burial!
32. What I have I also give you.


33. The moon gives you light,
34. And the bugles and the drums give you music;
35. And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,
36. My heart gives you love.
