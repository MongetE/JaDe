1. BEHOLD this swarthy face--these gray eyes,
2. This beard--the white wool, unclipt upon my neck,
3. My brown hands, and the silent manner of me, without charm;
4. Yet comes one, a Manhattanese, and ever at parting, kisses me lightly
5. on the lips with robust love,
6. And I, on the crossing of the street, or on the ship's deck, give a
7. kiss in return;
8. We observe that salute of American comrades, land and sea,
9. We are those two natural and nonchalant persons.
