1. BY the bivouac's fitful flame,
2. A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow;--but first
3. I note,
4. The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim outline,
5. The darkness, lit by spots of kindled fire--the silence;
6. Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving;
7. The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily
8. watching me;)
9. While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,
10. Of life and death--of home and the past and loved, and of those that
11. are far away;
12. A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,
13. By the bivouac's fitful flame.
