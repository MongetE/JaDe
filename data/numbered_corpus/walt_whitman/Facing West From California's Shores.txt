1. FACING west, from California's shores,
2. Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
3. I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity, the
4. land of migrations, look afar,
5. Look off the shores of my Western Sea--the circle almost circled;
6. For, starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
7. From Asia--from the north--from the God, the sage, and the hero,
8. From the south--from the flowery peninsulas, and the spice islands;
9. Long having wander'd since--round the earth having wander'd,
10. Now I face home again--very pleas'd and joyous;
11. (But where is what I started for, so long ago?
12. And why is it yet unfound?)
