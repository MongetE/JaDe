1. I SAW old General at bay;
2. (Old as he was, his grey eyes yet shone out in battle like stars;)
3. His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works;
4. He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines--a desperate
5. emergency;
6. I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks--but two or three
7. were selected;
8. I saw them receive their orders aside--they listen'd with care--the
9. adjutant was very grave;
10. I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives.
