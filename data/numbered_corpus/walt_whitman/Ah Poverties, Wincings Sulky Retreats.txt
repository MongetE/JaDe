1. AH poverties, wincings, and sulky retreats!
2. Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me!
3. (For what is my life, or any man's life, but a conflict with foes--
4. the old, the incessant war?)
5. You degradations--you tussle with passions and appetites;
6. You smarts from dissatisfied friendships, (ah wounds, the sharpest of
7. all;)
8. You toil of painful and choked articulations--you meannesses;
9. You shallow tongue-talks at tables, (my tongue the shallowest of
10. any;)
11. You broken resolutions, you racking angers, you smother'd ennuis;
12. Ah, think not you finally triumph--My real self has yet to come
13. forth;
14. It shall yet march forth o'ermastering, till all lies beneath me;
15. It shall yet stand up the soldier of unquestion'd victory.
