1. O TAN-FACED prairie-boy!
2. Before you came to camp, came many a welcome gift;
3. Praises and presents came, and nourishing food--till at last, among
4. the recruits,
5. You came, taciturn, with nothing to give--we but look'd on each
6. other,
7. When lo! more than all the gifts of the world, you gave me.
