1. Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;
2. How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?

3. What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?

4. All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,
5. Else it were time lost listening to me.

6. I do not snivel that snivel the world over,
7. That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.

8. Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, con- formity goes to the fourth-remov'd,
9. I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.

10. Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?

11. Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd with doctors and calculated close,
12. I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.

13. In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,
14. And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.

15. I know I am solid and sound,
16. To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,
17. All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.

18. I know I am deathless,
19. I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,
20. I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.

21. I know I am august,
22. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,
23. I see that the elementary laws never apologize,
24. (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)

25. I exist as I am, that is enough,
26. If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
27. And if each and all be aware I sit content.

28. One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is my- self,
29. And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years,
30. I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.

31. My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,
32. I laugh at what you call dissolution,
33. And I know the amplitude of time.
