1. I NEED no assurances--I am a man who is preoccupied, of his own Soul;
2. I do not doubt that from under the feet, and beside the hands and
3. face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not
4. cognizant of--calm and actual faces;
5. I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in
6. any iota of the world;
7. I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless--
8. in vain I try to think how limitless;
9. I do not doubt that the orbs, and the systems of orbs, play their
10. swift sports through the air on purpose--and that I shall one
11. day be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they;
12. I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on, millions of
13. years;
14. I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have
15. their exteriors--and that the eye-sight has another eye-sight,
16. and the hearing another hearing, and the voice another voice;
17. I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are
18. provided for--and that the deaths of young women, and the
19. deaths of little children, are provided for;
20. (Did you think Life was so well provided for--and Death, the purport
21. of all Life, is not well provided for?)
22. I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of
23. them--no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, has
24. gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points;
25. I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen, any where, at any
26. time, is provided for, in the inherences of things;
27. I do not think Life provides for all, and for Time and Space--but I
28. believe Heavenly Death provides for all.
