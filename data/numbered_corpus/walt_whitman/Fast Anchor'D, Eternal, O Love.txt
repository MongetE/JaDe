1. FAST-ANCHOR'D, eternal, O love! O woman I love!
2. O bride! O wife! more resistless than I can tell, the thought of you!
3. --Then separate, as disembodied, or another born,
4. Ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation;
5. I ascend--I float in the regions of your love, O man,
6. O sharer of my roving life.
