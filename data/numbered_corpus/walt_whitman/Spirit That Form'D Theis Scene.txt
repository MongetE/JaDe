1. SPIRIT that form'd this scene,
2. These tumbled rock-piles grim and red,
3. These reckless heaven-ambitious peaks,
4. These gorges, turbulent-clear streams, this naked freshness,
5. These formless wild arrays, for reasons of their own,
6. I know thee, savage spirit--we have communed together,
7. Mine too such wild arrays, for reasons of their own;
8. Was't charged against my chants they had forgotten art?
9. To fuse within themselves its rules precise and delicatesse?
10. The lyrist's measur'd beat, the wrought-out temple's grace--column
11. and polish'd arch forgot?
12. But thou that revelest here--spirit that form'd this scene,
13. They have remember'd thee.
