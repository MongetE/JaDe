1. LAWS for Creations,
2. For strong artists and leaders--for fresh broods of teachers, and
3. perfect literats for America,
4. For noble savans, and coming musicians.

5. All must have reference to the ensemble of the world, and the compact
6. truth of the world;
7. There shall be no subject too pronounced--All works shall illustrate

9. What do you suppose Creation is?
10. What do you suppose will satisfy the Soul, except to walk free, and

12. What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways, but
13. that man or woman is as good as God?
14. And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself?
15. And that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean?
16. And that you or any one must approach Creations through such laws?
