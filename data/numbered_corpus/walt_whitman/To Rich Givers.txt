1. WHAT you give me, I cheerfully accept,
2. A little sustenance, a hut and garden, a little money--these, as I
3. rendezvous with my poems;
4. A traveler's lodging and breakfast as I journey through The States--
5. Why should I be ashamed to own such gifts? Why to advertise for
6. them?
7. For I myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman;
8. For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of
9. the universe.
