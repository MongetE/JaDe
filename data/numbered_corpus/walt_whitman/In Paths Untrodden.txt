1. IN paths untrodden,
2. In the growth by margins of pond-waters,
3. Escaped from the life that exhibits itself,
4. From all the standards hitherto publish'd--from the pleasures,
5. profits, eruditions, conformities,
6. Which too long I was offering to feed my soul;
7. Clear to me, now, standards not yet publish'd--clear to me that my
8. Soul,
9. That the Soul of the man I speak for, feeds, rejoices most in
10. comrades;
11. Here, by myself, away from the clank of the world,
12. Tallying and talk'd to here by tongues aromatic,
13. No longer abash'd--for in this secluded spot I can respond as I would
14. not dare elsewhere,
15. Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself, yet contains
16. all the rest,
17. Resolv'd to sing no songs to-day but those of manly attachment,
18. Projecting them along that substantial life,
19. Bequeathing, hence, types of athletic love,
20. Afternoon, this delicious Ninth-month, in my forty-first year,
21. I proceed, for all who are, or have been, young men,
22. To tell the secret of my nights and days,
23. To celebrate the need of comrades.
