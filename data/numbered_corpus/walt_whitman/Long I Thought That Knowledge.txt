1. LONG I thought that knowledge alone would suffice me--O if I could
2. but obtain knowledge!
3. Then my lands engrossed me--Lands of the prairies, Ohio's land, the
4. southern savannas, engrossed me--For them I would live--I would
5. be their orator;
6. Then I met the examples of old and new heroes--I heard of warriors,
7. sailors, and all dauntless persons--And it seemed to me that I
8. too had it in me to be as dauntless as any--and would be so;
9. And then, to enclose all, it came to me to strike up the songs of the
10. New World--And then I believed my life must be spent in
11. singing;
12. But now take notice, land of the prairies, land of the south
13. savannas, Ohio's land,
14. Take notice, you Kanuck woods--and you Lake Huron--and all that with
15. you roll toward Niagara--and you Niagara also,
16. And you, Californian mountains--That you each and all find somebody
17. else to be your singer of songs,
18. For I can be your singer of songs no longer--One who loves me is
19. jealous of me, and withdraws me from all but love,
20. With the rest I dispense--I sever from what I thought would suffice
21. me, for it does not--it is now empty and tasteless to me,
22. I heed knowledge, and the grandeur of The States, and the example of
23. heroes, no more,
24. I am indifferent to my own songs--I will go with him I love,
25. It is to be enough for us that we are together--We never separate
26. again.
