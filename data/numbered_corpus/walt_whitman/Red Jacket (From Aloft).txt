1. Upon this scene, this show,
2. Yielded to-day by fashion, learning, wealth,
3. (Nor in caprice alone- some grains of deepest meaning,)
4. Haply, aloft, (who knows?) from distant sky-clouds' blended shapes,
5. As some old tree, or rock or cliff, thrill'd with its soul,
6. Product of Nature's sun, stars, earth direct- a towering human form,
7. In hunting-shirt of film, arm'd with the rifle, a half-ironical
8. smile curving its phantom lips,
9. Like one of Ossian's ghosts looks down.
