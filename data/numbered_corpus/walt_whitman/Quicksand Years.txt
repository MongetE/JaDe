1. QUICKSAND years that whirl me I know not whither,
2. Your schemes, politics, fail--lines give way--substances mock and
3. elude me;
4. Only the theme I sing, the great and strong-possess'd Soul, eludes
5. not;
6. One's-self must never give way--that is the final substance--that out
7. of all is sure;
8. Out of politics, triumphs, battles, life--what at last finally
9. remains?
10. When shows break up, what but One's-Self is sure?
