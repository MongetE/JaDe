1. ONE'S-SELF I sing--a simple, separate Person;
2. Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-masse.

3. Of Physiology from top to toe I sing;
4. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain alone, is worthy for the muse--I say
5. the Form complete is worthier far;
6. The Female equally with the male I sing.

7. Of Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,
8. Cheerful--for freest action form'd, under the laws divine,
9. The Modern Man I sing.
