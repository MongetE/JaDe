1. ONE song, America, before I go,
2. I'd sing, o'er all the rest, with trumpet sound,
3. For thee--the Future.

4. I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality;
5. I'd fashion thy Ensemble, including Body and Soul;
6. I'd show, away ahead, thy real Union, and how it may be accomplish'd.

7. (The paths to the House I seek to make,
8. But leave to those to come, the House itself.)

9. Belief I sing--and Preparation;
10. As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the Present
11. only,
12. But greater still from what is yet to come,
13. Out of that formula for Thee I sing.
