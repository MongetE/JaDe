1. NOT heaving from my ribb'd breast only;
2. Not in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself;
3. Not in those long-drawn, ill-supprest sighs;
4. Not in many an oath and promise broken;
5. Not in my wilful and savage soul's volition;
6. Not in the subtle nourishment of the air;
7. Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists;
8. Not in the curious systole and diastole within, which will one day
9. cease;
10. Not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only;
11. Not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in
12. the wilds;
13. Not in husky pantings through clench'd teeth;
14. Not in sounded and resounded words--chattering words, echoes, dead
15. words;
16. Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep,
17. Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day;
18. Nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you and dismiss you
19. continually--Not there;
20. Not in any or all of them, O adhesiveness! O pulse of my life!
21. Need I that you exist and show yourself, any more than in these
22. songs.
