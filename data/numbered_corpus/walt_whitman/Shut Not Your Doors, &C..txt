1. SHUT not your doors to me, proud libraries,
2. For that which was lacking on all your well-fill'd shelves, yet
3. needed most, I bring;
4. Forth from the army, the war emerging--a book I have made,
5. The words of my book nothing--the drift of it everything;
6. A book separate, not link'd with the rest, nor felt by the intellect,
7. But you, ye untold latencies, will thrill to every page;
8. Through Space and Time fused in a chant, and the flowing, eternal
9. Identity,
10. To Nature, encompassing these, encompassing God--to the joyous,
11. electric All,
12. To the sense of Death--and accepting, exulting in Death, in its turn,
13. the same as life,
14. The entrance of Man I sing.
