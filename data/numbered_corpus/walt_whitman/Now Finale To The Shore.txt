1. NOW finale to the shore!
2. Now, land and life, finale, and farewell!
3. Now Voyager depart! (much, much for thee is yet in store;)
4. Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,
5. Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,
6. Duly again to port, and hawser's tie, returning:
7. --But now obey, thy cherish'd, secret wish,
8. Embrace thy friends--leave all in order;
9. To port, and hawser's tie, no more returning,
10. Depart upon thy endless cruise, old Sailor!
