1. AS TOILSOME I wander'd Virginia's woods,
2. To the music of rustling leaves, kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas
3. autumn,)
4. I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier,
5. Mortally wounded he, and buried on the retreat, (easily all could I
6. understand;)
7. The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose--yet this sign
8. left,
9. On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,
10. Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.
11. Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering;
12. Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life;
13. Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or in
14. the crowded street,
15. Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave--comes the inscription
16. rude in Virginia's woods,
17. Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade.
