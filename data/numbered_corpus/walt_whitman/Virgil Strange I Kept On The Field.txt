1. VIGIL strange I kept on the field one night:
2. When you, my son and my comrade, dropt at my side that day,
3. One look I but gave, which your dear eyes return'd, with a look I
4. shall never forget;
5. One touch of your hand to mine, O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the
6. ground;
7. Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle;
8. Till late in the night reliev'd, to the place at last again I made my
9. way;
10. Found you in death so cold, dear comrade--found your body, son of
11. responding kisses, (never again on earth responding;)
12. Bared your face in the starlight--curious the scene--cool blew the
13. moderate night-wind;
14. Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battlefield
15. spreading;
16. Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant silent
17. night;
18. But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh--Long, long I gazed;
19. Then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, leaning my
20. chin in my hands;
21. Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you, dearest
22. comrade--Not a tear, not a word;
23. Vigil of silence, love and death--vigil for you my son and my
24. soldier,
25. As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole;
26. Vigil final for you, brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your
27. death,
28. I faithfully loved you and cared for you living--I think we shall
29. surely meet again;)
30. Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn
31. appear'd,
32. My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,
33. Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, and
34. carefully under feet;
35. And there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his
36. grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited;
37. Ending my vigil strange with that--vigil of night and battlefield
38. dim;
39. Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth
40. responding;)
41. Vigil for comrade swiftly slain--vigil I never forget, how as day
42. brighten'd,
43. I rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well in his
44. blanket,
45. And buried him where he fell.
