5. O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!
6. O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!

25. The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.

26. O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena in
27. perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his
28. opponent.

29. O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human
30. soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and
31. limitless floods.

32. O the mother's joys!
33. The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish, the
34. patiently yielded life.

35. O the of increase, growth, recuperation,
36. The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and harmony.

37. O to go back to the place where I was born,
38. To hear the birds sing once more,
39. To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more,
40. And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.

41. O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast,
42. To continue and be employ'd there all my life,
43. The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at low water,
44. The work of fishermen, the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher;
45. I come with my clam-rake and spade, I come with my eel-spear,
46. Is the tide out? I Join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,
47. I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettlesome
48. young man;

49. In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on foot
50. on the ice-I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice,
51. Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon,
52. my brood of tough boys accompanying me,
53. My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no
54. one else so well as they love to be with me,
55. By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.

56. Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots
57. where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the buoys,)
58. O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row
59. just before sunrise toward the buoys,
60. I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are
61. desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert
62. wooden pegs in the â€˜oints of their pincers,

63. I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the
64. shore,
65. There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil'd
66. till their color becomes scarlet.

67. Another time mackerel-taking,
68. Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the
69. water for miles;
70. Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake bay, I one of the

75. coils of slender rope,
76. In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, my
77. companions.

78. O boating on the rivers,
79. The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers,
80. The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft
81. and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars,
82. The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook
83. supper at evening.

84. (O something pernicious and dread!
85. Something far away from a puny and pious life!
86. Something unproved! something in a trance!
87. Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)

88. O to work in mines, or forging iron,
89. Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ample
90. and shadow'd space,
91. The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running.

92. O to resume the joys of the soldier!
93. To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer-to feel his
94. sympathy!
95. To behold his calmness-to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!
96. To go to battle-to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!
97. To hear the crash of artillery-to see the glittering of the bayonets
98. and musket-barrels in the sun!

101. To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.

102. O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!
103. I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes
104. fanning me,
105. I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, There- she
106. blows!
107. Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest- we descend,
108. wild with excitement,
109. I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,
110. We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass,
111. lethargic, basking,
112. I see the harpooneer standing up, I see the weapon dart from his
113. vigorous arm;
114. O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling,
115. running to windward, tows me,
116. Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,
117. I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in the
118. wound,
119. Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving him
120. fast,
121. As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and
122. narrower, swiftly cutting the water-I see him die,
123. He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then
124. falls flat and still in the bloody foam.

125. O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!
126. My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,
127. My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.

128. O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!

129. I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,

132. than the bloom of youth?
133. What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?

135. To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the

139. O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving identity
140. through materials and loving them, observing characters
141. and absorbing them,
142. My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch,
143. reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,
144. The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and
145. flesh,
146. My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,
147. Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes
148. which finally see,
149. Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,
150. embraces, procreates.

151. O the farmer's joys!
152. Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,

155. To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,
156. To plough land in the spring for maize,
157. To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.

158. O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,
159. To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along the
160. shore.

161. O to realize space!
162. The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,
163. To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying
164. clouds, as one with them.

165. O the joy a manly self-hood!
166. To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or
167. unknown,

168. To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,
169. To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,
170. To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,
171. To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the
172. earth.

173. Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth?
174. Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing
175. face?
176. Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?
177. Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?
178. Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?

179. Yet O my soul supreme!
180. Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?

183. and the struggle?
184. The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings day
185. or night?
186. Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?
187. Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife,
188. the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?
189. Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.

190. O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,
191. To meet life as a powerful conqueror,
192. No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,
193. To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving
194. my interior soul impregnable,
195. And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.

196. For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating-the joy of death!
197. The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments,
198. for reasons,
199. Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or render'd
200. to powder, or buried,
201. My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,
202. My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,
203. further offices, eternal uses of the earth.

204. O to attract by more than attraction!
205. How it is I know not-yet behold! the something which obeys none
206. of the rest,
207. It is offensive, never defensive-yet how magnetic it draws.

208. O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!
209. To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!
210. To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!

212. perfect nonchalance!
213. To be indeed a God!

214. O to sail to sea in a ship!
215. To leave this steady unendurable land,
216. To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the
217. houses,
218. To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,
219. To sail and sail and sail!

220. O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!
221. To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!
222. To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,
223. A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)
224. A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.
