1. LO! THE unbounded sea!
2. On its breast a Ship starting, spreading all her sails--an ample
3. Ship, carrying even her moonsails;
4. The pennant is flying aloft, as she speeds, she speeds so stately--
5. below, emulous waves press forward,
6. They surround the Ship, with shining curving motions, and foam.
