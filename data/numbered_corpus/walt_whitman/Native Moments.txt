1. NATIVE moments! when you come upon me--Ah you are here now! Give me now
2. libidinous joys only! Give me the drench of my passions! Give me life
3. coarse and rank! To-day, I go consort with nature's darlings--to-night too;
4. I am for those who believe in loose delights--I share the midnight orgies
5. of young men; I dance with the dancers, and drink with the drinkers; The
6. echoes ring with our indecent calls; I take for my love some prostitute--I
7. pick out some low person for my dearest friend, He shall be lawless, rude,
8. illiterate--he shall be one condemn'd by others for deeds done; I will play
9. a part no longer--Why should I exile myself from my companions? 10 O you
10. shunn'd persons! I at least do not shun you, I come forthwith in your
11. midst--I will be your poet, I will be more to you than to any of the rest.
