1. OUT from behind this bending, rough-cut Mask,
2. (All straighter, liker Masks rejected--this preferr'd,)
3. This common curtain of the face, contain'd in me for me, in you for
4. you, in each for each,
5. (Tragedies, sorrows, laughter, tears--O heaven!
6. The passionate, teeming plays this curtain hid!)
7. This glaze of God's serenest, purest sky,
8. This film of Satan's seething pit,
9. This heart's geography's map--this limitless small continent--this
10. soundless sea;
11. Out from the convolutions of this globe,
12. This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon--than Jupiter, Venus,
13. Mars;
14. This condensation of the Universe--(nay, here the only Universe,
15. Here the IDEA--all in this mystic handful wrapt;)
16. These burin'd eyes, flashing to you, to pass to future time,
17. To launch and spin through space revolving, sideling--from these to
18. emanate,
19. To You, whoe'er you are--a Look.


20. A Traveler of thoughts and years--of peace and war,
21. Of youth long sped, and middle age declining,
22. (As the first volume of a tale perused and laid away, and this the
23. second,
24. Songs, ventures, speculations, presently to close,)
25. Lingering a moment, here and now, to You I opposite turn,
26. As on the road, or at some crevice door, by chance, or open'd window,
27. Pausing, inclining, baring my head, You specially I greet,
28. To draw and clench your Soul, for once, inseparably with mine,
29. Then travel, travel on.
