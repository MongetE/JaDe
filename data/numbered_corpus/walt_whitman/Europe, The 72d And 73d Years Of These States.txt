1. SUDDENLY, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,
2. Like lightning it le'pt forth, half startled at itself,
3. Its feet upon the ashes and the rags--its hands tight to the throats
4. of kings.

5. O hope and faith!
6. O aching close of exiled patriots' lives!
7. O many a sicken'd heart!
8. Turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh.

9. And you, paid to defile the People! you liars, mark!
10. Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,
11. For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his
12. simplicity the poor man's wages,
13. For many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken, and laugh'd at in
14. the breaking,
15. Then in their power, not for all these, did the blows strike revenge,
16. or the heads of the nobles fall;
17. The People scorn'd the ferocity of kings.


18. But the sweetness of mercy brew'd bitter destruction, and the
19. frighten'd monarchs come back;
20. Each comes in state, with his train--hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,
21. Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.

22. Yet behind all, lowering, stealing--lo, a Shape,
23. Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in
24. scarlet folds,
25. Whose face and eyes none may see,
26. Out of its robes only this--the red robes, lifted by the arm,
27. One finger, crook'd, pointed high over the top, like the head of a
28. snake appears.


29. Meanwhile, corpses lie in new-made graves--bloody corpses of young
30. men;
31. The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are
32. flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,
33. And all these things bear fruits--and they are good.

34. Those corpses of young men,
35. Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets--those hearts pierc'd by the
36. gray lead,
37. Cold and motionless as they seem, live elsewhere with unslaughter'd
38. vitality.

39. They live in other young men, O kings!
40. They live in brothers, again ready to defy you!
41. They were purified by death--they were taught and exalted.

42. Not a grave of the murder'd for freedom, but grows seed for freedom,
43. in its turn to bear seed,
44. Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows
45. nourish.

46. Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,
47. But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling,
48. cautioning.


49. Liberty! let others despair of you! I never despair of you.

50. Is the house shut? Is the master away?
51. Nevertheless, be ready--be not weary of watching;
52. He will soon return--his messengers come anon.
