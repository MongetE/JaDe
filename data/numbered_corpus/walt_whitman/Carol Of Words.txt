1. EARTH, round, rolling, compact--suns, moons, animals--all these are
2. words to be said;
3. Watery, vegetable, sauroid advances--beings, premonitions, lispings
4. of the future,
5. Behold! these are vast words to be said.

6. Were you thinking that those were the words--those upright lines?
7. those curves, angles, dots?
8. No, those are not the words--the substantial words are in the ground
9. and sea,
10. They are in the air--they are in you.

11. Were you thinking that those were the words--those delicious sounds
12. out of your friends' mouths?
13. No, the real words are more delicious than they.

14. Human bodies are words, myriads of words;
15. In the best poems re-appears the body, man's or woman's, well-shaped,
16. natural, gay,
17. Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of
18. shame.


19. Air, soil, water, fire--these are words;
20. I myself am a word with them--my qualities interpenetrate with
21. theirs--my name is nothing to them;
22. Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would air,
23. soil, water, fire, know of my name?

24. A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words,
25. sayings, meanings;
26. The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women, are
27. sayings and meanings also.


28. The workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth;
29. The great masters know the earth's words, and use them more than the
30. audible words.

31. Amelioration is one of the earth's words;
32. The earth neither lags nor hastens;
33. It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the
34. jump;
35. It is not half beautiful only--defects and excrescences show just as
36. much as perfections show.

37. The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough;
38. The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal'd
39. either;
40. They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print;
41. They are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,
42. Conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth--I utter and utter,
43. I speak not, yet if you hear me not, of what avail am I to you?
44. To bear--to better--lacking these, of what avail am I?


45. Accouche! Accouchez!
46. Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?
47. Will you squat and stifle there?

48. The earth does not argue,
49. Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,
50. Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,
51. Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,
52. Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,
53. Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.


54. The earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to exhibit itself--
55. possesses still underneath;
56. Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the
57. wail of slaves,
58. Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young
59. people, accents of bargainers,
60. Underneath these, possessing the words that never fail.

61. To her children, the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never
62. fail;
63. The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection
64. does not fail;
65. Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not
66. fail.


67. Of the interminable sisters,
68. Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters,
69. Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger
70. sisters,
71. The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.
72. With her ample back towards every beholder,
73. With the fascinations of youth, and the equal fascinations of age,
74. Sits she whom I too love like the rest--sits undisturb'd,
75. Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her
76. eyes glance back from it,
77. Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,
78. Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.


79. Seen at hand, or seen at a distance,
80. Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,
81. Duly approach and pass with their companions, or a companion,
82. Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances
83. of those who are with them,
84. From the countenances of children or women, or the manly
85. countenance,
86. From the open countenances of animals, or from inanimate things,
87. From the landscape or waters, or from the exquisite apparition of the
88. sky,
89. From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,
90. Every day in public appearing without fail, but never twice with the
91. same companions.


92. Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and sixty-
93. five resistlessly round the sun;
94. Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and
95. sixty-five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they.


96. Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,
97. Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying,
98. The Soul's realization and determination still inheriting,
99. The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,
100. No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,
101. Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,
102. Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,
103. The divine ship sails the divine sea.


104. Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for you;
105. The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.

106. Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and
107. liquid,
108. You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky,
109. For none more than you are the present and the past,
110. For none more than you is immortality.


111. Each man to himself, and each woman to herself, such is the word of
112. the past and present, and the word of immortality;
113. No one can acquire for another--not one!
114. Not one can grow for another--not one!

115. The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him;
116. The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him;
117. The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him;
118. The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him;
119. The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him;
120. The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him--it cannot fail;
121. The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress,
122. not to the audience;
123. And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own, or the
124. indication of his own.


125. I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall be
126. complete!
127. I swear the earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who
128. remains jagged and broken!
129. I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those of
130. the earth!
131. I swear there can be no theory of any account, unless it corroborate
132. the theory of the earth!
133. No politics, art, religion, behavior, or what not, is of account,
134. unless it compare with the amplitude of the earth,
135. Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude of
136. the earth.


137. I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which
138. responds love!
139. It is that which contains itself--which never invites, and never
140. refuses.

141. I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words!
142. I swear I think all merges toward the presentation of the unspoken
143. meanings of the earth!
144. Toward him who sings the songs of the Body, and of the truths of the
145. earth;
146. Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot
147. touch.


148. I swear I see what is better than to tell the best;
149. It is always to leave the best untold.

150. When I undertake to tell the best, I find I cannot,
151. My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,
152. My breath will not be obedient to its organs,
153. I become a dumb man.

154. The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow--all or any is best;
155. It is not what you anticipated--it is cheaper, easier, nearer;
156. Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held before;
157. The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before;
158. Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before;
159. But the Soul is also real,--it too is positive and direct;
160. No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it,
161. Undeniable growth has establish'd it.


162. This is a poem--a carol of words--these are hints of meanings,
163. These are to echo the tones of Souls, and the phrases of Souls;
164. If they did not echo the phrases of Souls, what were they then?
165. If they had not reference to you in especial, what were they then?

166. I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells
167. the best!
168. I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold.


169. Say on, sayers!
170. Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!
171. Work on--(it is materials you must bring, not breaths;)
172. Work on, age after age! nothing is to be lost;
173. It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use;
174. When the materials are all prepared, the architects shall appear.

175. I swear to you the architects shall appear without fail! I announce
176. them and lead them;
177. I swear to you they will understand you, and justify you;
178. I swear to you the greatest among them shall be he who best knows
179. you, and encloses all, and is faithful to all;
180. I swear to you, he and the rest shall not forget you--they shall
181. perceive that you are not an iota less than they;
182. I swear to you, you shall be glorified in them.
