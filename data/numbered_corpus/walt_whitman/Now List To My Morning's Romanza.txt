1. NOW list to my morning's romanza--I tell the signs of the Answerer;
2. To the cities and farms I sing, as they spread in the sunshine before
3. me.

4. A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother;
5. How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?
6. Tell him to send me the signs.

7. And I stand before the young man face to face, and take his right
8. hand in my left hand, and his left hand in my right hand,
9. And I answer for his brother, and for men, and I answer for him that
10. answers for all, and send these signs.


11. Him all wait for--him all yield up to--his word is decisive and
12. final,
13. Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, as amid
14. light,
15. Him they immerse, and he immerses them.

16. Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, people,
17. animals,
18. The profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet ocean, (so
19. tell I my morning's romanza;)
20. All enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever money will
21. buy,
22. The best farms--others toiling and planting, and he unavoidably
23. reaps,
24. The noblest and costliest cities--others grading and building, and he
25. domiciles there;
26. Nothing for any one, but what is for him--near and far are for him,
27. the ships in the offing,
28. The perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if they are for
29. any body.

30. He puts things in their attitudes;
31. He puts to-day out of himself, with plasticity and love;
32. He places his own city, times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and
33. sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest
34. never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.

35. He is the answerer:
36. What can be answer'd he answers--and what cannot be answer'd, he
37. shows how it cannot be answer'd.


38. A man is a summons and challenge;
39. (It is vain to skulk--Do you hear that mocking and laughter? Do you
40. hear the ironical echoes?)

41. Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride,
42. beat up and down, seeking to give satisfaction;
43. He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and
44. down also.

45. Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly
46. and gently and safely, by day or by night;
47. He has the pass-key of hearts--to him the response of the prying of
48. hands on the knobs.

49. His welcome is universal--the flow of beauty is not more welcome or
50. universal than he is;
51. The person he favors by day, or sleeps with at night, is blessed.


52. Every existence has its idiom--everything has an idiom and tongue;
53. He resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men, and
54. any man translates, and any man translates himself also;
55. One part does not counteract another part--he is the joiner--he sees
56. how they join.

57. He says indifferently and alike, How are you, friend? to the
58. President at his levee,
59. And he says, Good-day, my brother! to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-
60. field,
61. And both understand him, and know that his speech is right.

62. He walks with perfect ease in the Capitol,
63. He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,
64. Here is our equal, appearing and new.

65. Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,
66. And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he
67. has follow'd the sea,
68. And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an
69. artist,
70. And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them;
71. No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it, or has
72. follow'd it,
73. No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and
74. sisters there.

75. The English believe he comes of their English stock,
76. A Jew to the Jew he seems--a Russ to the Russ--usual and near,
77. removed from none.

78. Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,
79. The Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the German is sure, and the
80. Spaniard is sure, and the island Cuban is sure;
81. The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the
82. Mississippi, or St. Lawrence, or Sacramento, or Hudson, or
83. Paumanok Sound, claims him.

84. The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood;
85. The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see
86. themselves in the ways of him--he strangely transmutes them,
87. They are not vile any more--they hardly know themselves, they are so
88. grown.
