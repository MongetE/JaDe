1. With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,
2. I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer'd and slain persons.
3. Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?

4. I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.
5. I beat and pound for the dead,
6. I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.

7. Vivas to those who have fail'd!
8. And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!
9. And to those themselves who sank in the sea!
10. And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!
11. And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!
