1. HUSH'D be the camps to-day;
2. And, soldiers, let us drape our war-worn weapons;
3. And each with musing soul retire, to celebrate,
4. Our dear commander's death.

5. No more for him life's stormy conflicts;
6. Nor victory, nor defeat--no more time's dark events,
7. Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky.


8. But sing, poet, in our name;
9. Sing of the love we bore him--because you, dweller in camps, know it
10. truly.

11. As they invault the coffin there;
12. Sing--as they close the doors of earth upon him--one verse,
13. For the heavy hearts of soldiers.
