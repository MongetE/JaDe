1. I have said that the soul is not more than the body,
2. And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,
3. And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,
4. And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud,
5. And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,
6. And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,
7. And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,
8. And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel'd universe,
9. And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.

10. And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,
11. For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,
12. (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.)

13. I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,
14. Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.

15. Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
16. I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,
17. In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,
18. I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd by God's name,
19. And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er I go,
20. Others will punctually come for ever and ever.
