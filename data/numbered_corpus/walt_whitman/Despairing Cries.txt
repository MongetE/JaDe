1. DESPAIRING cries float ceaselessly toward me, day and night,
2. The sad voice of Death--the call of my nearest lover, putting forth,
3. alarmed, uncertain,
4. This sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,
5. Come tell me where I am speeding--tell me my destination.


6. I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,
7. I approach, hear, behold--the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,
8. your mute inquiry,
9. Whither I go from the bed I now recline on, come tell me;
10. Old age, alarmed, uncertain--A young woman's voice appealing to me,
11. for comfort,
12. A young man's voice, Shall I not escape?
