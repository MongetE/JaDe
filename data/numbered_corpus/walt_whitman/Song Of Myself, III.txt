1. I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the
2. beginning and the end
3. But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.
4. There was never any more inception than there is now,
5. Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
6. And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
7. Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

8. Urge and urge and urge,
9. Always the procreant urge of the world.
10. Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and
11. increase, always sex,
12. Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of
13. life.
14. To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is
15. so.

16. Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well
17. entretied, braced in the beams,
18. Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
19. I and this mystery here we stand.

20. Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not
21. my soul.

22. Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,

24. Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
25. Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they
26. discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.

27. Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty
28. and clean,
29. Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be
30. less familiar than the rest.

31. I am satisfiedâ€”I see, dance, laugh, sing;
32. As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the
33. night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread.
34. Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the house
35. with their plenty,
36. Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my
37. eyes,
38. That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
39. And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
40. Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is
41. ahead?
