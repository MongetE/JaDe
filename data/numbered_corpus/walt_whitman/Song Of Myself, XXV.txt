1. Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,
2. If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.

3. We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,
4. We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the day- break.
5. My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
6. With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.

7. Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,
8. It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,
9. Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?

10. Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,
11. Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?
12. Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,
13. The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,
14. I underlying causes to balance them at last,
15. My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,
16. Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)

17. My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,
18. Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,
19. I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.

20. Writing and talk do not prove me,
21. I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,
22. With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.
