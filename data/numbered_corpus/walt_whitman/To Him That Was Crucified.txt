1. MY spirit to yours, dear brother;
2. Do not mind because many, sounding your name, do not understand you;
3. I do not sound your name, but I understand you, (there are others
4. also;)
5. I specify you with joy, O my comrade, to salute you, and to salute
6. those who are with you, before and since--and those to come
7. also,
8. That we all labor together, transmitting the same charge and
9. succession;
10. We few, equals, indifferent of lands, indifferent of times;
11. We, enclosers of all continents, all castes--allowers of all
12. theologies,
13. Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,
14. We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the
15. disputers, nor any thing that is asserted;
16. We hear the bawling and din--we are reach'd at by divisions,
17. jealousies, recriminations on every side,
18. They close peremptorily upon us, to surround us, my comrade,
19. Yet we walk unheld, free, the whole earth over, journeying up and
20. down, till we make our ineffaceable mark upon time and the
21. diverse eras,
22. Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races, ages
23. to come, may prove brethren and lovers, as we are.
