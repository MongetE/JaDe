1. At the last, tenderly,

2. From the walls of the powerful fortress'd house,
3. From the clasp of the knitted locks, from the keep of the well-closed doors,
4. Let me be wafted.
5. Let me glide noiselessly forth;
6. With the key of softness unlock the locks--with a whisper,
7. Set open the doors O soul.

8. Tenderly--be not impatient,
9. (Strong is your hold, O mortal flesh,
10. Strong is your hold O love.)
