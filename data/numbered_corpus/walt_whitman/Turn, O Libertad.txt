1. TURN, O Libertad, for the war is over,
2. (From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,
3. sweeping the world,)
4. Turn from lands retrospective, recording proofs of the past;
5. From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past;
6. From the chants of the feudal world--the triumphs of kings, slavery,
7. caste;
8. Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come--give up that
9. backward world;
10. Leave to the singers of hitherto--give them the trailing past;
11. But what remains, remains for singers for you--wars to come are for
12. you;
13. (Lo! how the wars of the past have duly inured to you--and the wars
14. of the present also inure:)
15. --Then turn, and be not alarm'd, O Libertad--turn your undying
16. face,
17. To where the future, greater than all the past,
18. Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.
