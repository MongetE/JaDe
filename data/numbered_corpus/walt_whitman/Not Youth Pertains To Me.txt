1. NOT youth pertains to me,
2. Nor delicatesse--I cannot beguile the time with talk;
3. Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant;
4. In the learn'd coterie sitting constrain'd and still--for learning.
5. inures not to me;
6. Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me--yet there are two or three things
7. inure to me;
8. I have nourish'd the wounded, and sooth'd many a dying soldier,
9. And at intervals, waiting, or in the midst of camp,
10. Composed these songs.
