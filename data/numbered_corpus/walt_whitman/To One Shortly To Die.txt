1. FROM all the rest I single out you, having a message for you:
2. You are to die--Let others tell you what they please, I cannot
3. prevaricate,
4. I am exact and merciless, but I love you--There is no escape for you.

5. Softly I lay my right hand upon you--you just feel it,
6. I do not argue--I bend my head close, and half envelope it,
7. I sit quietly by--I remain faithful,
8. I am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbor,
9. I absolve you from all except yourself, spiritual, bodily--that is
10. eternal--you yourself will surely escape,
11. The corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious.


12. The sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions!
13. Strong thoughts fill you, and confidence--you smile!
14. You forget you are sick, as I forget you are sick,
15. You do not see the medicines--you do not mind the weeping friends--I
16. am with you,
17. I exclude others from you--there is nothing to be commiserated,
18. I do not commiserate--I congratulate you.
