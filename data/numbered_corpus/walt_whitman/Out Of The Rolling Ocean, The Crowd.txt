1. OUT of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me,
2. Whispering, I love you, before long I die,
3. I have travel'd a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you,
4. For I could not die till I once look'd on you,
5. For I fear'd I might afterward lose you.


6. (Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe;
7. Return in peace to the ocean, my love;
8. I too am part of that ocean, my love--we are not so much separated;
9. Behold the great rondure--the cohesion of all, how perfect!
10. But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,
11. As for an hour, carrying us diverse--yet cannot carry us diverse for
12. ever;
13. Be not impatient--a little space--Know you, I salute the air, the
14. ocean and the land,
15. Every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.)
