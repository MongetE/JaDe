1. This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,
2. It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appoint- ments with all,
3. I will not have a single person slighted or left away,
4. The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,
5. The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;
6. There shall be no difference between them and the rest.

7. This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,
8. This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,
9. This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,
10. This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.
11. Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
12. Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.

13. Do you take it I would astonish?
14. Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods?
15. Do I astonish more than they?

16. This hour I tell things in confidence,
17. I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.
