1. SKIRTING the river road, (my forenoon walk, my rest,)
2. Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound, the dalliance of the eagles,
3. The rushing amorous contact high in space together,
4. The clinching interlocking claws, a living, fierce, gyrating wheel,
5. Four beating wings, two beaks, a swirling mass tight grappling,
6. In tumbling turning clustering loops, straight downward falling,
7. Till o'er the river pois'd, the twain yet one, a moment's lull,
8. A motionless still balance in the air, then parting, talons loosing,
9. Upward again on slow-firm pinions slanting, their separate diverse
10. flight,
11. She hers, he his, pursuing.
