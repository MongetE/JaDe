1. Tears! tears! tears!
2. In the night, in solitude, tears;
3. On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the sand;
4. Tears--not a star shining--all dark and desolate;
5. Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head:
6. --O who is that ghost?--that form in the dark, with tears?
7. What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the sand?
8. Streaming tears--sobbing tears--throes, choked with wild cries;
9. O storm, embodied, rising, careering, with swift steps along the
10. beach;
11. O wild and dismal night storm, with wind! O belching and
12. desperate!
13. O shade, so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance and
14. regulated pace;
15. But away, at night, as you fly, none looking--O then the unloosen'd
16. ocean,
17. Of tears! tears! tears!
