4. Of the earth at large, whispering through medium of me;
5. Of vista--Suppose some sight in arriere, through the formative chaos,
6. presuming the growth, fulness, life, now attain'd on the
7. journey;
8. (But I see the road continued, and the journey ever continued;)
9. --Of what was once lacking on earth, and in due time has become

11. Because all I see and know, I believe to have purport in what will
12. yet be supplied.
