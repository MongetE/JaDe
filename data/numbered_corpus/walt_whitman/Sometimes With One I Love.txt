1. SOMETIMES with one I love, I fill myself with rage, for fear I effuse
2. unreturn'd love;
3. But now I think there is no unreturn'd love--the pay is certain, one
4. way or another;
5. (I loved a certain person ardently, and my love was not return'd;
6. Yet out of that, I have written these songs.)
