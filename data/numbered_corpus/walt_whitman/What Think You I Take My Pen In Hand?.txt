1. WHAT think you I take my pen in hand to record?
2. The battle-ship, perfect-model'd, majestic, that I saw pass the
3. offing to-day under full sail?
4. The splendors of the past day? Or the splendor of the night that
5. envelopes me?
6. Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me?--
7. No;
8. But I record of two simple men I saw to-day, on the pier, in the
9. midst of the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends;
10. The one to remain hung on the other's neck, and passionately kiss'd
11. him,
12. While the one to depart, tightly prest the one to remain in his arms.
