1. THE world below the brine;
2. Forests at the bottom of the sea--the branches and leaves,
3. Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds--the thick
4. tangle, the openings, and the pink turf,
5. Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold--the
6. play of light through the water,
7. Dumb swimmers there among the rocks--coral, gluten, grass, rushes--
8. and the aliment of the swimmers,
9. Sluggish existences grazing there, suspended, or slowly crawling
10. close to the bottom,
11. The sperm-whale at the surface, blowing air and spray, or disporting
12. with his flukes,
13. The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea-leopard,
14. and the sting-ray;
15. Passions there--wars, pursuits, tribes--sight in those ocean-depths--
16. breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do;
17. The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed
18. by beings like us, who walk this sphere;
19. The change onward from ours, to that of beings who walk other
20. spheres.
