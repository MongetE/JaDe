1. THERE was a child went forth every day;
2. And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became;
3. And that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of
4. the day, or for many years, or stretching cycles of years.

5. The early lilacs became part of this child,
6. And grass, and white and red morning-glories, and white and red
7. clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,
8. And the Third-month lambs, and the sow's pink-faint litter, and the
9. mare's foal, and the cow's calf,
10. And the noisy brood of the barn-yard, or by the mire of the pond-
11. side,
12. And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there--and the
13. beautiful curious liquid,
14. And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads--all became part
15. of him.

16. The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of
17. him;
18. Winter-grain sprouts, and those of the light-yellow corn, and the
19. esculent roots of the garden,
20. And the apple-trees cover'd with blossoms, and the fruit afterward,
21. and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road;
22. And the old drunkard staggering home from the out-house of the
23. tavern, whence he had lately risen,
24. And the school-mistress that pass'd on her way to the school,
25. And the friendly boys that pass'd--and the quarrelsome boys,
26. And the tidy and fresh-cheek'd girls--and the barefoot negro boy and
27. girl,
28. And all the changes of city and country, wherever he went.

29. His own parents,
30. He that had father'd him, and she that had conceiv'd him in her womb,
31. and birth'd him,
32. They gave this child more of themselves than that;
33. They gave him afterward every day--they became part of him.

34. The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table;
35. The mother with mild words--clean her cap and gown, a wholesome odor
36. falling off her person and clothes as she walks by;
37. The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, unjust;
38. The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,
39. The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture--the
40. yearning and swelling heart,
41. Affection that will not be gainsay'd--the sense of what is real--the
42. thought if, after all, it should prove unreal,
43. The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time--the curious
44. whether and how,
45. Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?
46. Men and women crowding fast in the streets--if they are not flashes
47. and specks, what are they?
48. The streets themselves, and the fa√ßades of houses, and goods in the
49. windows,
50. Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank'd wharves--the huge crossing at the
51. ferries,
52. The village on the highland, seen from afar at sunset--the river
53. between,
54. Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of
55. white or brown, three miles off,
56. The schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the tide--the little
57. boat slack-tow'd astern,
58. The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,
59. The strata of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint, away
60. solitary by itself--the spread of purity it lies motionless in,
61. The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh
62. and shore mud;
63. These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now
64. goes, and will always go forth every day.
