1. I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
2. And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,
3. And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,
4. And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,
5. And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,
6. And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any statue,
7. And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.

8. I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,
9. And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,
10. And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,
11. But call any thing back again when I desire it.

12. In vain the speeding or shyness,
13. In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,
14. In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd bones,
15. In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,
16. In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,
17. In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,
18. In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,
19. In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,
20. In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,
21. I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.
