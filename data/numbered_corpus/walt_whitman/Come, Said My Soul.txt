1. Come, said my soul,
2. Such verses for my body let us write, (For we are One),
3. That should I after death invisibly return,
4. Or, long, long hence, in other spheres,
5. There to some group of mates the chants resuming,
6. (Tallying Earth's soil, trees, winds, tumultous waves,)
7. Ever with pleas'd smile I may keep on
8. Ever and ever to the verses owning - as, first, I here and now,
9. Signing for soul and body, set them to my name,
10. Walt Whitman.
