1. O BITTER sprig! Confession sprig!
2. In the bouquet I give you place also--I bind you in,
3. Proceeding no further till, humbled publicly,
4. I give fair warning, once for all.

5. I own that I have been sly, thievish, mean, a prevaricator, greedy,
6. derelict,
7. And I own that I remain so yet.

8. What foul thought but I think it--or have in me the stuff out of
9. which it is thought?
10. What in darkness in bed at night, alone or with a companion?
