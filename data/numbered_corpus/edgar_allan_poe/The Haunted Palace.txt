1. In the greenest of our valleys
2. By good angels tenanted,
3. Once a fair and stately palace-
4. Radiant palace- reared its head.
5. In the monarch Thought's dominion-
6. It stood there!
7. Never seraph spread a pinion
8. Over fabric half so fair!

9. Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
10. On its roof did float and flow,
11. (This- all this- was in the olden
12. Time long ago,)
13. And every gentle air that dallied,
14. In that sweet day,
15. Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
16. A winged odor went away.

17. Wanderers in that happy valley,
18. Through two luminous windows, saw
19. Spirits moving musically,
20. To a lute's well-tuned law,
21. Round about a throne where, sitting
22. (Porphyrogene!)
23. In state his glory well-befitting,
24. The ruler of the realm was seen.

25. And all with pearl and ruby glowing
26. Was the fair palace door,
27. Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
28. And sparkling evermore,
29. A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
30. Was but to sing,
31. In voices of surpassing beauty,
32. The wit and wisdom of their king.

33. But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
34. Assailed the monarch's high estate.
35. (Ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow
36. Shall dawn upon him desolate!)
37. And round about his home the glory
38. That blushed and bloomed,
39. Is but a dim-remembered story
40. Of the old time entombed.

41. And travellers, now, within that valley,
42. Through the red-litten windows see
43. Vast forms, that move fantastically
44. To a discordant melody,
45. While, like a ghastly rapid river,
46. Through the pale door
47. A hideous throng rush out forever
48. And laugh- but smile no more.

49. -THE END-
