1. I

2. Hear the sledges with the bells-
3. Silver bells!
4. What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
5. How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
6. In the icy air of night!
7. While the stars that oversprinkle
8. All the heavens, seem to twinkle
9. With a crystalline delight;
10. Keeping time, time, time,
11. In a sort of Runic rhyme,
12. To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
13. From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
14. Bells, bells, bells-
15. From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

16. II

17. Hear the mellow wedding bells,
18. Golden bells!
19. What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
20. Through the balmy air of night
21. How they ring out their delight!
22. From the molten-golden notes,
23. And an in tune,
24. What a liquid ditty floats
25. To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
26. On the moon!
27. Oh, from out the sounding cells,
28. What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
29. How it swells!
30. How it dwells
31. On the Future! how it tells
32. Of the rapture that impels
33. To the swinging and the ringing
34. Of the bells, bells, bells,
35. Of the bells, bells, bells,bells,
36. Bells, bells, bells-
37. To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

38. III

39. Hear the loud alarum bells-
40. Brazen bells!
41. What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
42. In the startled ear of night
43. How they scream out their affright!
44. Too much horrified to speak,
45. They can only shriek, shriek,
46. Out of tune,
47. In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
48. In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
49. Leaping higher, higher, higher,
50. With a desperate desire,
51. And a resolute endeavor,
52. Now- now to sit or never,
53. By the side of the pale-faced moon.
54. Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
55. What a tale their terror tells
56. Of Despair!
57. How they clang, and clash, and roar!
58. What a horror they outpour
59. On the bosom of the palpitating air!
60. Yet the ear it fully knows,
61. By the twanging,
62. And the clanging,
63. How the danger ebbs and flows:
64. Yet the ear distinctly tells,
65. In the jangling,
66. And the wrangling,
67. How the danger sinks and swells,
68. By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells-
69. Of the bells-
70. Of the bells, bells, bells,bells,
71. Bells, bells, bells-
72. In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

73. IV

74. Hear the tolling of the bells-
75. Iron Bells!
76. What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
77. In the silence of the night,
78. How we shiver with affright
79. At the melancholy menace of their tone!
80. For every sound that floats
81. From the rust within their throats
82. Is a groan.
83. And the people- ah, the people-
84. They that dwell up in the steeple,
85. All Alone
86. And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,
87. In that muffled monotone,
88. Feel a glory in so rolling
89. On the human heart a stone-
90. They are neither man nor woman-
91. They are neither brute nor human-
92. They are Ghouls:
93. And their king it is who tolls;
94. And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
95. Rolls
96. A paean from the bells!
97. And his merry bosom swells
98. With the paean of the bells!
99. And he dances, and he yells;
100. Keeping time, time, time,
101. In a sort of Runic rhyme,
102. To the paean of the bells-
103. Of the bells:
104. Keeping time, time, time,
105. In a sort of Runic rhyme,
106. To the throbbing of the bells-
107. Of the bells, bells, bells-
108. To the sobbing of the bells;
109. Keeping time, time, time,
110. As he knells, knells, knells,
111. In a happy Runic rhyme,
112. To the rolling of the bells-
113. Of the bells, bells, bells:
114. To the tolling of the bells,
115. Of the bells, bells, bells, bells-
116. Bells, bells, bells-
117. To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.
