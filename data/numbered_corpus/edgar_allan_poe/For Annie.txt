1. Thank Heaven! the crisis-
2. The danger is past,
3. And the lingering illness
4. Is over at last-
5. And the fever called "Living"
6. Is conquered at last.

7. Sadly, I know
8. I am shorn of my strength,
9. And no muscle I move
10. As I lie at full length-
11. But no matter!-I feel
12. I am better at length.

13. And I rest so composedly,
14. Now, in my bed
15. That any beholder
16. Might fancy me dead-
17. Might start at beholding me,
18. Thinking me dead.

19. The moaning and groaning,
20. The sighing and sobbing,
21. Are quieted now,
22. With that horrible throbbing
23. At heart:- ah, that horrible,
24. Horrible throbbing!

25. The sickness- the nausea-
26. The pitiless pain-
27. Have ceased, with the fever
28. That maddened my brain-
29. With the fever called "Living"
30. That burned in my brain.

31. And oh! of all tortures
32. That torture the worst
33. Has abated- the terrible
34. Torture of thirst
35. For the naphthaline river
36. Of Passion accurst:-
37. I have drunk of a water
38. That quenches all thirst:-

39. Of a water that flows,
40. With a lullaby sound,
41. From a spring but a very few
42. Feet under ground-
43. From a cavern not very far
44. Down under ground.

45. And ah! let it never
46. Be foolishly said
47. That my room it is gloomy
48. And narrow my bed;
49. For man never slept
50. In a different bed-
51. And, to sleep, you must slumber
52. In just such a bed.

53. My tantalized spirit
54. Here blandly reposes,
55. Forgetting, or never
56. Regretting its roses-
57. Its old agitations
58. Of myrtles and roses:

59. For now, while so quietly
60. Lying, it fancies
61. A holier odor
62. About it, of pansies-
63. A rosemary odor,
64. Commingled with pansies-
65. With rue and the beautiful
66. Puritan pansies.

67. And so it lies happily,
68. Bathing in many
69. A dream of the truth
70. And the beauty of Annie-
71. Drowned in a bath
72. Of the tresses of Annie.

73. She tenderly kissed me,
74. She fondly caressed,
75. And then I fell gently
76. To sleep on her breast-
77. Deeply to sleep
78. From the heaven of her breast.

79. When the light was extinguished,
80. She covered me warm,
81. And she prayed to the angels
82. To keep me from harm-
83. To the queen of the angels
84. To shield me from harm.

85. And I lie so composedly,
86. Now, in my bed,
87. (Knowing her love)
88. That you fancy me dead-
89. And I rest so contentedly,
90. Now, in my bed,
91. (With her love at my breast)
92. That you fancy me dead-
93. That you shudder to look at me,
94. Thinking me dead.

95. But my heart it is brighter
96. Than all of the many
97. Stars in the sky,
98. For it sparkles with Annie-
99. It glows with the light
100. Of the love of my Annie-
101. With the thought of the light
102. Of the eyes of my Annie.
