1. LO! Death hath rear'd himself a throne
2. In a strange city, all alone,
3. Far down within the dim west —
4. Where the good, and the bad, and the worst, and the best,
5. Have gone to their eternal rest.

6. There shrines, and palaces, and towers
7. Are — not like any thing of ours —
8. Oh no! — O no! — ours never loom
9. To heaven with that ungodly gloom!
10. Time-eaten towers that tremble not!
11. Resemble nothing that is ours.
12. Around, by lifting winds forgot,
13. Resignedly beneath the sky
14. The melancholy waters lie.

15. No holy rays from heaven come down
16. On the long night-time of that town,
17. But light from out the lurid sea
18. Streams up the turrets silently —
19. Up thrones — up long-forgotten bowers
20. Of scultur'd ivy and stone flowers —
21. Up domes — up spires — up kingly halls —
22. Up fanes — up Babylon-like walls —
23. Up many a melancholy shrine
24. Whose entablatures intertwine
25. The mask — the viol — and the vine.

26. There open temples — open graves
27. Are on a level with the waves —
28. But not the riches there that lie
29. In each idol's diamond eye,
30. Not the gaily-jewell'd dead
31. Tempt the waters from their bed:
32. For no ripples curl, alas!
33. Along that wilderness of glass —
34. No swellings hint that winds may be
35. Upon a far-off happier sea:
36. So blend the turrets and shadows there
37. That all seem pendulous in air,
38. While from the high towers of the town
39. Death looks gigantically down.

40. But lo! a stir is in the air!
41. The wave — there is a ripple there!
42. As if the towers had thrown aside,
43. In slightly sinking, the dull tide —
44. As if the turret-tops had given
45. A vacuum in the filmy heaven.
46. The waves have now a redder glow —
47. The very hours are breathing low —
48. And when, amid no earthly moans,
49. Down, down, that town shall settle hence,
50. All Hades, from a thousand thrones,
51. Shall do it reverence,
52. And Death to some more happy clime
53. Shall give his undivided time.
