1. Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
2. Of crystal, wandering water,
3. Thou art an emblem of the glow
4. Of beauty- the unhidden heart-
5. The playful maziness of art
6. In old Alberto's daughter;

7. But when within thy wave she looks-
8. Which glistens then, and trembles-
9. Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
10. Her worshipper resembles;
11. For in his heart, as in thy stream,
12. Her image deeply lies-
13. His heart which trembles at the beam
14. Of her soul-searching eyes.
