1. Thy soul shall find itself alone
2. 'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone;
3. Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
4. Into thine hour of secrecy.

5. Be silent in that solitude,
6. Which is not loneliness- for then
7. The spirits of the dead, who stood
8. In life before thee, are again
9. In death around thee, and their will
10. Shall overshadow thee; be still.

11. The night, though clear, shall frown,
12. And the stars shall not look down
13. From their high thrones in the Heaven
14. With light like hope to mortals given,
15. But their red orbs, without beam,
16. To thy weariness shall seem
17. As a burning and a fever
18. Which would cling to thee for ever.

19. Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish,
20. Now are visions ne'er to vanish;
21. From thy spirit shall they pass
22. No more, like dew-drop from the grass.

23. The breeze, the breath of God, is still,
24. And the mist upon the hill
25. Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,
26. Is a symbol and a token.
27. How it hangs upon the trees,
28. A mystery of mysteries!
