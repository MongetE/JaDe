1. Lo! 'tis a gala night
2. Within the lonesome latter years!
3. An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
4. In veils, and drowned in tears,
5. Sit in a theatre, to see
6. A play of hopes and fears,
7. While the orchestra breathes fitfully
8. The music of the spheres.

9. Mimes, in the form of God on high,
10. Mutter and mumble low,
11. And hither and thither fly-
12. Mere puppets they, who come and go
13. At bidding of vast formless things
14. That shift the scenery to and fro,
15. Flapping from out their Condor wings
16. Invisible Woe!

17. That motley drama- oh, be sure
18. It shall not be forgot!
19. With its Phantom chased for evermore,
20. By a crowd that seize it not,
21. Through a circle that ever returneth in
22. To the self-same spot,
23. And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
24. And Horror the soul of the plot.

25. But see, amid the mimic rout
26. A crawling shape intrude!
27. A blood-red thing that writhes from out
28. The scenic solitude!
29. It writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs
30. The mimes become its food,
31. And seraphs sob at vermin fangs
32. In human gore imbued.

33. Out- out are the lights- out all!
34. And, over each quivering form,
35. The curtain, a funeral pall,
36. Comes down with the rush of a storm,
37. While the angels, all pallid and wan,
38. Uprising, unveiling, affirm
39. That the play is the tragedy, 'Man,'
40. And its hero the Conqueror Worm.
