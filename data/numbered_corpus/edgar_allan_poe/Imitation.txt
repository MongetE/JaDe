1. A dark unfathomed tide
2. Of interminable pride -
3. A mystery, and a dream,
4. Should my early life seem;
5. I say that dream was fraught
6. With a wild and waking thought
7. Of beings that have been,
8. Which my spirit hath not seen,
9. Had I let them pass me by,
10. With a dreaming eye!
11. Let none of earth inherit
12. That vision of my spirit;
13. Those thoughts I would control,
14. As a spell upon his soul:
15. For that bright hope at last
16. And that light time have past,
17. And my worldly rest hath gone
18. With a sigh as it passed on:
19. I care not though it perish
20. With a thought I then did cherish
