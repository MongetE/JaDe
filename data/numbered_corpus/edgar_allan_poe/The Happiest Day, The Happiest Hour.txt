1. The happiest day- the happiest hour
2. My sear'd and blighted heart hath known,
3. The highest hope of pride and power,
4. I feel hath flown.

5. Of power! said I? yes! such I ween;
6. But they have vanish'd long, alas!
7. The visions of my youth have been-
8. But let them pass.

9. And, pride, what have I now with thee?
10. Another brow may even inherit
11. The venom thou hast pour'd on me
12. Be still, my spirit!

13. The happiest day- the happiest hour
14. Mine eyes shall see- have ever seen,
15. The brightest glance of pride and power,
16. I feel- have been:

17. But were that hope of pride and power
18. Now offer'd with the pain
19. Even then I felt- that brightest hour
20. I would not live again:

21. For on its wing was dark alloy,
22. And, as it flutter'd- fell
23. An essence- powerful to destroy
24. A soul that knew it well.
