1. Gaily bedight,
2. A gallant knight,
3. In sunshine and in shadow,
4. Had journeyed long,
5. Singing a song,
6. In search of Eldorado.

7. But he grew old-
8. This knight so bold-
9. And o'er his heart a shadow
10. Fell as he found
11. No spot of ground
12. That looked like Eldorado.

13. And, as his strength
14. Failed him at length,
15. He met a pilgrim shadow-
16. "Shadow," said he,
17. "Where can it be-
18. This land of Eldorado?"

19. "Over the Mountains
20. Of the Moon,
21. Down the Valley of the Shadow,
22. Ride, boldly ride,"
23. The shade replied-
24. "If you seek for Eldorado!"
