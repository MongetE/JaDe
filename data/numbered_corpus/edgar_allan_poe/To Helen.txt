1. Helen, thy beauty is to me
2. Like those Nicean barks of yore,
3. That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
4. The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
5. To his own native shore.

6. On desperate seas long wont to roam,
7. Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
8. Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
9. To the glory that was Greece
10. And the grandeur that was Rome.

11. Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
12. How statue-like I see thee stand,
13. The agate lamp within thy hand!
14. Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
15. Are Holy Land!
