1. Seraph! thy memory is to me
2. Like some enchanted far-off isle
3. In some tumultuous sea -
4. Some ocean vexed as it may be
5. With storms; but where, meanwhile,
6. Serenest skies continually
7. Just o'er that one bright island smile.
8. For 'mid the earnest cares and woes
9. That crowd around my earthly path,
10. (Sad path, alas, where grows
11. Not even one lonely rose!)
12. My soul at least a solace hath
13. In dreams of thee; and therein knows
14. An Eden of bland repose.
