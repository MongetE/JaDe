1. From childhood's hour I have not been
2. As others were; I have not seen
3. As others saw; I could not bring
4. My passions from a common spring.
5. From the same source I have not taken
6. My sorrow; I could not awaken
7. My heart to joy at the same tone;
8. And all I loved, I loved alone.
9. Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
10. Of a most stormy life- was drawn
11. From every depth of good and ill
12. The mystery which binds me still:
13. From the torrent, or the fountain,
14. From the red cliff of the mountain,
15. From the sun that round me rolled
16. In its autumn tint of gold,
17. From the lightning in the sky
18. As it passed me flying by,
19. From the thunder and the storm,
20. And the cloud that took the form
21. (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
22. Of a demon in my view.
