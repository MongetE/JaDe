1. I'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth,
2. Better than banking, trade or leases â€”
3. Take a bank note and fold it up,
4. And then you will find your money in creases!
5. This wonderful plan, without danger or loss,
6. Keeps your cash in your hands, where nothing can trouble it;
7. And every time that you fold it across,
8. 'Tis as plain as the light of the day that you double it!
