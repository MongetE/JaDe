1. Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
2. My spirit not awakening, till the beam
3. Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.
4. Yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
5. 'Twere better than the cold reality
6. Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
7. And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
8. A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
9. But should it be- that dream eternally
10. Continuing- as dreams have been to me
11. In my young boyhood- should it thus be given,
12. 'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.
13. For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright
14. I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light
15. And loveliness,- have left my very heart
16. In climes of my imagining, apart
17. From mine own home, with beings that have been
18. Of mine own thought- what more could I have seen?
19. 'Twas once- and only once- and the wild hour
20. From my remembrance shall not pass- some power
21. Or spell had bound me- 'twas the chilly wind
22. Came o'er me in the night, and left behind
23. Its image on my spirit- or the moon
24. Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
25. Too coldly- or the stars- howe'er it was
26. That dream was as that night-wind- let it pass.

27. I have been happy, tho' in a dream.
28. I have been happy- and I love the theme:
29. Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life,
30. As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
31. Of semblance with reality, which brings
32. To the delirious eye, more lovely things
33. Of Paradise and Love- and all our own!
34. Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.
