1. O! I care not that my earthly lot
2. Hath little of Earth in it,
3. That years of love have been forgot
4. In the fever of a minute:

5. I heed not that the desolate
6. Are happier, sweet, than I,
7. But that you meddle with my fate
8. Who am a passer by.

9. It is not that my founts of bliss
10. Are gushing- strange! with tears-
11. Or that the thrill of a single kiss
12. Hath palsied many years-

13. 'Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs
14. Which have wither'd as they rose
15. Lie dead on my heart-strings
16. With the weight of an age of snows.

17. Not that the grass- O! may it thrive!
18. On my grave is growing or grown-
19. But that, while I am dead yet alive
20. I cannot be, lady, alone.
