1. The only king by right divine
2. Is Ellen King, and were she mine
3. I'd strive for liberty no more,
4. But hug the glorious chains I wore.

5. Her bosom is an ivory throne,
6. Where tyrant virtue reigns alone ;
7. No subject vice dare interfere,
8. To check the power that governs here.

9. O! would she deign to rule my fate,
10. I'd worship Kings and kingly state,
11. And hold this maxim all life long,
12. The King — my King — can do no wrong.
