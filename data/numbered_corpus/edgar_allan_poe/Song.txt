1. I saw thee on thy bridal day-
2. When a burning blush came o'er thee,
3. Though happiness around thee lay,
4. The world all love before thee:

5. And in thine eye a kindling light
6. (Whatever it might be)
7. Was all on Earth my aching sight
8. Of Loveliness could see.

9. That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame-
10. As such it well may pass-
11. Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
12. In the breast of him, alas!

13. Who saw thee on that bridal day,
14. When that deep blush would come o'er thee,
15. Though happiness around thee lay;
16. The world all love before thee.
