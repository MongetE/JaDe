1. At morn- at noon- at twilight dim-
2. Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
3. In joy and woe- in good and ill-
4. Mother of God, be with me still!
5. When the hours flew brightly by,
6. And not a cloud obscured the sky,
7. My soul, lest it should truant be,
8. Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;
9. Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
10. Darkly my Present and my Past,
11. Let my Future radiant shine
12. With sweet hopes of thee and thine!
