1. I.
2. In the greenest of our valleys,
3. By good angels tenanted,
4. Once fair and stately palace --
5. Radiant palace --reared its head.
6. In the monarch Thought's dominion --
7. It stood there!
8. Never seraph spread a pinion
9. Over fabric half so fair.

10. II.
11. Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
12. On its roof did float and flow;
13. (This --all this --was in the olden
14. Time long ago)
15. And every gentle air that dallied,
16. In that sweet day,
17. Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
18. A winged odour went away.

19. III.
20. Wanderers in that happy valley
21. Through two luminous windows saw
22. Spirits moving musically
23. To a lute's well-tuned law,
24. Round about a throne, where sitting
25. (Porphyrogene!)
26. In state his glory well befitting,
27. The ruler of the realm was seen.

28. IV.
29. And all with pearl and ruby glowing
30. Was the fair palace door,
31. Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing
32. And sparkling evermore,
33. A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
34. Was but to sing,
35. In voices of surpassing beauty,
36. The wit and wisdom of their king.

37. V.
38. But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
39. Assailed the monarch's high estate;
40. (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow
41. Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
42. And, round about his home, the glory
43. That blushed and bloomed
44. Is but a dim-remembered story
45. Of the old time entombed.

46. VI.
47. And travellers now within that valley,
48. Through the red-litten windows, see
49. Vast forms that move fantastically
50. To a discordant melody;
51. While, like a rapid ghastly river,
52. Through the pale door,
53. A hideous throng rush out forever,
54. And laugh --but smile no more.
