1. How often we forget all time, when lone
2. Admiring Nature's universal throne;
3. Her woods- her wilds- her mountains- the intense
4. Reply of HERS to OUR intelligence! [BYRON, The Island.]

5. I

6. In youth have I known one with whom the Earth
7. In secret communing held- as he with it,
8. In daylight, and in beauty from his birth:
9. Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
10. From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
11. A passionate light- such for his spirit was fit-
12. And yet that spirit knew not, in the hour
13. Of its own fervor what had o'er it power.


14. II

15. Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
16. To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,
17. But I will half believe that wild light fraught
18. With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
19. Hath ever told- or is it of a thought
20. The unembodied essence, and no more,
21. That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
22. As dew of the night-time o'er the summer grass?

23. III

24. Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye
25. To the loved object- so the tear to the lid
26. Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
27. And yet it need not be- (that object) hid
28. From us in life- but common- which doth lie
29. Each hour before us- but then only, bid
30. With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken,
31. To awake us- 'Tis a symbol and a token

32. IV

33. Of what in other worlds shall be- and given
34. In beauty by our God, to those alone
35. Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
36. Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
37. That high tone of the spirit which hath striven,
38. Tho' not with Faith- with godliness- whose throne
39. With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
40. Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.
