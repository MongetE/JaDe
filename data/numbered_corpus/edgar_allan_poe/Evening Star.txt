1. 'Twas noontide of summer,
2. And mid-time of night;
3. And stars, in their orbits,
4. Shone pale, thro' the light
5. Of the brighter, cold moon,
6. 'Mid planets her slaves,
7. Herself in the Heavens,
8. Her beam on the waves.
9. I gazed awhile
10. On her cold smile;
11. Too cold- too cold for me-
12. There pass'd, as a shroud,
13. A fleecy cloud,
14. And I turned away to thee,
15. Proud Evening Star,
16. In thy glory afar,
17. And dearer thy beam shall be;
18. For joy to my heart
19. Is the proud part
20. Thou bearest in Heaven at night,
21. And more I admire
22. Thy distant fire,
23. Than that colder, lowly light.
