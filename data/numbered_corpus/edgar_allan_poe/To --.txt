1. The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see
2. The wantonest singing birds,
3. Are lips- and all thy melody
4. Of lip-begotten words-

5. Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined,
6. Then desolately fall,
7. O God! on my funereal mind
8. Like starlight on a pall-

9. Thy heart- thy heart!- I wake and sigh,
10. And sleep to dream till day
11. Of the truth that gold can never buy-
12. Of the baubles that it may.
