1. Thou wast all that to me, love,
2. For which my soul did pine-
3. A green isle in the sea, love,
4. A fountain and a shrine,
5. All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
6. And all the flowers were mine.

7. Ah, dream too bright to last!
8. Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
9. But to be overcast!
10. A voice from out the Future cries,
11. 'On! on!'- but o'er the Past
12. (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
13. Mute, motionless, aghast!

14. For, alas! alas! me
15. For me the light of Life is over!
16. 'No more- no more- no more-'
17. (Such language holds the solemn sea
18. To the sands upon the shore)
19. Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree
20. Or the stricken eagle soar!

21. And all my days are trances,
22. And all my nightly dreams
23. Are where thy grey eye glances,
24. And where thy footstep gleams-
25. In what ethereal dances,
26. By what eternal streams.
