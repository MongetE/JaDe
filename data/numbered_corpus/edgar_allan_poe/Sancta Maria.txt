1. Sancta Maria! turn thine eyes -
2. Upon the sinner's sacrifice,
3. Of fervent prayer and humble love,
4. From thy holy throne above.
5. At morn - at noon - at twilight dim -
6. Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
7. In joy and wo - in good and ill -
8. Mother of God, be with me still!

9. When the Hours flew brightly by,
10. And not a cloud obscured the sky,
11. My soul, lest it should truant be,
12. Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;

13. Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
14. Darkly my Present and my Past,
15. Let my Future radiant shine
16. With sweet hopes of thee and thine!
