1. In visions of the dark night
2. I have dreamed of joy departed-
3. But a waking dream of life and light
4. Hath left me broken-hearted.

5. Ah! what is not a dream by day
6. To him whose eyes are cast
7. On things around him with a ray
8. Turned back upon the past?

9. That holy dream- that holy dream,
10. While all the world were chiding,
11. Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
12. A lonely spirit guiding.

13. What though that light, thro' storm and night,
14. So trembled from afar-
15. What could there be more purely bright
16. In Truth's day-star?
