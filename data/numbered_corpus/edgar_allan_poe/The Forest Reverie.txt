1. 'Tis said that when
2. The hands of men
3. Tamed this primeval wood,
4. And hoary trees with groans of woe,
5. Like warriors by an unknown foe,
6. Were in their strength subdued,
7. The virgin Earth Gave instant birth
8. To springs that ne'er did flow
9. That in the sun Did rivulets run,
10. And all around rare flowers did blow
11. The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale
12. And the queenly lily adown the dale
13. (Whom the sun and the dew
14. And the winds did woo),
15. With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.

16. So when in tears
17. The love of years
18. Is wasted like the snow,
19. And the fine fibrils of its life
20. By the rude wrong of instant strife
21. Are broken at a blow
22. Within the heart
23. Do springs upstart
24. Of which it doth now know,
25. And strange, sweet dreams,
26. Like silent streams
27. That from new fountains overflow,
28. With the earlier tide
29. Of rivers glide
30. Deep in the heart whose hope has died--
31. Quenching the fires its ashes hide,--
32. Its ashes, whence will spring and grow
33. Sweet flowers, ere long,
34. The rare and radiant flowers of song!
