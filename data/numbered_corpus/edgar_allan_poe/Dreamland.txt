1. By a route obscure and lonely,
2. Haunted by ill angels only,
3. Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
4. On a black throne reigns upright,
5. I have reached these lands but newly
6. From an ultimate dim Thule-
7. From a wild clime that lieth, sublime,
8. Out of SPACE- out of TIME.

9. Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
10. And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
11. With forms that no man can discover
12. For the tears that drip all over;
13. Mountains toppling evermore
14. Into seas without a shore;
15. Seas that restlessly aspire,
16. Surging, unto skies of fire;
17. Lakes that endlessly outspread
18. Their lone waters- lone and dead,-
19. Their still waters- still and chilly
20. With the snows of the lolling lily.

21. By the lakes that thus outspread
22. Their lone waters, lone and dead,-
23. Their sad waters, sad and chilly
24. With the snows of the lolling lily,-
25. By the mountains- near the river
26. Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,-
27. By the grey woods,- by the swamp
28. Where the toad and the newt encamp-
29. By the dismal tarns and pools
30. Where dwell the Ghouls,-
31. By each spot the most unholy-
32. In each nook most melancholy-
33. There the traveller meets aghast
34. Sheeted Memories of the Past-
35. Shrouded forms that start and sigh
36. As they pass the wanderer by-
37. White-robed forms of friends long given,
38. In agony, to the Earth- and Heaven.

39. For the heart whose woes are legion
40. 'Tis a peaceful, soothing region-
41. For the spirit that walks in shadow
42. 'Tis- oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
43. But the traveller, travelling through it,
44. May not- dare not openly view it!
45. Never its mysteries are exposed
46. To the weak human eye unclosed;
47. So wills its King, who hath forbid
48. The uplifting of the fringed lid;
49. And thus the sad Soul that here passes
50. Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

51. By a route obscure and lonely,
52. Haunted by ill angels only,
53. Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
54. On a black throne reigns upright,
55. I have wandered home but newly
56. From this ultimate dim Thule.
