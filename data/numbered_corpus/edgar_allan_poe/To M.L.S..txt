1. Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
2. Of all to whom thine absence is the night-
3. The blotting utterly from out high heaven
4. The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee
5. Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all,
6. For the resurrection of deep-buried faith
7. In Truth- in Virtue- in Humanity-
8. Of all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed
9. Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
10. At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!"
11. At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
12. In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-
13. Of all who owe thee most- whose gratitude
14. Nearest resembles worship- oh, remember
15. The truest- the most fervently devoted,
16. And think that these weak lines are written by him-
17. By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
18. His spirit is communing with an angel's.
