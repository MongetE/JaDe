1. Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
2. Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
3. Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
4. Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
5. How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
6. Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
7. To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
8. Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
9. Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
10. And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
11. To seek a shelter in some happier star?
12. Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
13. The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
14. The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?
