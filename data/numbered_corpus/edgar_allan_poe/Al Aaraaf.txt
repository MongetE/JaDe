1. PART I

2. O! nothing earthly save the ray
3. (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,
4. As in those gardens where the day
5. Springs from the gems of Circassy-
6. O! nothing earthly save the thrill
7. Of melody in woodland rill-
8. Or (music of the passion-hearted)
9. Joy's voice so peacefully departed
10. That like the murmur in the shell,
11. Its echo dwelleth and will dwell-
12. Oh, nothing of the dross of ours-
13. Yet all the beauty- all the flowers
14. That list our Love, and deck our bowers-
15. Adorn yon world afar, afar-
16. The wandering star.

17. 'Twas a sweet time for Nesace- for there
18. Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
19. Near four bright suns- a temporary rest-
20. An oasis in desert of the blest.
21. Away- away- 'mid seas of rays that roll
22. Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul-
23. The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
24. Can struggle to its destin'd eminence,-
25. To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode
26. And late to ours, the favor'd one of God-
27. But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,
28. She throws aside the sceptre- leaves the helm,
29. And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
30. Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

31. Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
32. Whence sprang the 'Idea of Beauty' into birth,
33. (Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,
34. Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,
35. It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt)
36. She looked into Infinity- and knelt.
37. Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled-
38. Fit emblems of the model of her world-
39. Seen but in beauty- not impeding sight
40. Of other beauty glittering thro' the light-
41. A wreath that twined each starry form around,
42. And all the opal'd air in color bound.

43. All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
44. Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head
45. On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang
46. So eagerly around about to hang
47. Upon the flying footsteps of- deep pride-
48. Of her who lov'd a mortal- and so died.
49. The Sephalica, budding with young bees,
50. Upreared its purple stem around her knees:-
51. And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd-
52. Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd
53. All other loveliness:- its honied dew
54. (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
55. Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven,
56. And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
57. In Trebizond- and on a sunny flower
58. So like its own above that, to this hour,
59. It still remaineth, torturing the bee
60. With madness, and unwonted reverie:
61. In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
62. And blossom of the fairy plant in grief
63. Disconsolate linger- grief that hangs her head,
64. Repenting follies that full long have Red,
65. Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
66. Like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair:
67. Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
68. She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
69. And Clytia, pondering between many a sun,
70. While pettish tears adown her petals run:
71. And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth,
72. And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
73. Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
74. Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:
75. And Valisnerian lotus, thither flown'
76. From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
77. And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante!
78. Isola d'oro!- Fior di Levante!
79. And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
80. With Indian Cupid down the holy river-
81. Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given
82. To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven:

83. 'Spirit! that dwellest where,
84. In the deep sky,
85. The terrible and fair,
86. In beauty vie!
87. Beyond the line of blue-
88. The boundary of the star
89. Which turneth at the view
90. Of thy barrier and thy bar-
91. Of the barrier overgone
92. By the comets who were cast
93. From their pride and from their throne
94. To be drudges till the last-
95. To be carriers of fire
96. (The red fire of their heart)
97. With speed that may not tire
98. And with pain that shall not part-
99. Who livest- that we know-
100. In Eternity- we feel-
101. But the shadow of whose brow
102. What spirit shall reveal?
103. Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,
104. Thy messenger hath known
105. Have dream'd for thy Infinity
106. A model of their own-
107. Thy will is done, O God!
108. The star hath ridden high
109. Thro' many a tempest, but she rode
110. Beneath thy burning eye;
111. And here, in thought, to thee-
112. In thought that can alone
113. Ascend thy empire and so be
114. A partner of thy throne-
115. By winged Fantasy,
116. My embassy is given,
117. Till secrecy shall knowledge be
118. In the environs of Heaven.'

119. She ceas'd- and buried then her burning cheek
120. Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek
121. A shelter from the fervor of His eye;
122. For the stars trembled at the Deity.
123. She stirr'd not- breath'd not- for a voice was there
124. How solemnly pervading the calm air!
125. A sound of silence on the startled ear
126. Which dreamy poets name 'the music of the sphere.'
127. Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
128. 'Silence'- which is the merest word of all.
129. All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things
130. Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings-
131. But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high
132. The eternal voice of God is passing by,
133. And the red winds are withering in the sky:-

134. 'What tho 'in worlds which sightless cycles run,
135. Linked to a little system, and one sun-
136. Where all my love is folly and the crowd
137. Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
138. The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath-
139. (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)
140. What tho' in worlds which own a single sun
141. The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run,
142. Yet thine is my resplendency, so given
143. To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven!
144. Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
145. With all thy train, athwart the moony sky-
146. Apart- like fire-flies in Sicilian night,
147. And wing to other worlds another light!
148. Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
149. To the proud orbs that twinkle- and so be
150. To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban
151. Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!'

152. Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
153. The single-mooned eve!- on Earth we plight
154. Our faith to one love- and one moon adore-
155. The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.
156. As sprang that yellow star from downy hours
157. Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
158. And bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain
159. Her way, but left not yet her Therasaean reign.

160. PART II

161. High on a mountain of enamell'd head-
162. Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
163. Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
164. Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
165. With many a mutter'd 'hope to be forgiven'
166. What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven-
167. Of rosy head that, towering far away
168. Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
169. Of sunken suns at eve- at noon of night,
170. While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light-
171. Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
172. Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,
173. Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
174. Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
175. And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
176. Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
177. Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall
178. Of their own dissolution, while they die-
179. Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
180. A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,
181. Sat gently on these columns as a crown-
182. A window of one circular diamond, there,
183. Look'd out above into the purple air,
184. And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
185. And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,
186. Save, when, between th' empyrean and that ring,
187. Some eager spirit Flapp'd his dusky wing.
188. But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
189. The dimness of this world: that greyish green
190. That Nature loves the best Beauty's grave
191. Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave-
192. And every sculptur'd cherub thereabout
193. That from his marble dwelling peered out,
194. Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche-
195. Achaian statues in a world so rich!
196. Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis-
197. From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
198. Of beautiful Gomorrah! O, the wave
199. Is now upon thee- but too late to save!

200. Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
201. Witness the murmur of the grey twilight
202. That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco,
203. Of many a wild star-gazer long ago-
204. That stealeth ever on the ear of him
205. Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
206. And sees the darkness coming as a cloud-
207. Is not its form- its voice- most palpable and loud?

208. But what is this?- it cometh, and it brings
209. A music with it- 'tis the rush of wings-
210. A pause- and then a sweeping, falling strain
211. And Nesace is in her halls again.
212. From the wild energy of wanton haste
213. Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
214. And zone that clung around her gentle waist
215. Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
216. Within the centre of that hall to breathe,
217. She paused and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,
218. The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
219. And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there.

220. Young flowers were whispering in melody
221. To happy flowers that night- and tree to tree;
222. Fountains were gushing music as they fell
223. In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;
224. Yet silence came upon material things-
225. Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings-
226. And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
227. Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

228. ''Neath the blue-bell or streamer-
229. Or tufted wild spray
230. That keeps, from the dreamer,
231. The moonbeam away-
232. Bright beings! that ponder,
233. With half closing eyes,
234. On the stars which your wonder
235. Hath drawn from the skies,
236. Till they glance thro' the shade, and
237. Come down to your brow
238. Like- eyes of the maiden
239. Who calls on you now-
240. Arise! from your dreaming
241. In violet bowers,
242. To duty beseeming
243. These star-litten hours-
244. And shake from your tresses
245. Encumber'd with dew
246. The breath of those kisses
247. That cumber them too-
248. (O! how, without you, Love!
249. Could angels be blest?)
250. Those kisses of true Love
251. That lull'd ye to rest!
252. Up!- shake from your wing
253. Each hindering thing:
254. The dew of the night-
255. It would weigh down your flight
256. And true love caresses-
257. O, leave them apart!
258. They are light on the tresses,
259. But lead on the heart.

260. Ligeia! Ligeia!
261. My beautiful one!
262. Whose harshest idea
263. Will to melody run,
264. O! is it thy will
265. On the breezes to toss?
266. Or, capriciously still,
267. Like the lone Albatros,
268. Incumbent on night
269. (As she on the air)
270. To keep watch with delight
271. On the harmony there?

272. Ligeia! wherever
273. Thy image may be,
274. No magic shall sever
275. Thy music from thee.
276. Thou hast bound many eyes
277. In a dreamy sleep-
278. But the strains still arise
279. Which thy vigilance keep-
280. The sound of the rain,
281. Which leaps down to the flower-
282. And dances again
283. In the rhythm of the shower-
284. The murmur that springs
285. From the growing of grass
286. Are the music of things-
287. But are modell'd, alas!-
288. Away, then, my dearest,
289. Oh! hie thee away
290. To the springs that lie clearest
291. Beneath the moon-ray-
292. To lone lake that smiles,
293. In its dream of deep rest,
294. At the many star-isles
295. That enjewel its breast-
296. Where wild flowers, creeping,
297. Have mingled their shade,
298. On its margin is sleeping
299. Full many a maid-
300. Some have left the cool glade, and
301. Have slept with the bee-
302. Arouse them, my maiden,
303. On moorland and lea-
304. Go! breathe on their slumber,
305. All softly in ear,
306. Thy musical number
307. They slumbered to hear-
308. For what can awaken
309. An angel so soon,
310. Whose sleep hath been taken
311. Beneath the cold moon,
312. As the spell which no slumber
313. Of witchery may test,
314. The rhythmical number
315. Which lull'd him to rest?'

316. Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
317. A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',
318. Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight-
319. Seraphs in all but 'Knowledge,' the keen light
320. That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar,
321. O Death! from eye of God upon that star:
322. Sweet was that error- sweeter still that death-
323. Sweet was that error- even with us the breath
324. Of Science dims the mirror of our joy-
325. To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy-
326. For what (to them) availeth it to know
327. That Truth is Falsehood- or that Bliss is Woe?
328. Sweet was their death- with them to die was rife
329. With the last ecstasy of satiate life-
330. Beyond that death no immortality-
331. But sleep that pondereth and is not 'to be'!-
332. And there- oh! may my weary spirit dwell-
333. Apart from Heaven's Eternity- and yet how far from Hell!
334. What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,
335. Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
336. But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts
337. To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
338. A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover-
339. O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
340. Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?
341. Unguided Love hath fallen- 'mid 'tears of perfect moan.'
342. He was a goodly spirit- he who fell:
343. A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well-
344. A gazer on the lights that shine above-
345. A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
346. What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
347. And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair-
348. And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy
349. To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
350. The night had found (to him a night of woe)
351. Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo-
352. Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
353. And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
354. Here sat he with his love- his dark eye bent
355. With eagle gaze along the firmament:
356. Now turn'd it upon her- but ever then
357. It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.

358. 'Ianthe, dearest, see- how dim that ray!
359. How lovely 'tis to look so far away!
360. She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve
361. I left her gorgeous halls- nor mourn'd to leave.
362. That eve- that eve- I should remember well-
363. The sun-ray dropp'd in Lemnos, with a spell
364. On th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall
365. Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall-
366. And on my eyelids- O the heavy light!
367. How drowsily it weigh'd them into night!
368. On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
369. With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
370. But O that light!- I slumber'd- Death, the while,
371. Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle
372. So softly that no single silken hair
373. Awoke that slept- or knew that he was there.

374. 'The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon
375. Was a proud temple call'd the Parthenon;
376. More beauty clung around her column'd wall
377. Than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal,
378. And when old Time my wing did disenthral
379. Thence sprang I- as the eagle from his tower,
380. And years I left behind me in an hour.
381. What time upon her airy bounds I hung,
382. One half the garden of her globe was flung
383. Unrolling as a chart unto my view-
384. Tenantless cities of the desert too!
385. Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
386. And half I wish'd to be again of men.'

387. 'My Angelo! and why of them to be?
388. A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee-
389. And greener fields than in yon world above,
390. And woman's loveliness- and passionate love.'

391. 'But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft
392. Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft,
393. Perhaps my brain grew dizzy- but the world
394. I left so late was into chaos hurl'd-
395. Sprang from her station, on the winds apart.
396. And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
397. Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar
398. And fell- not swiftly as I rose before,
399. But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'
400. Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
401. Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
402. For nearest of all stars was thine to ours-
403. Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
404. A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.'

405. 'We came- and to thy Earth- but not to us
406. Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:
407. We came, my love; around, above, below,
408. Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
409. Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
410. She grants to us, as granted by her God-
411. But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd
412. Never his fairy wing O'er fairier world!
413. Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
414. Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
415. When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
416. Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea-
417. But when its glory swell'd upon the sky,
418. As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,
419. We paused before the heritage of men,
420. And thy star trembled- as doth Beauty then!'

421. Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away
422. The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
423. They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts
424. Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.
