1. Kind solace in a dying hour!
2. Such, father, is not (now) my theme-
3. I will not madly deem that power
4. Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
5. Unearthly pride hath revell'd in-
6. I have no time to dote or dream:
7. You call it hope- that fire of fire!
8. It is but agony of desire:
9. If I can hope- Oh God! I can-
10. Its fount is holier- more divine-
11. I would not call thee fool, old man,
12. But such is not a gift of thine.

13. Know thou the secret of a spirit
14. Bow'd from its wild pride into shame.
15. O yearning heart! I did inherit
16. Thy withering portion with the fame,
17. The searing glory which hath shone
18. Amid the jewels of my throne,
19. Halo of Hell! and with a pain
20. Not Hell shall make me fear again-
21. O craving heart, for the lost flowers
22. And sunshine of my summer hours!
23. The undying voice of that dead time,
24. With its interminable chime,
25. Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
26. Upon thy emptiness- a knell.

27. I have not always been as now:
28. The fever'd diadem on my brow
29. I claim'd and won usurpingly-
30. Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
31. Rome to the Caesar- this to me?
32. The heritage of a kingly mind,
33. And a proud spirit which hath striven
34. Triumphantly with human kind.

35. On mountain soil I first drew life:
36. The mists of the Taglay have shed
37. Nightly their dews upon my head,
38. And, I believe, the winged strife
39. And tumult of the headlong air
40. Have nestled in my very hair.

41. So late from Heaven- that dew- it fell
42. (Mid dreams of an unholy night)
43. Upon me with the touch of Hell,
44. While the red flashing of the light
45. From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,
46. Appeared to my half-closing eye
47. The pageantry of monarchy,
48. And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
49. Came hurriedly upon me, telling
50. Of human battle, where my voice,
51. My own voice, silly child!- was swelling
52. (O! how my spirit would rejoice,
53. And leap within me at the cry)
54. The battle-cry of Victory!

55. The rain came down upon my head
56. Unshelter'd- and the heavy wind
57. Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
58. It was but man, I thought, who shed
59. Laurels upon me: and the rush-
60. The torrent of the chilly air
61. Gurgled within my ear the crush
62. Of empires- with the captive's prayer-
63. The hum of suitors- and the tone
64. Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.

65. My passions, from that hapless hour,
66. Usurp'd a tyranny which men
67. Have deem'd, since I have reach'd to power,
68. My innate nature- be it so:
69. But father, there liv'd one who, then,
70. Then- in my boyhood- when their fire
71. Burn'd with a still intenser glow,
72. (For passion must, with youth, expire)
73. E'en then who knew this iron heart
74. In woman's weakness had a part.

75. I have no words- alas!- to tell
76. The loveliness of loving well!
77. Nor would I now attempt to trace
78. The more than beauty of a face
79. Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
80. Are- shadows on th' unstable wind:
81. Thus I remember having dwelt
82. Some page of early lore upon,
83. With loitering eye, till I have felt
84. The letters- with their meaning- melt
85. To fantasies- with none.

86. O, she was worthy of all love!
87. Love- as in infancy was mine-
88. 'Twas such as angel minds above
89. Might envy; her young heart the shrine
90. On which my every hope and thought
91. Were incense- then a goodly gift,
92. For they were childish and upright-
93. Pure- as her young example taught:
94. Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
95. Trust to the fire within, for light?

96. We grew in age- and love- together,
97. Roaming the forest, and the wild;
98. My breast her shield in wintry weather-
99. And when the friendly sunshine smil'd,
100. And she would mark the opening skies,
101. I saw no Heaven- but in her eyes.

102. Young Love's first lesson is- the heart:
103. For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
104. When, from our little cares apart,
105. And laughing at her girlish wiles,
106. I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,
107. And pour my spirit out in tears-
108. There was no need to speak the rest-
109. No need to quiet any fears
110. Of her- who ask'd no reason why,
111. But turn'd on me her quiet eye!

112. Yet more than worthy of the love
113. My spirit struggled with, and strove,
114. When, on the mountain peak, alone,
115. Ambition lent it a new tone-
116. I had no being- but in thee:
117. The world, and all it did contain
118. In the earth- the air- the sea-
119. Its joy- its little lot of pain
120. That was new pleasure- the ideal,
121. Dim vanities of dreams by night-

122. And dimmer nothings which were real-
123. (Shadows- and a more shadowy light!)
124. Parted upon their misty wings,
125. And, so, confusedly, became
126. Thine image, and- a name- a name!
127. Two separate- yet most intimate things.

128. I was ambitious- have you known
129. The passion, father? You have not:
130. A cottager, I mark'd a throne
131. Of half the world as all my own,
132. And murmur'd at such lowly lot-
133. But, just like any other dream,
134. Upon the vapour of the dew
135. My own had past, did not the beam
136. Of beauty which did while it thro'
137. The minute- the hour- the day- oppress
138. My mind with double loveliness.

139. We walk'd together on the crown
140. Of a high mountain which look'd down
141. Afar from its proud natural towers
142. Of rock and forest, on the hills-
143. The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers,
144. And shouting with a thousand rills.

145. I spoke to her of power and pride,
146. But mystically- in such guise
147. That she might deem it nought beside
148. The moment's converse; in her eyes
149. I read, perhaps too carelessly-
150. A mingled feeling with my own-
151. The flush on her bright cheek, to me
152. Seem'd to become a queenly throne
153. Too well that I should let it be
154. Light in the wilderness alone.

155. I wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,
156. And donn'd a visionary crown-
157. Yet it was not that Fantasy
158. Had thrown her mantle over me-
159. But that, among the rabble- men,
160. Lion ambition is chained down-
161. And crouches to a keeper's hand-
162. Not so in deserts where the grand-
163. The wild- the terrible conspire
164. With their own breath to fan his fire.

165. Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!
166. Is not she queen of Earth? her pride
167. Above all cities? in her hand
168. Their destinies? in all beside
169. Of glory which the world hath known
170. Stands she not nobly and alone?
171. Falling- her veriest stepping-stone
172. Shall form the pedestal of a throne-
173. And who her sovereign? Timour- he
174. Whom the astonished people saw
175. Striding o'er empires haughtily
176. A diadem'd outlaw!

177. O, human love! thou spirit given
178. On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
179. Which fall'st into the soul like rain
180. Upon the Siroc-wither'd plain,
181. And, failing in thy power to bless,
182. But leav'st the heart a wilderness!
183. Idea! which bindest life around
184. With music of so strange a sound,
185. And beauty of so wild a birth-
186. Farewell! for I have won the Earth.

187. When Hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see
188. No cliff beyond him in the sky,
189. His pinions were bent droopingly-
190. And homeward turn'd his soften'd eye.
191. 'Twas sunset: when the sun will part
192. There comes a sullenness of heart
193. To him who still would look upon
194. The glory of the summer sun.
195. That soul will hate the ev'ning mist,
196. So often lovely, and will list
197. To the sound of the coming darkness (known
198. To those whose spirits hearken) as one
199. Who, in a dream of night, would fly
200. But cannot from a danger nigh.

201. What tho' the moon- the white moon
202. Shed all the splendour of her noon,
203. Her smile is chilly, and her beam,
204. In that time of dreariness, will seem
205. (So like you gather in your breath)
206. A portrait taken after death.
207. And boyhood is a summer sun
208. Whose waning is the dreariest one-
209. For all we live to know is known,
210. And all we seek to keep hath flown-
211. Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
212. With the noon-day beauty- which is all.

213. I reach'd my home- my home no more
214. For all had flown who made it so.
215. I pass'd from out its mossy door,
216. And, tho' my tread was soft and low,
217. A voice came from the threshold stone
218. Of one whom I had earlier known-
219. O, I defy thee, Hell, to show
220. On beds of fire that burn below,
221. A humbler heart- a deeper woe.

222. Father, I firmly do believe-
223. I know- for Death, who comes for me
224. From regions of the blest afar,
225. Where there is nothing to deceive,
226. Hath left his iron gate ajar,
227. And rays of truth you cannot see
228. Are flashing thro' Eternity-
229. I do believe that Eblis hath
230. A snare in every human path-
231. Else how, when in the holy grove
232. I wandered of the idol, Love,
233. Who daily scents his snowy wings
234. With incense of burnt offerings
235. From the most unpolluted things,
236. Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
237. Above with trellis'd rays from Heaven,
238. No mote may shun- no tiniest fly-
239. The lightning of his eagle eye-
240. How was it that Ambition crept,
241. Unseen, amid the revels there,
242. Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
243. In the tangles of Love's very hair?
