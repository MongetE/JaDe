1. In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
2. "Whose heart-strings are a lute";
3. None sing so wildly well
4. As the angel Israfel,
5. And the giddy stars (so legends tell),
6. Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
7. Of his voice, all mute.

8. Tottering above
9. In her highest noon,
10. The enamored moon
11. Blushes with love,
12. While, to listen, the red levin
13. (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
14. Which were seven,)
15. Pauses in Heaven.

16. And they say (the starry choir
17. And the other listening things)
18. That Israfeli's fire
19. Is owing to that lyre
20. By which he sits and sings-
21. The trembling living wire
22. Of those unusual strings.

23. But the skies that angel trod,
24. Where deep thoughts are a duty-
25. Where Love's a grown-up God-
26. Where the Houri glances are
27. Imbued with all the beauty
28. Which we worship in a star.

29. Therefore thou art not wrong,
30. Israfeli, who despisest
31. An unimpassioned song;
32. To thee the laurels belong,
33. Best bard, because the wisest!
34. Merrily live, and long!

35. The ecstasies above
36. With thy burning measures suit-
37. Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
38. With the fervor of thy lute-
39. Well may the stars be mute!

40. Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
41. Is a world of sweets and sours;
42. Our flowers are merely- flowers,
43. And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
44. Is the sunshine of ours.

45. If I could dwell
46. Where Israfel
47. Hath dwelt, and he where I,
48. He might not sing so wildly well
49. A mortal melody,
50. While a bolder note than this might swell
51. From my lyre within the sky.
