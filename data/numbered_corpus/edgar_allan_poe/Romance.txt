1. Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
2. With drowsy head and folded wing,
3. Among the green leaves as they shake
4. Far down within some shadowy lake,
5. To me a painted paroquet
6. Hath been- a most familiar bird-
7. Taught me my alphabet to say-
8. To lisp my very earliest word
9. While in the wild wood I did lie,
10. A child- with a most knowing eye.

11. Of late, eternal Condor years
12. So shake the very Heaven on high
13. With tumult as they thunder by,
14. I have no time for idle cares
15. Through gazing on the unquiet sky.
16. And when an hour with calmer wings
17. Its down upon my spirit flings-
18. That little time with lyre and rhyme
19. To while away- forbidden things!
20. My heart would feel to be a crime
21. Unless it trembled with the strings.
