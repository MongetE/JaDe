1. I.       Beneath the vine-clad eaves,
2. Whose shadows fall before
3. Thy lowly cottage door--
4. Under the lilac's tremulous leaves--
5. Within thy snowy clasped hand
6. The purple flowers it bore.
7. Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,
8. Like queenly nymph from Fairy-land--
9. Enchantress of the flowery wand,
10. Most beauteous Isadore!

11. II.      And when I bade the dream
12. Upon thy spirit flee,
13. Thy violet eyes to me
14. Upturned, did overflowing seem
15. With the deep, untold delight
16. Of Love's serenity;
17. Thy classic brow, like lilies white
18. And pale as the Imperial Night
19. Upon her throne, with stars bedight,
20. Enthralled my soul to thee!


21. III.     Ah! ever I behold
22. Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
23. Blue as the languid skies
24. Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold;
25. Now strangely clear thine image grows,
26. And olden memories
27. Are startled from their long repose
28. Like shadows on the silent snows
29. When suddenly the night-wind blows
30. Where quiet moonlight lies.


31. IV.      Like music heard in dreams,
32. Like strains of harps unknown,
33. Of birds for ever flown,--
34. Audible as the voice of streams
35. That murmur in some leafy dell,
36. I hear thy gentlest tone,
37. And Silence cometh with her spell
38. Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
39. When tremulous in dreams I tell
40. My love to thee alone!

41. V.       In every valley heard,
42. Floating from tree to tree,
43. Less beautiful to me,
44. The music of the radiant bird,
45. Than artless accents such as thine
46. Whose echoes never flee!
47. Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:--
48. For uttered in thy tones benign
49. (Enchantress!) this rude name of mine
50. Doth seem a melody!
