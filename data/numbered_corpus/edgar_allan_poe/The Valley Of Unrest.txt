1. Once it smiled a silent dell
2. Where the people did not dwell;
3. They had gone unto the wars,
4. Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
5. Nightly, from their azure towers,
6. To keep watch above the flowers,
7. In the midst of which all day
8. The red sunlight lazily lay.
9. Now each visitor shall confess
10. The sad valley's restlessness.
11. Nothing there is motionless-
12. Nothing save the airs that brood
13. Over the magic solitude.
14. Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
15. That palpitate like the chill seas
16. Around the misty Hebrides!
17. Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
18. That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
19. Uneasily, from morn till even,
20. Over the violets there that lie
21. In myriad types of the human eye-
22. Over the lilies there that wave
23. And weep above a nameless grave!
24. They wave:- from out their fragrant tops
25. Eternal dews come down in drops.
26. They weep:- from off their delicate stems
27. Perennial tears descend in gems.
