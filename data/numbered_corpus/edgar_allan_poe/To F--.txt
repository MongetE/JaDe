1. Beloved! amid the earnest woes
2. That crowd around my earthly path-
3. (Drear path, alas! where grows
4. Not even one lonely rose)-
5. My soul at least a solace hath
6. In dreams of thee, and therein knows
7. An Eden of bland repose.

8. And thus thy memory is to me
9. Like some enchanted far-off isle
10. In some tumultuous sea-
11. Some ocean throbbing far and free
12. With storms- but where meanwhile
13. Serenest skies continually
14. Just o'er that one bright island smile.
