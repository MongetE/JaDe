1. Dim vales- and shadowy floods-
2. And cloudy-looking woods,
3. Whose forms we can't discover
4. For the tears that drip all over!
5. Huge moons there wax and wane-
6. Again- again- again-
7. Every moment of the night-
8. Forever changing places-
9. And they put out the star-light
10. With the breath from their pale faces.
11. About twelve by the moon-dial,
12. One more filmy than the rest
13. (A kind which, upon trial,
14. They have found to be the best)
15. Comes down- still down- and down,
16. With its centre on the crown
17. Of a mountain's eminence,
18. While its wide circumference
19. In easy drapery falls
20. Over hamlets, over halls,
21. Wherever they may be-
22. O'er the strange woods- o'er the sea-
23. Over spirits on the wing-
24. Over every drowsy thing-
25. And buries them up quite
26. In a labyrinth of light-
27. And then, how deep!- O, deep!
28. Is the passion of their sleep.
29. In the morning they arise,
30. And their moony covering
31. Is soaring in the skies,
32. With the tempests as they toss,
33. Like- almost anything-
34. Or a yellow Albatross.
35. They use that moon no more
36. For the same end as before-
37. Videlicet, a tent-
38. Which I think extravagant:
39. Its atomies, however,
40. Into a shower dissever,
41. Of which those butterflies
42. Of Earth, who seek the skies,
43. And so come down again,
44. (Never-contented things!)
45. Have brought a specimen
46. Upon their quivering wings.
