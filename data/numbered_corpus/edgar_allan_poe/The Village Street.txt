1. In these rapid, restless shadows,
2. Once I walked at eventide,
3. When a gentle, silent maiden,
4. Walked in beauty at my side.
5. She alone there walked beside me
6. All in beauty, like a bride.
7. Pallidly the moon was shining
8. On the dewy meadows nigh;
9. On the silvery, silent rivers,
10. On the mountains far and high,--
11. On the ocean's star-lit waters,
12. Where the winds a-weary die.

13. Slowly, silently we wandered
14. From the open cottage door,
15. Underneath the elm's long branches
16. To the pavement bending o'er;
17. Underneath the mossy willow
18. And the dying sycamore.

19. With the myriad stars in beauty
20. All bedight, the heavens were seen,
21. Radiant hopes were bright around me,
22. Like the light of stars serene;
23. Like the mellow midnight splendor
24. Of the Night's irradiate queen.

25. Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
26. Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
27. Like the distant murmured music
28. Of unquiet, lovely seas;
29. While the winds were hushed in slumber
30. In the fragrant flowers and trees.

31. Wondrous and unwonted beauty
32. Still adorning all did seem,
33. While I told my love in fables
34. 'Neath the willows by the stream;
35. Would the heart have kept unspoken
36. Love that was its rarest dream!

37. Instantly away we wandered
38. In the shadowy twilight tide,
39. She, the silent, scornful maiden,
40. Walking calmly at my side,
41. With a step serene and stately,
42. All in beauty, all in pride.

43. Vacantly I walked beside her.
44. On the earth mine eyes were cast;
45. Swift and keen there came unto me
46. Bitter memories of the past--
47. On me, like the rain in Autumn
48. On the dead leaves, cold and fast.

49. Underneath the elms we parted,
50. By the lowly cottage door;
51. One brief word alone was uttered--
52. Never on our lips before;
53. And away I walked forlornly,
54. Broken-hearted evermore.

55. Slowly, silently I loitered,
56. Homeward, in the night, alone;
57. Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
58. That my youth had never known;
59. Wild unrest, like that which cometh
60. When the Night's first dream hath flown.

61. Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
62. Mad, discordant melodies,
63. And keen melodies like shadows
64. Haunt the moaning willow trees,
65. And the sycamores with laughter
66. Mock me in the nightly breeze.

67. Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
68. Through the sighing foliage streams;
69. And each morning, midnight shadow,
70. Shadow of my sorrow seems;
71. Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!
72. And, O soul, forget thy dreams!
