1. The gloomy hulls in armor grim,
2. Like clouds o'er moors have met,
3. And prove that oak, and iron, and man
4. Are tough in fibre yet.

5. But Splendors wane. The sea-fight yields
6. No front of old display;
7. The garniture, emblazonment,
8. And heraldry all decay.

9. Towering afar in parting light,
10. The fleets like Albion's forelands shine--
11. The full-sailed fleets, the shrouded show
12. Of Ships-of-the-Line.

13. The fighting _Temeraire,_
14. Built of a thousand trees,
15. Lunging out her lightnings,
16. And beetling o'er the seas--
17. O Ship, how brave and fair,
18. That fought so oft and well,

19. On open decks you manned the gun
20. Armorial.
21. What cheerings did you share,
22. Impulsive in the van,
23. When down upon leagued France and
24. Spain
25. We English ran--
26. The freshet at your bowsprit
27. Like the foam upon the can.
28. Bickering, your colors
29. Licked up the Spanish air,
30. You flapped with flames of battle-flags--
31. Your challenge, _Temeraire!_
32. The rear ones of our fleet
33. They yearned to share your place,
34. Still vying with the Victory
35. Throughout that earnest race--
36. The Victory, whose Admiral,
37. With orders nobly won,
38. Shone in the globe of the battle glow--
39. The angel in that sun.
40. Parallel in story,
41. Lo, the stately pair,
42. As late in grapple ranging,
43. The foe between them there--
44. When four great hulls lay tiered,
45. And the fiery tempest cleared,
46. And your prizes twain appeared,
47. _Temeraire!_

48. But Trafalgar is over now,
49. The quarter-deck undone;
50. The carved and castled navies fire
51. Their evening-gun.
52. O, Titan _Temeraire,_
53. Your stern-lights fade away;
54. Your bulwarks to the years must yield,
55. And heart-of-oak decay.
56. A pigmy steam-tug tows you,
57. Gigantic, to the shore--
58. Dismantled of your guns and spars,
59. And sweeping wings of war.
60. The rivets clinch the iron clads,
61. Men learn a deadlier lore;
62. But Fame has nailed your battle-flags--
63. Your ghost it sails before:
64. O, the navies old and oaken,
65. O, the _Temeraire_ no more!
