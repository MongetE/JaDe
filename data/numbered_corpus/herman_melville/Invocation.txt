1. Ha, ha, gods and kings; fill high, one and all;
2. Drink, drink! shout and drink! mad respond to
3. the call!
4. Fill fast, and fill full; 'gainst the goblet ne'er
5. sin;
6. Quaff there, at high tide, to the uttermost
7. rim:--
8. Flood-tide, and soul-tide to the brim!

9. Who with wine in him fears? who thinks of his
10. cares?
11. Who sighs to be wise, when wine in him flares?
12. Water sinks down below, in currents full slow;
13. But wine mounts on high with its genial glow:--
14. Welling up, till the brain overflow!

15. As the spheres, with a roll, some fiery of soul,
16. Others golden, with music, revolve round the
17. pole;
18. So let our cups, radiant with many hued wines,
19. Round and round in groups circle, our Zodiac's
20. Signs:--
21. Round reeling, and ringing their chimes!

22. Then drink, gods and kings; wine merriment
23. brings;
24. It bounds through the veins; there, jubilant
25. sings.
26. Let it ebb, then, and flow; wine never grows
27. dim;
28. Drain down that bright tide at the foam beaded
29. rim:--
30. Fill up, every cup, to the brim!
