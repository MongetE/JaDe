1. ALOFT he guards the starry folds
2. Who is the brother of the star;
3. The bird whose joy is in the wind
4. Exulteth in the war.

5. No painted plume—a sober hue,
6. His beauty is his power;
7. That eager calm of gaze intent
8. Foresees the Sibyl’s hour.

9. Austere, he crowns the swaying perch,
10. Flapped by the angry flag;
11. The hurricane from the battery sings,
12. But his claw has known the crag.

13. Amid the scream of shells, his scream
14. Runs shrilling; and the glare
15. Of eyes that brave the blinding sun
16. The volleyed flame can bear.

17. The pride of quenchless strength is his—
18. Strength which, though chained, avails;
19. The very rebel looks and thrills—
20. The anchored Emblem hails.

21. Though scarred in many a furious fray,
22. No deadly hurt he knew;
23. Well may we think his years are charmed—
24. The Eagle of the Blue.
