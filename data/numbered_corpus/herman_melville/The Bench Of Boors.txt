1. In bed I muse on Tenier's boors,
2. Embrowned and beery losels all;
3. A wakeful brain
4. Elaborates pain:
5. Within low doors the slugs of boors
6. Laze and yawn and doze again.

7. In dreams they doze, the drowsy boors,
8. Their hazy hovel warm and small:
9. Thought's ampler bound
10. But chill is found:
11. Within low doors the basking boors
12. Snugly hug the ember-mound.

13. Sleepless, I see the slumberous boors
14. Their blurred eyes blink, their eyelids fall:
15. Thought's eager sight
16. Aches--overbright!
17. Within low doors the boozy boors
18. Cat-naps take in pipe-bowl light.
