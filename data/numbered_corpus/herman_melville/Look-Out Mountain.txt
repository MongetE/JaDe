1. WHO inhabiteth the Mountain
2. That it shines in lurid light,
3. And is rolled about with thunders,
4. And terrors, and a blight,
5. Like Kaf the peak of Eblis-
6. Kaf, the evil height?
7. Who has gone up with a shouting
8. And a trumpet in the night?

9. There is battle in the Mountain-
10. Might assaulteth Might;
11. 'Tis the fastness of the Anarch,
12. Torrent-torn, an ancient height;
13. The crags resound the clangor
14. Of the war of Wrong and Right;
15. And the armies in the valley
16. Watch and pray for dawning light.

17. Joy, joy, the day is breaking,
18. And the cloud is rolled from sight;
19. There is triumph in the Morning
20. For the Anarch's plunging flight;
21. God has glorified the Mountain
22. Where a banner burneth bright,
23. And the armies of the valley
24. They are fortified in right.
