1. _At The Surf Inn_

2. List the harp in window wailing
3. Stirred by fitful gales from sea:
4. Shrieking up in mad crescendo--
5. Dying down in plaintive key!

6. Listen: less a strain ideal
7. Than Ariel's rendering of the Real.
8. What that Real is, let hint
9. A picture stamped in memory's mint.

10. Braced well up, with beams aslant,
11. Betwixt the continents sails the _Phocion,_
12. For Baltimore bound from Alicant.
13. Blue breezy skies white fleeces fleck
14. Over the chill blue white-capped ocean:
15. From yard-arm comes--'Wreck ho, a
16. wreck!'

17. Dismasted and adrift,
18. Longtime a thing forsaken;
19. Overwashed by every wave
20. Like the slumbering kraken;
21. Heedless if the billow roar,
22. Oblivious of the lull,
23. Leagues and leagues from shoal or shore,
24. It swims--a levelled hull:
25. Bulwarks gone--a shaven wreck,
26. Nameless and a grass-green deck.
27. A lumberman: perchance, in hold
28. Prostrate pines with hemlocks rolled.

29. It has drifted, waterlogged,
30. Till by trailing weeds beclogged:
31. Drifted, drifted, day by day,
32. Pilotless on pathless way.
33. It has drifted till each plank
34. Is oozy as the oyster-bank:
35. Drifted, drifted, night by night,
36. Craft that never shows a light;
37. Nor ever, to prevent worse knell,
38. Tolls in fog the warning bell.

39. From collision never shrinking,
40. Drive what may through darksome smother;
41. Saturate, but never sinking,
42. Fatal only to the _other!_
43. Deadlier than the sunken reef
44. Since still the snare it shifteth,
45. Torpid in dumb ambuscade
46. Waylayingly it drifteth.

47. O, the sailors--O, the sails!
48. O, the lost crews never heard of!
49. Well the harp of Ariel wails
50. Thought that tongue can tell no word of!
