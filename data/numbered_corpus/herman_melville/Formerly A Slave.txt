1. The sufferance of her race is shown,
2. And retrospect of life,
3. Which now too late deliverance dawns upon;
4. Yet is she not at strife.

5. Her children's children they shall know
6. The good withheld from her;
7. And so her reverie takes prophetic cheer--
8. In spirit she sees the stir.

9. Far down the depth of thousand years,
10. And marks the revel shine;
11. Her dusky face is lit with sober light,
12. Sibylline, yet benign.
