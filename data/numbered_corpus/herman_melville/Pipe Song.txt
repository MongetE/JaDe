1. Care is all stuff:--
2. Puff! Puff!To puff is enough:--
3. Puff! Puff
4. More musky than snuff,
5. And warm is a puff:--
6. Puff! Puff
7. Here we sit mid our puffs,
8. Like old lords in their ruffs,
9. Snug as bears in their muffs:--
10. Puff! Puff
11. Then puff, puff, puff,
12. For care is all stuff,
13. Puffed off in a puff--
14. Puff! Puff!
