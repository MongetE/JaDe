1. In time and measure perfect moves
2. All Art whose aim is sure;
3. Evolving rhyme and stars divine
4. Have rules, and they endure.

5. Nor less the Fleet that warred for Right,
6. And, warring so, prevailed,
7. In geometric beauty curved,
8. And in an orbit sailed.

9. The rebel at Port Royal felt
10. The Unity overawe,
11. And rued the spell. A type was here,
12. And victory of LAW.
