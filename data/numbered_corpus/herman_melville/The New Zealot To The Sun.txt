1. Persian, you rise
2. Aflame from climes of sacrifice
3. Where adulators sue,
4. And prostrate man, with brow abased,
5. Adheres to rites whose tenor traced
6. All worship hitherto.

7. Arch type of sway,
8. Meetly your over-ruling ray
9. You fling from Asia's plain,
10. Whence flashed the javelins abroad
11. Of many a wild incursive horde
12. Led by some shepherd Cain.

13. Mid terrors dinned
14. Gods too came conquerors from your Ind,
15. The book of Brahma throve;
16. They came like to the scythed car,
17. Westward they rolled their empire far,
18. Of night their purple wove.

19. Chemist, you breed
20. In orient climes each sorcerous weed
21. That energizes dream--
22. Transmitted, spread in myths and creeds,
23. Houris and hells, delirious screeds
24. And Calvin's last extreme.

25. What though your light
26. In time's first dawn compelled the flight
27. Of Chaos' startled clan,
28. Shall never all your darted spears
29. Disperse worse Anarchs, frauds and fears,
30. Sprung from these weeds to man?

31. But Science yet
32. An effluence ampler shall beget,
33. And power beyond your play--
34. Shall quell the shades you fail to rout,
35. Yea, searching every secret out
36. Elucidate your ray.
