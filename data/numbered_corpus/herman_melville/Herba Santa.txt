1. I
2. After long wars when comes release
3. Not olive wands proclaiming peace
4. Can import dearer share
5. Than stems of Herba Santa hazed
6. In autumn's Indian air.
7. Of moods they breathe that care disarm,
8. They pledge us lenitive and calm.

9. II
10. Shall code or creed a lure afford
11. To win all selves to Love's accord?
12. When Love ordained a supper divine
13. For the wide world of man,
14. What bickerings o'er his gracious wine!
15. Then strange new feuds began.

16. Effectual more in lowlier way,
17. Pacific Herb, thy sensuous plea
18. The bristling clans of Adam sway
19. At least to fellowship in thee!
20. Before thine altar tribal flags are furled,
21. Fain wouldst thou make one hearthstone of
22. the world.

23. III
24. To scythe, to sceptre, pen and hod--
25. Yea, sodden laborers dumb;
26. To brains overplied, to feet that plod,
27. In solace of the _Truce of God_
28. The Calumet has come!

29. IV
30. Ah for the world ere Raleigh's find
31. Never that knew this suasive balm
32. That helps when Gilead's fails to heal,
33. Helps by an interserted charm.

34. Insinuous thou that through the nerve
35. Windest the soul, and so canst win
36. Some from repinings, some from sin,
37. The Church's aim thou dost subserve.

38. The ruffled fag fordone with care
39. And brooding, God would ease this pain:
40. Him soothest thou and smoothest down
41. Till some content return again.

42. Even ruffians feel thy influence breed
43. Saint Martin's summer in the mind,
44. They feel this last evangel plead,
45. As did the first, apart from creed,
46. Be peaceful, man--be kind!

47. V
48. Rejected once on higher plain,
49. O Love supreme, to come again
50. Can this be thine?
51. Again to come, and win us too
52. In likeness of a weed
53. That as a god didst vainly woo,
54. As man more vainly bleed?

55. VI
56. Forbear, my soul! and in thine Eastern
57. chamber
58. Rehearse the dream that brings the long
59. release:
60. Through jasmine sweet and talismanic amber
61. Inhaling Herba Santa in the passive Pipe
62. of Peace.
