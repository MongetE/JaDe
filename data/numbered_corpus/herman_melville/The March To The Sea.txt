1. Not Kenesaw high-arching,
2. Nor Allatoona's glen--
3. Though there the graves lie parching--
4. Stayed Sherman's miles of men;
5. From charred Atlanta marching
6. They launched the sword again.
7. The columns streamed like rivers
8. Which in their course agree,
9. And they streamed until their flashing
10. Met the flashing of the sea:
11. It was glorious glad marching,
12. That marching to the sea.
13. The brushed the foe before them
14. (Shall gnats impede the bull?);
15. Their own good bridges bore them
16. Over swamps or torrents full,
17. And the grand pines waving o'er them
18. Bowed to axes keen and cool.
19. The columns grooved their channels.
20. Enforced their own decree,
21. And their power met nothing larger
22. Until it met the sea:
23. It was glorious glad marching,
24. A marching glad and free.

25. Kilpatrick's snare of riders
26. In zigzags mazed the land,
27. Perplexed the pale Southsiders
28. With feints on every hand;
29. Vague menace awed the hiders
30. In forts beyond command.
31. To Sherman's shifting problem
32. No foeman knew the key;
33. But onward went the marching
34. Unpausing to the sea:
35. It was glorious glad marching,
36. The swinging step was free.

37. The flankers ranged like pigeons
38. In clouds through field or wood;
39. The flocks of all those regions,
40. The herds and horses good,
41. Poured in and swelled the legions,
42. For they caught the marching mood.
43. A volley ahead! They hear it;
44. And they hear the repartee:
45. Fighting was but frolic
46. In that marching to the sea:
47. It was glorious glad marching,
48. A marching bold and free.

49. All nature felt their coming,
50. The birds like couriers flew,
51. And the banners brightly blooming
52. The slaves by thousands drew,
53. And they marched beside the drumming,
54. And they joined the armies blue.
55. The cocks crowed from the cannon
56. (Pets named from Grant and Lee),
57. Plumed fighters and campaigners
58. In the marching to the sea:
59. It was glorious glad marching,
60. For every man was free.

61. The foragers through calm lands
62. Swept in tempest gay,
63. And they breathed the air of balm-lands
64. Where rolled savannas lay,
65. And they helped themselves from farm-lands--
66. As who should say them nay?
67. The regiments uproarious
68. Laughed in Plenty's glee;
69. And they marched till their broad laughter
70. Met the laughter of the sea:
71. It was glorious glad marching,
72. That marching to the sea.

73. The grain of endless acres
74. Was threshed (as in the East)
75. By the trampling of the Takers,
76. Strong march of man and beast;
77. The flails of those earth-shakers
78. Left a famine where they ceased.
79. The arsenals were yielded;
80. The sword (that was to be),
81. Arrested in the forging,
82. Rued that marching to the sea:
83. It was glorious glad marching,
84. But ah, the stern decree!

85. For behind they left a wailing,
86. A terror and a ban,
87. And blazing cinders sailing,
88. And houseless households wan,
89. Wide zones of counties paling,
90. And towns where maniacs ran.
91. Was it Treason's retribution--
92. Necessity the plea?
93. They will long remember Sherman
94. And his streaming columns free--
95. They will long remember Sherman
96. Marching to the sea.

97. (December, 1864.)
