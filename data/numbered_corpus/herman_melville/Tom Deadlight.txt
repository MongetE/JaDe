1. Farewell and adieu to you noble hearties,--
2. Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain,
3. For I've received orders for to sail for the
4. Deadman,
5. But hope with the grand fleet to see you
6. again.

7. I have hove my ship to, with main-top-sail
8. aback, boys;
9. I have hove my ship to, for the strike
10. soundings clear--
11. The black scud a'flying; but, by God's blessing,
12. dam' me,
13. Right up the Channel for the Deadman I'll
14. steer.

15. I have worried through the waters that are
16. called the Doldrums,
17. And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye
18. grope--
19. Blast my eyes, but the light-ship is hid by the
20. mist, lads:--
21. _Flying Dutchman_--odds bobbs--off the
22. Cape of Good Hope!

23. But what's this I feel that is fanning my cheek,
24. Matt?
25. The white goney's wing?--how she rolls!--
26. 't is the Cape!--
27. Give my kit to the mess, Jock, for kin none is
28. mine, none;
29. And tell _Holy Joe_ to avast with the crape.

30. Dead reckoning, says _Joe_, it won't do to go by;
31. But they doused all the glims, Matt, in sky
32. t' other night.
33. Dead reckoning is good for to sail for the
34. Deadman;
35. And Tom Deadlight he thinks it may reckon
36. near right.

37. The signal!--it streams for the grand fleet to
38. anchor.
39. The captains--the trumpets--the hullabaloo!
40. Stand by for blue-blazes, and mind your
41. shank-painters,
42. For the Lord High Admiral, he's squinting
43. at you!

44. But give me my _tot_, Matt, before I roll over;
45. Jock, let's have your flipper, it's good for to
46. feel;
47. And don't sew me up without _baccy_ in mouth,
48. boys,
49. And don't blubber like lubbers when I turn
50. up my keel.
