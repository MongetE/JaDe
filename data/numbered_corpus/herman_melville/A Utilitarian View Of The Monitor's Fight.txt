1. Plain be the phrase, yet apt the verse,
2. More ponderous than nimble;
3. For since grimed War here laid aside
4. His painted pomp, 'twould ill befit
5. Overmuch to ply
6. The rhyme's barbaric symbol.

7. Hail to victory without the gaud
8. Of glory; zeal that needs no fans
9. Of banners; plain mechanic power
10. Plied cogently in War now placed -
11. Where War belongs -
12. Among the trades and artisans.

13. Yet this was battle, and intense -
14. Beyond the strife of fleets heroic;
15. Deadlier, closer, calm 'mid storm;
16. No passion; all went on by crank.
17. Pivot, and screw,
18. And calculations of caloric.

19. Needless to dwell; the story's known.
20. The ringing of those plates on plates
21. Still ringeth round the world -
22. The clangor of the blacksmiths' fray.
23. The anvil-din
24. Resounds this message from the Fates:

25. War shall yet be, and to the end;
26. But war-paint shows the streaks of weather;
27. War yet shall be, but the warriors
28. Are now but operatives; War's made
29. Less grand than Peace,
30. And a singe runs through lace and feather.
