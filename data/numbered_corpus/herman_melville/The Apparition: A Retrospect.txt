1. Convulsions came; and, where the field
2. Long slept in pastoral green,
3. A goblin-mountain was upheaved
4. (Sure the scared sense was all deceived),
5. Marl-glen and slag-ravine.

6. The unreserve of Ill was there,
7. The clinkers in her last retreat;
8. But, ere the eye could take it in,
9. Or mind could comprehension win,
10. It sunk! - and at our feet.

11. So, then, Solidity's a crust -
12. The core of fire below;
13. All may go well for many a year,
14. But who can think without a fear
15. Of horrors that happen so?
