1. We rovers bold,
2. To the land of Gold,
3. Over the bowling billows are gliding:
4. Eager to toil,
5. For the golden spoil,
6. And every hardship biding.
7. See! See!
8. Before our prows' resistless dashes
9. The gold-fish fly in golden flashes!
10. 'Neath a sun of gold,
11. We rovers bold,
12. On the golden land are gaining;
13. And every night,
14. We steer aright,
15. By golden stars unwaning!
16. All fires burn a golden glare:
17. No locks so bright as golden hair!
18. All orange groves have golden gushings;
19. All mornings dawn with golden flushings!
20. In a shower of gold, say fables old,
21. A maiden was won by the god of gold!
22. In golden goblets wine is beaming:
23. On golden couches kings are dreaming!
24. The Golden Rule dries many tears!
25. The Golden Number rules the spheres!
26. Gold, gold it is, that sways the nations:
27. Gold! gold! the center of all rotations!
28. On golden axles worlds are turning:
29. With phosphorescence seas are burning!
30. All fire-flies flame with golden gleamings!
31. Gold-hunters' hearts with golden dreamings!
32. With golden arrows kings are slain:
33. With gold we'll buy a freeman's name!
34. In toilsome trades, for scanty earnings,
35. At home we've slaved, with stifled yearnings:
36. No light! no hope! Oh, heavy woe!
37. When nights fled fast, and days dragged slow.
38. But joyful now, with eager eye,
39. Fast to the Promised Land we fly:
40. Where in deep mines,
41. The treasure shines;
42. Or down in beds of golden streams,
43. The gold-flakes glance in golden gleams!
44. How we long to sift,
45. That yellow drift!
46. Rivers! Rivers! cease your goings!
47. Sand-bars! rise, and stay the tide!
48. 'Till we've gained the golden flowing;
49. And in the golden haven ride!
