1. (October, 1864)

2. Shoe the steed with silver
3. That bore him to the fray,
4. When he heard the guns at dawning-
5. Miles away;
6. When he heard them calling, calling-
7. Mount! nor stay:
8. Quick, or all is lost;
9. They've surprised and stormed the post.
10. They push your routed host-
11. Gallop! retrieve the day.

12. House the horse in ermine-
13. For the foam-flake blew
14. White through red October;
15. He thundered into view;
16. They cheered him in the looming,
17. Horseman and horse they knew.
18. The turn of the tide began,
19. The rally of bugles ran,
20. He swung his hat in the van;
21. The electric hoof-spark flew.

22. Wreathe the steed and lead him-
23. For the charge he led
24. Touched and turned the cypress
25. Into amaranths for the head
26. Of Philip, king of riders,
27. Who raised them from the dead
28. The camp (at dawning lost),
29. By eve, recovered-forced,
30. Rang with the laughter of the host
31. At belated Early fled.

32. Shroud the horse in sable-
33. For the mounds they heap!
34. There is firing in the Valley,
35. And yet no strife they keep;
36. It is the parting volley,
37. It is the pathos deep.
38. There is glory for the brave
39. Who lead, and nobly save,
40. But no knowledge in the grave
41. Where the nameless followers sleep.
