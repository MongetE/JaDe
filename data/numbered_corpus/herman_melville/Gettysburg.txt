1. O Pride of the days in prime of the months
2. Now trebled in great renown,
3. When before the ark of our holy cause
4. Fell Dagon down-
5. Dagon foredoomed, who, armed and targed,
6. Never his impious heart enlarged
7. Beyond that hour; God walled his power,
8. And there the last invader charged.

9. He charged, and in that charge condensed
10. His all of hate and all of fire;
11. He sought to blast us in his scorn,
12. And wither us in his ire.
13. Before him went the shriek of shells-
14. Aerial screamings, taunts and yells;
15. Then the three waves in flashed advance
16. Surged, but were met, and back they set:
17. Pride was repelled by sterner pride,
18. And Right is a strong-hold yet.

19. Before our lines it seemed a beach
20. Which wild September gales have strown
21. With havoc on wreck, and dashed therewith
22. Pale crews unknown-
23. Men, arms, and steeds. The evening sun
24. Died on the face of each lifeless one,
25. And died along the winding marge of fight
26. And searching-parties lone.

27. Sloped on the hill the mounds were green,
28. Our centre held that place of graves,
29. And some still hold it in their swoon,
30. And over these a glory waves.
31. The warrior-monument, crashed in fight,
32. Shall soar transfigured in loftier light,
33. A meaning ampler bear;
34. Soldier and priest with hymn and prayer
35. Have laid the stone, and every bone
36. Shall rest in honor there.
