1. _If Luther's day expand to Darwin's year,_
2. _Shall that exclude the hope--foreclose the fear?_

3. Unmoved by all the claims our times avow,
4. The ancient Sphinx still keeps the porch of
5. shade;
6. And comes Despair, whom not her calm may
7. cow,
8. And coldly on that adamantine brow
9. Scrawls undeterred his bitter pasquinade.
10. But Faith (who from the scrawl indignant
11. turns)
12. With blood warm oozing from her wounded
13. trust,
14. Inscribes even on her shards of broken urns
15. The sign o' the cross--_the spirit above the dust!_

16. Yea, ape and angel, strife and old debate--
17. The harps of heaven and dreary gongs of hell;
18. Science the feud can only aggravate--
19. No umpire she betwixt the chimes and knell:
20. The running battle of the star and clod
21. Shall run forever--if there be no God.

22. Degrees we know, unknown in days before;
23. The light is greater, hence the shadow more;
24. And tantalized and apprehensive Man
25. Appealing--Wherefore ripen us to pain?
26. Seems there the spokesman of dumb Nature's
27. train.

28. But through such strange illusions have they
29. passed
30. Who in life's pilgrimage have baffled striven--
31. Even death may prove unreal at the last,
32. And stoics be astounded into heaven.

33. Then keep thy heart, though yet but
34. ill-resigned--
35. Clarel, thy heart, the issues there but mind;
36. That like the crocus budding through the
37. snow--
38. That like a swimmer rising from the deep--
39. That like a burning secret which doth go
40. Even from the bosom that would hoard and
41. keep;
42. Emerge thou mayst from the last whelming
43. sea,
44. And prove that death but routs life into victory.
