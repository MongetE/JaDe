1. Far off in the sea is Marlena,
2. A land of shades and streams,
3. A land of many delights,
4. Dark and bold, thy shores, Marlena;
5. But green, and timorous, thy soft knolls,
6. Crouching behind the woodlands.
7. All shady thy hills; all gleaming thy springs,
8. Like eyes in the earth looking at you.
9. How charming thy haunts, Marlena!--
10. Oh, the waters that flow through Onimoo;
11. Oh, the leaves that rustle through Ponoo:
12. Oh, the roses that blossom in Tarma.
13. Come, and see the valley of Vina:
14. How sweet, how sweet, the Isles from Hina:
15. 'Tis aye afternoon of the full, full moon,
16. And ever the season of fruit,
17. And ever the hour of flowers,
18. And never the time of rains and gales,
19. All in and about Marlena.
20. Soft sigh the boughs in the stilly air,
21. Soft lap the beach the billows there;
22. And in the woods or by the streams,
23. You needs must nod in the Land of Dreams.
