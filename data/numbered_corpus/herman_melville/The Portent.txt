1. Hanging from the beam,
2. Slowly swaying (such the law),
3. Gaunt the shadow on the green,
4. Shenandoah!
5. The cut is on the crown
6. (Lo, John Brown),
7. And the stabs shall heal no more.

8. Hidden in the cap
9. Is the anguish none can draw;
10. So your future veils its face,
11. Shenandoah!
12. But the streaming beard is shown
13. (Weird John Brown),
14. The meteor of the war.
