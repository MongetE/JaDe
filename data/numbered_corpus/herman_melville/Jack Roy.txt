1. Kept up by relays of generations young
2. Never dies at halyards the blithe chorus sung;
3. While in sands, sounds, and seas where the
4. storm-petrels cry,
5. Dropped mute around the globe, these halyard
6. singers lie.
7. Short-lived the clippers for racing-cups that
8. run,
9. And speeds in life's career many a lavish
10. mother's-son.

11. But thou, manly king o' the old _Splendid's_
12. crew,
13. The ribbons o' thy hat still a-fluttering, should
14. fly--
15. A challenge, and forever, nor the bravery
16. should rue.
17. Only in a tussle for the starry flag high,
18. When 'tis piety to do, and privilege to die.
19. Then, only then, would heaven think to lop
20. Such a cedar as the captain o' the _Splendid's_
21. main-top:
22. A belted sea-gentleman; a gallant, off-hand
23. Mercutio indifferent in life's gay command.
24. Magnanimous in humor; when the splintering
25. shot fell,
26. 'Tooth-picks a-plenty, lads; thank 'em with a
27. shell!'

28. Sang Larry o' the _Cannakin,_ smuggler o' the
29. wine,
30. At mess between guns, lad in jovial recline:
31. 'In Limbo our Jack he would chirrup up a
32. cheer,
33. The martinet there find a chaffing mutineer;
34. From a thousand fathoms down under hatches
35. o' your Hades,
36. He'd ascend in love-ditty, kissing fingers to
37. your ladies!'

38. Never relishing the knave, though allowing
39. for the menial,
40. Nor overmuch the king, Jack, nor prodigally
41. genial.
42. Ashore on liberty he flashed in escapade,
43. Vaulting over life in its levelness of grade,
44. Like the dolphin off Africa in rainbow
45. a-sweeping--
46. Arch iridescent shot from seas languid
47. sleeping.

48. Larking with thy life, if a joy but a toy,
49. Heroic in thy levity wert thou, Jack Roy.
