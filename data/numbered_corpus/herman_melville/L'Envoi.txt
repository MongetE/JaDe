1. _The Return of the Sire de Nesle._
2. A.D.

3. My towers at last! These rovings end,
4. Their thirst is slaked in larger dearth:
5. The yearning infinite recoils,
6. For terrible is earth.

7. Kaf thrusts his snouted crags through fog:
8. Araxes swells beyond his span,
9. And knowledge poured by pilgrimage
10. Overflows the banks of man.

11. But thou, my stay, thy lasting love
12. One lonely good, let this but be!
13. Weary to view the wide world's swarm,
14. But blest to fold but thee.
