1. To have known him, to have loved him
2. After loneness long;
3. And then to be estranged in life,
4. And neither in the wrong;
5. And now for death to set his seal--
6. Ease me, a little ease, my song!

7. By wintry hills his hermit-mound
8. The sheeted snow-drifts drape,
9. And houseless there the snow-bird flits
10. Beneath the fir-trees' crape:
11. Glazed now with ice the cloistral vine
12. That hid the shyest grape.
