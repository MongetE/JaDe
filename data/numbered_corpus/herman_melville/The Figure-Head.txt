1. The _Charles-and-Emma_ seaward sped,
2. (Named from the carven pair at prow,)
3. He so smart, and a curly head,
4. She tricked forth as a bride knows how:
5. Pretty stem for the port, I trow!

6. But iron-rust and alum-spray
7. And chafing gear, and sun and dew
8. Vexed this lad and lassie gay,
9. Tears in their eyes, salt tears nor few;
10. And the hug relaxed with the failing glue.

11. But came in end a dismal night,
12. With creaking beams and ribs that groan,
13. A black lee-shore and waters white:
14. Dropped on the reef, the pair lie prone:
15. O, the breakers dance, but the winds they
16. moan!
