1. With banners furled and clarions mute,
2. An army passes in the night;
3. And beaming spears and helms salute
4. The dark with bright.

5. In silence deep the legions stream,
6. With open ranks, in order true;
7. Over boundless plains they stream and
8. gleam--
9. No chief in view!

10. Afar, in twinkling distance lost,
11. (So legends tell) he lonely wends
12. And back through all that shining host
13. His mandate sends.
