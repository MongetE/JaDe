1. Hail! voyagers, hail!
2. Whence e'er ye come, where'er ye rove,
3. No calmer strand,
4. No sweeter land,
5. Will e'er ye view, than the Land of Love!

6. Hail! voyagers, hail!
7. To these, our shores, soft gales invite:
8. The palm plumes wave,
9. The billows lave,
10. And hither point fix'd stars of light!

11. Hail! voyagers, hail!
12. Think not our groves wide brood with gloom;
13. In this, our isle,
14. Bright flowers smile:
15. Full urns, rose-heaped, these valleys bloom.

16. Hail! voyagers, hail!
17. Be not deceived; renounce vain things;
18. Ye may not find
19. A tranquil mind,
20. Though hence ye sail with swiftest wings.

21. Hail! voyagers, hail!
22. Time flies full fast; life soon is o'er;
23. And ye may mourn,
24. That hither borne,
25. Ye left behind our pleasant shore.
