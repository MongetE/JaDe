1. Dip, dip, in the brine our paddles dip,
2. Dip, dip, the fins of our swimming ship!
3. How the waters part,
4. As on we dart;
5. Our sharp prows fly,
6. And curl on high,
7. As the upright fin of the rushing shark,
8. Rushing fast and far on his flying mark!
9. Like him we prey;
10. Like him we slay;
11. Swim on the foe,
12. Our prow a blow!
