1. The ribs and terrors in the whale,
2. Arched over me a dismal gloom,
3. While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
4. And left me deepening down to doom.

5. I saw the opening maw of hell,
6. With endless pains and sorrows there;
7. Which none but they that feel can tell—
8. Oh, I was plunging to despair.

9. In black distress, I called my God,
10. When I could scarce believe him mine,
11. He bowed his ear to my complaints—
12. No more the whale did me confine.

13. With speed he flew to my relief,
14. As on a radiant dolphin borne;
15. Awful, yet bright, as lightening shone
16. The face of my Deliverer God.

17. My song for ever shall record
18. That terrible, that joyful hour;
19. I give the glory to my God,
20. His all the mercy and the power.
