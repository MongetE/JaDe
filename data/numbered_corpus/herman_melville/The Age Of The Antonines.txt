1. While faith forecasts millennial years
2. Spite Europe's embattled lines,
3. Back to the Past one glance be cast--
4. The Age of the Antonines!
5. O summit of fate, O zenith of time
6. When a pagan gentleman reigned,
7. And the olive was nailed to the inn of the
8. world
9. Nor the peace of the just was feigned.
10. A halcyon Age, afar it shines,
11. Solstice of Man and the Antonines.

12. Hymns to the nations' friendly gods
13. Went up from the fellowly shrines,
14. No demagogue beat the pulpit-drum
15. In the Age of the Antonines!
16. The sting was not dreamed to be taken from
17. death,
18. No Paradise pledged or sought,
19. But they reasoned of fate at the flowing feast,
20. Nor stifled the fluent thought,
21. We sham, we shuffle while faith declines--
22. They were frank in the Age of the Antonines.

23. Orders and ranks they kept degree,
24. Few felt how the parvenu pines,
25. No law-maker took the lawless one's fee
26. In the Age of the Antonines!
27. Under law made will the world reposed
28. And the ruler's right confessed,
29. For the heavens elected the Emperor then,
30. The foremost of men the best.
31. Ah, might we read in America's signs
32. The Age restored of the Antonines.
