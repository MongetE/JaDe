1. I
2. Though the Clerk of the Weather insist,
3. And lay down the weather-law,
4. Pintado and gannet they wist
5. That the winds blow whither they list
6. In tempest or flaw.

7. II
8. Old are the creeds, but stale the schools,
9. Revamped as the mode may veer,
10. But Orm from the schools to the beaches
11. strays
12. And, finding a Conch hoar with time, he
13. delays
14. And reverent lifts it to ear.
15. That Voice, pitched in far monotone,
16. Shall it swerve? shall it deviate ever?
17. The Seas have inspired it, and Truth--
18. Truth, varying from sameness never.

19. III
20. In hollows of the liquid hills
21. Where the long Blue Ridges run,
22. The flattery of no echo thrills,
23. For echo the seas have none;
24. Nor aught that gives man back man's strain--
25. The hope of his heart, the dream in his brain.

26. IV
27. On ocean where the embattled fleets repair,
28. Man, suffering inflictor, sails on sufferance
29. there.

30. V
31. Implacable I, the old Implacable Sea:
32. Implacable most when most I smile serene--
33. Pleased, not appeased, by myriad wrecks in
34. me.

35. VI
36. Curled in the comb of yon billow Andean,
37. Is it the Dragon's heaven-challenging crest?
38. Elemental mad ramping of ravening waters--
39. Yet Christ on the Mount, and the dove in
40. her nest!

41. VII
42. Healed of my hurt, I laud the inhuman Sea--
43. Yea, bless the Angels Four that there convene;
44. For healed I am ever by their pitiless breath
45. Distilled in wholesome dew named rosmarine.
