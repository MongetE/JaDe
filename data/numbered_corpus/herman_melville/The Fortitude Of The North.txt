1. _Under the Disaster of the Second Manassas_

2. They take no shame for dark defeat
3. While prizing yet each victory won,
4. Who fight for the Right through all retreat,
5. Nor pause until their work is done.
6. The Cape-of-Storms is proof to every throe;
7. Vainly against that foreland beat
8. Wild winds aloft and wilder waves below:
9. The black cliffs gleam through rents in sleet
10. When the livid Antarctic storm-clouds glow.
