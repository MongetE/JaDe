1. Arms reversed and banners creped -
2. Muffled drums;
3. Snowy horses sable-draped -
4. McPherson comes.

5. But, tell us, shall we know him more,
6. Lost-Mountain and lone Kenesaw?

7. Brave the sword upon the pall -
8. A gleam in gloom;
9. So a bright name lighteth all
10. McPherson's doom.

11. Bear him through the chapel-door -
12. Let priest in stole
13. Pace before the warrior
14. Who led. Bell -toll!

15. Lay him down within the nave,
16. The lesson read -
17. Man is noble, man is brave,
18. But man's - a weed.

19. Take him up again and wend
20. Graveward, nor weep:
21. There's a trumpet that shall rend
22. This Soldier's sleep.

23. Pass the ropes the coffin round,
24. And let descend;
25. Prayer and volley - let it sound
26. McPherson's end.

27. True fame is his, for life is o'er -
28. Sarpedon of the mighty war.
