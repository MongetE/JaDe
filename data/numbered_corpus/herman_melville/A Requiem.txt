1. _For Soldiers lost in Ocean Transports_

2. When, after storms that woodlands rue,
3. To valleys comes atoning dawn,
4. The robins blithe their orchard-sports renew;
5. And meadow-larks, no more withdrawn
6. Caroling fly in the languid blue;
7. The while, from many a hid recess,
8. Alert to partake the blessedness,
9. The pouring mites their airy dance pursue.
10. So, after ocean's ghastly gales,
11. When laughing light of hoyden morning
12. breaks,
13. Every finny hider wakes--
14. From vaults profound swims up with
15. glittering scales;
16. Through the delightsome sea he sails,
17. With shoals of shining tiny things
18. Frolic on every wave that flings
19. Against the prow its showery spray;
20. All creatures joying in the morn,
21. Save them forever from joyance torn,
22. Whose bark was lost where now the
23. dolphins play;
24. Save them that by the fabled shore,
25. Down the pale stream are washed away,
26. Far to the reef of bones are borne;
27. And never revisits them the light,
28. Nor sight of long-sought land and pilot more;
29. Nor heed they now the lone bird's flight
30. Round the lone spar where mid-sea surges
31. pour.
