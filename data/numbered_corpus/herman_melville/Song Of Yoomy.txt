1. Departed the pride, and the glory of Mardi:
2. The vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea,
3. That rolls o'er his corse with a hush,
4. His warriors bend over their spears,
5. His sisters gaze upward and mourn.
6. Weep, weep, for Adondo is dead!
7. The sun has gone down in a shower;
8. Buried in clouds the face of the moon;
9. Tears stand in the eyes of the starry skies,
10. And stand in the eyes of the flowers;
11. And streams of tears are the trickling brooks,
12. Coursing adown the mountains.--
13. Departed the pride, and the glory of Mardi:
14. The vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea.
15. Fast falls the small rain on its bosom that
16. sobs,--
17. Not showers of rain, but the tears of Oro.
