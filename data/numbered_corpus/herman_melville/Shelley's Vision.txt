1. Wandering late by morning seas
2. When my heart with pain was low--
3. Hate the censor pelted me--
4. Deject I saw my shadow go.

5. In elf-caprice of bitter tone
6. I too would pelt the pelted one:
7. At my shadow I cast a stone.

8. When lo, upon that sun-lit ground
9. I saw the quivering phantom take
10. The likeness of St. Stephen crowned:
11. Then did self-reverence awake.
