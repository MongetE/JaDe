1. Lonesome on earth's loneliest deep,
2. Sailor! who dost thy vigil keep--
3. Off the Cape of Storms dost musing sweep
4. Over monstrous waves that curl and comb;
5. Of thee we think when here from brink
6. We blow the mead in bubbling foam.

7. Of thee we think, in a ring we link;
8. To the shearer of ocean's fleece we drink,
9. And the _Meteor_ rolling home.
