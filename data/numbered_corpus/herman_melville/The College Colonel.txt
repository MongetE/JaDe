1. He rides at their head;
2. A crutch by his saddle just slants in view,
3. One slung arm in splints, you see,
4. Yet he guides his strong steed - how coldly too.

5. He brings his regiment home -
6. Not as they filed two years before,
7. But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, and worn,
8. Like castaway sailors, who - stunned
9. By the surf's loud roar,
10. Their mates dragged back and seen no more -
11. Again and again breast the surge,
12. And at last crawl, spent, to shore.

13. A still rigidity and pale -
14. An Indian aloofness lines his brow;
15. He has lived a thousand years
16. Compressed in battle's pains and prayers,
17. Marches and watches slow.

18. There are welcoming shots, and flags;
19. Old men off hat to the Boy,
20. Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet,
21. But to him - there comes alloy.

22. It is not that a leg is lost,
23. It is not that an arm is maimed,
24. It is not that the fever has racked -
25. Self he has long since disclaimed.

26. But all through the Seven Days' Fight,
27. And deep in the Wilderness grim,
28. And in the field-hospital tent,
29. And Petersburg crater, and dim
30. Lean brooding in Libby, there came -
31. Ah heaven! - what truth to him.
