1. 1860-1

2. The Ancient of Days forever is young,
3. Forever the scheme of Nature thrives;
4. I know a wind in purpose strong--
5. It spins _against_ the way it drives.
6. What if the gulfs their slimed foundations
7. bare?
8. So deep must the stones be hurled
9. Whereon the throes of ages rear
10. The final empire and the happier world.

11. Power unanointed may come--
12. Dominion (unsought by the free)
13. And the Iron Dome,
14. Stronger for stress and strain,
15. Fling her huge shadow athwart the main;
16. But the Founders' dream shall flee.
17. Age after age has been,
18. (From man's changeless heart their way they
19. win);
20. And death be busy with all who strive--
21. Death, with silent negative.

22. _Yea and Nay--_
23. _Each hath his say;_
24. _But God He keeps the middle way._
25. _None was by_
26. _When He spread the sky;_
27. _Wisdom is vain, and prophecy._
