1. Happy are they and charmed in life
2. Who through long wars arrive unscarred
3. At peace. To such the wreath be given,
4. If they unfalteringly have striven -
5. In honor, as in limb, unmarred.
6. Let cheerful praise be rife,
7. And let them live their years at ease,
8. Musing on brothers who victorious died -
9. Loved mates whose memory shall ever please.

10. And yet mischance is honorable too -
11. Seeming defeat in conflict justified
12. Whose end to closing eyes is hid from view.
13. The will, that never can relent -
14. The aim, survivor of the bafflement,
15. Make this memorial due.
