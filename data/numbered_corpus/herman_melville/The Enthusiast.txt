1. "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him"

2. Shall hearts that beat no base retreat
3. In youth's magnanimous years -
4. Ignoble hold it, if discreet
5. When interest tames to fears;
6. Shall spirits that worship light
7. Perfidious deem its sacred glow,
8. Recant, and trudge where worldlings go,
9. Conform and own them right?

10. Shall Time with creeping influence cold
11. Unnerve and cow? The heart
12. Pine for the heartless ones enrolled
13. With palterers of the mart?
14. Shall faith abjure her skies,
15. Or pale probation blench her down
16. To shrink from Truth so still, so lone
17. Mid loud gregarious lies?

18. Each burning boat in Caesar's rear,
19. Flames -No return through me!
20. So put the torch to ties though dear,
21. If ties but tempters be.
22. Nor cringe if come the night:
23. Walk through the cloud to meet the pall,
24. Though light forsake thee, never fall
25. From fealty to light.
