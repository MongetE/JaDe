1. Though fast youth's glorious fable flies,
2. View not the world with worldling's eyes;
3. Nor turn with weather of the time.
4. Foreclose the coming of surprise:
5. Stand where Posterity shall stand;
6. Stand where the Ancients stood before,
7. And, dipping in lone founts thy hand,
8. Drink of the never-varying lore:
9. Wise once, and wise thence evermore.
