1. One that I cherished,
2. Yea, loved as a son -
3. Up early, up late with,
4. My promising one:
5. No use in good nurture,
6. None, lads, none!

7. Here on this settle
8. He wore the true crown,
9. King of good fellows,
10. And Fat Jack was one -
11. Now, Beadle of England
12. In formal array -
13. Best fellow alive
14. On a throne flung away!

15. Companions and cronies
16. Keep fast and lament; -
17. Come, drawer, more sack here
18. To drown discontent;
19. For now intuitions
20. Shall wither to codes,
21. Pragmatized morals
22. Shall libel the gods.

23. One I instructed,
24. Yea, talked to -alone:
25. Precept -example
26. Clean away thrown!

27. Sorrow makes thirsty:
28. Sack, drawer, more sack! -
29. One that I prayed for,
30. I, Honest Jack!

31. To bring down these grey hairs -
32. To cut his old pal!
33. But, I'll be magnanimous -
34. Here's to thee Hal!
