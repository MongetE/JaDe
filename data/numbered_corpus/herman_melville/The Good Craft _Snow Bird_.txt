1. Strenuous need that head-wind be
2. From purposed voyage that drives at last
3. The ship, sharp-braced and dogged still,
4. Beating up against the blast.

5. Brigs that figs for market gather,
6. Homeward-bound upon the stretch,
7. Encounter oft this uglier weather
8. Yet in end their port they fetch.

9. Mark yon craft from sunny Smyrna
10. Glazed with ice in Boston Bay;
11. Out they toss the fig-drums cheerly,
12. Livelier for the frosty ray.

13. What if sleet off-shore assailed her,
14. What though ice yet plate her yards;
15. In wintry port not less she renders
16. Summer's gift with warm regards!

17. And, look, the underwriters' man,
18. Timely, when the stevedore's done,
19. Puts on his _specs_ to pry and scan,
20. And sets her down--_A, No. 1._

21. Bravo, master! Bravo, brig!
22. For slanting snows out of the West
23. Never the _Snow-Bird_ cares one fig;
24. And foul winds steady her, though a pest.
