1. From 'The Saya-y-Manto.'


2. While now the Pole Star sinks from sight
3. The Southern Cross it climbs the sky;
4. But losing thee, my love, my light,
5. O bride but for one bridal night,
6. The loss no rising joys supply.

7. Love, love, the Trade Winds urge abaft,
8. And thee, from thee, they steadfast waft.

9. By day the blue and silver sea
10. And chime of waters blandly fanned--
11. Nor these, nor Gama's stars to me
12. May yield delight since still for thee
13. I long as Gama longed for land.

14. I yearn, I yearn, reverting turn,
15. My heart it streams in wake astern
16. When, cut by slanting sleet, we swoop
17. Where raves the world's inverted year,
18. If roses all your porch shall loop,
19. Not less your heart for me will droop
20. Doubling the world's last outpost drear.

21. O love, O love, these oceans vast:
22. Love, love, it is as death were past!
