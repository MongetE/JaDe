1. When tempest winnowed grain from bran;
2. And men were looking for a man,
3. Authority called you to the van,
4. McClellan:
5. Along the line the plaudit ran,
6. As later when Antietam's cheers began.

7. Through storm-cloud and eclipse must move
8. Each Cause and Man, dear to the stars and Jove;
9. Nor always can the wisest tell
10. Deferred fulfillment from the hopeless knell-
11. The struggler from the floundering ne'er-do-well.
12. A pall-cloth on the Seven Days fell,
13. McClellan:
14. Unprosperously heroical!
15. Who could Antietam's wreath foretell?

16. Authority called you; then, in mist
17. And loom of jeopardy-dismissed.
18. But staring peril soon appalled;
19. You, the Discarded, she recalled-
20. Recalled you, nor endured delay;
21. And forth you rode upon a blasted way,
22. Arrayed Pope's rout, and routed Lee's array,
23. McClellan:
24. Your tent was choked with captured flags that day,
25. McClellan:
26. Antietam was a telling fray.

27. Recalled you; and she heard your drum
28. Advancing through the ghastly gloom.
29. You manned the wall, you propped the Dome,
30. You stormed the powerful stormer home.
31. McClellan:
32. Antietam's cannon long shall boom.

33. At Alexandria, left alone,
34. McClellan:
35. Your veterans sent from you, and thrown
36. To fields and fortunes all unknown-
37. What thoughts were yours, revealed to none,
38. While faithful still you labored on-
39. Hearing the far Manassas gun!
40. McClellan:
41. Only Antietam could atone.

42. You fought in the front (an evil day,
43. McClellan)-
44. The fore-front of the first assay;
45. The Cause went sounding, groped its way;
46. The leadsmen quarrelled in the bay;
47. Quills thwarted swords; divided sway;
48. The rebel flushed in his lusty May:
49. You did your best, as in you lay,
50. McClellan.
51. Antietam's sun-burst sheds a ray.

52. Your medalled soldiers love you well,
53. McClellan:
54. Name your name, their true hearts swell;
55. With you they shook dread Stonewall's spell,
56. With you they braved the blended yell
57. Of rebel and maligner fell;
58. With you in shame or fame they dwell,
59. McClellan:
60. Antietam-braves a brave can tell.

61. And when your comrades (now so few,
62. McClellan-
63. Such ravage in deep files they rue)
64. Meet round the board, and sadly view
65. The empty places; tribute due
66. They render to the dead-and you!
67. Absent and silent o'er the blue;
68. The one-armed lift the wine to you,
69. McClellan,
70. And great Antietam's cheers renew.
