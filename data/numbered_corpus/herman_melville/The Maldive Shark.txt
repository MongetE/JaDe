1. About the Shark, phlegmatical one,
2. Pale sot of the Maldive sea,
3. The sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim,
4. How alert in attendance be.
5. From his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel of maw,
6. They have nothing of harm to dread,
7. But liquidly glide on his ghastly flank
8. Or before his Gorgonian head;
9. Or lurk in the port of serrated teeth
10. In white triple tiers of glittering gates,
11. And there find a haven when peril's abroad,
12. An asylum in jaws of the Fates!
13. They are friends; and friendly they guide him to prey,
14. Yet never partake of the treat --
15. Eyes and brains to the dotard lethargic and dull,
16. Pale ravener of horrible meat.
