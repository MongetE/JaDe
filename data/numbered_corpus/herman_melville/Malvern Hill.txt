1. Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill
2. In prime of morn and May,
3. Recall ye how McClellan's men
4. Here stood at bay?
5. While deep within yon forest dim
6. Our rigid comrades lay -
7. Some with the cartridge in their mouth,
8. Others with fixed arms lifted South -
9. Invoking so
10. The cypress glades? Ah wilds of woe!

11. The spires of Richmond, late beheld
12. Through rifts in musket-haze,
13. Were closed from view in clouds of dust
14. On leaf-walled ways,
15. Where streamed our wagons in caravan;
16. And the Seven Nights and Days
17. Of march and fast, retreat and fight,
18. Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight -
19. Does the elm wood
20. Recall the haggard beards of blood?

21. The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed,
22. We followed (it never fell!) -
23. In silence husbanded our strength -
24. Received their yell;
25. Till on this slope we patient turned
26. With cannon ordered well;
27. Reverse we proved was not defeat;
28. But ah, the sod what thousands meet! -
29. Does Malvern Wood
30. Bethink itself, and muse and brood?

31. We elms of Malvern Hill
32. Remember every thing;
33. But sap the twig will fill:
34. Wag the world how it will,
35. Leaves must be green in Spring.
