1. Children of my happier prime,
2. When One yet lived with me, and threw
3. Her rainbow over life and time,
4. Even Hope, my bride, and mother to you!
5. O, nurtured in sweet pastoral air,
6. And fed on flowers and light and dew
7. Of morning meadows -spare, ah, spare
8. Reproach; spare, and upbraid me not
9. That, yielding scarce to reckless mood,
10. But jealous of your future lot,
11. I sealed you in a fate subdued.
12. Have I not saved you from the dread
13. Theft, and ignoring which need be
14. The triumph of the insincere
15. Unanimous Mediocrity?
16. Rest, therefore, free from all despite,
17. Snugged in the arms of comfortable night.
