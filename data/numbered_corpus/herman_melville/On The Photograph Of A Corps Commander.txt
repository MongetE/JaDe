1. Ay, man is manly. Here you see
2. The warrior-carriage of the head,
3. And brave dilation of the frame;
4. And lighting all, the soul that led
5. In Spottsylvania's charge to victory,
6. Which justifies his fame.

7. A cheering picture. It is good
8. To look upon a Chief like this,
9. In whom the spirit moulds the form.
10. Here favoring Nature, oft remiss,
11. With eagle mien expressive has endued
12. A man to kindle strains that warm.

13. Trace back his lineage, and his sires,
14. Yeoman or noble, you shall find
15. Enrolled with men of Agincourt,
16. Heroes who shared great Harry's mind.
17. Down to us come the knightly Norman fires,
18. And front the Templars bore.

19. Nothing can lift the heart of man
20. Like manhood in a fellow-man.
21. The thought of heaven's great King afar
22. But humbles us--too weak to scan;
23. But manly greatness men can span,
24. And feel the bonds that draw.
