1. Aloof they crown the foreland lone,
2. From aloft they loftier rise--
3. Fair columns, in the aureole rolled
4. From sunned Greek seas and skies.
5. They wax, sublimed to fancy's view,
6. A god-like group against the blue.

7. Over much like gods! Serene they saw
8. The wolf-waves board the deck,
9. And headlong hull of Falconer,
10. And many a deadlier wreck.
