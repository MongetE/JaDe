1. _From 'Rammon.'_

2. Through storms you reach them and from
3. storms are free.
4. Afar descried, the foremost drear in hue,
5. But, nearer, green; and, on the marge, the sea
6. Makes thunder low and mist of rainbowed
7. dew.

8. But, inland, where the sleep that folds the hills
9. A dreamier sleep, the trance of God, instills--
10. On uplands hazed, in wandering airs
11. aswoon,
12. Slow-swaying palms salute love's cypress tree
13. Adown in vale where pebbly runlets croon
14. A song to lull all sorrow and all glee.

15. Sweet-fern and moss in many a glade are here.
16. Where, strewn in flocks, what cheek-flushed
17. myriads lie
18. Dimpling in dream--unconscious slumberers
19. mere,
20. While billows endless round the beaches die.
