1. In placid hours well-pleased we dream
2. Of many a brave unbodied scheme.
3. But form to lend, pulsed life create,
4. What unlike things must meet and mate:
5. A flame to melt--a wind to freeze;
6. Sad patience--joyous energies;
7. Humility--yet pride and scorn;
8. Instinct and study; love and hate;
9. Audacity--reverence. These must mate,
10. And fuse with Jacob's mystic heart,
11. To wrestle with the angel--Art.
