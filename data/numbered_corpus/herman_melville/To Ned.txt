1. Where is the world we roved, Ned Bunn?
2. Hollows thereof lay rich in shade
3. By voyagers old inviolate thrown
4. Ere Paul Pry cruised with Pelf and Trade.
5. To us old lads some thoughts come home
6. Who roamed a world young lads no more shall
7. roam.

8. Nor less the satiate year impends
9. When, wearying of routine-resorts,
10. The pleasure-hunter shall break loose,
11. Ned, for our Pantheistic ports:--
12. Marquesas and glenned isles that be
13. Authentic Edens in a Pagan sea.

14. The charm of scenes untried shall lure,
15. And, Ned, a legend urge the flight--
16. The Typee-truants under stars
17. Unknown to Shakespere's _Midsummer-
18. Night;_
19. And man, if lost to Saturn's Age,
20. Yet feeling life no Syrian pilgrimage.

21. But, tell, shall he, the tourist, find
22. Our isles the same in violet-glow
23. Enamoring us what years and years--
24. Ah, Ned, what years and years ago!
25. Well, Adam advances, smart in pace,
26. But scarce by violets that advance you trace.

27. But we, in anchor-watches calm,
28. The Indian Psyche's languor won,
29. And, musing, breathed primeval balm
30. From Edens ere yet overrun;
31. Marvelling mild if mortal twice,
32. Here and hereafter, touch a Paradise.
