1. _Commemorative of the Dissolution of armies at the Peace_
2. May, 1

3. What power disbands the Northern Lights
4. After their steely play?
5. The lonely watcher feels an awe
6. Of Nature's sway,
7. As when appearing,
8. He marked their flashed uprearing
9. In the cold gloom--
10. Retreatings and advancings,
11. (Like dallyings of doom),
12. Transitions and enhancings,
13. And bloody ray.

14. The phantom-host has faded quite,
15. Splendor and Terror gone
16. Portent or promise--and gives way
17. To pale, meek Dawn;
18. The coming, going,
19. Alike in wonder showing--
20. Alike the God,
21. Decreeing and commanding
22. The million blades that glowed,
23. The muster and disbanding--
24. Midnight and Morn.
