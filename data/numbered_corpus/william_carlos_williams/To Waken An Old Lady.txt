1. Old age is
2. a flight of small
3. cheeping birds
4. skimming
5. bare trees
6. above a snow glaze.
7. Gaining and failing
8. they are buffeted
9. by a dark wind --
10. But what?
11. On harsh weedstalks
12. the flock has rested --
13. the snow
14. is covered with broken
15. seed husks
16. and the wind tempered
17. with a shrill
18. piping of plenty.
