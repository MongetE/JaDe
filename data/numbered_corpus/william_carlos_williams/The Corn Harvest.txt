1. Summer !
2. the painting is organized
3. about a young

4. reaper enjoying his
5. noonday rest
6. completely

7. relaxed
8. from his morning labors
9. sprawled

10. in fact sleeping
11. unbuttoned
12. on his back

13. the women
14. have brought him his lunch
15. perhaps

16. a spot of wine
17. they gather gossiping
18. under a tree

19. whose shade
20. carelessly
21. he does not share the

22. resting
23. center of
24. their workaday world.
