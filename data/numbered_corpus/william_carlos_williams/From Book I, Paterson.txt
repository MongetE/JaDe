1. Paterson lies in the valley under the Passaic Falls
2. its spent waters forming the outline of his back. He
3. lies on his right side, head near the thunder
4. of the waters filling his dreams! Eternally asleep,
5. his dreams walk about the city where he persists
6. incognito. Butterflies settle on his stone ear.
7. Immortal he neither moves nor rouses and is seldom
8. seen, though he breathes and the subtleties of his machinations
9. drawing their substance from the noise of the pouring river
10. animate a thousand automations. Who because they
11. neither know their sources nor the sills of their
12. disappointments walk outside their bodies aimlessly
13. for the most part,
14. locked and forgot in their desires-unroused.

15. —Say it, no ideas but in things—
16. nothing but the blank faces of the houses
17. and cylindrical trees
18. bent, forked by preconception and accident—
19. split, furrowed, creased, mottled, stained—
20. secret—into the body of the light!

21. From above, higher than the spires, higher
22. even than the office towers, from oozy fields
23. abandoned to gray beds of dead grass,
24. black sumac, withered weed-stalks,
25. mud and thickets cluttered with dead leaves-
26. the river comes pouring in above the city
27. and crashes from the edge of the gorge
28. in a recoil of spray and rainbow mists-

29. (What common language to unravel?
30. . . .combed into straight lines
31. from that rafter of a rock's
32. lip.)

33. A man like a city and a woman like a flower
34. —who are in love. Two women. Three women.
35. Innumerable women, each like a flower.

36. But
37. only one man—like a city.
