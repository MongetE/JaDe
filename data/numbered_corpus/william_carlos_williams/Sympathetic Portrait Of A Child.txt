1. The murderer's little daughter
2. who is barely ten years old
3. jerks her shoulders
4. right and left
5. so as to catch a glimpse of me
6. without turning round.
7. Her skinny little arms
8. wrap themselves
9. this way then that
10. reversely about her body!
11. Nervously
12. she crushes her straw hat
13. about her eyes
14. and tilts her head
15. to deepen the shadow—
16. smiling excitedly!

17. As best as she can
18. she hides herself
19. in the full sunlight
20. her cordy legs writhing
21. beneath the little flowered dress
22. that leaves them bare
23. from mid-thigh to ankle—

24. Why has she chosen me
25. for the knife
26. that darts along her smile?
