1. There were some dirty plates
2. and a glass of milk
3. beside her on a small table
4. near the rank, disheveled bed--

5. Wrinkled and nearly blind
6. she lay and snored
7. rousing with anger in her tones
8. to cry for food,

9. Gimme something to eat--
10. They're starving me--
11. I'm all right--I won't go
12. to the hospital.No, no, no

13. Give me something to eat!
14. Let me take you
15. to the hospital, I said
16. and after you are well

17. you can do as you please.
18. She smiled, Yes
19. you do what you please first
20. then I can do what I please--

21. Oh, oh, oh! she cried
22. as the ambulance men lifted
23. her to the stretcher--
24. Is this what you call

25. making me comfortable?
26. By now her mind was clear--
27. Oh you think you're smart
28. you young people,

29. she said, but I'll tell you
30. you don't know anything.
31. Then we started.
32. On the way

33. we passed a long row
34. of elms. She looked at them
35. awhile out of
36. the ambulance window and said,

37. What are all those
38. fuzzy looking things out there?
39. Trees?Well, I'm tired
40. of them and rolled her head away.
