1. Snow falls:
2. years of anger following
3. hours that float idly down --
4. the blizzard
5. drifts its weight
6. deeper and deeper for three days
7. or sixty years, eh? Then
8. the sun! a clutter of
9. yellow and blue flakes --
10. Hairy looking trees stand out
11. in long alleys
12. over a wild solitude.
13. The man turns and there --
14. his solitary track stretched out
15. upon the world.
