1. Not because of his eyes,
2. the eyes of a bird,
3. but because he is beaked,
4. birdlike, to do an injury,
5. has the turtle attracted you.
6. He is your only pet.
7. When we are together
8. you talk of nothing else
9. ascribing all sorts
10. of murderous motives
11. to his least action.
12. You ask me
13. to write a poem,
14. should I have a poem to write,
15. about a turtle.
16. The turtle lives in the mud
17. but is not mud-like,
18. you can tell it by his eyes
19. which are clear.
20. When he shall escape
21. his present confinement
22. he will stride about the world
23. destroying all
24. with his sharp beak.
25. Whatever opposes him
26. in the streets of the city
27. shall go down.
28. Cars will be overturned.
29. And upon his back
30. shall ride,
31. to his conquests,
32. my Lord,
33. you!
34. You shall be master!
35. In the beginning
36. there was a great tortoise
37. who supported the world.
38. Upon him
39. All ultimately
40. rests.
41. Without him
42. nothing will stand.
43. He is all wise
44. and can outrun the hare.
45. In the night
46. his eyes carry him
47. to unknown places.
48. He is your friend.
