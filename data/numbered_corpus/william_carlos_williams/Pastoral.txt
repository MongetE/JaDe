1. The little sparrows
2. hop ingenuously
3. about the pavement
4. quarreling
5. with sharp voices
6. over those things
7. that interest them.
8. But we who are wiser
9. shut ourselves in
10. on either hand
11. and no one knows
12. whether we think good
13. or evil.
14. Meanwhile,
15. the old man who goes about
16. gathering dog-lime
17. walks in the gutter
18. without looking up
19. and his tread
20. is more majestic than
21. that of the Episcopal minister
22. approaching the pulpit
23. of a Sunday.
24. These things
25. astonish me beyond words.
