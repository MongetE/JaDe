1. Light hearted William twirled
2. his November moustaches
3. and, half dressed, looked
4. from the bedroom window
5. upon the spring weather.

6. Heigh-ya! sighed he gaily
7. leaning out to see
8. up and down the street
9. where a heavy sunlight
10. lay beyond some blue shadows.

11. Into the room he drew
12. his head again and laughed
13. to himself quietly
14. twirling his green moustaches.
