1. The pure products of America
2. go crazy--
3. mountain folk from Kentucky

4. or the ribbed north end of
5. Jersey
6. with its isolate lakes and

7. valleys, its deaf-mutes, thieves
8. old names
9. and promiscuity between

10. devil-may-care men who have taken
11. to railroading
12. out of sheer lust of adventure--

13. and young slatterns, bathed
14. in filth
15. from Monday to Saturday

16. to be tricked out that night
17. with gauds
18. from imaginations which have no

19. peasant traditions to give them
20. character
21. but flutter and flaunt

22. sheer rags-succumbing without
23. emotion
24. save numbed terror

25. under some hedge of choke-cherry
26. or viburnum-
27. which they cannot express--

28. Unless it be that marriage
29. perhaps
30. with a dash of Indian blood

31. will throw up a girl so desolate
32. so hemmed round
33. with disease or murder

34. that she'll be rescued by an
35. agent--
36. reared by the state and

37. sent out at fifteen to work in
38. some hard-pressed
39. house in the suburbs--

40. some doctor's family, some Elsie--
41. voluptuous water
42. expressing with broken

43. brain the truth about us--
44. her great
45. ungainly hips and flopping breasts

46. addressed to cheap
47. jewelry
48. and rich young men with fine eyes

49. as if the earth under our feet
50. were
51. an excrement of some sky

52. and we degraded prisoners
53. destined
54. to hunger until we eat filth

55. while the imagination strains
56. after deer
57. going by fields of goldenrod in

58. the stifling heat of September
59. Somehow
60. it seems to destroy us

61. It is only in isolate flecks that
62. something
63. is given off

64. No one
65. to witness
66. and adjust, no one to drive the car
