1. From the Nativity
2. which I have already celebrated
3. the Babe in its Mother's arms

4. the Wise Men in their stolen
5. splendor
6. and Joseph and the soldiery

7. attendant
8. with their incredulous faces
9. make a scene copied we'll say

10. from the Italian masters
11. but with a difference
12. the mastery

13. of the painting
14. and the mind the resourceful mind
15. that governed the whole

16. the alert mind dissatisfied with
17. what it is asked to
18. and cannot do

19. accepted the story and painted
20. it in the brilliant
21. colors of the chronicler

22. the downcast eyes of the Virgin
23. as a work of art
24. for profound worship
