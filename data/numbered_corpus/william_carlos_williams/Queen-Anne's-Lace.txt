1. Her body is not so white as 
2. anemone petals nor so smooth—nor 
3. so remote a thing. It is a field 
4. of the wild carrot taking 
5. the field by force; the grass 
6. does not raise above it. 
7. Here is no question of whiteness, 
8. white as can be, with a purple mole 
9. at the center of each flower. 
10. Each flower is a hand's span 
11. of her whiteness. Wherever 
12. his hand has lain there is 
13. a tiny purple blossom under his touch 
14. to which the fibres of her being 
15. stem one by one, each to its end, 
16. until the whole field is a 
17. white desire, empty, a single stem, 
18. a cluster, flower by flower, 
19. a pious wish to whiteness gone over— 
20. or nothing.
