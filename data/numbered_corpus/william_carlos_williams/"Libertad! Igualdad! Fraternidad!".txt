1. You sullen pig of a man
2. you force me into the mud
3. with your stinking ash-cart!

4. Brother!
5. --if we were rich
6. we'd stick our chests out
7. and hold our heads high!

8. It is dreams that have destroyed us.

9. There is no more pride
10. in horses or in rein holding.
11. We sit hunched together brooding
12. our fate.

13. Well--
14. all things turn bitter in the end
15. whether you choose the right or
16. the left way
17. and--
18. dreams are not a bad thing.
