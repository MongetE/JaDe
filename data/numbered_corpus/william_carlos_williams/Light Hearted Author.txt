1. The birches are mad with green points 
2. the wood's edge is burning with their green, 
3. burning, seething—No, no, no. 
4. The birches are opening their leaves one 
5. by one. Their delicate leaves unfold cold 
6. and separate, one by one. Slender tassels 
7. hang swaying from the delicate branch tips— 
8. Oh, I cannot say it. There is no word. 
9. Black is split at once into flowers. In 
10. every bog and ditch, flares of 
11. small fire, white flowers!—Agh, 
12. the birches are mad, mad with their green. 
13. The world is gone, torn into shreds 
14. with this blessing. What have I left undone 
15. that I should have undertaken? 

16. O my brother, you redfaced, living man 
17. ignorant, stupid whose feet are upon 
18. this same dirt that I touch—and eat. 
19. We are alone in this terror, alone, 
20. face to face on this road, you and I, 
21. wrapped by this flame! 
22. Let the polished plows stay idle, 
23. their gloss already on the black soil. 
24. But that face of yours—! 
25. Answer me. I will clutch you. I 
26. will hug you, grip you. I will poke my face 
27. into your face and force you to see me. 
28. Take me in your arms, tell me the commonest 
29. thing that is in your mind to say, 
30. say anything. I will understand you—! 
31. It is the madness of the birch leaves opening 
32. cold, one by one. 

33. My rooms will receive me. But my rooms 
34. are no longer sweet spaces where comfort 
35. is ready to wait on me with its crumbs. 
36. A darkness has brushed them. The mass 
37. of yellow tulips in the bowl is shrunken. 
38. Every familiar object is changed and dwarfed. 
39. I am shaken, broken against a might 
40. that splits comfort, blows apart 
41. my careful partitions, crushes my house 
42. and leaves me—with shrinking heart 
43. and startled, empty eyes—peering out 
44. into a cold world. 

45. In the spring I would be drunk! In the spring 
46. I would be drunk and lie forgetting all things. 
47. Your face! Give me your face, Yang Kue Fei! 
48. your hands, your lips to drink! 
49. Give me your wrists to drink— 
50. I drag you, I am drowned in you, you 
51. overwhelm me! Drink! 
52. Save me! The shad bush is in the edge 
53. of the clearing. The yards in a fury 
54. of lilac blossoms are driving me mad with terror. 
55. Drink and lie forgetting the world. 

56. And coldly the birch leaves are opening one by one. 
57. Coldly I observe them and wait for the end. 
58. And it ends.
