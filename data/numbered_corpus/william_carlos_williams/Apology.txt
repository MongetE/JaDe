1. Why do I write today?

2. The beauty of
3. the terrible faces
4. of our nonentites
5. stirs me to it:

6. colored women
7. day workers—
8. old and experienced—
9. returning home at dusk
10. in cast off clothing
11. faces like
12. old Florentine oak.

13. Also

14. the set pieces
15. of your faces stir me—
16. leading citizens—
17. but not
18. in the same way.
