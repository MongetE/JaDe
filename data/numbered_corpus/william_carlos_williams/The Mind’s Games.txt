1. If a man can say of his life or
2. any moment of his life, There is
3. nothing more to be desired! his state
4. becomes like that told in the famous
5. double sonnet--but without the
6. sonnet’s restrictions. Let him go look
7. at the river flowing or the bank
8. of late flowers, there will be one
9. small fly still among the petals
10. in whose gauzy wings raised above
11. its back a rainbow shines. The world
12. to him is radiant and even the fact
13. of poverty is wholly without despair.

14. So it seems until these rouse
15. to him pictures of the systematically
16. starved--for a purpose, at the mind’s
17. proposal. What good then the
18. light winged fly, the flower or
19. the river--too foul to drink of or
20. even to bathe in? The 90 story building
21. beyond the ocean that a rocket
22. will span for destruction in a matter
23. of minutes but will not
24. bring him, in a century, food or
25. relief of any sort from his suffering.

26. The world too much with us? Rot!
27. the world is not half enough with us--
28. the rot of a potato with
29. a healthy skin, a rot that is
30. never revealed till we are about to
31. eat--and it revolts us. Beauty?
32. Beauty should make us paupers,
33. should blind us, rob us--for it
34. does not feed the sufferer but makes
35. his suffering a fly-blown putrescence
36. and ourselves decay--unless
37. the ecstasy be general.
