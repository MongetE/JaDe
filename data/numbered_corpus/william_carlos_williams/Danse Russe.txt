1. If I when my wife is sleeping
2. and the baby and Kathleen
3. are sleeping
4. and the sun is a flame-white disc
5. in silken mists
6. above shining trees,—
7. if I in my north room
8. dance naked, grotesquely
9. before my mirror
10. waving my shirt round my head
11. and singing softly to myself:
12. 'I am lonely, lonely.
13. I was born to be lonely,
14. I am best so! '
15. If I admire my arms, my face,
16. my shoulders, flanks, buttocks
17. against the yellow drawn shades,—

18. Who shall say I am not
19. the happy genius of my household?
