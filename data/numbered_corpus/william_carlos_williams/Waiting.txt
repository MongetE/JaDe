1. When I am alone I am happy.
2. The air is cool. The sky is
3. flecked and splashed and wound
4. with color. The crimson phalloi
5. of the sassafras leaves
6. hang crowded before me
7. in shoals on the heavy branches.
8. When I reach my doorstep
9. I am greeted by
10. the happy shrieks of my children
11. and my heart sinks.
12. I am crushed.

13. Are not my children as dear to me
14. as falling leaves or
15. must one become stupid
16. to grow older?
17. It seems much as if Sorrow
18. had tripped up my heels.
19. Let us see, let us see!
20. What did I plan to say to her
21. when it should happen to me
22. as it has happened now?
