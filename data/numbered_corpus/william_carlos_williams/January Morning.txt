1. I

2. I have discovered that most of 
3. the beauties of travel are due to 
4. the strange hours we keep to see them: 

5. the domes of the Church of 
6. the Paulist Fathers in Weehawken 
7. against a smoky dawn — the heart stirred — 
8. are beautiful as Saint Peters 
9. approached after years of anticipation. 

10. II 

11. Though the operation was postponed 
12. I saw the tall probationers 
13. in their tan uniforms 
14.               hurrying to breakfast! 

15. III 

16. — and from basement entries 
17. neatly coiffed, middle aged gentlemen 
18. with orderly moustaches and 
19. well-brushed coats 

20. IV 

21. — and the sun, dipping into the avenues 
22. streaking the tops of 
23. the irregular red houselets, 
24.              and 
25. the gay shadows drooping and drooping. 

26. V 

27. — and a young horse with a green bed-quilt 
28. on his withers shaking his head: 
29. bared teeth and nozzle high in the air! 

30. VI 

31. —and a semicircle of dirt-colored men 
32. about a fire bursting from an old 
33. ash can, 

34. VII 

35. — and the worn, 
36. blue car rails (like the sky!) 
37. gleaming among the cobbles! 

38. VIII 

39. — and the rickety ferry-boat "Arden"! 
40. What an object to be called "Arden" 
41. among the great piers, — on the 
42. ever new river! 
43.      "Put me a Touchstone 
44. at the wheel, white gulls, and we'll 
45. follow the ghost of the Half Moon 
46. to the North West Passage — and through! 
47. (at Albany!) for all that!" 

48. IX 

49. Exquisite brown waves — long 
50. circlets of silver moving over you! 
51. enough with crumbling ice crusts among you! 
52. The sky has come down to you, 
53. lighter than tiny bubbles, face to 
54. face with you! 
55.     His spirit is 
56. a white gull with delicate pink feet 
57. and a snowy breast for you to 
58. hold to your lips delicately! 

59. X 

60. The young doctor is dancing with happiness 
61. in the sparkling wind, alone 
62. at the prow of the ferry! He notices 
63. the curdy barnacles and broken ice crusts 
64. left at the slip's base by the low tide 
65. and thinks of summer and green 
66. shell-crusted ledges among 
67.         the emerald eel-grass! 

68. XI 

69. Who knows the Palisades as I do 
70. knows the river breaks east from them 
71. above the city — but they continue south 
72. — under the sky — to bear a crest of 
73. little peering houses that brighten 
74. with dawn behind the moody 
75. water-loving giants of Manhattan. 

76. XII 

77. Long yellow rushes bending 
78. above the white snow patches; 
79. purple and gold ribbon 
80. of the distant wood: 
81.    what an angle 
82. you make with each other as 
83. you lie there in contemplation. 

84. XIII 

85. Work hard all your young days 
86. and they'll find you too, some morning 
87. staring up under 
88. your chiffonier at its warped 
89. bass-wood bottom and your soul — 
90. out! 
91. — among the little sparrows 
92. behind the shutter. 

93. XIV 

94. — and the flapping flags are at 
95. half-mast for the dead admiral. 

96. XV 

97. All this — 
98. was for you, old woman. 
99. I wanted to write a poem 
100. that you would understand. 
101. For what good is it to me 
102. if you can't understand it? 
103.    But you got to try hard — 
104. But — 
105.       Well, you know how 
106. the young girls run giggling 
107. on Park Avenue after dark 
108. when they ought to be home in bed? 
109. Well, 
110. that's the way it is with me somehow.
