1. Of asphodel, that greeny flower,
2. like a buttercup
3. upon its branching stem-
4. save that it's green and wooden-
5. I come, my sweet,
6. to sing to you.
7. We lived long together
8. a life filled,
9. if you will,
10. with flowers.  So that
11. I was cheered
12. when I came first to know
13. that there were flowers also
14. in hell.
15. Today
16. I'm filled with the fading memory of those flowers
17. that we both loved,
18. even to this poor
19. colorless thing-
20. I saw it
21. when I was a child-
22. little prized among the living
23. but the dead see,
24. asking among themselves:
25. What do I remember
26. that was shaped
27. as this thing is shaped?
28. while our eyes fill
29. with tears.
30. Of love, abiding love
31. it will be telling
32. though too weak a wash of crimson
33. colors it
34. to make it wholly credible.
35. There is something
36. something urgent
37. I have to say to you
38. and you alone
39. but it must wait
40. while I drink in
41. the joy of your approach,
42. perhaps for the last time.
43. And so
44. with fear in my heart
45. I drag it out
46. and keep on talking
47. for I dare not stop.
48. Listen while I talk on
49. against time.
50. It will not be
51. for long.
52. I have forgot
53. and yet I see clearly enough
54. something
55. central to the sky
56. which ranges round it.
57. An odor
58. springs from it!
59. A sweetest odor!
60. Honeysuckle!  And now
61. there comes the buzzing of a bee!
62. and a whole flood
63. of sister memories!
64. Only give me time,
65. time to recall them
66. before I shall speak out.
67. Give me time,
68. time.
69. When I was a boy
70. I kept a book
71. to which, from time
72. to time,
73. I added pressed flowers
74. until, after a time,
75. I had a good collection.
76. The asphodel,
77. forebodingly,
78. among them.
79. I bring you,
80. reawakened,
81. a memory of those flowers.
82. They were sweet
83. when I pressed them
84. and retained
85. something of their sweetness
86. a long time.
87. It is a curious odor,
88. a moral odor,
89. that brings me
90. near to you.
91. The color
92. was the first to go.
93. There had come to me
94. a challenge,
95. your dear self,
96. mortal as I was,
97. the lily's throat
98. to the hummingbird!
99. Endless wealth,
100. I thought,
101. held out its arms to me.
102. A thousand tropics
103. in an apple blossom.
104. The generous earth itself
105. gave us lief.
106. The whole world
107. became my garden!
108. But the sea
109. which no one tends
110. is also a garden
111. when the sun strikes it
112. and the waves
113. are wakened.
114. I have seen it
115. and so have you
116. when it puts all flowers
117. to shame.
118. Too, there are the starfish
119. stiffened by the sun
120. and other sea wrack
121. and weeds.  We knew that
122. along with the rest of it
123. for we were born by the sea,
124. knew its rose hedges
125. to the very water's brink.
126. There the pink mallow grows
127. and in their season
128. strawberries
129. and there, later,
130. we went to gather
131. the wild plum.
132. I cannot say
133. that I have gone to hell
134. for your love
135. but often
136. found myself there
137. in your pursuit.
138. I do not like it
139. and wanted to be
140. in heaven.  Hear me out.
141. Do not turn away.
142. I have learned much in my life
143. from books
144. and out of them
145. about love.
146. Death
147. is not the end of it.
148. There is a hierarchy
149. which can be attained,
150. I think,
151. in its service.
152. Its guerdon
153. is a fairy flower;
154. a cat of twenty lives.
155. If no one came to try it
156. the world
157. would be the loser.
158. It has been
159. for you and me
160. as one who watches a storm
161. come in over the water.
162. We have stood
163. from year to year
164. before the spectacle of our lives
165. with joined hands.
166. The storm unfolds.
167. Lightning
168. plays about the edges of the clouds.
169. The sky to the north
170. is placid,
171. blue in the afterglow
172. as the storm piles up.
173. It is a flower
174. that will soon reach
175. the apex of its bloom.
176. We danced,
177. in our minds,
178. and read a book together.
179. You remember?
180. It was a serious book.
181. And so books
182. entered our lives.
183. The sea!  The sea!
184. Always
185. when I think of the sea
186. there comes to mind
187. the Iliad
188. and Helen's public fault
189. that bred it.
190. Were it not for that
191. there would have been
192. no poem but the world
193. if we had remembered,
194. those crimson petals
195. spilled among the stones,
196. would have called it simply
197. murder.
198. The sexual orchid that bloomed then
199. sending so many
200. disinterested
201. men to their graves
202. has left its memory
203. to a race of fools
204. or heroes
205. if silence is a virtue.
206. The sea alone
207. with its multiplicity
208. holds any hope.
209. The storm
210. has proven abortive
211. but we remain
212. after the thoughts it roused
213. to
214. re-cement our lives.
215. It is the mind
216. the mind
217. that must be cured
218. short of death's
219. intervention,
220. and the will becomes again
221. a garden.  The poem
222. is complex and the place made
223. in our lives
224. for the poem.
225. Silence can be complex too,
226. but you do not get far
227. with silence.
228. Begin again.
229. It is like Homer's
230. catalogue of ships:
231. it fills up the time.
232. I speak in figures,
233. well enough, the dresses
234. you wear are figures also,
235. we could not meet
236. otherwise.  When I speak
237. of flowers
238. it is to recall
239. that at one time
240. we were young.
241. All women are not Helen,
242. I know that,
243. but have Helen in their hearts.
244. My sweet,
245. you have it also, therefore
246. I love you
247. and could not love you otherwise.
248. Imagine you saw
249. a field made up of women
250. all silver-white.
251. What should you do
252. but love them?
253. The storm bursts
254. or fades!  it is not
255. the end of the world.
256. Love is something else,
257. or so I thought it,
258. a garden which expands,
259. though I knew you as a woman
260. and never thought otherwise,
261. until the whole sea
262. has been taken up
263. and all its gardens.
264. It was the love of love,
265. the love that swallows up all else,
266. a grateful love,
267. a love of nature, of people,
268. of animals,
269. a love engendering
270. gentleness and goodness
271. that moved me
272. and that I saw in you.
273. I should have known,
274. though I did not,
275. that the lily-of-the-valley
276. is a flower makes many ill
277. who whiff it.
278. We had our children,
279. rivals in the general onslaught.
280. I put them aside
281. though I cared for them.
282. as well as any man
283. could care for his children
284. according to my lights.
285. You understand
286. I had to meet you
287. after the event
288. and have still to meet you.
289. Love
290. to which you too shall bow
291. along with me-
292. a flower
293. a weakest flower
294. shall be our trust
295. and not because
296. we are too feeble
297. to do otherwise
298. but because
299. at the height of my power
300. I risked what I had to do,
301. therefore to prove
302. that we love each other
303. while my very bones sweated
304. that I could not cry to you
305. in the act.
306. Of asphodel, that greeny flower,
307. I come, my sweet,
308. to sing to you!
309. My heart rouses
310. thinking to bring you news
311. of something
312. that concerns you
313. and concerns many men.  Look at
314. what passes for the new.
315. You will not find it there but in
316. despised poems.
317. It is difficult
318. to get the news from poems
319. yet men die miserably every day
320. for lack
321. of what is found there.
322. Hear me out
323. for I too am concerned
324. and every man
325. who wants to die at peace in his bed
326. besides.
