1. contend in a sea which the land partly encloses
2. shielding them from the too-heavy blows
3. of an ungoverned ocean which when it chooses

4. tortures the biggest hulls, the best man knows
5. to pit against its beatings, and sinks them pitilessly.
6. Mothlike in mists, scintillant in the minute

7. brilliance of cloudless days, with broad bellying sails
8. they glide to the wind tossing green water
9. from their sharp prows while over them the crew crawls

10. ant-like, solicitously grooming them, releasing,
11. making fast as they turn, lean far over and having
12. caught the wind again, side by side, head for the mark.

13. In a well guarded arena of open water surrounded by
14. lesser and greater craft which, sycophant, lumbering
15. and flittering follow them, they appear youthful, rare

16. as the light of a happy eye, live with the grace
17. of all that in the mind is feckless, free and
18. naturally to be desired. Now the sea which holds them

19. is moody, lapping their glossy sides, as if feeling
20. for some slightest flaw but fails completely.
21. Today no race. Then the wind comes again. The yachts

22. move, jockeying for a start, the signal is set and they
23. are off. Now the waves strike at them but they are too
24. well made, they slip through, though they take in canvas.

25. Arms with hands grasping seek to clutch at the prows.
26. Bodies thrown recklessly in the way are cut aside.
27. It is a sea of faces about them in agony, in despair

28. until the horror of the race dawns staggering the mind;
29. the whole sea become an entanglement of watery bodies
30. lost to the world bearing what they cannot hold. Broken,

31. beaten, desolate, reaching from the dead to be taken up
32. they cry out, failing, failing! their cries rising
33. in waves still as the skillful yachts pass over.
