1. I must tell you
2. this young tree
3. whose round and firm trunk
4. between the wet

5. pavement and the gutter
6. (where water
7. is trickling) rises
8. bodily

9. into the air with
10. one undulant
11. thrust half its height-
12. and then

13. dividing and waning
14. sending out
15. young branches on
16. all sides-

17. hung with cocoons
18. it thins
19. till nothing is left of it
20. but two

21. eccentric knotted
22. twigs
23. bending forward
24. hornlike at the top
