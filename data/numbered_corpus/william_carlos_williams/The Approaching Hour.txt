1. You Communists and Republicans!
2. all you Germans and Frenchmen!
3. you corpses and quickeners!
4. The stars are about to melt
5. and fall on you in tears.

6. Get ready! Get ready!
7. you Papists and Protestants!
8. you whores and you virtuous!
9. The moon will be bread
10. and drop presently into your baskets.

11. Friends and those who despise
12. and detest us!
13. Adventists and those who believe
14. nothing!
15. Get ready for the awakening.
