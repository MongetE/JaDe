2. bareheaded
3. in a soiled undershirt
4. his hair standing out
5. on all sides
6. stood on his toes
7. heels together
8. arms gracefully
9. for the moment

10. curled above his head.
11. Then he whirled about
12. bounded
13. into the air
14. and with an entrechat
15. perfectly achieved
16. completed the figure.
17. My mother
18. taken by surprise
19. where she sat
20. in her invalid's chair
21. was left speechless.
22. Bravo! she cried at last
23. and clapped her hands.
24. The man's wife
25. came from the kitchen:
26. What goes on here? she said.
27. But the show was over.
