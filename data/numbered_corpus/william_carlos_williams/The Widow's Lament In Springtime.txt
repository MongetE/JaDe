1. Sorrow is my own yard
2. where the new grass
3. flames as it has flamed
4. often before but not
5. with the cold fire
6. that closes round me this year.
7. Thirtyfive years
8. I lived with my husband.
9. The plumtree is white today
10. with masses of flowers.
11. Masses of flowers
12. load the cherry branches
13. and color some bushes
14. yellow and some red
15. but the grief in my heart
16. is stronger than they
17. for though they were my joy
18. formerly, today I notice them
19. and turn away forgetting.
20. Today my son told me
21. that in the meadows,
22. at the edge of the heavy woods
23. in the distance, he saw
24. trees of white flowers.
25. I feel that I would like
26. to go there
27. and fall into those flowers
28. and sink into the marsh near them.
