1. All those treasures that lie in the little bolted box whose tiny space is
2. Mightier than the room of the stars, being secret and filled with dreams:
3. All those treasures—I hold them in my hand—are straining continually
4. Against the sides and the lid and the two ends of the little box in which I guard them;
5. Crying that there is no sun come among them this great while and that they weary of shining;
6. Calling me to fold back the lid of the little box and to give them sleep finally.

7. But the night I am hiding from them, dear friend, is far more desperate than their night!
8. And so I take pity on them and pretend to have lost the key to the little house of my treasures;
9. For they would die of weariness were I to open it, and not be merely faint and sleepy
10. As they are now.
