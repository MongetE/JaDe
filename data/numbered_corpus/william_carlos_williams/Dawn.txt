1. Ecstatic bird songs pound
2. the hollow vastness of the sky
3. with metallic clinkings--
4. beating color up into it
5. at a far edge,--beating it, beating it
6. with rising, triumphant ardor,--
7. stirring it into warmth,
8. quickening in it a spreading change,--
9. bursting wildly against it as
10. dividing the horizon, a heavy sun
11. lifts himself--is lifted--
12. bit by bit above the edge
13. of things,--runs free at last
14. out into the open--!lumbering
15. glorified in full release upward--
16. songs cease.
