1. At ten AM the young housewife
2. moves about in negligee behind
3. the wooden walls of her husbandâ€™s house.
4. I pass solitary in my car.

5. Then again she comes to the curb
6. to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
7. shy, uncorseted, tucking in
8. stray ends of hair, and I compare her
9. to a fallen leaf.

10. The noiseless wheels of my car
11. rush with a crackling sound over
12. dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling.
