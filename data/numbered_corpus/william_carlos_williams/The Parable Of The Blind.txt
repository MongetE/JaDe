1. This horrible but superb painting
2. the parable of the blind
3. without a red

4. in the composition shows a group
5. of beggars leading
6. each other diagonally downward

7. across the canvas
8. from one side
9. to stumble finally into a bog

10. where the picture
11. and the composition ends back
12. of which no seeing man

13. is represented the unshaven
14. features of the des-
15. titute with their few

16. pitiful possessions a basin
17. to wash in a peasant
18. cottage is seen and a church spire

19. the faces are raised
20. as toward the light
21. there is no detail extraneous

22. to the composition one
23. follows the others stick in
24. hand triumphant to disaster
