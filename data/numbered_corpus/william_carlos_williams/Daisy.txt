1. The dayseye hugging the earth
2. in August, ha! Spring is
3. gone down in purple,
4. weeds stand high in the corn,
5. the rainbeaten furrow
6. is clotted with sorrel
7. and crabgrass, the
8. branch is black under
9. the heavy mass of the leaves--
10. The sun is upon a
11. slender green stem
12. ribbed lengthwise.
13. He lies on his back--
14. it is a woman also--
15. he regards his former
16. majesty and
17. round the yellow center,
18. split and creviced and done into
19. minute flowerheads, he sends out
20. his twenty rays-- a little
21. and the wind is among them
22. to grow cool there!

23. One turns the thing over
24. in his hand and looks
25. at it from the rear: brownedged,
26. green and pointed scales
27. armor his yellow.

28. But turn and turn,
29. the crisp petals remain
30. brief, translucent, greenfastened,
31. barely touching at the edges:
32. blades of limpid seashell.
