1. It is a small plant
2. delicately branched and
3. tapering conically
4. to a point, each branch
5. and the peak a wire for
6. green pods, blind lanterns
7. starting upward from
8. the stalk each way to
9. a pair of prickly edged blue
10. flowerets: it is her regard,
11. a little plant without leaves,
12. a finished thing guarding
13. its secret. Blue eyes—
14. but there are twenty looks
15. in one, alike as forty flowers
16. on twenty stems—Blue eyes
17. a little closed upon a wish
18. achieved and half lost again,
19. stemming back, garlanded
20. with green sacks of
21. satisfaction gone to seed,
22. back to a straight stem—if
23. one looks into you, trumpets—!
24. No. It is the pale hollow of
25. desire itself counting
26. over and over the moneys of
27. a stale achievement. Three
28. small lavender imploring tips
29. below and above them two
30. slender colored arrows
31. of disdain with anthers
32. between them and
33. at the edge of the goblet
34. a white lip, to drink from—!
35. And summer lifts her look
36. forty times over, forty times
37. over—namelessly.
