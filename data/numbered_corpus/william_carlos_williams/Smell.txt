1. Oh strong-ridged and deeply hollowed
2. nose of mine! what will you not be smelling?
3. What tactless asses we are, you and I, boney nose,
4. always indiscriminate, always unashamed,
5. and now it is the souring flowers of the bedreggled
6. poplars: a festering pulp on the wet earth
7. beneath them. With what deep thirst
8. we quicken our desires
9. to that rank odor of a passing springtime!
10. Can you not be decent? Can you not reserve your ardors
11. for something less unlovely? What girl will care
12. for us, do you think, if we continue in these ways?
13. Must you taste everything? Must you know everything?
14. Must you have a part in everything?
