1. In Breughel's great picture, The Kermess,
2. the dancers go round, they go round and
3. around, the squeal and the blare and the
4. tweedle of bagpipes, a bugle and fiddles
5. tipping their bellies, (round as the thick-
6. sided glasses whose wash they impound)
7. their hips and their bellies off balance
8. to turn them. Kicking and rolling about
9. the Fair Grounds, swinging their butts, those
10. shanks must be sound to bear up under such
11. rollicking measures, prance as they dance
