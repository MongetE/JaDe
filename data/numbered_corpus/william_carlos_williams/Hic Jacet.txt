1. The coroner's merry little children
2. Have such twinkling brown eyes.
3. Their father is not of gay men
4. And their mother jocular in no wise,
5. Yet the coroner's merry little children
6. Laugh so easily.

7. They laugh because they prosper.
8. Fruit for them is upon all branches.
9. Lo! how they jibe at loss, for
10. Kind heaven fills their little paunches!
11. It's the coroner's merry, merry children
12. Who laugh so easily.
