1. I have had my dream--like others--
2. and it has come to nothing, so that
3. I remain now carelessly
4. with feet planted on the ground
5. and look up at the sky--
6. feeling my clothes about me,
7. the weight of my body in my shoes,
8. the rim of my hat, air passing in and out
9. at my nose--and decide to dream no more.
