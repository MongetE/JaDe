1. I lie here thinking of you:---

2. the stain of love
3. is upon the world!
4. Yellow, yellow, yellow
5. it eats into the leaves,
6. smears with saffron
7. the horned branched the lean
8. heavily
9. against a smooth purple sky!
10. There is no light
11. only a honey-thick stain
12. that drips from leaf to leaf
13. and limb to limb
14. spoiling the colors
15. of the whole world-

16. you far off there under
17. the wine-red selvage of the west!
