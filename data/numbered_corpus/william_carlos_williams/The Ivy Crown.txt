1. The whole process is a lie,
2. unless,
3. crowned by excess,
4. It break forcefully,
5. one way or another,
6. from its confinement—
7. or find a deeper well.
8. Antony and Cleopatra
9. were right;
10. they have shown
11. the way. I love you
12. or I do not live
13. at all.

14. Daffodil time
15. is past. This is
16. summer, summer!
17. the heart says,
18. and not even the full of it.
19. No doubts
20. are permitted—
21. though they will come
22. and may
23. before our time
24. overwhelm us.
25. We are only mortal
26. but being mortal
27. can defy our fate.
28. We may
29. by an outside chance
30. even win! We do not
31. look to see
32. jonquils and violets
33. come again
34. but there are,
35. still,
36. the roses!

37. Romance has no part in it.
38. The business of love is
39. cruelty which,
40. by our wills,
41. we transform
42. to live together.
43. It has its seasons,
44. for and against,
45. whatever the heart
46. fumbles in the dark
47. to assert
48. toward the end of May.
49. Just as the nature of briars
50. is to tear flesh,
51. I have proceeded
52. through them.
53. Keep
54. the briars out,
55. they say.
56. You cannot live
57. and keep free of
58. briars.

59. Children pick flowers.
60. Let them.
61. Though having them
62. in hand
63. they have no further use for them
64. but leave them crumpled
65. at the curb's edge.

66. At our age the imagination
67. across the sorry facts
68. lifts us
69. to make roses
70. stand before thorns.
71. Sure
72. love is cruel
73. and selfish
74. and totally obtuse—
75. at least, blinded by the light,
76. young love is.
77. But we are older,
78. I to love
79. and you to be loved,
80. we have,
81. no matter how,
82. by our wills survived
83. to keep
84. the jeweled prize
85. always
86. at our finger tips.
87. We will it so
88. and so it is
89. past all accident.
