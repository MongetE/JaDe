1. By the road to the contagious hospital
2. under the surge of the blue
3. mottled clouds driven from the
4. northeast -- a cold wind. Beyond, the
5. waste of broad, muddy fields
6. brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen

7. patches of standing water
8. the scattering of tall trees

9. All along the road the reddish
10. purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy
11. stuff of bushes and small trees
12. with dead, brown leaves under them
13. leafless vines --

14. Lifeless in appearance, sluggish
15. dazed spring approaches --

16. They enter the new world naked,
17. cold, uncertain of all
18. save that they enter. All about them
19. the cold, familiar wind --

20. Now the grass, tomorrow
21. the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf

22. One by one objects are defined --
23. It quickens: clarity, outline of leaf

24. But now the stark dignity of
25. entrance -- Still, the profound change
26. has come upon them: rooted they
27. grip down and begin to awaken
