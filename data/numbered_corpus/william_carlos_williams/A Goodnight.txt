1. Go to sleep--though of course you will not--
2. to tideless waves thundering slantwise against
3. strong embankments, rattle and swish of spray
4. dashed thirty feet high, caught by the lake wind,
5. scattered and strewn broadcast in over the steady
6. car rails! Sleep, sleep! Gulls' cries in a wind-gust
7. broken by the wind; calculating wings set above
8. the field of waves breaking.
9. Go to sleep to the lunge between foam-crests,
10. refuse churned in the recoil. Food! Food!
11. Offal! Offal! that holds them in the air, wave-white
12. for the one purpose, feather upon feather, the wild
13. chill in their eyes, the hoarseness in their voices--
14. sleep, sleep . . .

15. Gentlefooted crowds are treading out your lullaby.
16. Their arms nudge, they brush shoulders,
17. hitch this way then that, mass and surge at the crossings--
18. lullaby, lullaby! The wild-fowl police whistles,
19. the enraged roar of the traffic, machine shrieks:
20. it is all to put you to sleep,
21. to soften your limbs in relaxed postures,
22. and that your head slip sidewise, and your hair loosen
23. and fall over your eyes and over your mouth,
24. brushing your lips wistfully that you may dream,
25. sleep and dream--

26. A black fungus springs out about the lonely church doors--
27. sleep, sleep. The Night, coming down upon
28. the wet boulevard, would start you awake with his
29. message, to have in at your window. Pay no
30. heed to him. He storms at your sill with
31. cooings, with gesticulations, curses!
32. You will not let him in. He would keep you from sleeping.
33. He would have you sit under your desk lamp
34. brooding, pondering; he would have you
35. slide out the drawer, take up the ornamented dagger
36. and handle it. It is late, it is nineteen-nineteen--
37. go to sleep, his cries are a lullaby;
38. his jabbering is a sleep-well-my-baby; he is
39. a crackbrained messenger.

40. The maid waking you in the morning
41. when you are up and dressing,
42. the rustle of your clothes as you raise them--
43. it is the same tune.
44. At table the cold, greeninsh, split grapefruit, its juice
45. on the tongue, the clink of the spoon in
46. your coffee, the toast odors say it over and over.

47. The open street-door lets in the breath of
48. the morning wind from over the lake.
49. The bus coming to a halt grinds from its sullen brakes--
50. lullaby, lullaby. The crackle of a newspaper,
51. the movement of the troubled coat beside you--
52. sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep . . .
53. It is the sting of snow, the burning liquor of
54. the moonlight, the rush of rain in the gutters packed
55. with dead leaves: go to sleep, go to sleep.
56. And the night passes--and never passes--
