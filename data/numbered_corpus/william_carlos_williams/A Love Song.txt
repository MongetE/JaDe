1. What have I to say to you
2. When we shall meet?
3. Yet—
4. I lie here thinking of you.

5. The stain of love
6. Is upon the world.
7. Yellow, yellow, yellow,
8. It eats into the leaves,
9. Smears with saffron
10. The horned branches that lean
11. Heavily
12. Against a smooth purple sky.

13. There is no light—
14. Only a honey-thick stain
15. That drips from leaf to leaf
16. And limb to limb
17. Spoiling the colours
18. Of the whole world.

19. I am alone.
20. The weight of love
21. Has buoyed me up
22. Till my head
23. Knocks against the sky.

24. See me!
25. My hair is dripping with nectar—
26. Starlings carry it
27. On their black wings.
28. See, at last
29. My arms and my hands
30. Are lying idle.

31. How can I tell
32. If I shall ever love you again
33. As I do now?
