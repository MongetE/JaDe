1. A middle-northern March, now as always--
2. gusts from the South broken against cold winds--
3. but from under, as if a slow hand lifted a tide,
4. it moves--not into April--into a second March,

5. the old skin of wind-clear scales dropping
6. upon the mold: this is the shadow projects the tree
7. upward causing the sun to shine in his sphere.

8. So we will put on our pink felt hat--new last year!
9. --newer this by virtue of brown eyes turning back
10. the seasons--and let us walk to the orchid-house,
11. see the flowers will take the prize tomorrow
12. at the Palace.
13. Stop here, these are our oleanders.
14. When they are in bloom--
15. You would waste words
16. It is clearer to me than if the pink
17. were on the branch. It would be a searching in
18. a colored cloud to reveal that which now, huskless,
19. shows the very reason for their being.

20. And these the orange-trees, in blossom--no need
21. to tell with this weight of perfume in the air.
22. If it were not so dark in this shed one could better
23. see the white.
24. It is that very perfume
25. has drawn the darkness down among the leaves.
26. Do I speak clearly enough?
27. It is this darkness reveals that which darkness alone
28. loosens and sets spinning on waxen wings--
29. not the touch of a finger-tip, not the motion
30. of a sigh. A too heavy sweetness proves
31. its own caretaker.
32. And here are the orchids!
33. Never having seen
34. such gaiety I will read these flowers for you:
35. This is an odd January, died--in Villon's time.
36. Snow, this is and this the stain of a violet
37. grew in that place the spring that foresaw its own doom.

38. And this, a certain July from Iceland:
39. a young woman of that place
40. breathed it toward the South. It took root there.
41. The color ran true but the plant is small.

42. This falling spray of snow-flakes is
43. a handful of dead Februaries
44. prayed into flower by Rafael Arevalo Martinez
45. of Guatemala.
46. Here's that old friend who
47. went by my side so many years: this full, fragile
48. head of veined lavender. Oh that April
49. that we first went with our stiff lusts
50. leaving the city behind, out to the green hill--
51. May, they said she was. A hand for all of us:
52. this branch of blue butterflies tied to this stem.

53. June is a yellow cup I'll not name; August
54. the over-heavy one. And here are--
55. russet and shiny, all but March. And March?
56. Ah, March--
57. Flowers are a tiresome pastime.
58. One has a wish to shake them from their pots
59. root and stem, for the sun to gnaw.

60. Walk out again into the cold and saunter home
61. to the fire. This day has blossomed long enough.
62. I have wiped out the red night and lit a blaze
63. instead which will at least warm our hands
64. and stir up the talk.
65. I think we have kept fair time.
66. Time is a green orchard.
