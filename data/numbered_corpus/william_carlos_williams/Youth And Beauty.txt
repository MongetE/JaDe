1. I bought a dishmop--
2. having no daughter--
3. for they had twisted
4. fine ribbons of shining copper
5. about white twine
6. and made a tousled head
7. of it, fastened it
8. upon a turned ash stick
9. slender at the neck
10. straight, tall--
11. when tied upright
12. on the brass wallbracket
13. to be a light for me
14. and naked
15. as a girl should seem
16. to her father.
