1. Constantly near you, I never in my entire
2. sixty-four years knew you so well as yesterday
3. or half so well. We talked. you were never
4. so lucid, so disengaged from all exigencies
5. of place and time. We talked of ourselves,
6. intimately, a thing never heard between us.
7. How long have we waited? almost a hundred years.

8. You said, Unless there is some spark, some
9. spirit we keep within ourselves, a life, a
10. continuing life's impossible-and it is all
11. we have. There is no other life, only the one.
12. The world of the spirits that come afterward
13. is the same as our own, just like you sitting
14. there they come and talk to me, just the same.

15. They come to bother us. Why? I said. I don't
16. know. Perhaps to find out what we are doing.
17. Jealous, do you think? I don't know. I
18. don't know why they should want to come back.
19. I was reading about some men who had been
20. buried under a mountain, I said to her, and
21. one of them came back after two months,

22. digging himself out. It was in Switzerland,
23. you remember? Of course I remember. The
24. villagers tho't it was a ghost coming down
25. to complain. They were frightened. They
26. do come, she said, what you call
27. my 'visions.' I talk to them just as I
28. am talking to you. I see them plainly.

29. Oh if I could only read! You don't know
30. what adjustments I have made. All
31. I can do is to try to live over again
32. what I knew when your brother and you
33. were children-but I can't always succeed.
34. Tell me about the horse show. I have
35. been waiting all week to hear about it.

36. Mother darling, I wasn't able to get away.
37. Oh that's too bad. It was just a show;
38. they make the horses walk up and down
39. to judge them by their form. Oh is that
40. all? I tho't it was something else. Oh
41. they jump and run too. I wish you had been
42. there, I was so interested to hear about it.
