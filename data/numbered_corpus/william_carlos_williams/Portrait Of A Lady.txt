1. Your thighs are appletrees
2. whose blossoms touch the sky.
3. Which sky? The sky
4. where Watteau hung a lady's
5. slipper. Your knees
6. are a southern breeze -- or
7. a gust of snow. Agh! what
8. sort of man was Fragonard?
9. -- As if that answered
10. anything. -- Ah, yes. Below
11. the knees, since the tune
12. drops that way, it is
13. one of those white summer days,
14. the tall grass of your ankles
15. flickers upon the shore --
16. Which shore? --
17. the sand clings to my lips --
18. Which shore?
19. Agh, petals maybe. How
20. should I know?
21. Which shore? Which shore?
22. -- the petals from some hidden
23. appletree -- Which shore?
24. I said petals from an appletree.
