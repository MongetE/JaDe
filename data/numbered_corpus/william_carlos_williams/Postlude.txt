1. Now that I have cooled to you
2. Let there be gold of tarnished masonry,
3. Temples soothed by the sun to ruin
4. That sleep utterly.
5. Give me hand for the dances,
6. Ripples at Philae, in and out,
7. And lips, my Lesbian,
8. Wall flowers that once were flame.

9. Your hair is my Carthage
10. And my arms the bow,
11. And our words arrows
12. To shoot the stars
13. Who from that misty sea
14. Swarm to destroy us.

15. But you there beside meâ€”
16. Oh, how shall I defy you,
17. Who wound me in the night
18. With breasts shining
19. Like Venus and like Mars?
20. The night that is shouting Jason
21. When the loud eaves rattle
22. As with waves above me
23. Blue at the prow of my desire.
