1. I stopped the car
2. to let the children down
3. where the streets end
4. in the sun
5. at the marsh edge
6. and the reeds begin
7. and there are small houses
8. facing the reeds
9. and the blue mist in the distance
10. with grapevine trellises
11. with grape clusters
12. small as strawberries
13. on the vines
14. and ditches
15. running springwater
16. that continue the gutters
17. with willows over them.
18. The reeds begin
19. like water at a shore
20. their pointed petals waving
21. dark green and light.
22. But blueflags are blossoming
23. in the reeds
24. which the children pluck
25. chattering in the reeds
26. high over their heads
27. which they part
28. with bare arms to appear
29. with fists of flowers
30. till in the air
31. there comes the smell
32. of calmus
33. from wet, gummy stalks.
