1. The crowd at the ball game
2. is moved uniformly

3. by a spirit of uselessness
4. which delights them—

5. all the exciting detail
6. of the chase

7. and the escape, the error
8. the flash of genius—

9. all to no end save beauty
10. the eternal—

11. So in detail they, the crowd,
12. are beautiful

13. for this
14. to be warned against

15. saluted and defied—
16. It is alive, venomous

17. it smiles grimly
18. its words cut—

19. The flashy female with her
20. mother, gets it—

21. The Jew gets it straight— it
22. is deadly, terrifying—

23. It is the Inquisition, the
24. Revolution

25. It is beauty itself
26. that lives

27. day by day in them
28. idly—

29. This is
30. the power of their faces

31. It is summer, it is the solstice
32. the crowd is

33. cheering, the crowd is laughing
34. in detail

35. permanently, seriously
36. without thought
