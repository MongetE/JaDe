1. If you had come away with me
2. into another state
3. we had been quiet together.
4. But there the sun coming up
5. out of the nothing beyond the lake was
6. too low in the sky,
7. there was too great a pushing
8. against him,
9. too much of sumac buds, pink
10. in the head
11. with the clear gum upon them,
12. too many opening hearts of lilac leaves,
13. too many, too many swollen
14. limp poplar tassels on the
15. bare branches!
16. It was too strong in the air.
17. I had no rest against that
18. springtime!
19. The pounding of the hoofs on the
20. raw sods
21. stayed with me half through the night.
22. I awoke smiling but tired.
