1. They call me and I go.
2. It is a frozen road
3. past midnight, a dust
4. of snow caught
5. in the rigid wheeltracks.
6. The door opens.
7. I smile, enter and
8. shake off the cold.
9. Here is a great woman
10. on her side in the bed.
11. She is sick,
12. perhaps vomiting,
13. perhaps laboring
14. to give birth to
15. a tenth child. Joy! Joy!
16. Night is a room
17. darkened for lovers,
18. through the jalousies the sun
19. has sent one golden needle!
20. I pick the hair from her eyes
21. and watch her misery
22. with compassion.
