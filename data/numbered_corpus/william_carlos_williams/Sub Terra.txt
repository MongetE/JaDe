1. Where shall I find you—
2. You, my grotesque fellows
3. That I seek everywhere
4. To make up my band?
5. None, not one
6. With the earthy tastes I require:
7. The burrowing pride that rises
8. Subtly as on a bush in May.

9. Where are you this day—
10. You, my seven-year locusts
11. With cased wings?
12. Ah, my beauties, how I long!
13. That harvest
14. That shall be your advent—
15. Thrusting up through the grass,
16. Up under the weeds,
17. Answering me—
18. That shall be satisfying!
19. The light shall leap and snap
20. That day as with a million lashes!

21. Oh, I have you!
22. Yes, you are about me in a sense,
23. Playing under the blue pools
24. That are my windows.
25. But they shut you out still
26. There in the half light—
27. For the simple truth is
28. That though I see you clear enough …
29. You are not there.

30. It is not that—it is you,
31. You I want, my companions!
32. God! if I could only fathom
33. The guts of shadows!—
34. You to come with me
35. Poking into negro houses
36. With their gloom and smell!
37. In among children
38. Leaping around a dead dog!
39. Mimicking
40. Onto the lawns of the rich!
41. You!
42. To go with me a-tip-toe
43. Head down under heaven,
44. Nostrils lipping the wind!
