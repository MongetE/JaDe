1. My wife's new pink slippers
2. have gay pompons.
3. There is not a spot or a stain
4. on their satin toes or their sides.
5. All night they lie together
6. under her bed's edge.
7. Shivering I catch sight of them
8. and smile, in the morning.
9. Later I watch them
10. descending the stair,
11. hurrying through the doors
12. and round the table,
13. moving stiffly
14. with a shake of their gay pompons!
15. And I talk to them
16. in my secret mind
17. out of pure happiness.
