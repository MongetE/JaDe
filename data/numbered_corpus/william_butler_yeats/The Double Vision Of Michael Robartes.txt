1. I
2. ON the grey rock of Cashel the mind's eye
3. Has called up the cold spirits that are born
4. When the old moon is vanished from the sky
5. And the new still hides her horn.
6. Under blank eyes and fingers never still
7. The particular is pounded till it is man.
8. When had I my own will?
9. O not since life began.
10. Constrained, arraigned, baffled, bent and unbent
11. By these wire-jointed jaws and limbs of wood,
12. Themselves obedient,
13. Knowing not evil and good;
14. Obedient to some hidden magical breath.
15. They do not even feel, so abstract are they.
16. So dead beyond our death,
17. Triumph that we obey.
18. On the grey rock of Cashel I suddenly saw
19. A Sphinx with woman breast and lion paw.
20. A Buddha, hand at rest,
21. Hand lifted up that blest;
22. And right between these two a girl at play
23. That, it may be, had danced her life away,
24. For now being dead it seemed
25. That she of dancing dreamed.
26. Although I saw it all in the mind's eye
27. There can be nothing solider till I die;
28. I saw by the moon's light
29. Now at its fifteenth night.
30. One lashed her tail; her eyes lit by the moon
31. Gazed upon all things known, all things unknown,
32. In triumph of intellect
33. With motionless head erect.
34. That other's moonlit eyeballs never moved,
35. Being fixed on all things loved, all things unloved.
36. Yet little peace he had,
37. For those that love are sad.
38. Little did they care who danced between,
39. And little she by whom her dance was seen
40. So she had outdanced thought.
41. Body perfection brought,
42. For what but eye and ear silence the mind
43. With the minute particulars of mankind?
44. Mind moved yet seemed to stop
45. As 'twere a spinning-top.
46. In contemplation had those three so wrought
47. Upon a moment, and so stretched it out
48. That they, time overthrown,
49. Were dead yet flesh and bone.
50. I knew that I had seen, had seen at last
51. That girl my unremembering nights hold fast
52. Or else my dreams that fly
53. If I should rub an eye,
54. And yet in flying fling into my meat
55. A crazy juice that makes the pulses beat
56. As though I had been undone
57. By Homer's Paragon
58. Who never gave the burning town a thought;
59. To such a pitch of folly I am brought,
60. Being caught between the pull
61. Of the dark moon and the full,
62. The commonness of thought and images
63. That have the frenzy of our western seas.
64. Thereon I made my moan,
65. And after kissed a stone,
66. And after that arranged it in a song
67. Seeing that I, ignorant for So long,
68. Had been rewarded thus
69. In Cormac's ruined house.

70. MICHAEL ROBARTES AND THE DANCER

71. He. Opinion is not worth a rush;
72. In this altar-piece the knight,
73. Who grips his long spear so to push
74. That dragon through the fading light,
75. Loved the lady; and it's plain
76. The half-dead dragon was her thought,
77. That every morning rose again
78. And dug its claws and shrieked and fought.
79. Could the impossible come to pass
80. She would have time to turn her eyes,
81. Her lover thought, upon the glass
82. And on the instant would grow wise.
83. She. You mean they argued.
84. He. Put it so;
85. But bear in mind your lover's wage
86. Is what your looking-glass can show,
87. And that he will turn green with rage
88. At all that is not pictured there.
89. She. May I not put myself to college?
90. He. Go pluck Athene by the hair;
91. For what mere book can grant a knowledge
92. With an impassioned gravity
93. Appropriate to that beating breast,
94. That vigorous thigh, that dreaming eye?
95. And may the Devil take the rest.
96. She. And must no beautiful woman be
97. Learned like a man?
98. He. Paul Veronese
99. And all his sacred company
100. Imagined bodies all their days
101. By the lagoon you love so much,
102. For proud, soft, ceremonious proof
103. That all must come to sight and touch;
104. While Michael Angelo's Sistine roof,
105. His 'Morning' and his 'Night' disclose
106. How sinew that has been pulled tight,
107. Or it may be loosened in repose,
108. Can rule by supernatural right
109. Yet be but sinew.
110. She. I have heard said
111. There is great danger in the body.
112. He. Did God in portioning wine and bread
113. Give man His thought or His mere body?
114. She. My wretched dragon is perplexed.
115. Hec. I have principles to prove me right.
116. It follows from this Latin text
117. That blest souls are not composite,
118. And that all beautiful women may
119. Live in uncomposite blessedness,
120. And lead us to the like -- if they
121. Will banish every thought, unless
122. The lineaments that please their view
123. When the long looking-glass is full,
124. Even from the foot-sole think it too.
125. She. They say such different things at school.
