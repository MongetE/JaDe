1. I THOUGHT of your beauty, and this arrow,
2. Made out of a wild thought, is in my marrow.
3. There's no man may look upon her, no man,
4. As when newly grown to be a woman,
5. Tall and noble but with face and bosom
6. Delicate in colour as apple blossom.
7. This beauty's kinder, yet for a reason
8. I could weep that the old is out of season.
