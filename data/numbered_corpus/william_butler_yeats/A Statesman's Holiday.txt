1. I lived among great houses,
2. Riches drove out rank,
3. Base drove out the better blood,
4. And mind and body shrank.
5. No Oscar ruled the table,
6. But I'd a troop of friends
7. That knowing better talk had gone
8. Talked of odds and ends.
9. Some knew what ailed the world
10. But never said a thing,
11. So I have picked a better trade
12. And night and morning sing:
13. Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.
14. Am I a great Lord Chancellor
15. That slept upon the Sack?
16. Commanding officer that tore
17. The khaki from his back?
18. Or am I de Valera,
19. Or the King of Greece,
20. Or the man that made the motors?
21. Ach, call me what you please!
22. Here's a Montenegrin lute,
23. And its old sole string
24. Makes me sweet music
25. And I delight to sing:
26. Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.
27. With boys and girls about him.
28. With any sort of clothes,
29. With a hat out of fashion,
30. With Old patched shoes,
31. With a ragged bandit cloak,
32. With an eye like a hawk,
33. With a stiff straight back,
34. With a strutting turkey walk.
35. With a bag full of pennies,
36. With a monkey on a chain,
37. With a great cock's feather,
38. With an old foul tune.
39. Tall dames go walking in grass-green Avalon.
