1. PYTHAGORAS planned it.  Why did the people stare?
2. His numbers, though they moved or seemed to move
3. In marble or in bronze, lacked character.
4. But boys and girls, pale from the imagined love
5. Of solitary beds, knew what they were,
6. That passion could bring character enough,
7. And pressed at midnight in some public place
8. Live lips upon a plummet-measured face.
9. No! Greater than Pythagoras, for the men
10. That with a mallet or a chisel' modelled these
11. Calculations that look but casual flesh, put down
12. All Asiatic vague immensities,
13. And not the banks of oars that swam upon
14. The many-headed foam at Salamis.
15. Europe put off that foam when Phidias
16. Gave women dreams and dreams their looking-glass.
17. One image crossed the many-headed, sat
18. Under the tropic shade, grew round and slow,
19. No Hamlet thin from eating flies, a fat
20. Dreamer of the Middle Ages.  Empty eyeballs knew
21. That knowledge increases unreality, that
22. Mirror on mirror mirrored is all the show.
23. When gong and conch declare the hour to bless
24. Grimalkin crawls to Buddha's emptiness.
25. When Pearse summoned Cuchulain to his side.
26. What stalked through the post Office? What intellect,
27. What calculation, number, measurement, replied?
28. We Irish, born into that ancient sect
29. But thrown upon this filthy modern tide
30. And by its formless spawning fury wrecked,
31. Climb to our proper dark, that we may trace
32. The lineaments of a plummet-measured face.
