1. As I came over Windy Gap
2. They threw a halfpenny into my cap.
3. For I am running to paradise;
4. And all that I need do is to wish
5. And somebody puts his hand in the dish
6. To throw me a bit of salted fish:
7. And there the king is but as the beggar.
8. My brother Mourteen is worn out
9. With skelping his big brawling lout,
10. And I am running to paradise;
11. A poor life, do what he can,
12. And though he keep a dog and a gun,
13. A serving-maid and a serving-man:
14. And there the king is but as the beggar.
15. Poor men have grown to be rich men,
16. And rich men grown to be poor again,
17. And I am running to paradise;
18. And many a darling wit's grown dull
19. That tossed a bare heel when at school,
20. Now it has filled a old sock full:
21. And there the king is but as the beggar.
22. The wind is old and still at play
23. While I must hurty upon my way.
24. For I am running to paradise;
25. Yet never have I lit on a friend
26. To take my fancy like the wind
27. That nobody can buy or bind:
28. And there the king is but as the beggar.
