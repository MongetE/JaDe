1. Man

2. IN a cleft that's christened Alt
3. Under broken stone I halt
4. At the bottom of a pit
5. That broad noon has never lit,
6. And shout a secret to the stone.
7. All that I have said and done,
8. Now that I am old and ill,
9. Turns into a question till
10. I lie awake night after night
11. And never get the answers right.
12. Did that play of mine send out
13. Certain men the English shot?
14. Did words of mine put too great strain
15. On that woman's reeling brain?
16. Could my spoken words have checked
17. That whereby a house lay wrecked?
18. And all seems evil until I
19. Sleepless would lie down and die.

20. Echo

21. Lie down and die.

22. Man

23. That were to shirk
24. The spiritual intellect's great work,
25. And shirk it in vain.  There is no release
26. In a bodkin or disease,
27. Nor can there be work so great
28. As that which cleans man's dirty slate.
29. While man can still his body keep
30. Wine or love drug him to sleep,
31. Waking he thanks the Lord that he
32. Has body and its stupidity,
33. But body gone he sleeps no more,
34. And till his intellect grows sure
35. That all's arranged in one clear view,
36. pursues the thoughts that I pursue,
37. Then stands in judgment on his soul,
38. And, all work done, dismisses all
39. Out of intellect and sight
40. And sinks at last into the night.

41. Echo
42. Into the night.

43. Man

44. O Rocky Voice,
45. Shall we in that great night rejoice?
46. What do we know but that we face
47. One another in this place?
48. But hush, for I have lost the theme,
49. Its joy or night-seem but a dream;
50. Up there some hawk or owl has struck,
51. Dropping out of sky or rock,
52. A stricken rabbit is crying out,
53. And its cry distracts my thought.
