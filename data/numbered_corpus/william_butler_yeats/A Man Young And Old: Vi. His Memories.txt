1. We should be hidden from their eyes,
2. Being but holy shows
3. And bodies broken like a thorn
4. Whereon the bleak north blows,
5. To think of buried Hector
6. And that none living knows.

7. The women take so little stock
8. In what I do or say
9. They'd sooner leave their cosseting
10. To hear a jackass bray;
11. My arms are like the twisted thorn
12. And yet there beauty lay;

13. The first of all the tribe lay there
14. And did such pleasure take -
15. She who had brought great Hector down
16. And put all Troy to wreck -
17. That she cried into this ear,
18. 'Strike me if I shriek.'
