1. I did the dragon's will until you came
2. Because I had fancied love a casual
3. Improvisation, or a settled game
4. That followed if I let the kerchief fall:
5. Those deeds were best that gave the minute wings
6. And heavenly music if they gave it wit;
7. And then you stood among the dragon-rings.
8. I mocked, being crazy, but you mastered it
9. And broke the chain and set my ankles free,
10. Saint George or else a pagan Perseus;
11. And now we stare astonished at the sea,
12. And a miraculous strange bird shrieks at us.
