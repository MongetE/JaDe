1. Now that we're almost settled in our house
2. I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us
3. Beside a fire of turf in th' ancient tower,
4. And having talked to some late hour
5. Climb up the narrow winding stairs to bed:
6. Discoverers of forgotten truth
7. Or mere companions of my youth,
8. All, all are in my thoughts to-night being dead.

9. Always we'd have the new friend meet the old
10. And we are hurt if either friend seem cold,
11. And there is salt to lengthen out the smart
12. In the affections of our heart,
13. And quarrels are blown up upon that head;
14. But not a friend that I would bring
15. This night can set us quarrelling,
16. For all that come into my mind are dead.

17. Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind,
18. That loved his learning better than mankind.
19. Though courteous to the worst; much falling he
20. Brooded upon sanctity
21. Till all his Greek and Latin learning seemed
22. A long blast upon the horn that brought
23. A little nearer to his thought
24. A measureless consummation that he dreamed.

25. And that enquiring man John Synge comes next,
26. That dying chose the living world for text
27. And never could have rested in the tomb
28. But that, long travelling, he had come
29. Towards nightfall upon certain set apart
30. In a most desolate stony place,
31. Towards nightfall upon a race
32. Passionate and simple like his heart.

33. And then I think of old George Pollexfen,
34. In muscular youth well known to Mayo men
35. For horsemanship at meets or at racecourses,
36. That could have shown how pure-bred horses
37. And solid men, for all their passion, live
38. But as the outrageous stars incline
39. By opposition, square and trine;
40. Having grown sluggish and contemplative.

41. They were my close companions many a year.
42. A portion of my mind and life, as it were,
43. And now their breathless faces seem to look
44. Out of some old picture-book;
45. I am accustomed to their lack of breath,
46. But not that my dear friend's dear son,
47. Our Sidney and our perfect man,
48. Could share in that discourtesy of death.

49. For all things the delighted eye now sees
50. Were loved by him: the old storm-broken trees
51. That cast their shadows upon road and bridge;
52. The tower set on the stream's edge;
53. The ford where drinking cattle make a stir
54. Nightly, and startled by that sound
55. The water-hen must change her ground;
56. He might have been your heartiest welcomer.

57. When with the Galway foxhounds he would ride
58. From Castle Taylor to the Roxborough side
59. Or Esserkelly plain, few kept his pace;
60. At Mooneen he had leaped a place
61. So perilous that half the astonished meet
62. Had shut their eyes; and where was it
63. He rode a race without a bit?
64. And yet his mind outran the horses' feet.

65. We dreamed that a great painter had been born
66. To cold Clare rock and Galway rock and thorn,
67. To that stern colour and that delicate line
68. That are our secret discipline
69. Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might.
70. Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
71. And yet he had the intensity
72. To have published all to be a world's delight.

73. What other could so well have counselled us
74. In all lovely intricacies of a house
75. As he that practised or that understood
76. All work in metal or in wood,
77. In moulded plaster or in carven stone?
78. Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
79. And all he did done perfectly
80. As though he had but that one trade alone.

81. Some burn damp faggots, others may consume
82. The entire combustible world in one small room
83. As though dried straw, and if we turn about
84. The bare chimney is gone black out
85. Because the work had finished in that flare.
86. Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,
87. As 'twere all life's epitome.
88. What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?

89. I had thought, seeing how bitter is that wind
90. That shakes the shutter, to have brought to mind
91. All those that manhood tried, or childhood loved
92. Or boyish intellect approved,
93. With some appropriatc commentary on each;
94. Until imagination brought
95. A fitter welcome; but a thought
96. Of that late death took all my heart for speech.
