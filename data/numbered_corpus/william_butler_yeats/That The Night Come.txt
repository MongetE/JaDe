1. SHE lived in storm and strife,
2. Her soul had such desire
3. For what proud death may bring
4. That it could not endure
5. The common good of life,
6. But lived as 'twere a king
7. That packed his marriage day
8. With banneret and pennon,
9. Trumpet and kettledrum,
10. And the outrageous cannon,
11. To bundle time away
12. That the night come.
