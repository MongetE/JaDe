1. THE Roaring Tinker if you like,
2. But Mannion is my name,
3. And I beat up the common sort
4. And think it is no shame.
5. The common breeds the common,
6. A lout begets a lout,
7. So when I take on half a score
8. I knock their heads about.
9. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
10. All Mannions come from Manannan,
11. Though rich on every shore
12. He never lay behind four walls
13. He had such character,
14. Nor ever made an iron red
15. Nor soldered pot or pan;
16. His roaring and his ranting
17. Best please a wandering man.
18. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
19. Could Crazy Jane put off old age
20. And ranting time renew,
21. Could that old god rise up again
22. We'd drink a can or two,
23. And out and lay our leadership
24. On country and on town,
25. Throw likely couples into bed
26. And knock the others down.
27. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
28. II
29. My name is Henry Middleton,
30. I have a small demesne,
31. A small forgotten house that's set
32. On a storm-bitten green.
33. I scrub its floors and make my bed,
34. I cook and change my plate,
35. The post and garden-boy alone
36. Have keys to my old gate.
37. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
38. Though I have locked my gate on them,
39. I pity all the young,
40. I know what devil's trade they learn
41. From those they live among,
42. Their drink, their pitch-and-toss by day,
43. Their robbery by night;
44. The wisdom of the people's gone,
45. How can the young go straight?
46. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
47. When every Sunday afternoon
48. On the Green Lands I walk
49. And wear a coat in fashion.
50. Memories of the talk
51. Of henwives and of queer old men
52. Brace me and make me strong;
53. There's not a pilot on the perch
54. Knows I have lived so long.
55. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
56. III
57. Come gather round me, players all:
58. Come praise Nineteen-Sixteen,
59. Those from the pit and gallery
60. Or from the painted scene
61. That fought in the Post Office
62. Or round the City Hall,
63. praise every man that came again,
64. Praise every man that fell.
65. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
66. Who was the first man shot that day?
67. The player Connolly,
68. Close to the City Hall he died;
69. Catriage and voice had he;
70. He lacked those years that go with skill,
71. But later might have been
72. A famous, a brilliant figure
73. Before the painted scene.
74. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
75. Some had no thought of victory
76. But had gone out to die
77. That Ireland's mind be greater,
78. Her heart mount up on high;
79. And yet who knows what's yet to come?
80. For patrick pearse had said
81. That in every generation
82. Must Ireland's blood be shed.
83. From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.
