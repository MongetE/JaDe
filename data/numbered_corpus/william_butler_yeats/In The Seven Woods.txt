1. I HAVE heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods
2. Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees
3. Hum in the lime-tree flowers; and put away
4. The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness
5. That empty the heart.  I have forgot awhile
6. Tara uprooted, and new commonness
7. Upon the throne and crying about the streets
8. And hanging its paper flowers from post to post,
9. Because it is alone of all things happy.
10. I am contented, for I know that Quiet
11. Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart
12. Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer,
13. Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs
14. A cloudy quiver over Pairc-na-lee.
