1. MAY God be praised for woman
2. That gives up all her mind,
3. A man may find in no man
4. A friendship of her kind
5. That covers all he has brought
6. As with her flesh and bone,
7. Nor quarrels with a thought
8. Because it is not her own.
9. Though pedantry denies,
10. It's plain the Bible means
11. That Solomon grew wise
12. While talking with his queens.
13. Yet never could, although
14. They say he counted grass,
15. Count all the praises due
16. When Sheba was his lass,
17. When she the iron wrought, or
18. When from the smithy fire
19. It shuddered in the water:
20. Harshness of their desire
21. That made them stretch and yawn,
22. pleasure that comes with sleep,
23. Shudder that made them one.
24. What else He give or keep
25. God grant me -- no, not here,
26. For I am not so bold
27. To hope a thing so dear
28. Now I am growing old,
29. But when, if the tale's true,
30. The Pestle of the moon
31. That pounds up all anew
32. Brings me to birth again --
33. To find what once I had
34. And know what once I have known,
35. Until I am driven mad,
36. Sleep driven from my bed.
37. By tenderness and care.
38. pity, an aching head,
39. Gnashing of teeth, despair;
40. And all because of some one
41. perverse creature of chance,
42. And live like Solomon
43. That Sheba led a dance.
