1. IF Michael, leader of God's host
2. When Heaven and Hell are met,
3. Looked down on you from Heaven's door-post
4. He would his deeds forget.
5. Brooding no more upon God's wars
6. In his divine homestead,
7. He would go weave out of the stars
8. A chaplet for your head.
9. And all folk seeing him bow down,
10. And white stars tell your praise,
11. Would come at last to God's great town,
12. Led on by gentle ways;
13. And God would bid His warfare cease,
14. Saying all things were well;
15. And softly make a rosy peace,
16. A peace of Heaven with Hell.
