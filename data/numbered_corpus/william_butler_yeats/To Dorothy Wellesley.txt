1. STRETCH towards the moonless midnight of the trees,
2. As though that hand could reach to where they stand,
3. And they but famous old upholsteries
4. Delightful to the touch; tighten that hand
5. As though to draw them closer yet.
6. Rammed full
7. Of that most sensuous silence of the night
8. (For since the horizon's bought strange dogs are still)
9. Climb to your chamber full of books and wait,
10. No books upon the knee, and no one there
11. But a Great Dane that cannot bay the moon
12. And now lies sunk in sleep.
13. What climbs the stair?
14. Nothing that common women ponder on
15. If you are worrh my hope! Neither Content
16. Nor satisfied Conscience, but that great family
17. Some ancient famous authors mistepresent,
18. The proud Furies each with her torch on high.
