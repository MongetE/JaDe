1. COME gather round me, Parnellites,
2. And praise our chosen man;
3. Stand upright on your legs awhile,
4. Stand upright while you can,
5. For soon we lie where he is laid,
6. And he is underground;
7. Come fill up all those glasses
8. And pass the bottle round.

9. And here's a cogent reason,
10. And I have many more,
11. He fought the might of England
12. And saved the Irish poor,
13. Whatever good a farmer's got
14. He brought it all to pass;
15. And here's another reason,
16. That parnell loved a lass.

17. And here's a final reason,
18. He was of such a kind
19. Every man that sings a song
20. Keeps Parnell in his mind.
21. For Parnell was a proud man,
22. No prouder trod the ground,
23. And a proud man's a lovely man,
24. So pass the bottle round.

25. The Bishops and the party
26. That tragic story made,
27. A husband that had sold hiS wife
28. And after that betrayed;
29. But stories that live longest
30. Are sung above the glass,
31. And Parnell loved his countrey
32. And parnell loved his lass.
