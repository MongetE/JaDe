1. I found that ivory image there
2. Dancing with her chosen youth,
3. But when he wound her coal-black hair
4. As though to strangle her, no scream
5. Or bodily movement did I dare,
6. Eyes under eyelids did so gleam;
7. Love is like the lion's tooth.
8. When She, and though some said she played
9. I said that she had danced heart's truth,
10. Drew a knife to strike him dead,
11. I could but leave him to his fate;
12. For no matter what is said
13. They had all that had their hate;
14. Love is like the lion's tooth.
15. Did he die or did she die?
16. Seemed to die or died they both?
17. God be with the times when I
18. Cared not a thraneen for what chanced
19. So that I had the limbs to try
20. Such a dance as there was danced -
21. Love is like the lion's tooth.
