1. IF you have revisited the town, thin Shade,
2. Whether to look upon your monument
3. (I wonder if the builder has been paid)
4. Or happier-thoughted when the day is spent
5. To drink of that salt breath out of the sea
6. When grey gulls flit about instead of men,
7. And the gaunt houses put on majesty:
8. Let these content you and be gone again;
9. For they are at their old tricks yet.
10. A man
11. Of your own passionate serving kind who had brought
12. In his full hands what, had they only known,
13. Had given their children's children loftier thought,
14. Sweeter emotion, working in their veins
15. Like gentle blood, has been driven from the place,
16. And instilt heaped upon him for his pains,
17. And for his open-handedness, disgrace;
18. Your enemy, an old fotil mouth, had set
19. The pack upon him.
20. Go, unquiet wanderer,
21. And gather the Glasnevin coverlet
22. About your head till the dust stops your ear,
23. The time for you to taste of that Salt breath
24. And listen at the corners has not come;
25. You had enough of sorrow before death --
26. Away, away! You are safer in the tomb.
