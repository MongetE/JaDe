1. WOULD I could cast a sad on the water
2. Where many a king has gone
3. And many a king's daughter,
4. And alight at the comely trees and the lawn,
5. The playing upon pipes and the dancing,
6. And learn that the best thing is
7. To change my loves while dancing
8. And pay but a kiss for a kiss.
9. I would find by the edge of that water
10. The collar-bone of a hare
11. Worn thin by the lapping of water,
12. And pierce it through with a gimlet, and stare
13. At the old bitter world where they marry in churches,
14. And laugh over the untroubled water
15. At all who marry in churches,
16. Through the white thin bone of a hare.
