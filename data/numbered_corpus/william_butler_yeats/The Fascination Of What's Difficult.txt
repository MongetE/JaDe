1. THE fascination of what's difficult
2. Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent
3. Spontaneous joy and natural content
4. Out of my heart.  There's something ails our colt
5. That must, as if it had not holy blood
6. Nor on Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,
7. Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt
8. As though it dragged road-metal.  My curse on plays
9. That have to be set up in fifty ways,
10. On the day's war with every knave and dolt,
11. Theatre business, management of men.
12. I swear before the dawn comes round again
13. I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt.
