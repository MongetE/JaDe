1. I AM worn out with dreams;
2. A weather-worn, marble triton
3. Among the streams;
4. And all day long I look
5. Upon this lady's beauty
6. As though I had found in a book
7. A pictured beauty,
8. pleased to have filled the eyes
9. Or the discerning ears,
10. Delighted to be but wise,
11. For men improve with the years;
12. And yet, and yet,
13. Is this my dream, or the truth?
14. O would that we had met
15. When I had my burning youth!
16. But I grow old among dreams,
17. A weather-worn, marble triton
18. Among the streams.
