1. I WOULD be ignorant as the dawn
2. That has looked down
3. On that old queen measuring a town
4. With the pin of a brooch,
5. Or on the withered men that saw
6. From their pedantic Babylon
7. The careless planets in their courses,
8. The stars fade out where the moon comes.
9. And took their tablets and did sums;
10. I would be ignorant as the dawn
11. That merely stood, rocking the glittering coach
12. Above the cloudy shoulders of the horses;
13. I would be -- for no knowledge is worth a straw --
14. Ignorant and wanton as the dawn.
