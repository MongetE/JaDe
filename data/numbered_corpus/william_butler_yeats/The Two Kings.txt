1. KING EOCHAID came at sundown to a wood
2. Westward of Tara.  Hurrying to his queen
3. He had outridden his war-wasted men
4. That with empounded cattle trod the mire,
5. And where beech-trees had mixed a pale green light
6. With the ground-ivy's blue, he saw a stag
7. Whiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.
8. Because it stood upon his path and seemed
9. More hands in height than any stag in the world
10. He sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth
11. Upon his trembling horse, then drove the spur;
12. But the stag stooped and ran at him, and passed,
13. Rending the horse's flank.  King Eochaid reeled,
14. Then drew his sword to hold its levelled point
15. Against the stag.  When horn and steel were met
16. The horn resounded as though it had been silver,
17. A sweet, miraculous, terrifying sound.
18. Horn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there
19. As though a stag and unicorn were met
20. Among the African Mountains of the Moon,
21. Until at last the double horns, drawn backward,
22. Butted below the single and so pierced
23. The entrails of the horse.  Dropping his sword
24. King Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands
25. And stared into the sea-green eye, and so
26. Hither and thither to and fro they trod
27. Till all the place was beaten into mire.
28. The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met,
29. The hands that gathered up the might of the world,
30. And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed
31. Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air.
32. Through bush they plunged and over ivied root,
33. And where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves
34. A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;
35. But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks
36. Against a beech-bole, he threw down the beast
37. And knelt above it with drawn knife.  On the instant
38. It vanished like a shadow, and a cry
39. So mournful that it seemed the cry of one
40. Who had lost some unimaginable treasure
41. Wandered between the blue and the green leaf
42. And climbed into the air, crumbling away,
43. Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision
44. But for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,
45. The disembowelled horse.
46. King Eochaid ran
47. Toward peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath
48. Until he came before the painted wall,
49. The posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,
50. Of the great door; but though the hanging lamps
51. Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows,
52. Nor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,
53. Nor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound
54. From well-side or from plough-land, was there noisc;
55. Nor had there been the noise of living thing
56. Before him or behind, but that far off
57. On the horizon edge bellowed the herds.
58. Knowing that silence brings no good to kings,
59. And mocks returning victory, he passed
60. Between the pillars with a beating heart
61. And saw where in the midst of the great hall
62. pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain
63. Sat upright with a sword before her feet.
64. Her hands on either side had gripped the bench.
65. Her eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.
66. Some passion had made her stone.  Hearing a foot
67. She started and then knew whose foot it was;
68. But when he thought to take her in his arms
69. She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:
70. 'I have sent among the fields or to the woods
71. The fighting-men and servants of this house,
72. For I would have your judgment upon one
73. Who is self-accused.  If she be innocent
74. She would not look in any known man's face
75. Till judgment has been given, and if guilty,
76. Would never look again on known man's face.'
77. And at these words hc paled, as she had paled,
78. Knowing that he should find upon her lips
79. The meaning of that monstrous day.
80. Then she:
81. 'You brought me where your brother Ardan sat
82. Always in his one seat, and bid me care him
83. Through that strange illness that had fixed him there.
84. And should he die to heap his burial-mound
85. And catve his name in Ogham.' Eochaid said,
86. 'He lives?' 'He lives and is a healthy man.'
87. 'While I have him and you it matters little
88. What man you have lost, what evil you have found.'
89. 'I bid them make his bed under this roof
90. And carried him his food with my own hands,
91. And so the weeks passed by.  But when I said,
92. ''What is this trouble?'' he would answer nothing,
93. Though always at my words his trouble grew;
94. And I but asked the more, till he cried out,
95. Weary of many questions:  ''There are things
96. That make the heart akin to the dumb stone.''
97. Then I replied, ''Although you hide a secret,
98. Hopeless and dear, or terrible to think on,
99. Speak it, that I may send through the wide world
100. Day after day you question me, and I,
101. Because there is such a storm amid my thoughts
102. I shall be carried in the gust, command,
103. Forbid, beseech and waste my breath.'' Then I:
104. Although the thing that you have hid were evil,
105. The speaking of it could be no great wrong,
106. And evil must it be, if done 'twere worse
107. Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in,
108. And loosen on us dreams that waste our life,
109. Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain.''
110. but finding him still silent I stooped down
111. And whispering that none but he should hear,
112. Said, ''If a woman has put this on you,
113. My men, whether it please her or displease,
114. And though they have to cross the Loughlan waters
115. And take her in the middle of armed men,
116. Shall make her look upon her handiwork,
117. That she may quench the rick she has fired; and though
118. She may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,
119. She'II not be proud, knowing within her heart
120. That our sufficient portion of the world
121. Is that we give, although it be brief giving,
122. Happiness to children and to men.''
123. Then he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,
124. And speaking what he would not though he would,
125. Sighed, ''You, even you yourself, could work the cure!''
126. And at those words I rose and I went out
127. And for nine days he had food from other hands,
128. And for nine days my mind went whirling round
129. The one disastrous zodiac, muttering
130. That the immedicable mound's beyond
131. Our questioning, beyond our pity even.
132. But when nine days had gone I stood again
133. Before his chair and bending down my head
134. I bade him go when all his household slept
135. To an old empty woodman's house that's hidden
136. Westward of Tara, among the hazel-trees --
137. For hope would give his limbs the power -- and await
138. A friend that could, he had told her, work his cure
139. And would be no harsh friend.
140. When night had deepened,
141. I groped my way from beech to hazel wood,
142. Found that old house, a sputtering torch within,
143. And stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins
144. Ardan, and though I called to him and tried
145. To Shake him out of sleep, I could not rouse him.
146. I waited till the night was on the turn,
147. Then fearing that some labourer, on his way
148. To plough or pasture-land, might see me there,
149. Went out.
150. Among the ivy-covered rocks,
151. As on the blue light of a sword, a man
152. Who had unnatural majesty, and eyes
153. Like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,
154. Stood on my path.  Trembling from head to foot
155. I gazed at him like grouse upon a kite;
156. But with a voice that had unnatural music,
157. ''A weary wooing and a long,'' he said,
158. ''Speaking of love through other lips and looking
159. Under the eyelids of another, for it was my craft
160. That put a passion in the sleeper there,
161. And when I had got my will and drawn you here,
162. Where I may speak to you alone, my craft
163. Sucked up the passion out of him again
164. And left mere sleep.  He'll wake when the sun wakes,
165. push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes,
166. And wonder what has ailed him these twelve months.''
167. I cowered back upon the wall in terror,
168. But that sweet-sounding voice ran on:  ''Woman,
169. I was your husband when you rode the air,
170. Danced in the whirling foam and in the dust,
171. In days you have not kept in memory,
172. Being betrayed into a cradle, and I come
173. That I may claim you as my wife again.''
174. I was no longer terrified -- his voice
175. Had half awakened some old memory --
176. Yet answered him, ''I am King Eochaid's wife
177. And with him have found every happiness
178. Women can find.'' With a most masterful voice,
179. That made the body seem as it were a string
180. Under a bow, he cried, ''What happiness
181. Can lovers have that know their happiness
182. Must end at the dumb stone? But where we build
183. Our sudden palaces in the still air
184. pleasure itself can bring no weariness.
185. Nor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot
186. That has grown weary of the wandering dance,
187. Nor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,
188. Among those mouths that sing their sweethearts' praise,
189. Your empty bed.'' ''How should I love,'' I answered,
190. ''Were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed
191. And shown my husband sleeping there, I have sighcd,
192. 'Your strength and nobleness will pass away'?
193. Or how should love be worth its pains were it not
194. That when he has fallen asleep within my atms,
195. Being wearied out, I love in man the child?
196. What can they know of love that do not know
197. She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge
198. Above a windy precipice?'' Then he:
199. ''Seeing that when you come to the deathbed
200. You must return, whether you would or no,
201. This human life blotted from memory,
202. Why must I live some thirty, forty years,
203. Alone with all this useless happiness?''
204. Thereon he seized me in his arms, but I
205. Thrust him away with both my hands and cried,
206. ''Never will I believe there is any change
207. Can blot out of my memory this life
208. Sweetened by death, but if I could believe,
209. That were a double hunger in my lips
210. For what is doubly brief.''
211. And now the shape
212. My hands were pressed to vanished suddenly.
213. I staggered, but a beech-tree stayed my fall,
214. And clinging to it I could hear the cocks
215. Crow upon Tara.'
216. King Eochaid bowed his head
217. And thanked her for her kindness to his brother,
218. For that she promised, and for that refused.
219. Thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds
220. Rose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed door
221. Jostled and shouted those war-wasted men,
222. And in the midst King Eochaid's brother stood,
223. And bade all welcome, being ignorant.
