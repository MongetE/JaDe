1. I HEAR the Shadowy Horses, their long manes a-shake,
2. Their hoofs heavy with tumult, their eyes glimmering white;
3. The North unfolds above them clinging, creeping night,
4. The East her hidden joy before the morning break,
5. The West weeps in pale dew and sighs passing away,
6. The South is pouring down roses of crimson fire:
7. O vanity of Sleep, Hope, Dream, endless Desire,
8. The Horses of Disaster plunge in the heavy clay:
9. Beloved, let your eyes half close, and your heart beat
10. Over my heart, and your hair fall over my breast,
11. Drowning love's lonely hour in deep twilight of rest,
12. And hiding their tossing manes and their tumultuous feet.
