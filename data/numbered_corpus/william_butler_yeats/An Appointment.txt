1. BEING out of heart with government
2. I took a broken root to fling
3. Where the proud, wayward squirrel went,
4. Taking delight that he could spring;
5. And he, with that low whinnying sound
6. That is like laughter, sprang again
7. And so to the other tree at a bound.
8. Nor the tame will, nor timid brain,
9. Nor heavy knitting of the brow
10. Bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb
11. And threw him up to laugh on the bough;
12. No govermnent appointed him.
