1. A STATESMAN is an easy man,
2. He tells his lies by rote;
3. A journalist makes up his lies
4. And takes you by the throat;
5. So stay at home' and drink your beer
6. And let the neighbours' vote,

7. Said the man in the golden breastplate
8. Under the old stone Cross.
9. Because this age and the next age
10. Engender in the ditch,
11. No man can know a happy man
12. From any passing wretch;
13. If Folly link with Elegance
14. No man knows which is which,

15. Said the man in the golden breastplate
16. Under the old stone Cross.
17. But actors lacking music
18. Do most excite my spleen,
19. They say it is more human
20. To shuffle, grunt and groan,
21. Not knowing what unearthly stuff
22. Rounds a mighty scene,

23. Said the man in the golden breastplate
24. Under the old stone Cross.
