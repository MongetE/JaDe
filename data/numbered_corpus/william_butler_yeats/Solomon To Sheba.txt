1. SANG Solomon to Sheba,
2. And kissed her dusky face,
3. 'All day long from mid-day
4. We have talked in the one place,
5. All day long from shadowless noon
6. We have gone round and round
7. In the narrow theme of love
8. Like a old horse in a pound.-
9. To Solomon sang Sheba,
10. Plated on his knees,
11. 'If you had broached a matter
12. That might the learned please,
13. You had before the sun had thrown
14. Our shadows on the ground
15. Discovered that my thoughts, not it,
16. Are but a narrow pound.'
17. Said Solomon to Sheba,
18. And kissed her Arab eyes,
19. 'There's not a man or woman
20. Born under the skies
21. Dare match in learning with us two,
22. And all day long we have found
23. There's not a thing but love can make
24. The world a narrow pound.'
