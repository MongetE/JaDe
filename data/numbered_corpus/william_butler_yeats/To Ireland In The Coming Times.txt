1. Know, that I would accounted be
2. True brother of a company
3. That sang, to sweeten Ireland's wrong,
4. Ballad and story, rann and song;
5. Nor be I any less of them,
6. Because the red-rose-bordered hem
7. Of her, whose history began
8. Before God made the angelic clan,
9. Trails all about the written page.
10. When Time began to rant and rage
11. The measure of her flying feet
12. Made Ireland's heart hegin to beat;
13. And Time bade all his candles flare
14. To light a measure here and there;
15. And may the thoughts of Ireland brood
16. Upon a measured guietude.
17. Nor may I less be counted one
18. With Davis, Mangan, Ferguson,
19. Because, to him who ponders well,
20. My rhymes more than their rhyming tell
21. Of things discovered in the deep,
22. Where only body's laid asleep.
23. For the elemental creatures go
24. About my table to and fro,
25. That hurry from unmeasured mind
26. To rant and rage in flood and wind,
27. Yet he who treads in measured ways
28. May surely barter gaze for gaze.
29. Man ever journeys on with them
30. After the red-rose-bordered hem.Ah, faerics, dancing under the moon,
31. A Druid land, a Druid tune.!
32. While stiIl I may, I write for you
33. The love I lived, the dream I knew.
34. From our birthday, until we die,
35. Is but the winking of an eye;
36. And we, our singing and our love,
37. What measurer Time has lit above,
38. And all benighted things that go
39. About my table to and fro,
40. Are passing on to where may be,
41. In truth's consuming ecstasy,
42. No place for love and dream at all;
43. For God goes by with white footfall.
44. I cast my heart into my rhymes,
45. That you, in the dim coming times,
46. May know how my heart went with them
47. After the red-rose-bordered hem.
