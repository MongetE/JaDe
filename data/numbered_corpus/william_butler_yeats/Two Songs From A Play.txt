1. I

2. I saw a staring virgin stand
3. Where holy Dionysus died,
4. And tear the heart out of his side.
5. And lay the heart upon her hand
6. And bear that beating heart away;
7. Of Magnus Annus at the spring,
8. As though God's death were but a play.

9. Another Troy must rise and set,
10. Another lineage feed the crow,
11. Another Argo's painted prow
12. Drive to a flashier bauble yet.
13. The Roman Empire stood appalled:
14. It dropped the reins of peace and war
15. When that fierce virgin and her Star
16. Out of the fabulous darkness called.

17. II

18. In pity for man's darkening thought
19. He walked that room and issued thence
20. In Galilean turbulence;
21. The Babylonian starlight brought
22. A fabulous, formless darkness in;
23. Odour of blood when Christ was slain
24. Made all platonic tolerance vain
25. And vain all Doric discipline.

26. Everything that man esteems
27. Endures a moment or a day.
28. Love's pleasure drives his love away,
29. The painter's brush consumes his dreams;
30. The herald's cry, the soldier's tread
31. Exhaust his glory and his might:
32. Whatever flames upon the night
33. Man's own resinous heart has fed.
