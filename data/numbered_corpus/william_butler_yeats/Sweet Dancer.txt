1. THE girl goes dancing there
2. On the leaf-sown, new-mown, smooth
3. Grass plot of the garden;
4. Escaped from bitter youth,
5. Escaped out of her crowd,
6. Or out of her black cloud.
7. Ah, dancer, ah, sweet dancer.!
8. If strange men come from the house
9. To lead her away, do not say
10. That she is happy being crazy;
11. Lead them gently astray;
12. Let her finish her dance,
13. Let her finish her dance.
14. Ah, dancer, ah, sweet dancer.!
