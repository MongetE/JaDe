1. I FASTED for some forty days on bread and buttermilk,
2. For passing round the bottle with girls in rags or silk,
3. In country shawl or Paris cloak, had put my wits astray,
4. And what's the good of women, for all that they can say
5. Is fol de rol de rolly O.
6. Round Lough Derg's holy island I went upon the stones,
7. I prayed at all the Stations upon my matrow-bones,
8. And there I found an old man, and though, I prayed all day
9. And that old man beside me, nothing would he say
10. But fol de rol de rolly O.

11. All know that all the dead in the world about that place are stuck,
12. And that should mother seek her son she'd have but little luck
13. Because the fires of purgatory have ate their shapes away;
14. I swear to God I questioned them, and all they had to say
15. Was fol de rol de rolly O.
16. A great black ragged bird appeared when I was in the boat;
17. Some twenty feet from tip to tip had it stretched rightly out,
18. With flopping and with flapping it made a great display,
19. But I never stopped to question, what could the boatman say
20. But fol de rol de rolly O.
21. Now I am in the public-house and lean upon the wall,
22. So come in rags or come in silk, in cloak or country shawl,
23. And come with learned lovers or with what men you may,
24. For I can put the whole lot down, and all I have to say
25. Is fol de rol de rolly O.
