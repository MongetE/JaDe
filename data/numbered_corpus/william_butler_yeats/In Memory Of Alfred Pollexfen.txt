1. FIVE-AND-TWENTY years have gone
2. Since old William pollexfen
3. Laid his strong bones down in death
4. By his wife Elizabeth
5. In the grey stone tomb he made.
6. And after twenty years they laid
7. In that tomb by him and her
8. His son George, the astrologer;
9. And Masons drove from miles away
10. To scatter the Acacia spray
11. Upon a melancholy man
12. Who had ended where his breath began.
13. Many a son and daughter lies
14. Far from the customary skies,
15. The Mall and Eades's grammar school,
16. In London or in Liverpool;
17. But where is laid the sailor John
18. That so many lands had known,
19. Quiet lands or unquiet seas
20. Where the Indians trade or Japanese?
21. He never found his rest ashore,
22. Moping for one voyage more.
23. Where have they laid the sailor John?
24. And yesterday the youngest son,
25. A humorous, unambitious man,
26. Was buried near the astrologer,
27. Yesterday in the tenth year
28. Since he who had been contented long.
29. A nobody in a great throng,
30. Decided he would journey home,
31. Now that his fiftieth year had come,
32. And 'Mr.  Alfred' be again
33. Upon the lips of common men
34. Who carried in their memory
35. His childhood and his family.
36. At all these death-beds women heard
37. A visionary white sea-bird
38. Lamenting that a man should die;
39. And with that cry I have raised my cry.
