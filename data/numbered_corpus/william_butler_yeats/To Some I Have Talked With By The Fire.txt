1. WHILE I wrought out these fitful Danaan rhymes,
2. My heart would brim with dreams about the times
3. When we bent down above the fading coals
4. And talked of the dark folk who live in souls
5. Of passionate men, like bats in the dead trees;
6. And of the wayward twilight companies
7. Who sigh with mingled sorrow and content,
8. Because their blossoming dreams have never bent
9. Under the fruit of evil and of good:
10. And of the embattled flaming multitude
11. Who rise, wing above wing, flame above flame,
12. And, like a storm, cry the Ineffable Name,
13. And with the clashing of their sword-blades make
14. A rapturous music, till the morning break
15. And the white hush end all but the loud beat
16. Of their long wings, the flash of their white feet.
