1. WHEN you and my true lover meet
2. And he plays tunes between your feet.
3. Speak no evil of the soul,
4. Nor think that body is the whole,
5. For I that am his daylight lady
6. Know worse evil of the body;
7. But in honour split his love
8. Till either neither have enough,
9. That I may hear if we should kiss
10. A contrapuntal serpent hiss,
11. You, should hand explore a thigh,
12. All the labouring heavens sigh.
