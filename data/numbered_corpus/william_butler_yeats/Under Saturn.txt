1. DO not because this day I have grown saturnine
2. Imagine that lost love, inseparable from my thought
3. Because I have no other youth, can make me pine;
4. For how should I forget the wisdom that you brought,
5. The comfort that you made? Although my wits have gone
6. On a fantastic ride, my horse's flanks are spurred
7. By childish memories of an old cross Pollexfen,
8. And of a Middleton, whose name you never heard,
9. And of a red-haired Yeats whose looks, although he died
10. Before my time, seem like a vivid memory.
11. You heard that labouring man who had served my people.  He said
12. Upon the open road, near to the Sligo quay --
13. No, no, not said, but cried it out -- 'You have come again,
14. And surely after twenty years it was time to come.'
15. I am thinking of a child's vow sworn in vain
16. Never to leave that valley his fathers called their home.
