1. Chorus. Come praise Colonus' horses, and come praise
2. The wine-dark of the wood's intricacies,
3. The nightingale that deafens daylight there,
4. If daylight ever visit where,
5. Unvisited by tempest or by sun,
6. Immortal ladies tread the ground
7. Dizzy with harmonious sound,
8. Semele's lad a gay companion.
9. And yonder in the gymnasts' garden thrives
10. The self-sown, self-begotten shape that gives
11. Athenian intellect its mastery,
12. Even the grey-leaved olive-tree
13. Miracle-bred out of the living stone;
14. Nor accident of peace nor war
15. Shall wither that old marvel, for
16. The great grey-eyed Athene stareS thereon.
17. Who comes into this countty, and has come
18. Where golden crocus and narcissus bloom,
19. Where the Great Mother, mourning for her daughter
20. And beauty-drunken by the water
21. Glittering among grey-leaved olive-trees,
22. Has plucked a flower and sung her loss;
23. Who finds abounding Cephisus
24. Has found the loveliest spectacle there is.
25. because this country has a pious mind
26. And so remembers that when all mankind
27. But trod the road, or splashed about the shore,
28. Poseidon gave it bit and oar,
29. Every Colonus lad or lass discourses
30. Of that oar and of that bit;
31. Summer and winter, day and night,
32. Of horses and horses of the sea, white horsffes.
