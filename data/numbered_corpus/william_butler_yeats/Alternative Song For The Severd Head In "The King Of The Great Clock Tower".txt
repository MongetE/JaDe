1. SADDLE and ride, I heard a man say,
2. Out of Ben Bulben and Knocknarea,
3. i{What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?}
4. All those tragic characters ride
5. But turn from Rosses' crawling tide,
6. The meet's upon the mountain-side.
7. i{A slow low note and an iron bell.}What brought them there so far from their home.
8. Cuchulain that fought night long with the foam,
9. i{What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?}
10. Niamh that rode on it; lad and lass
11. That sat so still and played at the chess?
12. What but heroic wantonness?
13. i{A slow low note and an iron bell.}Aleel, his Countess; Hanrahan
14. That seemed but a wild wenching man;
15. i{What says the Clock in the Great Clock Tower?}
16. And all alone comes riding there
17. The King that could make his people stare,
18. Because he had feathers instead of hair.
19. i{A slow low note and an iron bell.}
