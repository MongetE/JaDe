1. Come, let me sing into your ear;
2. Those dancing days are gone,
3. All that silk and satin gear;
4. Crouch upon a stone,
5. Wrapping that foul body up
6. In as foul a rag:
7. I carry the sun in a golden cup.
8. The moon in a silver bag.
9. Curse as you may I sing it through;
10. What matter if the knave
11. That the most could pleasure you,
12. The children that he gave,
13. Are somewhere sleeping like a top
14. Under a marble flag?
15. I carry the sun in a golden cup.
16. The moon in a silver bag.
17. I thought it out this very day.
18. Noon upon the clock,
19. A man may put pretence away
20. Who leans upon a stick,
21. May sing, and sing until he drop,
22. Whether to maid or hag:
23. I carry the sun in a golden cup,
24. The moon in a silver bag.
