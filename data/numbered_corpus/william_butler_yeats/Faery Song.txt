2. We who are old, old and gay,
3. O so old!
4. Thousands of years, thousands of years,
5. If all were told:

6. Give to these children, new from the world,
7. Silence and love;
8. And the long dew-dropping hours of the night,
9. And the stars above:

10. Gie to these children, new from the world,
11. Rest far from men.
12. Is anything better, anything better?
13. Tell us it then:

14. Us who are old, old and gay,
15. O so old!
16. Thousands of years, thousands of years,
17. If all were told.
