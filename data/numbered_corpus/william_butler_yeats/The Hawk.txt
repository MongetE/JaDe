1. 'CALL down the hawk from the air;
2. Let him be hooded or caged
3. Till the yellow eye has grown mild,
4. For larder and spit are bare,
5. The old cook enraged,
6. The scullion gone wild.'
7. 'I will not be clapped in a hood,
8. Nor a cage, nor alight upon wrist,
9. Now I have learnt to be proud
10. Hovering over the wood
11. In the broken mist
12. Or tumbling cloud.'
13. 'What tumbling cloud did you cleave,
14. Yellow-eyed hawk of the mind,
15. Last evening? that I, who had sat
16. Dumbfounded before a knave,
17. Should give to my friend
18. A pretence of wit.'
