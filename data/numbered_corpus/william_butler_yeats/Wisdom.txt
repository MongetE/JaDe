1. THE true faith discovered was
2. When painted panel, statuary.
3. Glass-mosaic, window-glass,
4. Amended what was told awry
5. By some peasant gospeller;
6. Swept the Sawdust from the floor
7. Of that working-carpenter.
8. Miracle had its playtime where
9. In damask clothed and on a seat
10. Chryselephantine, cedar-boarded,
11. His majestic Mother sat
12. Stitching at a purple hoarded
13. That He might be nobly breeched
14. In starry towers of Babylon
15. Noah's freshet never reached.
16. King Abundance got Him on
17. Innocence; and Wisdom He.
18. That cognomen sounded best
19. Considering what wild infancy
20. Drove horror from His Mother's breast.
