1. Hidden by old age awhile
2. In masker's cloak and hood,
3. Each hating what the other loved,
4. Face to face we stood:
5. 'That I have met with such,' said he,
6. 'Bodes me little good.'

7. 'Let others boast their fill,' said I,
8. 'But never dare to boast
9. That such as I had such a man
10. For lover in the past;
11. Say that of living men I hate
12. Such a man the most.'

13. 'A loony'd boast of such a love,'
14. He in his rage declared:
15. But such as he for such as me --
16. Could we both discard
17. This beggarly habiliment --
18. Had found a sweeter word.
