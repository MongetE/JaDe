1. FOR certain minutes at the least
2. That crafty demon and that loud beast
3. That plague me day and night
4. Ran out of my sight;
5. Though I had long perned in the gyre,
6. Between my hatred and desire.
7. I saw my freedom won
8. And all laugh in the sun.
9. The glittering eyes in a death's head
10. Of old Luke Wadding's portrait said
11. Welcome, and the Ormondes all
12. Nodded upon the wall,
13. And even Strafford smiled as though
14. It made him happier to know
15. I understood his plan.
16. Now that the loud beast ran
17. There was no portrait in the Gallery
18. But beckoned to sweet company,
19. For all men's thoughts grew clear
20. Being dear as mine are dear.
21. But soon a tear-drop started up,
22. For aimless joy had made me stop
23. Beside the little lake
24. To watch a white gull take
25. A bit of bread thrown up into the air;
26. Now gyring down and perning there
27. He splashed where an absurd
28. Portly green-pated bird
29. Shook off the water from his back;
30. Being no more demoniac
31. A stupid happy creature
32. Could rouse my whole nature.
33. Yet I am certain as can be
34. That every natural victory
35. Belongs to beast or demon,
36. That never yet had freeman
37. Right mastery of natural things,
38. And that mere growing old, that brings
39. Chilled blood, this sweetness brought;
40. Yet have no dearer thought
41. Than that I may find out a way
42. To make it linger half a day.
43. O what a sweetness strayed
44. Through barren Thebaid,
45. Or by the Mareotic sea
46. When that exultant Anthony
47. And twice a thousand more
48. Starved upon the shore
49. And withered to a bag of bones!
50. What had the Caesars but their thrones?
