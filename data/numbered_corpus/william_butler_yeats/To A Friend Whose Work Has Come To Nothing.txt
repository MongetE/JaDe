1. NOW all the truth is out,
2. Be secret and take defeat
3. From any brazen throat,
4. For how can you compete,
5. Being honour bred, with one
6. Who, were it proved he lies,
7. Were neither shamed in his own
8. Nor in his neighbours' eyes?
9. Bred to a harder thing
10. Than Triumph, turn away
11. And like a laughing string
12. Whereon mad fingers play
13. Amid a place of stone,
14. Be secret and exult,
15. Because of all things known
16. That is most difficult.
