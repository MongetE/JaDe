1. DEAR fellow-artist, why so free
2. With every sort of company,
3. With every Jack and Jill?
4. Choose your companions from the best;
5. Who draws a bucket with the rest
6. Soon topples down the hill.
7. You may, that mirror for a school,
8. Be passionate, not bountiful
9. As common beauties may,
10. Who were not born to keep in trim
11. With old Ezekiel's cherubim
12. But those of Beauvarlet.
13. I know what wages beauty gives,
14. How hard a life her setvant lives,
15. Yet praise the winters gone:
16. There is not a fool can call me friend,
17. And I may dine at journey's end
18. With Landor and with Donne.
