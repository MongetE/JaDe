1. Laughter not time destroyed my voice
2. And put that crack in it,
3. And when the moon's pot-bellied
4. I get a laughing fit,
5. For that old Madge comes down the lane,
6. A stone upon her breast,
7. And a cloak wrapped about the stone,
8. And she can get no rest
9. With singing hush and hush-a-bye;
10. She that has been wild
11. And barren as a breaking wave
12. Thinks that the stone's a child.

13. And Peter that had great affairs
14. And was a pushing man
15. Shrieks, 'I am King of the Peacocks,'
16. And perches on a stone;
17. And then I laugh till tears run down
18. And the heart thumps at my side,
19. Remembering that her shriek was love
20. And that he shrieks from pride.
