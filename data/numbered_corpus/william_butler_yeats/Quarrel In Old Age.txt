1. WHERE had her sweetness gone?
2. What fanatics invent
3. In this blind bitter town,
4. Fantasy or incident
5. Not worth thinking of,
6. put her in a rage.
7. I had forgiven enough
8. That had forgiven old age.
9. All lives that has lived;
10. So much is certain;
11. Old sages were not deceived:
12. Somewhere beyond the curtain
13. Of distorting days
14. Lives that lonely thing
15. That shone before these eyes
16. Targeted, trod like Spring.
