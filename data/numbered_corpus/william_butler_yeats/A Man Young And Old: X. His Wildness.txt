1. O bid me mount and sail up there
2. Amid the cloudy wrack,
3. For peg and Meg and Paris' love
4. That had so straight a back,
5. Are gone away, and some that stay
6. Have changed their silk for sack.

7. Were I but there and none to hear
8. I'd have a peacock cry,
9. For that is natural to a man
10. That lives in memory,
11. Being all alone I'd nurse a stone
12. And sing it lullaby.
