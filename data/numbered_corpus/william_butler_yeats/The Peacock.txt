1. What's riches to him
2. That has made a great peacock
3. With the pride of his eye?
4. The wind-beaten, stone-grey,
5. And desolate Three Rock
6. Would nourish his whim.
7. Live he or die
8. Amid wet rocks and heather,
9. His ghost will be gay
10. Adding feather to feather
11. For the pride of his eye.
