1. Shepherd. That cry's from the first cuckoo of the year.
2. I wished before it ceased.

3. Goatherd.              Nor bird nor beast
4. Could make me wish for anything this day,
5. Being old, but that the old alone might die,
6. And that would be against God's providence.
7. Let the young wish.  But what has brought you here?
8. Never until this moment have we met
9. Where my goats browse on the scarce grass or leap
10. From stone to Stone.

11. Shepherd.         I am looking for strayed sheep;
12. Something has troubled me and in my rrouble
13. I let them stray.  I thought of rhyme alone,
14. For rhme can beat a measure out of trouble
15. And make the daylight sweet once more; but when
16. I had driven every rhyme into its Place
17. The sheep had gone from theirs.

18. Goatherd.                   I know right well
19. What turned so good a shepherd from his charge.

20. Shepherd. He that was best in every country sport
21. And every country craft, and of us all
22. Most courteous to slow age and hasty youth,
23. Is dead.

24. Goatherd. The boy that brings my griddle-cake
25. Brought the bare news.

26. Shepherd. He had thrown the crook away
27. And died in the great war beyond the sea.

28. Goatherd. He had often played his pipes among my hills,
29. And when he played it was their loneliness,
30. The exultation of their stone, that died
31. Under his fingers.

32. Shepherd.    I had it from his mother,
33. And his own flock was browsing at the door.

34. Goatherd. How does she bear her grief? There is not a
35. shepherd
36. But grows more gentle when he speaks her name,
37. Remembering kindness done, and how can I,
38. That found when I had neither goat nor grazing
39. New welcome and old wisdom at her fire
40. Till winter blasts were gone, but speak of her
41. Even before his children and his wife?

42. Shepherd. She goes about her house erect and calm
43. Between the pantry and the linen-chest,
44. Or else at meadow or at grazing overlooks
45. Her labouring men, as though her darling lived,
46. But for her grandson now; there is no change
47. But such as I have Seen upon her face
48. Watching our shepherd sports at harvest-time
49. When her son's turn was over.

50. Goatherd.              Sing your song.
51. I too have rhymed my reveries, but youth
52. Is hot to show whatever it has found,
53. And till that's done can neither work nor wait.
54. Old goatherds and old goats, if in all else
55. Youth can excel them in accomplishment,
56. Are learned in waiting.

57. Shepherd. You cannot but have seen
58. That he alone had gathered up no gear,
59. Set carpenters to work on no wide table,
60. On no long bench nor lofty milking-shed
61. As others will, when first they take possession,
62. But left the house as in his father's time
63. As though he knew himself, as it were, a cuckoo,
64. No settled man.  And now that he is gone
65. There's nothing of him left but half a score
66. Of sorrowful, austere, sweet, lofty pipe tunes.

67. Goatherd. You have put the thought in rhyme.

68. Shepherd.              I worked all day,
69. And when 'twas done so little had I done
70. That maybe "I am sorry' in plain prose
71. Had Sounded better to your mountain fancy.

72. [He sings.]

73. "Like the speckled bird that steers
74. Thousands of leagues oversea,
75. And runs or a while half-flies
76. On his yellow legs through our meadows.
77. He stayed for a while; and we
78. Had scarcely accustomed our ears
79. To his speech at the break of day,
80. Had scarcely accustomed our eyes
81. To his shape at the rinsing-pool
82. Among the evening shadows,
83. When he vanished from ears and eyes.
84. I might have wished on the day
85. He came, but man is a fool.'

86. Goatherd. You sing as always of the natural life,
87. And I that made like music in my youth
88. Hearing it now have sighed for that young man
89. And certain lost companions of my own.

90. Shepherd. They say that on your barren mountain ridge
91. You have measured out the road that the soul treads
92. When it has vanished from our natural eyes;
93. That you have talked with apparitions.

94. Goatherd.                        Indeed
95. My daily thoughts since the first stupor of youth
96. Have found the path my goats' feet cannot find.

97. Shepherd. Sing, for it may be that your thoughts have
98. plucked
99. Some medicable herb to make our grief
100. Less bitter.

101. Goatherd.    They have brought me from that ridge
102. Seed-pods and flowers that are not all wild poppy.

103. [Sings.]

104. "He grows younger every second
105. That were all his birthdays reckoned
106. Much too solemn seemed;
107. Because of what he had dreamed,
108. Or the ambitions that he served,
109. Much too solemn and reserved.
110. Jaunting, journeying
111. To his own dayspring,
112. He unpacks the loaded pern
113. Of all 'twas pain or joy to learn,
114. Of all that he had made.
115. The outrageous war shall fade;
116. At some old winding whitethorn root
117. He'll practise on the shepherd's flute,
118. Or on the close-cropped grass
119. Court his shepherd lass,
120. Or put his heart into some game
121. Till daytime, playtime seem the same;
122. Knowledge he shall unwind
123. Through victories of the mind,
124. Till, clambering at the cradle-side,
125. He dreams himself hsi mother's pride,
126. All knowledge lost in trance
127. Of sweeter ignorance.'

128. Shepherd. When I have shut these ewes and this old ram
129. Into the fold, we'll to the woods and there
130. Cut out our rhymes on strips of new-torn bark
131. But put no name and leave them at her door.
132. To know the mountain and the valley have grieved
133. May be a quiet thought to wife and mother,
134. And children when they spring up shoulder-high.
