1. THE Danaan children laugh, in cradles of wrought gold,
2. And clap their hands together, and half close their eyes,
3. For they will ride the North when the ger-eagle flies,
4. With heavy whitening wings, and a heart fallen cold:
5. I kiss my wailing child and press it to my breast,
6. And hear the narrow graves calling my child and me.
7. Desolate winds that cry over the wandering sea;
8. Desolate winds that hover in the flaming West;
9. Desolate winds that beat the doors of Heaven, and beat
10. The doors of Hell and blow there many a whimpering ghost;
11. O heart the winds have shaken, the unappeasable host
12. Is comelier than candles at Mother Mary's feet.
