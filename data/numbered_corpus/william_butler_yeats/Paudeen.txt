1. INDIGNANT at the fumbling wits, the obscure spite
2. Of our old paudeen in his shop, I stumbled blind
3. Among the stones and thorn-trees, under morning light;
4. Until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind
5. A curlew answered; and suddenly thereupon I thought
6. That on the lonely height where all are in God's eye,
7. There cannot be, confusion of our sound forgot,
8. A single soul that lacks a sweet crystalline cry.
