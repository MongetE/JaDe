1. A crazy man that found a cup,
2. When all but dead of thirst,
3. Hardly dared to wet his mouth
4. Imagining, moon-accursed,
5. That another mouthful
6. And his beating heart would burst.
7. October last I found it too
8. But found it dry as bone,
9. And for that reason am I crazed
10. And my sleep is gone.
