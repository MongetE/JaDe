1. SHY one, Shy one,
2. Shy one of my heart,
3. She moves in the firelight
4. pensively apart.
5. She carries in the dishes,
6. And lays them in a row.
7. To an isle in the water
8. With her would I go.
9. With catries in the candles,
10. And lights the curtained room,
11. Shy in the doorway
12. And shy in the gloom;
13. And shy as a rabbit,
14. Helpful and shy.
15. To an isle in the water
16. With her would I fly.
