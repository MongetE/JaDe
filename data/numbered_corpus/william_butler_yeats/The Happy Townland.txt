1. THERE'S many a strong farmer
2. Whose heart would break in two,
3. If he could see the townland
4. That we are riding to;
5. Boughs have their fruit and blossom
6. At all times of the year;
7. Rivers are running over
8. With red beer and brown beer.
9. An old man plays the bagpipes
10. In a golden and silver wood;
11. Queens, their eyes blue like the ice,
12. Are dancing in a crowd.
13. The little fox he murmured,
14. 'O what of the world's bane?'
15. The sun was laughing sweetly,
16. The moon plucked at my rein;
17. But the little red fox murmured,
18. 'O do not pluck at his rein,
19. He is riding to the townland
20. That is the world's bane.'When their hearts are so high
21. That they would come to blows,
22. They unhook rheir heavy swords
23. From golden and silver boughs;
24. But all that are killed in battle
25. Awaken to life again.
26. It is lucky that their story
27. Is not known among men,
28. For O, the strong farmers
29. That would let the spade lie,
30. Their hearts would be like a cup
31. That somebody had drunk dry.
32. The little fox he murmured,
33. 'O what of the world's bane?'
34. The sun was laughing sweetly,
35. The moon plucked at my rcin;
36. But the little red fox murmured,
37. 'O do not pluck at his rein,
38. He is riding to the townland
39. That is the world's bane.'Michael will unhook his trumpet
40. From a bough overhead,
41. And blow a little noise
42. When the supper has been spread.
43. Gabriel will come from the water
44. With a fish-tail, and talk
45. Of wonders that have happened
46. On wet roads where men walk.
47. And lift up an old horn
48. Of hammered silver, and drink
49. Till he has fallen asleep
50. Upon the starry brink.
51. The little fox he murmured,
52. 'O what of the world's bane?'
53. The sun was laughing sweetly,
54. The moon plucked at my rein;
55. But the little red fox murmured.
56. 'O do not pluck at his rein,
57. He is riding to the townland
58. That is the world's bane.'
