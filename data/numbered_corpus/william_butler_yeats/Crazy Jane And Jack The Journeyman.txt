1. I know, although when looks meet
2. I tremble to the bone,
3. The more I leave the door unlatched
4. The sooner love is gone,
5. For love is but a skein unwound
6. Between the dark and dawn.

7. A lonely ghost the ghost is
8. That to God shall come;
9. I - love's skein upon the ground,
10. My body in the tomb -
11. Shall leap into the light lost
12. In my mother's womb.

13. But were I left to lie alone
14. In an empty bed,
15. The skein so bound us ghost to ghost
16. When he turned his head
17. passing on the road that night,
18. Mine must walk when dead.
