1. O WOMEN, kneeling by your altar-rails long hence,
2. When songs I wove for my beloved hide the prayer,
3. And smoke from this dead heart drifts through the violet air
4. And covers away the smoke of myrrh and frankincense;
5. Bend down and pray for all that sin I wove in song,
6. Till the Attorney for Lost Souls cry her sweet cry,
7. And.call to my beloved and me:  'No longer fly
8. Amid the hovering, piteouS, penitential throng.'
