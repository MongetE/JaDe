1. Hunchback. Stand up and lift your hand and bless
2. A man that finds great bitterness
3. In thinking of his lost renown.
4. A Roman Caesar is held down
5. Under this hump.

6. Saint. God tries each man
7. According to a different plan.
8. I shall not cease to bless because
9. I lay about me with the taws
10. That night and morning I may thrash
11. Greek Alexander from my flesh,
12. Augustus Caesar, and after these
13. That great rogue Alcibiades.

14. Hunchback. To all that in your flesh have stood
15. And blessed, I give my gratitude,
16. Honoured by all in their degrees,
17. But most to Alcibiades.
