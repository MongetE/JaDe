1. THIS night has been so strange that it seemed
2. As if the hair stood up on my head.
3. From going-down of the sun I have dreamed
4. That women laughing, or timid or wild,
5. In rustle of lace or silken stuff,
6. Climbed up my creaking stair.  They had read
7. All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing
8. Returned and yet unrequited love.
9. They stood in the door and stood between
10. My great wood lectern and the fire
11. Till I could hear their hearts beating:
12. One is a harlot, and one a child
13. That never looked upon man with desire.
14. And one, it may be, a queen.
