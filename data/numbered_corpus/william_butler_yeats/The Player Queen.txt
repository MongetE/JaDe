1. MY mother dandled me and sang,
2. 'How young it is, how young! '
3. And made a golden cradle
4. That on a willow swung.
5. 'He went away,' my mother sang,
6. 'When I was brought to bed,'
7. And all the while her needle pulled
8. The gold and silver thread.
9. She pulled the thread and bit the thread
10. And made a golden gown,
11. And wept because she had dreamt that I
12. Was born to wear a crown.
13. 'When she was got,' my mother sang,
14. I heard a sea-mew cry,
15. And saw a flake of the yellow foam
16. That dropped upon my thigh.'
17. How therefore could she help but braid
18. The gold into my hair,
19. And dream that I should carry
20. The golden top of care?
