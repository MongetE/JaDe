1. A CURSING rogue with a merry face,
2. A bundle of rags upon a crutch,
3. Stumbled upon that windy place
4. Called Cruachan, and it was as much
5. As the one sturdy leg could do
6. To keep him upright while he cursed.
7. He had counted, where long years ago
8. Queen Maeve's nine Maines had been nursed,
9. A pair of lapwings, one old sheep,
10. And not a house to the plain's edge,
11. When close to his right hand a heap
12. Of grey stones and a rocky ledge
13. Reminded him that he could make.
14. If he but shifted a few stones,
15. A shelter till the daylight broke.
16. But while he fumbled with the stones
17. They toppled over; 'Were it not
18. I have a lucky wooden shin
19. I had been hurt'; and toppling brought
20. Before his eyes, where stones had been,
21. A dark deep hollow in the rock.
22. He gave a gasp and thought to have fled,
23. Being certain it was no right rock
24. Because an ancient history said
25. Hell Mouth lay open near that place,
26. And yet stood still, because inside
27. A great lad with a beery face
28. Had tucked himself away beside
29. A ladle and a tub of beer,
30. And snored, no phantom by his look.
31. So with a laugh at his own fear
32. He crawled into that pleasant nook.
33. 'Night grows uneasy near the dawn
34. Till even I sleep light; but who
35. Has tired of his own company?
36. What one of Maeve's nine brawling sons
37. Sick of his grave has wakened me?
38. But let him keep his grave for once
39. That I may find the sleep I have lost.'
40. What care I if you sleep or wake?
41. But I'Il have no man call me ghost.'
42. Say what you please, but from daybreak
43. I'll sleep another century.'
44. And I will talk before I sleep
45. And drink before I talk.'
46. And he
47. Had dipped the wooden ladle deep
48. Into the sleeper's tub of beer
49. Had not the sleeper started up.
50. Before you have dipped it in the beer
51. I dragged from Goban's mountain-top
52. I'll have assurance that you are able
53. To value beer; no half-legged fool
54. Shall dip his nose into my ladle
55. Merely for stumbling on this hole
56. In the bad hour before the dawn.'
57. Why beer is only beer.'
58. 'But say
59. ''I'll sleep until the winter's gone,
60. Or maybe to Midsummer Day,''
61. And drink and you will sleep that length.
62. 'I'd like to sleep till winter's gone
63. Or till the sun is in his srrength.
64. This blast has chilled me to the bone.'
65. 'I had no better plan at first.
66. I thought to wait for that or this;
67. Maybe the weather was accursed
68. Or I had no woman there to kiss;
69. So slept for half a year or so;
70. But year by year I found that less
71. Gave me such pleasure I'd forgo
72. Even a half-hour's nothingness,
73. And when at one year's end I found
74. I had not waked a single minute,
75. I chosc this burrow under ground.
76. I'll sleep away all time within it:
77. My sleep were now nine centuries
78. But for those mornings when I find
79. The lapwing at their foolish dies
80. And the sheep bleating at the wind
81. As when I also played the fool.'
82. The beggar in a rage began
83. Upon his hunkers in the hole,
84. 'It's plain that you are no right man
85. To mock at everything I love
86. As if it were not worth, the doing.
87. I'd have a merry life enough
88. If a good Easter wind were blowing,
89. And though the winter wind is bad
90. I should not be too down in the mouth
91. For anything you did or said
92. If but this wind were in the south.'
93. 'You cty aloud, O would 'twere spring
94. Or that the wind would shift a point,
95. And do not know that you would bring,
96. If time were suppler in the joint,
97. Neither the spring nor the south wind
98. But the hour when you shall pass away
99. And leave no smoking wick behind,
100. For all life longs for the Last Day
101. And there's no man but cocks his ear
102. To know when Michael's trumpet cries
103. 'That flesh and bone may disappear,
104. And souls as if they were but sighs,
105. And there be nothing but God left;
106. But, I aone being blessed keep
107. Like some old rabbit to my cleft
108. And wait Him in a drunken sleep.'
109. He dipped his ladle in the tub
110. And drank and yawned and stretched him out,
111. The other shouted, 'You would rob
112. My life of every pleasant thought
113. And every comfortable thing,
114. And so take that and that.' Thereon
115. He gave him a great pummelling,
116. But might have pummelled at a stone
117. For all the sleeper knew or cared;
118. And after heaped up stone on stone,
119. And then, grown weary, prayed and cursed
120. And heaped up stone on stone again,
121. And prayed and cursed and cursed and bed
122. From Maeve and all that juggling plain,
123. Nor gave God thanks till overhead
124. The clouds were brightening with the dawn.
