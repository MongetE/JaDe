1. Behold that great Plotinus swim,
2. Buffeted by such seas;
3. Bland Rhadamanthus beckons him,
4. But the Golden Race looks dim,
5. Salt blood blocks his eyes.
6. Scattered on the level grass
7. Or winding through the grove
8. plato there and Minos pass,
9. There stately Pythagoras
10. And all the choir of Love.
