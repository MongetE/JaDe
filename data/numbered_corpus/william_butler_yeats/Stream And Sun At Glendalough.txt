1. THROUGH intricate motions ran
2. Stream and gliding sun
3. And all my heart seemed gay:
4. Some stupid thing that I had done
5. Made my attention stray.
6. Repentance keeps my heart impure;
7. But what am I that dare
8. Fancy that I can
9. Better conduct myself or have more
10. Sense than a common man?
11. What motion of the sun or stream
12. Or eyelid shot the gleam
13. That pierced my body through?
14. What made me live like these that seem
15. Self-born, born anew?
