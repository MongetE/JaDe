1. ARGUMENT.  Baile and Aillinn were lovers, but Aengus, the
2. Master of Love, wishing them to he happy in his own land
3. among the dead, told to each a story of the other's death, so
4. that their hearts were broken and they died.

5. I HARDLY hear the curlew cry,

6. Nor thegrey rush when the wind is high,
7. Before my thoughts begin to run
8. On the heir of Uladh, Buan's son,
9. Baile, who had the honey mouth;
10. And that mild woman of the south,
11. Aillinn, who was King Lugaidh's heir.
12. Their love was never drowned in care
13. Of this or that thing, nor grew cold
14. Because their hodies had grown old.
15. Being forbid to marry on earth,
16. They blossomed to immortal mirth.

17. About the time when Christ was born,
18. When the long wars for the White Horn
19. And the Brown Bull had not yet come,
20. Young Baile Honey Mouth, whom some
21. Called rather Baile Little-Land,
22. Rode out of Emain with a band
23. Of harpers and young men; and they
24. Imagined, as they struck the way
25. To many-pastured Muirthemne,
26. That all things fell out happily,
27. And there, for all that fools had said,
28. Baile and Aillinn would be wed.
29. They found an old man running there:
30. He had ragged long grass-coloured hair;
31. He had knees that stuck out of his hose;
32. He had puddle-water in his shoes;
33. He had half a cloak to keep him dry,
34. Although he had a squirrel's eye.

35. wandering hirds and rushy beds,
36. You put such folly in our heads
37. With all this crying in the wind,
38. No common love is to our mind,
39. And our poor kate or Nan is less
40. Than any whose unhappiness
41. Awoke the harp-strings long ago.
42. Yet they that know all things hut know
43. That all this life can give us is
44. A child's laughter, a woman's kiss.
45. Who was it put so great a scorn
46. In thegrey reeds that night and morn
47. Are trodden and broken hy the herds,
48. And in the light bodies of birds
49. The north wind tumbles to and fro
50. And pinches among hail and snow?
51. That runner said:  'I am from the south;
52. I run to Baile Honey-Mouth,
53. To tell him how the girl Aillinn
54. Rode from the country of her kin,
55. And old and young men rode with her:
56. For all that country had been astir
57. If anybody half as fair
58. Had chosen a husband anywhere
59. But where it could see her every day.
60. When they had ridden a little way
61. An old man caught the horse's head
62. With:  ''You must home again, and wed
63. With somebody in your own land.''
64. A young man cried and kissed her hand,
65. ''O lady, wed with one of us'';
66. And when no face grew piteous
67. For any gentle thing she spake,
68. She fell and died of the heart-break.'
69. Because a lover's heart s worn out,
70. Being tumbled and blown about
71. By its own blind imagining,
72. And will believe that anything
73. That is bad enough to be true, is true,
74. Baile's heart was broken in two;
75. And he, being laid upon green boughs,
76. Was carried to the goodly house
77. Where the Hound of Uladh sat before
78. The brazen pillars of his door,
79. His face bowed low to weep the end
80. Of the harper's daughter and her friend
81. For athough years had passed away
82. He always wept them on that day,
83. For on that day they had been betrayed;
84. And now that Honey-Mouth is laid
85. Under a cairn of sleepy stone
86. Before his eyes, he has tears for none,
87. Although he is carrying stone, but two
88. For whom the cairn's but heaped anew.

89. We hold, because our memory is
90. Sofull of that thing and of this,
91. That out of sight is out of mind.
92. But the grey rush under the wind
93. And the grey bird with crooked bill
94. rave such long memories that they still
95. Remember Deirdre and her man;
96. And when we walk with Kate or Nan
97. About the windy water-side,
98. Our hearts can Fear the voices chide.
99. How could we be so soon content,
100. Who know the way that Naoise went?
101. And they have news of Deirdre's eyes,
102. Who being lovely was so wise --
103. Ah! wise, my heart knows well how wise.

104. Now had that old gaunt crafty one,
105. Gathering his cloak about him, mn
106. Where Aillinn rode with waiting-maids,
107. Who amid leafy lights and shades
108. Dreamed of the hands that would unlace
109. Their bodices in some dim place
110. When they had come to the matriage-bed,
111. And harpers, pacing with high head
112. As though their music were enough
113. To make the savage heart of love
114. Grow gentle without sorrowing,
115. Imagining and pondering
116. Heaven knows what calamity;
117. 'Another's hurried off,' cried he,
118. 'From heat and cold and wind and wave;
119. They have heaped the stones above his grave
120. In Muirthemne, and over it
121. In changeless Ogham letters writ --
122. Baile, that was of Rury's seed.
123. But the gods long ago decreed
124. No waiting-maid should ever spread
125. Baile and Aillinn's marriage-bed,
126. For they should clip and clip again
127. Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.
128. Therefore it is but little news
129. That put this hurry in my shoes.'
130. Then seeing that he scarce had spoke
131. Before her love-worn heart had broke.
132. He ran and laughed until he came
133. To that high hill the herdsmen name
134. The Hill Seat of Laighen, because
135. Some god or king had made the laws
136. That held the land together there,
137. In old times among the clouds of the air.
138. That old man climbed; the day grew dim;
139. Two swans came flying up to him,
140. Linked by a gold chain each to each,
141. And with low murmuring laughing speech
142. Alighted on the windy grass.
143. They knew him:  his changed body was
144. Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings
145. Were hovering over the harp-strings
146. That Edain, Midhir's wife, had wove
147. In the hid place, being crazed by love.
148. What shall I call them? fish that swim,
149. Scale rubbing scale where light is dim
150. By a broad water-lily leaf;
151. Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf
152. Forgotten at the threshing-place;
153. Or birds lost in the one clear space
154. Of morning light in a dim sky;
155. Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye,
156. Or the door-pillars of one house,
157. Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs
158. That have one shadow on the ground;
159. Or the two strings that made one sound
160. Where that wise harper's finger ran.
161. For this young girl and this young man
162. Have happiness without an end,
163. Because they have made so good a friend.
164. They know all wonders, for they pass
165. The towery gates of Gorias,
166. And Findrias and Falias,
167. And long-forgotten Murias,
168. Among the giant kings whose hoard,
169. Cauldron and spear and stone and sword,
170. Was robbed before earth gave the wheat;
171. Wandering from broken street to street
172. They come where some huge watcher is,
173. And tremble with their love and kiss.
174. They know undying things, for they
175. Wander where earth withers away,
176. Though nothing troubles the great streams
177. But light from the pale stars, and gleams
178. From the holy orchards, where there is none
179. But fruit that is of precious stone,
180. Or apples of the sun and moon.
181. What were our praise to them? They eat
182. Quiet's wild heart, like daily meat;
183. Who when night thickens are afloat
184. On dappled skins in a glass boat,
185. Far out under a windless sky;
186. While over them birds of Aengus fly,
187. And over the tiller and the prow,
188. And waving white wings to and fro
189. Awaken wanderings of light air
190. To stir their coverlet and their hair.
191. And poets found, old writers say,
192. A yew tree where his body lay;
193. But a wild apple hid the grass
194. With its sweet blossom where hers was,
195. And being in good heart, because
196. A better time had come again
197. After the deaths of many men,
198. And that long fighting at the ford,
199. They wrote on tablets of thin board,
200. Made of the apple and the yew,
201. All the love stories that they knew.

202. Let rush and hird cry out their fill
203. Of the harper's daughter if they will,
204. Beloved, I am not afraid of her.
205. She is not wiser nor lovelier,
206. And you are more high of heart than she,
207. For all her wanderings over-sea;
208. But I'd have bird and rush forget
209. Those other two; for never yet
210. Has lover lived, but longed to wive
211. Like them that are no more alive.
