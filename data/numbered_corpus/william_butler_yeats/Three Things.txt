1. `O cruel Death, give three things back,'
2. Sang a bone upon the shore;
3. `A child found all a child can lack,
4. Whether of pleasure or of rest,
5. Upon the abundance of my breast':
6. A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.
7. `Three dear things that women know,'
8. Sang a bhone upon the shore;
9. `A man if I but held him so
10. When my body was alive
11. Found all the pleasure that life gave':
12. A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.
13. `The third thing that I think of yet,'
14. Sang a bone upon the shore,
15. `Is that morning when I met
16. Face to face my rightful man
17. And did after stretch and yawn':
18. A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.
