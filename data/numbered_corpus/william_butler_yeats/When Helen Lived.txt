1. WE have cried in our despair
2. That men desert,
3. For some trivial affair
4. Or noisy, insolent sport,
5. Beauty that we have won
6. From bitterest hours;
7. Yet we, had we walked within
8. Those topless towers
9. Where Helen waked with her boy,
10. Had given but as the rest
11. Of the men and women of Troy,
12. A word and a jest.
