1. I RISE in the dawn, and I kneel and blow
2. Till the seed of the fire flicker and glow;
3. And then I must scrub and bake and sweep
4. Till stars are beginning to blink and peep;
5. And the young lie long and dream in their bed
6. Of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head,
7. And their ~y goes over in idleness,
8. And they sigh if the wind but lift a tress:
9. While I must work because I am old,
10. And the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold.
