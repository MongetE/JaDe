1. Beloved, may your sleep be sound
2. That have found it where you fed.
3. What were all the world's alarms
4. To mighty paris when he found
5. Sleep upon a golden bed
6. That first dawn in Helen's arms?

7. Sleep, beloved, such a sleep
8. As did that wild Tristram know
9. When, the potion's work being done,
10. Roe could run or doe could leap
11. Under oak and beechen bough,
12. Roe could leap or doe could run;

13. Such a sleep and sound as fell
14. Upon Eurotas' grassy bank
15. When the holy bird, that there
16. Accomplished his predestined will,
17. From the limbs of Leda sank
18. But not from her protecting care.
