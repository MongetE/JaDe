1. O HEART, be at peace, because
2. Nor knave nor dolt can break
3. What's not for their applause,
4. Being for a woman's sake.
5. Enough if the work has seemed,
6. So did she your strength renew,
7. A dream that a lion had dreamed
8. Till the wilderness cried aloud,
9. A secret between you two,
10. Between the proud and the proud.
11. What, still you would have their praise!
12. But here's a haughtier text,
13. The labyrinth of her days
14. That her own strangeness perplexed;
15. And how what her dreaming gave
16. Earned slander, ingratitude,
17. From self-same dolt and knave;
18. Aye, and worse wrong than these.
19. Yet she, singing upon her road,
20. Half lion, half child, is at peace.
