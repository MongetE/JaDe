1. SING of the O'Rahilly,
2. Do not deny his right;
3. Sing a 'the' before his name;
4. Allow that he, despite
5. All those learned historians,
6. Established it for good;
7. He wrote out that word himself,
8. He christened himself with blood.
9. How goes the weather?

10. Sing of the O'Rahilly
11. That had such little sense
12. He told Pearse and Connolly
13. He'd gone to great expense
14. Keeping all the Kerry men
15. Out of that crazy fight;
16. That he might be there himself
17. Had travelled half the night.
18. How goes the weather?

19. 'Am I such a craven that
20. I should not get the word
21. But for what some travelling man
22. Had heard I had not heard?'
23. Then on pearse and Connolly
24. He fixed a bitter look:
25. 'Because I helped to wind the clock
26. I come to hear it strike.'
27. How goes the weather?

28. What remains to sing about
29. But of the death he met
30. Stretched under a doorway
31. Somewhere off Henry Street;
32. They that found him found upon
33. The door above his head
34. 'Here died the O'Rahilly.
35. R.I.P.' writ in blood.
36. How goes the weather.?
