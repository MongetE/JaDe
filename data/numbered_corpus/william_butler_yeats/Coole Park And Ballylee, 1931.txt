1. Under my window-ledge the waters race,
2. Otters below and moor-hens on the top,
3. Run for a mile undimmed in Heaven's face
4. Then darkening through 'dark' Raftery's 'cellar' drop,
5. Run underground, rise in a rocky place
6. In Coole demesne, and there to finish up
7. Spread to a lake and drop into a hole.
8. What's water but the generated soul?

9. Upon the border of that lake's a wood
10. Now all dry sticks under a wintry sun,
11. And in a copse of beeches there I stood,
12. For Nature's pulled her tragic buskin on
13. And all the rant's a mirror of my mood:
14. At sudden thunder of the mounting swan
15. I turned about and looked where branches break
16. The glittering reaches of the flooded lake.

17. Another emblem there! That stormy white
18. But seems a concentration of the sky;
19. And, like the soul, it sails into the sight
20. And in the morning's gone, no man knows why;
21. And is so lovely that it sets to right
22. What knowledge or its lack had set awry,
23. So atrogantly pure, a child might think
24. It can be murdered with a spot of ink.

25. Sound of a stick upon the floor, a sound
26. From somebody that toils from chair to chair;
27. Beloved books that famous hands have bound,
28. Old marble heads, old pictures everywhere;
29. Great rooms where travelled men and children found
30. Content or joy; a last inheritor
31. Where none has reigned that lacked a name and fame
32. Or out of folly into folly came.

33. A spot whereon the founders lived and died
34. Seemed once more dear than life; ancestral trees,
35. Or gardens rich in memory glorified
36. Marriages, alliances and families,
37. And every bride's ambition satisfied.
38. Where fashion or mere fantasy decrees
39. We shift about - all that great glory spent -
40. Like some poor Arab tribesman and his tent.

41. We were the last romantics - chose for theme
42. Traditional sanctity and loveliness;
43. Whatever's written in what poets name
44. The book of the people; whatever most can bless
45. The mind of man or elevate a rhyme;
46. But all is changed, that high horse riderless,
47. Though mounted in that saddle Homer rode
48. Where the swan drifts upon a darkening flood.
