1. 'TIME to put off the world and go somewhere
2. And find my health again in the sea air,'
3. Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
4. 'And make my soul before my pate is bare.-
5. 'And get a comfortable wife and house
6. To rid me of the devil in my shoes,'
7. Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
8. 'And the worse devil that is between my thighs.'
9. And though I'd marry with a comely lass,
10. She need not be too comely -- let it pass,'
11. Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
12. 'But there's a devil in a looking-glass.'
13. 'Nor should she be too rich, because the rich
14. Are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch,'
15. Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
16. 'And cannot have a humorous happy speech.'
17. 'And there I'll grow respected at my ease,
18. And hear amid the garden's nightly peace.'
19. Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,
20. 'The wind-blown clamour of the barnacle-geese.'
