1. O'DRISCOLL drove with a song
2. The wild duck and the drake
3. From the tall and the tufted reeds
4. Of the drear Hart Lake.
5. And he saw how the reeds grew dark
6. At the coming of night-tide,
7. And dreamed of the long dim hair
8. Of Bridget his bride.
9. He heard while he sang and dreamed
10. A piper piping away,
11. And never was piping so sad,
12. And never was piping so gay.And he saw young men and young girls
13. Who danced on a level place,
14. And Bridget his bride among them,
15. With a sad and a gay face.
16. The dancers crowded about him
17. And many a sweet thing said,
18. And a young man brought him red wine
19. And a young girl white bread.
20. But Bridget drew him by the sleeve
21. Away from the merry bands,
22. To old men playing at cards
23. With a twinkling of ancient hands.
24. The bread and the wine had a doom,
25. For these were the host of the air;
26. He sat and played in a dream
27. Of her long dim hair.
28. He played with the merry old men
29. And thought not of evil chance,
30. Until one bore Bridget his bride
31. Away from the merry dance.
32. He bore her away in his atms,
33. The handsomest young man there,
34. And his neck and his breast and his arms
35. Were drowned in her long dim hair.
36. O'Driscoll scattered the cards
37. And out of his dream awoke:
38. Old men and young men and young girls
39. Were gone like a drifting smoke;
40. But he heard high up in the air
41. A piper piping away,
42. And never was piping so sad,
43. And never was piping so gay.
