1. SAID lady once to lover,
2. 'None can rely upon
3. A love that lacks its proper food;
4. And if your love were gone
5. How could you sing those songs of love?
6. I should be blamed, young man.
7. O my dear, O my dear.
8. Have no lit candles in your room,'
9. That lovely lady said,
10. 'That I at midnight by the clock
11. May creep into your bed,
12. For if I saw myself creep in
13. I think I should drop dead.'
14. O my dear, O my dear.
15. 'I love a man in secret,
16. Dear chambermaid,' said she.
17. 'I know that I must drop down dead
18. If he stop loving me,
19. Yet what could I but drop down dead
20. If I lost my chastity?
21. O my dear, O my dear.
22. 'So you must lie beside him
23. And let him think me there.
24. And maybe we are all the same
25. Where no candles are,
26. And maybe we are all the same
27. That stip the body bare.'
28. O my dear, O my dear.But no dogs barked, and midnights chimed,
29. And through the chime she'd say,
30. 'That was a lucky thought of mine,
31. My lover.  looked so gay';
32. But heaved a sigh if the chambermaid
33. Looked half asleep all day.
34. O my dear, O my dear.
35. 'No, not another song,' siid he,
36. 'Because my lady came
37. A year ago for the first time
38. At midnight to my room,
39. And I must lie between the sheets
40. When the clock begins to chime.'
41. O my dear, O my d-ear.

42. 'A laughing, crying, sacred song,
43. A leching song,' they said.
44. Did ever men hear such a song?
45. No, but that day they did.
46. Did ever man ride such a race?
47. No, not until he rode.
48. O my dear, O my dear.
49. But when his horse had put its hoof
50. Into a rabbit-hole
51. He dropped upon his head and died.
52. His lady saw it all
53. And dropped and died thereon, for she
54. Loved him with her soul.
55. O my dear, O my dear.The chambermaid lived long, and took
56. Their graves into her charge,
57. And there two bushes planted
58. That when they had grown large
59. Seemed sprung from but a single root
60. So did their roses merge.
61. O my dear, O my dear.
62. When she was old and dying,
63. The priest came where she was;
64. She made a full confession.
65. Long looked he in her face,
66. And O he was a good man
67. And understood her case.
68. O my dear, O my dear.
69. He bade them take and bury her
70. Beside her lady's man,
71. And set a rose-tree on her grave,
72. And now none living can,
73. When they have plucked a rose there,
74. Know where its roots began.
75. O my dear, O my dear.
