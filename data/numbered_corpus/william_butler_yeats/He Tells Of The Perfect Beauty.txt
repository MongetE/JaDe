1. O CLOUD-PALE eyelids, dream-dimmed eyes,
2. The poets labouring all their days
3. To build a perfect beauty in rhyme
4. Are overthrown by a woman's gaze
5. And by the unlabouring brood of the skies:
6. And therefore my heart will bow, when dew
7. Is dropping sleep, until God burn time,
8. Before the unlabouring stars and you.
