1. 'ALTHOUGH I'd lie lapped up in linen
2. A deal I'd sweat and little earn
3. If I should live as live the neighbours,'
4. Cried the beggar, Billy Byrne;
5. 'Stretch bones till the daylight come
6. On great-grandfather's battered tomb.'Upon a grey old battered tombstone
7. In Glendalough beside the stream
8. Where the O'Byrnes and Byrnes are buried,
9. He stretched his bones and fell in a dream
10. Of sun and moon that a good hour
11. Bellowed and pranced in the round tower;
12. Of golden king and Silver lady,
13. Bellowing up and bellowing round,
14. Till toes mastered a sweet measure,
15. Mouth mastered a sweet sound,
16. Prancing round and prancing up
17. Until they pranced upon the top.
18. That golden king and that wild lady
19. Sang till stars began to fade,
20. Hands gripped in hands, toes close together,
21. Hair spread on the wind they made;
22. That lady and that golden king
23. Could like a brace of blackbirds sing.
24. 'It's certain that my luck is broken,'
25. That rambling jailbird Billy said;
26. 'Before nightfall I'll pick a pocket
27. And snug it in a feather bed.
28. I cannot find the peace of home
29. On great-grandfather's battered tomb.'
