1. My Soul.  I summon to the winding ancient stair;
2. Set all your mind upon the steep ascent,
3. Upon the broken, crumbling battlement,
4. Upon the breathless starlit air,
5. 'Upon the star that marks the hidden pole;
6. Fix every wandering thought upon
7. That quarter where all thought is done:
8. Who can distinguish darkness from the soul

9. My Self.  The consecretes blade upon my knees
10. Is Sato's ancient blade, still as it was,
11. Still razor-keen, still like a looking-glass
12. Unspotted by the centuries;
13. That flowering, silken, old embroidery, torn
14. From some court-lady's dress and round
15. The wodden scabbard bound and wound
16. Can, tattered, still protect, faded adorn

17. My Soul.  Why should the imagination of a man
18. Long past his prime remember things that are
19. Emblematical of love and war?
20. Think of ancestral night that can,
21. If but imagination scorn the earth
22. And intellect is wandering
23. To this and that and t'other thing,
24. Deliver from the crime of death and birth.

25. My Self.  Montashigi, third of his family, fashioned it
26. Five hundred years ago, about it lie
27. Flowers from I know not what embroidery -
28. Heart's purple - and all these I set
29. For emblems of the day against the tower
30. Emblematical of the night,
31. And claim as by a soldier's right
32. A charter to commit the crime once more.

33. My Soul.  Such fullness in that quarter overflows
34. And falls into the basin of the mind
35. That man is stricken deaf and dumb and blind,
36. For intellect no longer knows
37. Is from the Ought, or knower from the Known -
38. That is to say, ascends to Heaven;
39. Only the dead can be forgiven;
40. But when I think of that my tongue's a stone.

41. II

42. My Self.  A living man is blind and drinks his drop.
43. What matter if the ditches are impure?
44. What matter if I live it all once more?
45. Endure that toil of growing up;
46. The ignominy of boyhood; the distress
47. Of boyhood changing into man;
48. The unfinished man and his pain
49. Brought face to face with his own clumsiness;

50. The finished man among his enemies? -
51. How in the name of Heaven can he escape
52. That defiling and disfigured shape
53. The mirror of malicious eyes
54. Casts upon his eyes until at last
55. He thinks that shape must be his shape?
56. And what's the good of an escape
57. If honour find him in the wintry blast?

58. I am content to live it all again
59. And yet again, if it be life to pitch
60. Into the frog-spawn of a blind man's ditch,
61. A blind man battering blind men;
62. Or into that most fecund ditch of all,
63. The folly that man does
64. Or must suffer, if he woos
65. A proud woman not kindred of his soul.

66. I am content to follow to its source
67. Every event in action or in thought;
68. Measure the lot; forgive myself the lot!
69. When such as I cast out remorse
70. So great a sweetness flows into the breast
71. We must laugh and we must sing,
72. We are blest by everything,
73. Everything we look upon is blest.
