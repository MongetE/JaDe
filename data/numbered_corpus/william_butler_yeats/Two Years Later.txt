1. HAS no one said those daring
2. Kind eyes should be more learn'd?
3. Or warned you how despairing
4. The moths are when they are burned?
5. I could have warned you; but you are young,
6. So we speak a different tongue.
7. O you will take whatever's offered
8. And dream that all the world's a friend,
9. Suffer as your mother suffered,
10. Be as broken in the end.
11. But I am old and you are young,
12. And I speak a barbarous tongue.
