1. I SAT on cushioned otter-skin:
2. My word was law from Ith to Emain,
3. And shook at Inver Amergin
4. The hearts of the world-troubling seamen,
5. And drove tumult and war away
6. From girl and boy and man and beast;
7. The fields grew fatter day by day,
8. The wild fowl of the air increased;
9. And every ancient Ollave said,
10. While he bent down his fading head.
11. 'He drives away the Northern cold.'
12. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.
13. I sat and mused and drank sweet wine;
14. A herdsman came from inland valleys,
15. Crying, the pirates drove his swine
16. To fill their dark-beaked hollow galleys.
17. I called my battle-breaking men
18. And my loud brazen battle-cars
19. From rolling vale and rivery glen;
20. And under the blinking of the stars
21. Fell on the pirates by the deep,
22. And hurled them in the gulph of sleep:
23. These hands won many a torque of gold.
24. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.
25. But slowly, as I shouting slew
26. And trampled in the bubbling mire,
27. In my most secret spirit grew
28. A whirling and a wandering fire:
29. I stood:  keen stars above me shone,
30. Around me shone keen eyes of men:
31. I laughed aloud and hurried on
32. By rocky shore and rushy fen;
33. I laughed because birds fluttered by,
34. And starlight gleamed, and clouds flew high,
35. And rushes waved and waters rolled.
36. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.
37. And now I wander in the woods
38. When summer gluts the golden bees,
39. Or in autumnal solitudes
40. Arise the leopard-coloured trees;
41. Or when along the wintry strands
42. The cormorants shiver on their rocks;
43. I wander on, and wave my hands,
44. And sing, and shake my heavy locks.
45. The grey wolf knows me; by one ear
46. I lead along the woodland deer;
47. The hares run by me growing bold.
48. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.
49. I came upon a little town
50. That slumbered in the harvest moon,
51. And passed a-tiptoe up and down,
52. Murmuring, to a fitful tune,
53. How I have followed, night and day,
54. A tramping of tremendous feet,
55. And saw where this old tympan lay
56. Deserted on a doorway seat,
57. And bore it to the woods with me;
58. Of some inhuman misery
59. Our married voices wildly trolled.
60. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.
61. I sang how, when day's toil is done,
62. Orchil shakes out her long dark hair
63. That hides away the dying sun
64. And sheds faint odours through the air:
65. When my hand passed from wire to wire
66. It quenched, with sound like falling dew
67. The whirling and the wandering fire;
68. But lift a mournful ulalu,
69. For the kind wires are torn and still,
70. And I must wander wood and hill
71. Through summer's heat and winter's cold.
72. They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.
