1. ALTHOUGH I can see him still.
2. The freckled man who goes
3. To a grey place on a hill
4. In grey Connemara clothes
5. At dawn to cast his flies,
6. It's long since I began
7. To call up to the eyes
8. This wise and simple man.
9. All day I'd looked in the face
10. What I had hoped 'twould be
11. To write for my own race
12. And the reality;
13. The living men that I hate,
14. The dead man that I loved,
15. The craven man in his seat,
16. The insolent unreproved,
17. And no knave brought to book
18. Who has won a drunken cheer,
19. The witty man and his joke
20. Aimed at the commonest ear,
21. The clever man who cries
22. The catch-cries of the clown,
23. The beating down of the wise
24. And great Art beaten down.
25. Maybe a twelvemonth since
26. Suddenly I began,
27. In scorn of this audience,
28. Imagining a man,
29. And his sun-freckled face,
30. And grey Connemara cloth,
31. Climbing up to a place
32. Where stone is dark under froth,
33. And the down-turn of his wrist
34. When the flies drop in the stream;
35. A man who does not exist,
36. A man who is but a dream;
37. And cried, 'Before I am old
38. I shall have written him one
39. poem maybe as cold
40. And passionate as the dawn.'
