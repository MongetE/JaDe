1. O WHAT to me the little room
2. That was brimmed up with prayer and rest;
3. He bade me out into the gloom,
4. And my breast lies upon his breast.
5. O what to me my mother's care,
6. The house where I was safe and warm;
7. The shadowy blossom of my hair
8. Will hide us from the bitter storm.
9. O hiding hair and dewy eyes,
10. I am no more with life and death,
11. My heart upon his warm heart lies,
12. My breath is mixed into his breath.
