1. ONE that is ever kind said yesterday:
2. 'Your well-beloved's hair has threads of grey,
3. And little shadows come about her eyes;
4. Time can but make it easier to be wise
5. Though now it seems impossible, and so
6. All that you need is patience.'
7. Heart cries, 'No,
8. I have not a crumb of comfort, not a grain.
9. Time can but make her beauty over again:
10. Because of that great nobleness of hers
11. The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs,
12. Burns but more clearly.  O she had not these ways
13. When all the wild Summer was in her gaze.'
14. Heart! O heart! if she'd but turn her head,
15. You'd know the folly of being comforted.
