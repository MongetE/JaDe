1. SAILING TO BYZANTIUM
2. I

3. THAT is no country for old men.  The young
4. In one another's arms, birds in the trees
5. -- Those dying generations -- at their song,
6. The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,
7. Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long
8. Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
9. Caught in that sensual music all neglect
10. Monuments of unageing intellect.
11. An aged man is but a paltry thing,
12. A tattered coat upon a stick, unless
13. Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing
14. For every tatter in its mortal dress,
15. Nor is there singing school but studying
16. Monuments of its own magnificence;
17. And therefore I have sailed the seas and come
18. To the holy city of Byzantium.
19. O sages standing in God's holy fire
20. As in the gold mosaic of a wall,
21. Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,
22. And be the singing-masters of my soul.
23. Consume my heart away; sick with desire
24. And fastened to a dying animal
25. It knows not what it is; and gather me
26. Into the artifice of eternity.
27. Once out Of nature I shall never take
28. My bodily form from any natural thing,
29. But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make
30. Of hammered gold and gold enamelling
31. To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;
32. Or set upon a golden bough to sing
33. To lords and ladies of Byzantium
34. Of what is past, or passing, or to come.

35. WHAT shall I do with this absurdity --
36. O heart, O troubled heart -- this caricature,
37. Decrepit age that has been tied to me
38. As to a dog's tail?
39. Never had I more
40. Excited, passionate, fantastical
41. Imagination, nor an ear and eye
42. That more expected the impossible --
43. No, not in boyhood when with rod and fly,
44. Or the humbler worm, I climbed Ben Bulben's back
45. And had the livelong summer day to spend.
46. It seems that I must bid the Muse go pack,
47. Choose Plato and Plotinus for a friend
48. Until imagination, ear and eye,
49. Can be content with argument and deal
50. In abstract things; or be derided by
51. A sort of battered kettle at the heel.
52. I pace upon the battlements and stare
53. On the foundations of a house, or where
54. Tree, like a sooty finger, starts from the earth;
55. And send imagination forth
56. Under the day's declining beam, and call
57. Images and memories
58. From ruin or from ancient trees,
59. For I would ask a question of them all.
60. Beyond that ridge lived Mrs.  French, and once
61. When every silver candlestick or sconce
62. Lit up the dark mahogany and the wine.
63. A serving-man, that could divine
64. That most respected lady's every wish,
65. Ran and with the garden shears
66. Clipped an insolent farmer's ears
67. And brought them in a little covered dish.
68. Some few remembered still when I was young
69. A peasant girl commended by a Song,
70. Who'd lived somewhere upon that rocky place,
71. And praised the colour of her face,
72. And had the greater joy in praising her,
73. Remembering that, if walked she there,
74. Farmers jostled at the fair
75. So great a glory did the song confer.
76. And certain men, being maddened by those rhymes,
77. Or else by toasting her a score of times,
78. Rose from the table and declared it right
79. To test their fancy by their sight;
80. But they mistook the brightness of the moon
81. For the prosaic light of day --
82. Music had driven their wits astray --
83. And one was drowned in the great bog of Cloone.
84. Strange, but the man who made the song was blind;
85. Yet, now I have considered it, I find
86. That nothing strange; the tragedy began
87. With Homer that was a blind man,
88. And Helen has all living hearts betrayed.
89. O may the moon and sunlight seem
90. One inextricable beam,
91. For if I triumph I must make men mad.
92. And I myself created Hanrahan
93. And drove him drunk or sober through the dawn
94. From somewhere in the neighbouring cottages.
95. Caught by an old man's juggleries
96. He stumbled, tumbled, fumbled to and fro
97. And had but broken knees for hire
98. And horrible splendour of desire;
99. I thought it all out twenty years ago:
100. Good fellows shuffled cards in an old bawn;
101. And when that ancient ruffian's turn was on
102. He so bewitched the cards under his thumb
103. That all but the one card became
104. A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards,
105. And that he changed into a hare.
106. Hanrahan rose in frenzy there
107. And followed up those baying creatures towards --
108. O towards I have forgotten what -- enough!
109. I must recall a man that neither love
110. Nor music nor an enemy's clipped ear
111. Could, he was so harried, cheer;
112. A figure that has grown so fabulous
113. There's not a neighbour left to say
114. When he finished his dog's day:
115. An ancient bankrupt master of this house.
116. Before that ruin came, for centuries,
117. Rough men-at-arms, cross-gartered to the knees
118. Or shod in iron, climbed the narrow stairs,
119. And certain men-at-arms there were
120. Whose images, in the Great Memory stored,
121. Come with loud cry and panting breast
122. To break upon a sleeper's rest
123. While their great wooden dice beat on the board.
124. As I would question all, come all who can;
125. Come old, necessitous.  half-mounted man;
126. And bring beauty's blind rambling celebrant;
127. The red man the juggler sent
128. Through God-forsaken meadows; Mrs.  French,
129. Gifted with so fine an ear;
130. The man drowned in a bog's mire,
131. When mocking Muses chose the country wench.
132. Did all old men and women, rich and poor,
133. Who trod upon these rocks or passed this door,
134. Whether in public or in secret rage
135. As I do now against old age?
136. But I have found an answer in those eyes
137. That are impatient to be gone;
138. Go therefore; but leave Hanrahan,
139. For I need all his mighty memories.
140. Old lecher with a love on every wind,
141. Bring up out of that deep considering mind
142. All that you have discovered in the grave,
143. For it is certain that you have
144. Reckoned up every unforeknown, unseeing
145. plunge, lured by a softening eye,
146. Or by a touch or a sigh,
147. Into the labyrinth of another's being;
148. Does the imagination dwell the most
149. Upon a woman won or woman lost.?
150. If on the lost, admit you turned aside
151. From a great labyrinth out of pride,
152. Cowardice, some silly over-subtle thought
153. Or anything called conscience once;
154. And that if memory recur, the sun's
155. Under eclipse and the day blotted out.

156. III
157. It is time that I wrote my will;
158. I choose upstanding men
159. That climb the streams until
160. The fountain leap, and at dawn
161. Drop their cast at the side
162. Of dripping stone; I declare
163. They shall inherit my pride,
164. The pride of people that were
165. Bound neither to Cause nor to State.
166. Neither to slaves that were spat on,
167. Nor to the tyrants that spat,
168. The people of Burke and of Grattan
169. That gave, though free to refuse --
170. pride, like that of the morn,
171. When the headlong light is loose,
172. Or that of the fabulous horn,
173. Or that of the sudden shower
174. When all streams are dry,
175. Or that of the hour
176. When the swan must fix his eye
177. Upon a fading gleam,
178. Float out upon a long
179. Last reach of glittering stream
180. And there sing his last song.
181. And I declare my faith:
182. I mock plotinus' thought
183. And cry in plato's teeth,
184. Death and life were not
185. Till man made up the whole,
186. Made lock, stock and barrel
187. Out of his bitter soul,
188. Aye, sun and moon and star, all,
189. And further add to that
190. That, being dead, we rise,
191. Dream and so create
192. Translunar paradise.
193. I have prepared my peace
194. With learned Italian things
195. And the proud stones of Greece,
196. Poet's imaginings
197. And memories of love,
198. Memories of the words of women,
199. All those things whereof
200. Man makes a superhuman,
201. Mirror-resembling dream.
202. As at the loophole there
203. The daws chatter and scream,
204. And drop twigs layer upon layer.
205. When they have mounted up,
206. The mother bird will rest
207. On their hollow top,
208. And so warm her wild nest.
209. I leave both faith and pride
210. To young upstanding men
211. Climbing the mountain-side,
212. That under bursting dawn
213. They may drop a fly;
214. Being of that metal made
215. Till it was broken by
216. This sedentary trade.
217. Now shall I make my soul,
218. Compelling it to study
219. In a learned school
220. Till the wreck of body,
221. Slow decay of blood,
222. Testy delirium
223. Or dull decrepitude,
224. Or what worse evil come --
225. The death of friends, or death
226. Of every brilliant eye
227. That made a catch in the breath -- .
228. Seem but the clouds of the sky
229. When the horizon fades;
230. Or a bird's sleepy cry
231. Among the deepening shades.THE TOWER
