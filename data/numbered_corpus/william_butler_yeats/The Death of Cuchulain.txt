1. The harlot sang to the beggar-man.
2. I meet them face to face,
3. Conall, Cuchulain, Usna's boys,
4. All that most ancient race;
5. Maeve had three in an hour, they say.
6. I adore those clever eyes,
7. Those muscular bodies, but can get
8. No grip upon their thighs.
9. I meet those long pale faces,
10. Hear their great horses, then
11. Recall what centuries have passed
12. Since they were living men.
13. That there are still some living
14. That do my limbs unclothe,
15. But that the flesh my flesh is gripped
16. I both adore and loathe.

17. Are those things that men adore and loathe
18. Their sole reality?
19. What stood in the Post Office
20. With Pearse and Connolly?
21. What comes out of the mountain
22. Where men first shed their blood?
23. Who thought Cuchulain till it seemed
24. He stood where they had stood?

25. No body like his body
26. Has modern woman borne,
27. But an old man looking back in life
28. Imagines it in scorn.
29. A statue's there to mark the place,
30. By Oliver Sheppard done.
31. So ends the tale that the harlot
32. Sang to the beggar-man.
