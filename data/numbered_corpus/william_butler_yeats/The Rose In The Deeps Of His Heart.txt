1. All things uncomely and broken,
2. All things worn-out and old,
3. The cry of a child by the roadway,
4. The creak of a lumbering cart,
5. The heavy steps of the ploughman,
6. splashing the wintry mould,
7. Are wronging your image that blossoms
8. A rose in the deeps of my heart.The wrong of unshapely things
9. Is a wrong too great to be told;
10. I hunger to build them anew
11. And sit on a green knoll apart,
12. With the earth and the sky and the water,
13. Remade, like a casket of gold
14. For my dreams of your image that blossoms
15. A rose in the deeps of my heart.
