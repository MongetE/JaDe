1. The lot of love is chosen.  I learnt that much
2. Struggling for an image on the track
3. Of the whirling Zodiac.
4. Scarce did he my body touch,
5. Scarce sank he from the west
6. Or found a subtetranean rest
7. On the maternal midnight of my breast
8. Before I had marked him on his northern way,
9. And seemed to stand although in bed I lay.
10. I struggled with the horror of daybreak,
11. I chose it for my lot! If questioned on
12. My utmost pleasure with a man
13. By some new-married bride, I take
14. That stillness for a theme
15. Where his heart my heart did seem
16. And both adrift on the miraculous stream
17. Where -- wrote a learned astrologer --
18. The Zodiac is changed into a sphere.
