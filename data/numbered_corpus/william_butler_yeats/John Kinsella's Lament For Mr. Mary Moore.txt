2. Gunshot or a noose,
3. For Death who takes what man would keep,
4. Leaves what man would lose.
5. He might have had my sister,
6. My cousins by the score,
7. But nothing satisfied the fool
8. But my dear Mary Moore,
9. None other knows what pleasures man
10. At table or in bed.
11. What shall I do for pretty girls
12. Now my old bawd is dead?Though stiff to strike a bargain,
13. Like an old Jew man,
14. Her bargain struck we laughed and talked
15. And emptied many a can;
16. And O! but she had stories,
17. Though not for the priest's ear,
18. To keep the soul of man alive,
19. Banish age and care,
20. And being old she put a skin
21. On everything she said.
22. What shall I do for pretty girls
23. Now my old bawd is dead?
24. The priests have got a book that says
25. But for Adam's sin
26. Eden's Garden would be there
27. And I there within.
28. No expectation fails there,
29. No pleasing habit ends,
30. No man grows old, no girl grows cold
31. But friends walk by friends.
32. Who quarrels over halfpennies
33. That plucks the trees for bread?
34. What shall I do for pretty girls
35. Now my old bawd is dead?
