1. Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days!
2. Come near me, while I sing the ancient ways:
3. Cuchulain battling with the bitter tide;
4. The Druid, grey, wood-nurtured, quiet-eyed,
5. Who cast round Fergus dreams, and ruin untold;
6. And thine own sadness, where of stars, grown old
7. In dancing silver-sandalled on the sea,
8. Sing in their high and lonely melody.
9. Come near, that no more blinded hy man's fate,
10. I find under the boughs of love and hate,
11. In all poor foolish things that live a day,
12. Eternal beauty wandering on her way.
13. Come near, come near, come near -- Ah, leave me still
14. A little space for the rose-breath to fill!
15. Lest I no more bear common things that crave;
16. The weak worm hiding down in its small cave,
17. The field-mouse running by me in the grass,
18. And heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass;
19. But seek alone to hear the strange things said
20. By God to the bright hearts of those long dead,
21. And learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know.
22. Come near; I would, before my time to go,
23. Sing of old Eire and the ancient ways:
24. Red Rose, proud Rose, sad Rose of all my days.
