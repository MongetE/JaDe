1. WHEN the flaming lute-thronged angelic door is wide;
2. When an immortal passion breathes in mortal clay;
3. Our hearts endure the scourge, the plaited thorns, the way
4. Crowded with bitter faces, the wounds in palm and side,
5. The vinegar-heavy sponge, the flowers by Kedron stream;
6. We will bend down and loosen our hair over you,
7. That it may drop faint perfume, and be heavy with dew,
8. Lilies of death-pale hope, roses of passionate dream.
