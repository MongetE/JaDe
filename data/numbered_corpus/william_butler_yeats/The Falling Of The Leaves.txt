1. AUTUMN is over the long leaves that love us,
2. And over the mice in the barley sheaves;
3. Yellow the leaves of the rowan above us,
4. And yellow the wet wild-strawberry leaves.
5. The hour of the waning of love has beset us,
6. And weary and worn are our sad souls now;
7. Let us patt, ere the season of passion forget us,
8. With a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow.
