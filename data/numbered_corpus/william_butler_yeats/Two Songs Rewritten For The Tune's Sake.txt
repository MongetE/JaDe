1. I
2. My Paistin Finn is my sole desire,
3. And I am shrunken to skin and bone,
4. For all my heart has had for its hire
5. Is what I can whistle alone and alone.
6. Oro, oro.!
7. Tomorrow night I will break down the door.
8. What is the good of a man and he
9. Alone and alone, with a speckled shin?
10. I would that I drank with my love on my knee
11. Between two barrels at the inn.
12. Oro, oro.!

13. To-morrow night I will break down the door.
14. Alone and alone nine nights I lay
15. Between two bushes under the rain;
16. I thought to have whistled her down that
17. I whistled and whistled and whistled in vain.
18. Oro, oro!
19. To-morrow night I will break down the door.

20. II
21. I would that I were an old beggar
22. Rolling a blind pearl eye,
23. For he cannot see my lady
24. Go gallivanting by;
25. A dreary, dreepy beggar
26. Without a friend on the earth
27. But a thieving rascally cur --
28. O a beggar blind from his birth;
29. Or anything else but a rhymer
30. Without a thing in his head
31. But rhymes for a beautiful lady,
32. He rhyming alone in his bed.
