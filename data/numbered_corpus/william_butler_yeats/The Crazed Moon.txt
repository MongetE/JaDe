1. CRAZED through much child-bearing
2. The moon is staggering in the sky;
3. Moon-struck by the despairing
4. Glances of her wandering eye
5. We grope, and grope in vain,
6. For children born of her pain.
7. Children dazed or dead!
8. When she in all her virginal pride
9. First trod on the mountain's head
10. What stir ran through the countryside
11. Where every foot obeyed her glance!
12. What manhood led the dance!
13. Fly-catchers of the moon,
14. Our hands are blenched, our fingers seem
15. But slender needles of bone;
16. Blenched by that malicious dream
17. They are spread wide that each
18. May rend what comes in reach.
