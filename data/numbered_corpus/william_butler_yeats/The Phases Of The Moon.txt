1. An old man cocked his car upon a bridge;
2. He and his friend, their faces to the South,
3. Had trod the uneven road.  Their hoots were soiled,
4. Their Connemara cloth worn out of shape;
5. They had kept a steady pace as though their beds,
6. Despite a dwindling and late-risen moon,
7. Were distant still.  An old man cocked his ear.
8. Aherne. What made that Sound?
9. Robartes. A rat or water-hen
10. Splashed, or an otter slid into the stream.
11. We are on the bridge; that shadow is the tower,
12. And the light proves that he is reading still.
13. He has found, after the manner of his kind,
14. Mere images; chosen this place to live in
15. Because, it may be, of the candle-light
16. From the far tower where Milton's Platonist
17. Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince:
18. The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved,
19. An image of mysterious wisdom won by toil;
20. And now he seeks in book or manuscript
21. What he shall never find.
22. Ahernc. Why should not you
23. Who know it all ring at his door, and speak
24. Just truth enough to show that his whole life
25. Will scarcely find for him a broken crust
26. Of all those truths that are your daily bread;
27. And when you have spoken take the roads again?
28. Robartes. He wrote of me in that extravagant style
29. He had learnt from pater, and to round his tale
30. Said I was dead; and dead I choose to be.
31. Aherne. Sing me the changes of the moon once more;
32. True song, though speech:  'mine author sung it me.'
33. Robartes. Twenty-and-eight the phases of the moon,
34. The full and the moon's dark and all the crescents,
35. Twenty-and-eight, and yet but six-and-twenty
36. The cradles that a man must needs be rocked in:
37. For there's no human life at the full or the dark.
38. From the first crescent to the half, the dream
39. But summons to adventure and the man
40. Is always happy like a bird or a beast;
41. But while the moon is rounding towards the full
42. He follows whatever whim's most difficult
43. Among whims not impossible, and though scarred.
44. As with the cat-o'-nine-tails of the mind,
45. His body moulded from within his body
46. Grows comelier.  Eleven pass, and then
47. Athene takes Achilles by the hair,
48. Hector is in the dust, Nietzsche is born,
49. Because the hero's crescent is the twelfth.
50. And yet, twice born, twice buried, grow he must,
51. Before the full moon, helpless as a worm.
52. The thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war
53. In its own being, and when that war's begun
54. There is no muscle in the arm; and after,
55. Under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon,
56. The soul begins to tremble into stillness,
57. To die into the labyrinth of itself!
58. Aherne. Sing out the song; sing to the end, and sing
59. The strange reward of all that discipline.
60. Robartes. All thought becomes an image and the soul
61. Becomes a body:  that body and that soul
62. Too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle,
63. Too lonely for the traffic of the world:
64. Body and soul cast out and cast away
65. Beyond the visible world.
66. Aherne. All dreams of the soul
67. End in a beautiful man's or woman's body.
68. Robartes, Have you not always known it?
69. Aherne. The song will have it
70. That those that we have loved got their long fingers
71. From death, and wounds, or on Sinai's top,
72. Or from some bloody whip in their own hands.
73. They ran from cradle to cradle till at last
74. Their beauty dropped out of the loneliness
75. Of body and soul.
76. Robartes. The lover's heart knows that.
77. Aherne. It must be that the terror in their eyes
78. Is memory or foreknowledge of the hour
79. When all is fed with light and heaven is bare.
80. Robartes. When the moon's full those creatures of the full
81. Are met on the waste hills by countrymen
82. Who shudder and hurry by:  body and soul
83. Estranged amid the strangeness of themselves,
84. Caught up in contemplation, the mind's eye
85. Fixed upon images that once were thought;
86. For separate, perfect, and immovable
87. Images can break the solitude
88. Of lovely, satisfied, indifferent eyes.
89. And thereupon with aged, high-pitched voice
90. Aherne laughed, thinking of the man within,
91. His sleepless candle and lahorious pen.
92. Robartes. And after that the crumbling of the moon.
93. The soul remembering its loneliness
94. Shudders in many cradles; all is changed,
95. It would be the world's servant, and as it serves,
96. Choosing whatever task's most difficult
97. Among tasks not impossible, it takes
98. Upon the body and upon the soul
99. The coarseness of the drudge.
100. Aherne. Before the full
101. It sought itself and afterwards the world.
102. Robartes. Because you are forgotten, half out of life,
103. And never wrote a book, your thought is clear.
104. Reformer, merchant, statesman, learned man,
105. Dutiful husband, honest wife by turn,
106. Cradle upon cradle, and all in flight and all
107. Deformed because there is no deformity
108. But saves us from a dream.
109. Aherne. And what of those
110. That the last servile crescent has set free?
111. Robartes. Because all dark, like those that are all light,
112. They are cast beyond the verge, and in a cloud,
113. Crying to one another like the bats;
114. And having no desire they cannot tell
115. What's good or bad, or what it is to triumph
116. At the perfection of one's own obedience;
117. And yet they speak what's blown into the mind;
118. Deformed beyond deformity, unformed,
119. Insipid as the dough before it is baked,
120. They change their bodies at a word.
121. Aherne. And then?
122. Rohartes. When all the dough has been so kneaded up
123. That it can take what form cook Nature fancies,
124. The first thin crescent is wheeled round once more.
125. Aherne. But the escape; the song's not finished yet.
126. Robartes. Hunchback and Saint and Fool are the last crescents.
127. The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow
128. Out of the up and down, the wagon-wheel
129. Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter --
130. Out of that raving tide -- is drawn betwixt
131. Deformity of body and of mind.
132. Aherne. Were not our beds far off I'd ring the bell,
133. Stand under the rough roof-timbers of the hall
134. Beside the castle door, where all is stark
135. Austerity, a place set out for wisdom
136. That he will never find; I'd play a part;
137. He would never know me after all these years
138. But take me for some drunken countryman:
139. I'd stand and mutter there until he caught
140. 'Hunchback and Sant and Fool,' and that they came
141. Under the three last crescents of the moon.
142. And then I'd stagger out.  He'd crack his wits
143. Day after day, yet never find the meaning.
144. And then he laughed to think that what seemed hard
145. Should be so simple -- a bat rose from the hazels
146. And circled round him with its squeaky cry,
147. The light in the tower window was put out.
