1. ALL things uncomely and broken, all things worn out and old,
2. The cry of a child by the roadway, the creak of a lumbering cart,
3. The heavy steps of the ploughman, splashing the wintry mould,
4. Are wronging your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.
5. The wrong of unshapely things is a wrong too great to be told;
6. I hunger to build them anew and sit on a green knoll apart,
7. With the earth and the sky and the water, re-made, like a casket of gold
8. For my dreams of your image that blossoms a rose in the deeps of my heart.
