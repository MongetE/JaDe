1. IF this importunate heart trouble your peace
2. With words lighter than air,
3. Or hopes that in mere hoping flicker and cease;
4. Crumple the rose in your hair;
5. And cover your lips with odorous twilight and say,
6. 'O Hearts of wind-blown flame!
7. O Winds, older than changing of night and day,
8. That murmuring and longing came
9. From marble cities loud with tabors of old
10. In dove-grey faery lands;
11. From battle-banners, fold upon purple fold,
12. Queens wrought with glimmering hands;
13. That saw young Niamh hover with love-lorn face
14. Above the wandering tide;
15. And lingered in the hidden desolate place
16. Where the last Phoenix died,
17. And wrapped the flames above his holy head;
18. And still murmur and long:
19. O piteous Hearts, changing till change be dead
20. In a tumultuous song':
21. And cover the pale blossoms of your breast
22. With your dim heavy hair,
23. And trouble with a sigh for all things longing for rest
24. The odorous twilight there.
