1. I care not what the sailors say:
2. All those dreadful thunder-stones,
3. All that storm that blots the day
4. Can but show that Heaven yawns;
5. Great Europa played the fool
6. That changed a lover for a bull.
7. Fol de rol, fol de rol.
8. To round that shell's elaborate whorl,
9. Adorning every secret track
10. With the delicate mother-of-pearl,
11. Made the joints of Heaven crack:
12. So never hang your heart upon
13. A roaring, ranting journeyman.
14. Fol de rol, fol de rol.
