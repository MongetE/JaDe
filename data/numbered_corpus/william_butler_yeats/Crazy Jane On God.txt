1. That lover of a night
2. Came when he would,
3. Went in the dawning light
4. Whether I would or no;
5. Men come, men go;
6. All things remain in God.
7. Banners choke the sky;
8. Men-at-arms tread;
9. Armoured horses neigh
10. In the narrow pass:
11. All things remain in God.
12. Before their eyes a house
13. That from childhood stood
14. Uninhabited, ruinous,
15. Suddenly lit up
16. From door to top:
17. All things remain in God.
18. I had wild Jack for a lover;
19. Though like a road
20. That men pass over
21. My body makes no moan
22. But sings on:
23. All things remain in God.
