1. THEY must to keep their certainty accuse
2. All that are different of a base intent;
3. Pull down established honour; hawk for news
4. Whatever their loose fantasy invent
5. And murmur it with bated breath, as though
6. The abounding gutter had been Helicon
7. Or calumny a song.  How can they know
8. Truth flourishes where the student's lamp has shone,
9. And there alone, that have no Solitude?
10. So the crowd come they care not what may come.
11. They have loud music, hope every day renewed
12. And heartier loves; that lamp is from the tomb.
