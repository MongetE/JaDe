1. I WANDER by the edge
2. Of this desolate lake
3. Where wind cries in the sedge:

4. Until the axle break
5. That keeps the stars in their round,
6. And hands hurl in the deep
7. The banners of East and West,
8. And the girdle of light is unhound,
9. Your breast will not lie by the breast
10. Of your beloved in sleep.
