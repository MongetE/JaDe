1. He. Dear, I must be gone
2. While night Shuts the eyes
3. Of the household spies;
4. That song announces dawn.

5. She. No, night's bird and love's
6. Bids all true lovers rest,
7. While his loud song reproves
8. The murderous stealth of day.

9. He. Daylight already flies
10. From mountain crest to crest

11. She. That light is from the moon.

12. He. That bird...

13. She.                     Let him sing on,
14. I offer to love's play
15. My dark declivities.
