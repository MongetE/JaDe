1. BE you still, be you still, trembling heart;
2. Remember the wisdom out of the old days:
3. Him who trembles before the flame and the flood,
4. And the winds that blow through the starry ways,
5. Let the starry winds and the flame and the flood
6. Cover over and hide, for he has no part
7. With the lonely, majestical multitude.
