1. He. Opinion is not worth a rush;
2. In this altar-piece the knight,
3. Who grips his long spear so to push
4. That dragon through the fading light,
5. Loved the lady; and it's plain
6. The half-dead dragon was her thought,
7. That every morning rose again
8. And dug its claws and shrieked and fought.
9. Could the impossible come to pass
10. She would have time to turn her eyes,
11. Her lover thought, upon the glass
12. And on the instant would grow wise.

13. She. You mean they argued.

14. He. Put it so;
15. But bear in mind your lover's wage
16. Is what your looking-glass can show,
17. And that he will turn green with rage
18. At all that is not pictured there.

19. She. May I not put myself to college?

20. He. Go pluck Athena by the hair;
21. For what mere book can grant a knowledge
22. With an impassioned gravity
23. Appropriate to that beating breast,
24. That vigorous thigh, that dreaming eye?
25. And may the devil take the rest.

26. She. And must no beautiful woman be
27. Learned like a man?

28. He. Paul Veronese
29. And all his sacred company
30. Imagined bodies all their days
31. By the lagoon you love so much,
32. For proud, soft, ceremonious proof
33. That all must come to sight and touch;
34. While Michael Angelo's Sistine roof
35. His 'Morning' and his 'Night' disclose
36. How sinew that has been pulled tight,
37. Or it may be loosened in repose,
38. Can rule by supernatural right
39. Yet be but sinew.

40. She. I have heard said
41. There is great danger in the body.

42. He. Did God in portioning wine and bread
43. Give man His thought or His mere body?

44. She. My wretched dragon is perplexed.

45. He. I have principles to prove me right.
46. It follows from this Latin text
47. That blest souls are not composite,
48. And that all beautiful women may
49. Live in uncomposite blessedness,
50. And lead us to the like -- if they
51. Will banish every thought, unless
52. The lineaments that please their view
53. When the long looking-glass is full,
54. Even from the foot-sole think it too.

55. She. They say such different things at school.
