1. O but there is wisdom
2. In what the sages said;
3. But stretch that body for a while
4. And lay down that head
5. Till I have told the sages
6. Where man is comforted.

7. How could passion run so deep
8. Had I never thought
9. That the crime of being born
10. Blackens all our lot?
11. But where the crime's committed
12. The crime can be forgot.
