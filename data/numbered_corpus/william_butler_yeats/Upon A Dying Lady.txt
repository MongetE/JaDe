1. I
2. Her Courtesy

3. WITH the old kindness, the old distinguished grace,
4. She lies, her lovely piteous head amid dull red hair
5. propped upon pillows, rouge on the pallor of her face.
6. She would not have us sad because she is lying there,
7. And when she meets our gaze her eyes are laughter-lit,
8. Her speech a wicked tale that we may vie with her,
9. Matching our broken-hearted wit against her wit,
10. Thinking of saints and of petronius Arbiter.

11. II
12. Curtain Artist bring her Dolls and Drawings
13. Bring where our Beauty lies
14. A new modelled doll, or drawing,
15. With a friend's or an enemy's
16. Features, or maybe showing
17. Her features when a tress
18. Of dull red hair was flowing
19. Over some silken dress
20. Cut in the Turkish fashion,
21. Or, it may be, like a boy's.
22. We have given the world our passion,
23. We have naught for death but toys.

24. III
25. She turns the Dolls' Faces to the Wall
26. Because to-day is some religious festival
27. They had a priest say Mass, and even the Japanese,
28. Heel up and weight on toe, must face the wall
29. -- Pedant in passion, learned in old courtesies,
30. Vehement and witty she had seemed -- ; the Venetian lady
31. Who had seemed to glide to some intrigue in her red shoes,
32. Her domino, her panniered skirt copied from Longhi;
33. The meditative critic; all are on their toes,
34. Even our Beauty with her Turkish trousers on.
35. Because the priest must have like every dog his day
36. Or keep us all awake with baying at the moon,
37. We and our dolls being but the world were best away.

38. IV
39. The End of Day
40. She is playing like a child
41. And penance is the play,
42. Fantastical and wild
43. Because the end of day
44. Shows her that some one soon
45. Will come from the house, and say --
46. Though play is but half done --
47. 'Come in and leave the play.'

48. V
49. Her Race
50. She has not grown uncivil
51. As narrow natures would
52. And called the pleasures evil
53. Happier days thought good;
54. She knows herself a woman,
55. No red and white of a face,
56. Or rank, raised from a common
57. Vnreckonable race;
58. And how should her heart fail her
59. Or sickness break her will
60. With her dead brother's valour
61. For an example still?

62. VI
63. Her Courage
64. When her soul flies to the predestined dancing-place
65. (I have no speech but symbol, the pagan speech I made
66. Amid the dreams of youth) let her come face to face,
67. Amid that first astonishment, with Grania's shade,
68. All but the terrors of the woodland flight forgot
69. That made her Diatmuid dear, and some old cardinal
70. Pacing with half-closed eyelids in a sunny spot
71. Who had murmured of Giorgione at his latest breath --
72. Aye, and Achilles, Timor, Babar, Barhaim, all
73. Who have lived in joy and laughed into the face of Death.

74. VII
75. Her Friends bring her a Christmas Tree
76. pardon, great enemy,
77. Without an angry thought
78. We've carried in our tree,
79. And here and there have bought
80. Till all the boughs are gay,
81. And she may look from the bed
82. On pretty things that may
83. please a fantastic head.
84. Give her a little grace,
85. What if a laughing eye
86. Have looked into your face?
87. It is about to die.
