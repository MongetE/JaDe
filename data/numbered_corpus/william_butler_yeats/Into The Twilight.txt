1. OUT-WORN heart, in a time out-worn,
2. Come clear of the nets of wrong and right;
3. Laugh, heart, again in the grey twilight,
4. Sigh, heart, again in the dew of the morn.
5. Your mother Eire is aways young,
6. Dew ever shining and twilight grey;
7. Though hope fall from you and love decay,
8. Burning in fires of a slanderous tongue.
9. Come, heart, where hill is heaped upon hill:
10. For there the mystical brotherhood
11. Of sun and moon and hollow and wood
12. And river and stream work out their will;
13. And God stands winding His lonely horn,
14. And time and the world are ever in flight;
15. And love is less kind than the grey twilight,
16. And hope is less dear than the dew of the morn.
