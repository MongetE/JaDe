1. Fasten your hair with a golden pin,
2. And bind up every wandering tress;
3. I bade my heart build these poor rhymes:
4. It worked at them, day out, day in,
5. Building a sorrowful loveliness
6. Out of the battles of old times.

7. You need but lift a pearl-pale hand,
8. And bind up your long hair and sigh;
9. And all men's hearts must burn and beat;
10. And candle-like foam on the dim sand,
11. And stars climbing the dew-dropping sky,
12. Live but to light your passing feet.
