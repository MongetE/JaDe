1. Although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face,
2. And even old men's eyes grew dim, this hand alone,
3. Like some last courtier at a gypsy camping-place
4. Babbling of fallen majesty, records what's gone.

5. The lineaments, a heart that laughter has made sweet,
6. These, these remain, but I record what's gone. A crowd
7. Will gather, and not know it walks the very street
8. Whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud.
