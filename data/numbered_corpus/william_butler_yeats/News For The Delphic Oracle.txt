1. THERE all the golden codgers lay,
2. There the silver dew,
3. And the great water sighed for love,
4. And the wind sighed too.
5. Man-picker Niamh leant and sighed
6. By Oisin on the grass;
7. There sighed amid his choir of love
8. Tall pythagoras.
9. plotinus came and looked about,
10. The salt-flakes on his breast,
11. And having stretched and yawned awhile
12. Lay sighing like the rest.
13. Straddling each a dolphin's back
14. And steadied by a fin,
15. Those Innocents re-live their death,
16. Their wounds open again.
17. The ecstatic waters laugh because
18. Their cries are sweet and strange,
19. Through their ancestral patterns dance,
20. And the brute dolphins plunge
21. Until, in some cliff-sheltered bay
22. Where wades the choir of love
23. Proffering its sacred laurel crowns,
24. They pitch their burdens off.
