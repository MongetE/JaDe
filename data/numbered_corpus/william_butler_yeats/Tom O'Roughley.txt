1. 'THOUGH logic-choppers rule the town,
2. And every man and maid and boy
3. Has marked a distant object down,
4. An aimless joy is a pure joy,'
5. Or so did Tom O'Roughley say
6. That saw the surges running by.
7. 'And wisdom is a butterfly
8. And not a gloomy bird of prey.
9. 'If little planned is little sinned
10. But little need the grave distress.
11. What's dying but a second wind?
12. How but in zig-zag wantonness
13. Could trumpeter Michael be so brave?'
14. Or something of that sort he said,
15. 'And if my dearest friend were dead
16. I'd dance a measure on his grave.'
