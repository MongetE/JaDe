1. I AM tired of cursing the Bishop,
2. (Said Crazy Jane)
3. Nine books or nine hats
4. Would not make him a man.
5. I have found something worse
6. To meditate on.
7. A King had some beautiful cousins.
8. But where are they gone?
9. Battered to death in a cellar,
10. And he stuck to his throne.
11. Last night I lay on the mountain.
12. (Said Crazy Jane)
13. There in a two-horsed carriage
14. That on two wheels ran
15. Great-bladdered Emer sat.
16. Her violent man
17. Cuchulain sat at her side;
18. Thereupon'
19. Propped upon my two knees,
20. I kissed a stone
21. I lay stretched out in the dirt
22. And I cried tears down.
