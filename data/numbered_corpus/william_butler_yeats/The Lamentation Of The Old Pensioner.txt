1. ALTHOUGH I shelter from the rain
2. Under a broken tree,
3. My chair was nearest to the fire
4. In every company
5. That talked of love or politics,
6. Ere Time transfigured me.
7. Though lads are making pikes again
8. For some conspiracy,
9. And crazy rascals rage their fill
10. At human tyranny,
11. My contemplations are of Time
12. That has transfigured me.There's not a woman turns her face
13. Upon a broken tree,
14. And yet the beauties that I loved
15. Are in my memory;
16. I spit into the face of Time
17. That has transfigured me.
