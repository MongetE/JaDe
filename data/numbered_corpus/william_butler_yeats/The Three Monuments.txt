1. THEY hold their public meetings where
2. Our most renowned patriots stand,
3. One among the birds of the air,
4. A stumpier on either hand;
5. And all the popular statesmen say
6. That purity built up the State
7. And after kept it from decay;
8. And let all base ambition be,
9. For intellect would make us proud
10. And pride bring in impurity:
11. The three old rascals laugh aloud.
