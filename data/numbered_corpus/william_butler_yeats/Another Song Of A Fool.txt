1. This great purple butterfly,
2. In the prison of my hands,
3. Has a learning in his eye
4. Not a poor fool understands.

5. Once he lived a schoolmaster
6. With a stark, denying look;
7. A string of scholars went in fear
8. Of his great birch and his great book.

9. Like the clangour of a bell,
10. Sweet and harsh, harsh and sweet.
11. That is how he learnt so well
12. To take the roses for his meat.
