1. Who talks of Plato's spindle;
2. What set it whirling round?
3. Eternity may dwindle,
4. Time is unwound,
5. Dan and Jerry Lout
6. Change their loves about.
7. However they may take it,
8. Before the thread began
9. I made, and may not break it
10. When the last thread has run,
11. A bargain with that hair
12. And all the windings there.
