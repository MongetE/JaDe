1. YOUR hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood,
2. Even where horrible green parrots call and swing.
3. My works are all stamped down into the sultry mud.
4. I knew that horse-play, knew it for a murderous thing.
5. What wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat,
6. And that alone; yet I, being driven half insane
7. Because of some green wing, gathered old mummy wheat
8. In the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain
9. And after baked it slowly in an oven; but now
10. I bring full-flavoured wine out of a barrel found
11. Where seven Ephesian topers slept and never knew
12. When Alexander's empire passed, they slept so sound.
13. Stretch out your limbs and sleep a long Saturnian sleep;
14. I have loved you better than my soul for all my words,
15. And there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep
16. Unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds.
