1. IF any man drew near
2. When I was young,
3. I thought, 'He holds her dear,'
4. And shook with hate and fear.
5. But O! 'twas bitter wrong
6. If he could pass her by
7. With an indifferent eye.
8. Whereon I wrote and wrought,
9. And now, being grey,
10. I dream that I have brought
11. To such a pitch my thought
12. That coming time can say,
13. 'He shadowed in a glass
14. What thing her body was.'
15. For she had fiery blood
16. When I was young,
17. And trod so sweetly proud
18. As 'twere upon a cloud,
19. A woman Homer sung,
20. That life and letters seem
21. But an heroic dream.
