1. O HURRY where by water among the trees
2. The delicate-stepping stag and his lady sigh,
3. When they have but looked upon their images --
4. Would none had ever loved but you and I!
5. Or have you heard that sliding silver-shoed
6. Pale silver-proud queen-woman of the sky,
7. When the sun looked out of his golden hood? --
8. O that none ever loved but you and I!
9. O hurty to the ragged wood, for there
10. I will drive all those lovers out and cry --
11. O my share of the world, O yellow hair!
12. No one has ever loved but you and I.
