1. A DOLL in the doll-maker's house
2. Looks at the cradle and bawls:
3. 'That is an insult to us.'
4. But the oldest of all the dolls,
5. Who had seen, being kept for show,
6. Generations of his sort,
7. Out-screams the whole shelf:  'Although
8. There's not a man can report
9. Evil of this place,
10. The man and the woman bring
11. Hither, to our disgrace,
12. A noisy and filthy thing.'
13. Hearing him groan and stretch
14. The doll-maker's wife is aware
15. Her husband has heard the wretch,
16. And crouched by the arm of his chair,
17. She murmurs into his ear,
18. Head upon shoulder leant:
19. 'My dear, my dear, O dear.
20. It was an accident.'
