1. I

2. A speckled cat and a tame hare
3. Eat at my hearthstone
4. And seep there;
5. And both look up to me alone
6. For learning and defence
7. As I look up to Providence.

8. I start out of my sleep to think
9. Some day I may forget
10. Their food and drink;
11. Or, the house door left unshut,
12. The hare may run till it's found
13. The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.
14. I bear a burden that might well try
15. Men that do all by rule,
16. And what can I
17. That am a wandering-witted fool
18. But pray to God that He ease
19. My great responsibilities?

20. II

21. I slept on my three-leged stool by the fire,
22. The speckled cat slept on my knee;
23. We never thought to enquire
24. Where the brown hare might be,
25. And whether the door were shut.
26. Who knows how she drank the wind
27. Stretched up on two legs from the mat,
28. Before she had settled her mind
29. To drum with her heel and to leap?
30. Had I but awakened from sleep
31. And called her name, she had heard,
32. It may be, and not have stirred,
33. That now, it may be, has found
34. The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.
