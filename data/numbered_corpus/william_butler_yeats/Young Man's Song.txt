1. 'She will change,' I cried.
2. 'Into a withered crone.'
3. The heart in my side,
4. That so still had lain,
5. In noble rage replied
6. And beat upon the bone:

7. 'Uplift those eyes and throw
8. Those glances unafraid:
9. She would as bravely show
10. Did all the fabric fade;
11. No withered crone I saw
12. Before the world was made.'

13. Abashed by that report,
14. For the heart cannot lie,
15. I knelt in the dirt.
16. And all shall bend the knee
17. To my offended heart
18. Until it pardon me.
