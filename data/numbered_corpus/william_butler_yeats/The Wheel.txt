1. THROUGH winter-time we call on spring,
2. And through the spring on summer call,
3. And when abounding hedges ring
4. Declare that winter's best of all;
5. And after that there s nothing good
6. Because the spring-time has not come --
7. Nor know that what disturbs our blood
8. Is but its longing for the tomb.
