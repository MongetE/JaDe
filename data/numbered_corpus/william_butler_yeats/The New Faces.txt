1. IF you, that have grown old, were the first dead,
2. Neither catalpa tree nor scented lime
3. Should hear my living feet, nor would I tread
4. Where we wrought that shall break the teeth of Time.
5. Let the new faces play what tricks they will
6. In the old rooms; night can outbalance day,
7. Our shadows rove the garden gravel still,
8. The living seem more shadowy than they.
