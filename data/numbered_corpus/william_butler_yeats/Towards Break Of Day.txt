1. WAS it the double of my dream
2. The woman that by me lay
3. Dreamed, or did we halve a dream
4. Under the first cold gleam of day?
5. I thought:  'There is a waterfall
6. Upon Ben Bulben side
7. That all my childhood counted dear;
8. Were I to travel far and wide
9. I could not find a thing so dear.'
10. My memories had magnified
11. So many times childish delight.
12. I would have touched it like a child
13. But knew my finger could but have touched
14. Cold stone and water.  I grew wild.
15. Even accusing Heaven because
16. It had set down among its laws:
17. Nothing that we love over-much
18. Is ponderable to our touch.
19. I dreamed towards break of day,
20. The cold blown spray in my nostril.
21. But she that beside me lay
22. Had watched in bitterer sleep
23. The marvellous stag of Arthur,
24. That lofty white stag, leap
25. From mountain steep to steep.
