1. I

2. BETWEEN extremities
3. Man runs his course;
4. A brand, or flaming breath.
5. Comes to destroy
6. All those antinomies
7. Of day and night;
8. The body calls it death,
9. The heart remorse.
10. But if these be right
11. What is joy?

12. II

13. A tree there is that from its topmost bough
14. Is half all glittering flame and half all green
15. Abounding foliage moistened with the dew;
16. And half is half and yet is all the scene;
17. And half and half consume what they renew,
18. And he that Attis' image hangs between
19. That staring fury and the blind lush leaf
20. May know not what he knows, but knows not grief

21. III

22. Get all the gold and silver that you can,
23. Satisfy ambition, animate
24. The trivial days and ram them with the sun,
25. And yet upon these maxims meditate:
26. All women dote upon an idle man
27. Although their children need a rich estate;
28. No man has ever lived that had enough
29. Of children's gratitude or woman's love.
30. No longer in Lethean foliage caught
31. Begin the preparation for your death
32. And from the fortieth winter by that thought
33. Test every work of intellect or faith,
34. And everything that your own hands have wrought
35. And call those works extravagance of breath
36. That are not suited for such men as come
37. proud, open-eyed and laughing to the tomb.

38. IV

39. My fiftieth year had come and gone,
40. I sat, a solitary man,
41. In a crowded London shop,
42. An open book and empty cup
43. On the marble table-top.
44. While on the shop and street I gazed
45. My body of a sudden blazed;
46. And twenty minutes more or less
47. It seemed, so great my happiness,
48. That I was blessed and could bless.
49. Although the summer Sunlight gild
50. Cloudy leafage of the sky,
51. Or wintry moonlight sink the field
52. In storm-scattered intricacy,
53. I cannot look thereon,
54. Responsibility so weighs me down.
55. Things said or done long years ago,
56. Or things I did not do or say
57. But thought that I might say or do,
58. Weigh me down, and not a day
59. But something is recalled,
60. My conscience or my vanity appalled.
61. A rivery field spread out below,
62. An odour of the new-mown hay
63. In his nostrils, the great lord of Chou
64. Cried, casting off the mountain snow,
65. 'Let all things pass away.'
66. Wheels by milk-white asses drawn
67. Where Babylon or Nineveh
68. Rose; some conquer drew rein
69. And cried to battle-weary men,
70. 'Let all things pass away.'
71. From man's blood-sodden heart are sprung
72. Those branches of the night and day
73. Where the gaudy moon is hung.
74. What's the meaning of all song?
75. 'Let all things pass away.'

76. VII

77. The Soul.  Seek out reality, leave things that seem.
78. The Heart. What, be a singer born and lack a theme?
79. The Soul. Isaiah's coal, what more can man desire?
80. The Heart. Struck dumb in the simplicity of fire!
81. The Soul. Look on that fire, salvation walks within.
82. The Heart. What theme had Homer but original sin?

83. VIII

84. Must we part, Von Hugel, though much alike, for we
85. Accept the miracles of the saints and honour sanctity?
86. The body of Saint Teresa lies undecayed in tomb,
87. Bathed in miraculous oil, sweet odours from it come,
88. Healing from its lettered slab.  Those self-same hands perchance
89. Eternalised the body of a modern saint that once
90. Had scooped out pharaoh's mummy.  I -- though heart might find relief
91. Did I become a Christian man and choose for my belief
92. What seems most welcome in the tomb -- play a pre- destined part.
93. Homer is my example and his unchristened heart.
94. The lion and the honeycomb, what has Scripture said?
95. So get you gone, Von Hugel, though with blessings on your head.
