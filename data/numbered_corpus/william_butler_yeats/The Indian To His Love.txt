1. THE island dreams under the dawn
2. And great boughs drop tranquillity;
3. The peahens dance on a smooth lawn,
4. A parrot sways upon a tree,
5. Raging at his own image in the enamelled sea.
6. Here we will moor our lonely ship
7. And wander ever with woven hands,
8. Murmuring softly lip to lip,
9. Along the grass, along the sands,
10. Murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands:
11. How we alone of mortals are
12. Hid under quiet boughs apart,
13. While our love grows an Indian star,
14. A meteor of the burning heart,
15. One with the tide that gleams, the wings that gleam
16. and dart,
17. The heavy boughs, the burnished dove
18. That moans and sighs a hundred days:
19. How when we die our shades will rove,
20. When eve has hushed the feathered ways,
21. With vapoury footsole by the water's drowsy blaze.
