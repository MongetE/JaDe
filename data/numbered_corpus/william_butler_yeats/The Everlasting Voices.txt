1. O SWEET everlasting Voices, be still;
2. Go to the guards of the heavenly fold
3. And bid them wander obeying your will,
4. Flame under flame, till Time be no more;
5. Have you not heard that our hearts are old,
6. That you call in birds, in wind on the hill,
7. In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore?
8. O sweet everlasting Voices, be still.
