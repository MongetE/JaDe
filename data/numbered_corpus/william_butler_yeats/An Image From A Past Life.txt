1. He. Never until this night have I been stirred.
2. The elaborate starlight throws a reflection
3. On the dark stream,
4. Till all the eddies gleam;
5. And thereupon there comes that scream
6. From terrified, invisible beast or bird:
7. Image of poignant recollection.

8. She. An image of my heart that is smitten through
9. Out of all likelihood, or reason,
10. And when at last,
11. Youth's bitterness being past,
12. I had thought that all my days were cast
13. Amid most lovely places; smitten as though
14. It had not learned its lesson.

15. He. Why have you laid your hands upon my eyes?
16. What can have suddenly alarmed you
17. Whereon 'twere best
18. My eyes should never rest?
19. What is there but the slowly fading west,
20. The river imaging the flashing skies,
21. All that to this moment charmed you?

22. She. A Sweetheart from another life floats there
23. As though she had been forced to linger
24. From vague distress
25. Or arrogant loveliness,
26. Merely to loosen out a tress
27. Among the starry eddies of her hair
28. Upon the paleness of a finger.

29. He. But why should you grow suddenly afraid
30. And start -- I at your shoulder --
31. Imagining
32. That any night could bring
33. An image up, or anything
34. Even to eyes that beauty had driven mad,
35. But images to make me fonder?

36. She. Now She has thrown her arms above her head;
37. Whether she threw them up to flout me,
38. Or but to find,
39. Now that no fingers bind,
40. That her hair streams upon the wind,
41. I do not know, that know I am afraid
42. Of the hovering thing night brought me.
