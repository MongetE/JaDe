1. POETRY, music, I have loved, and yet
2. Because of those new dead
3. That come into my soul and escape
4. Confusion of the bed,
5. Or those begotten or unbegotten
6. Perning in a band,

7. I bend my body to the spade
8. Or grope with a dirty hand.
9. Or those begotten or unbegotten,
10. For I would not recall
11. Some that being unbegotten
12. Are not individual,
13. But copy some one action,
14. Moulding it of dust or sand,

15. I bend my body to the spade
16. Or grope with a dirty hand.
17. An old ghost's thoughts are lightning,
18. To follow is to die;
19. Poetry and music I have banished,
20. But the stupidity
21. Of root, shoot, blossom or clay
22. Makes no demand.

23. I bend my body to the spade
24. Or grope with a dirty hand.
