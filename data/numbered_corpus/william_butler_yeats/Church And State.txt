1. HERE is fresh matter, poet,
2. Matter for old age meet;
3. Might of the Church and the State,
4. Their mobs put under their feet.
5. O but heart's wine shall run pure,
6. Mind's bread grow sweet.
7. That were a cowardly song,
8. Wander in dreams no more;
9. What if the Church and the State
10. Are the mob that howls at the door!
11. Wine shall run thick to the end,
12. Bread taste sour.
