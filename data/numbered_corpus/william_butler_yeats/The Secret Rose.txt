1. FAR-OFF, most secret, and inviolate Rose,
2. Enfold me in my hour of hours; where those
3. Who sought thee in the Holy Sepulchre,
4. Or in the wine-vat, dwell beyond the stir
5. And tumult of defeated dreams; and deep
6. Among pale eyelids, heavy with the sleep
7. Men have named beauty.  Thy great leaves enfold
8. The ancient beards, the helms of ruby and gold
9. Of the crowned Magi; and the king whose eyes
10. Saw the pierced Hands and Rood of elder rise
11. In Druid vapour and make the torches dim;
12. Till vain frenzy awoke and he died; and him
13. Who met Fand walking among flaming dew
14. By a grey shore where the wind never blew,
15. And lost the world and Emer for a kiss;
16. And him who drove the gods out of their liss,
17. And till a hundred moms had flowered red
18. Feasted, and wept the barrows of his dead;
19. And the proud dreaming king who flung the crown
20. And sorrow away, and calling bard and clown
21. Dwelt among wine-stained wanderers in deep woods:
22. And him who sold tillage, and house, and goods,
23. And sought through lands and islands numberless years,
24. Until he found, with laughter and with tears,
25. A woman of so shining loveliness
26. That men threshed corn at midnight by a tress,
27. A little stolen tress.  I, too, await
28. The hour of thy great wind of love and hate.
29. When shall the stars be blown about the sky,
30. Like the sparks blown out of a smithy, and die?
31. Surely thine hour has come, thy great wind blows,
32. Far-off, most secret, and inviolate Rose?
