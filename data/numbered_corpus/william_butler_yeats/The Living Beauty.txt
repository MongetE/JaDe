1. I BADE, because the wick and oil are spent
2. And frozen are the channels of the blood,
3. My discontented heart to draw content
4. From beauty that is cast out of a mould
5. In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears,
6. Appears, but when wc have gone is gone again,
7. Being more indifferent to our solitude
8. Than 'twere an apparition.  O heart, we are old;
9. The living beauty is for younger men:
10. We cannot pay its rribute of wild tears.
