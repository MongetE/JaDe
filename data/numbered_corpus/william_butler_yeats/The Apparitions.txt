8. The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger.
9. I have found nothing half so good
10. As my long-planned half solitude,
11. Where I can sit up half the night
12. With some friend that has the wit
13. Not to allow his looks to tell
14. When I am unintelligible.
15. Fifteen apparitions have I seen;
16. The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger.
17. When a man grows old his joy
18. Grows more deep day after day,
19. His empty heart is full at length,
20. But he has need of all that strength
21. Because of the increasing Night
22. That opens her mystery and fright.
23. Fifteen apparitions have I seen;
24. The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger.
