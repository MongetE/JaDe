1. We, unaccustomed to courage
2. exiles from delight
3. live coiled in shells of loneliness
4. until love leaves its high holy temple
5. and comes into our sight
6. to liberate us into life.

7. Love arrives
8. and in its train come ecstasies
9. old memories of pleasure
10. ancient histories of pain.
11. Yet if we are bold,
12. love strikes away the chains of fear
13. from our souls.

14. We are weaned from our timidity
15. In the flush of love's light
16. we dare be brave
17. And suddenly we see
18. that love costs all we are
19. and will ever be.
20. Yet it is only love
21. which sets us free.
