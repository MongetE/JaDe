1. You may write me down in history
2. With your bitter, twisted lies,
3. You may tread me in the very dirt
4. But still, like dust, I'll rise.

5. Does my sassiness upset you?
6. Why are you beset with gloom?
7. 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
8. Pumping in my living room.

9. Just like moons and like suns,
10. With the certainty of tides,
11. Just like hopes springing high,
12. Still I'll rise.

13. Did you want to see me broken?
14. Bowed head and lowered eyes?
15. Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
16. Weakened by my soulful cries.

17. Does my haughtiness offend you?
18. Don't you take it awful hard
19. 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
20. Diggin' in my own back yard.

21. You may shoot me with your words,
22. You may cut me with your eyes,
23. You may kill me with your hatefulness,
24. But still, like air, I'll rise.

25. Does my sexiness upset you?
26. Does it come as a surprise
27. That I dance like I've got diamonds
28. At the meeting of my thighs?

29. Out of the huts of history's shame
30. I rise
31. Up from a past that's rooted in pain
32. I rise
33. I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
34. Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
35. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
36. I rise
37. Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
38. I rise
39. Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
40. I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
41. I rise
42. I rise
43. I rise.
