1. Preacher, don't send me
2. when I die
3. to some big ghetto
4. in the sky
5. where rats eat cats
6. of the leopard type
7. and Sunday brunch
8. is grits and tripe.

9. I've known those rats
10. I've seen them kill
11. and grits I've had
12. would make a hill,
13. or maybe a mountain,
14. so what I need
15. from you on Sunday
16. is a different creed.

17. Preacher, please don't
18. promise me
19. streets of gold
20. and milk for free.
21. I stopped all milk
22. at four years old
23. and once I'm dead
24. I won't need gold.

25. I'd call a place
26. pure paradise
27. where families are loyal
28. and strangers are nice,
29. where the music is jazz
30. and the season is fall.
31. Promise me that
32. or nothing at all.
