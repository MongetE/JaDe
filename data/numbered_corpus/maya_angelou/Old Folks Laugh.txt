1. They have spent their
2. content of simpering,
3. holding their lips this
4. and that way, winding
5. the lines between
6. their brows. Old folks
7. allow their bellies to jiggle like slow
8. tambourines.
9. The hollers
10. rise up and spill
11. over any way they want.
12. When old folks laugh, they free the world.
13. They turn slowly, slyly knowing
14. the best and the worst
15. of remembering.
16. Saliva glistens in
17. the corners of their mouths,
18. their heads wobble
19. on brittle necks, but
20. their laps
21. are filled with memories.
22. When old folks laugh, they consider the promise
23. of dear painless death, and generously
24. forgive life for happening
25. to them.
