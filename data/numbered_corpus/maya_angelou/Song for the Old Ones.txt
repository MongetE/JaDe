1. My Fathers sit on benches
2. their flesh counts every plank
3. the slats leave dents of darkness
4. deep in their withered flanks.

5. They nod like broken candles
6. all waxed and burnt profound
7. they say 'It's understanding
8. that makes the world go round.'

9. There in those pleated faces
10. I see the auction block
11. the chains and slavery's coffles
12. the whip and lash and stock.

13. My Fathers speak in voices
14. that shred my fact and sound
15. they say 'It's our submission
16. that makes the world go round.'

17. They used the finest cunning
18. their naked wits and wiles
19. the lowly Uncle Tomming
20. and Aunt Jemima's smiles.

21. They've laughed to shield their crying
22. then shuffled through their dreams
23. and stepped 'n' fetched a country
24. to write the blues with screams.

25. I understand their meaning
26. it could and did derive
27. from living on the edge of death
28. They kept my race alive.
