1. Beloveds, now we know that we know nothing
2. Now that our bright and shining star can slip away from our fingertips like a puff of summer wind

3. Without notice, our dear love can escape our doting embrace
4. Sing our songs among the stars and and walk our dances across the face of the moon

5. In the instant we learn that Michael is gone we know nothing
6. No clocks can tell our time and no oceans can rush our tides
7. With the abrupt absence of our treasure

8. Though we our many, each of us is achingly alone
9. Piercingly alone
10. Only when we confess our confusion can we remember that he was a gift to us and we did have him

11. He came to us from the Creator, trailing creativity in abundance
12. Despite the anguish of life he was sheathed in mother love and family love and survived and did more than that

13. He thrived with passion and compassion, humor and style
14. We had him
15. Whether we knew who he was or did not know, he was ours and we were his
16. We had him

17. Beautiful, delighting our eyes
18. He raked his hat slant over his brow and took a pose on his toes for all of us and we laughed and stomped our feet for him

19. We were enchanted with his passion because he held nothing
20. He gave us all he had been given

21. Today in Tokyo, beneath the Eiffel Tower, in Ghana's Blackstar Square, in Johannesburg, in Pittsburgh, in Birmingham, Alabama and Birmingham England, we are missing Michael Jackson

22. But we do know that we had him
23. And we are the world.
