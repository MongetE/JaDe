1. When I think about myself,
2. I almost laugh myself to death,
3. My life has been one great big joke,
4. A dance that's walked
5. A song that's spoke,
6. I laugh so hard I almost choke
7. When I think about myself.

8. Sixty years in these folks' world
9. The child I works for calls me girl
10. I say 'Yes ma'am' for working's sake.
11. Too proud to bend
12. Too poor to break,
13. I laugh until my stomach ache,
14. When I think about myself.

15. My folks can make me split my side,
16. I laughed so hard I nearly died,
17. The tales they tell, sound just like lying,
18. They grow the fruit,
19. But eat the rind,
20. I laugh until I start to crying,
21. When I think about my folks.
