1. She lay, skin down in the moist dirt,
2. the canebrake rustling
3. with the whispers of leaves, and
4. loud longing of hounds and
5. the ransack of hunters crackling the near
6. branches.

7. She muttered, lifting her head a nod toward
8. freedom,
9. I shall not, I shall not be moved.


10. She gathered her babies,
11. their tears slick as oil on black faces,
12. their young eyes canvassing mornings of madness.
13. Momma, is Master going to sell you
14. from us tomorrow?


15. Yes.
16. Unless you keep walking more
17. and talking less.
18. Yes.
19. Unless the keeper of our lives
20. releases me from all commandments.
21. Yes.
22. And your lives,
23. never mine to live,
24. will be executed upon the killing floor of
25. innocents.
26. Unless you match my heart and words,
27. saying with me,


28. I shall not be moved.


29. In Virginia tobacco fields,
30. leaning into the curve
31. of Steinway
32. pianos, along Arkansas roads,
33. in the red hills of Georgia,
34. into the palms of her chained hands, she
35. cried against calamity,
36. You have tried to destroy me
37. and though I perish daily,


38. I shall not be moved.


39. Her universe, often
40. summarized into one black body
41. falling finally from the tree to her feet,
42. made her cry each time into a new voice.
43. All my past hastens to defeat,
44. and strangers claim the glory of my love,
45. Iniquity has bound me to his bed.


46. yet, I must not be moved.


47. She heard the names,
48. swirling ribbons in the wind of history:
49. nigger, nigger bitch, heifer,
50. mammy, property, creature, ape, baboon,
51. whore, hot tail, thing, it.
52. She said, But my description cannot
53. fit your tongue, for
54. I have a certain way of being in this world,


55. and I shall not, I shall not be moved.


56. No angel stretched protecting wings
57. above the heads of her children,
58. fluttering and urging the winds of reason
59. into the confusions of their lives.
60. The sprouted like young weeds,
61. but she could not shield their growth
62. from the grinding blades of ignorance, nor
63. shape them into symbolic topiaries.
64. She sent them away,
65. underground, overland, in coaches and
66. shoeless.


67. When you learn, teach.
68. When you get, give.
69. As for me,


70. I shall not be moved.


71. She stood in midocean, seeking dry land.
72. She searched God's face.
73. Assured,
74. she placed her fire of service
75. on the altar, and though
76. clothed in the finery of faith,
77. when she appeared at the temple door,
78. no sign welcomed
79. Black Grandmother, Enter here.


80. Into the crashing sound,
81. into wickedness, she cried,
82. No one, no, nor no one million
83. ones dare deny me God, I go forth
84. along, and stand as ten thousand.


85. The Divine upon my right
86. impels me to pull forever
87. at the latch on Freedom's gate.


88. The Holy Spirit upon my left leads my
89. feet without ceasing into the camp of the
90. righteous and into the tents of the free.


91. These momma faces, lemon-yellow, plum-purple,
92. honey-brown, have grimaced and twisted
93. down a pyramid for years.
94. She is Sheba the Sojourner,
95. Harriet and Zora,
96. Mary Bethune and Angela,
97. Annie to Zenobia.


98. She stands
99. before the abortion clinic,
100. confounded by the lack of choices.
101. In the Welfare line,
102. reduced to the pity of handouts.
103. Ordained in the pulpit, shielded
104. by the mysteries.
105. In the operating room,
106. husbanding life.
107. In the choir loft,
108. holding God in her throat.
109. On lonely street corners,
110. hawking her body.
111. In the classroom, loving the
112. children to understanding.


113. Centered on the world's stage,
114. she sings to her loves and beloveds,
115. to her foes and detractors:
116. However I am perceived and deceived,
117. however my ignorance and conceits,
118. lay aside your fears that I will be undone,


119. for I shall not be moved.
