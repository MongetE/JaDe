1. I've got the children to tend
2. The clothes to mend
3. The floor to mop
4. The food to shop
5. Then the chicken to fry
6. The baby to dry
7. I got company to feed
8. The garden to weed
9. I've got shirts to press
10. The tots to dress
11. The can to be cut
12. I gotta clean up this hut
13. Then see about the sick
14. And the cotton to pick.

15. Shine on me, sunshine
16. Rain on me, rain
17. Fall softly, dewdrops
18. And cool my brow again.

19. Storm, blow me from here
20. With your fiercest wind
21. Let me float across the sky
22. 'Til I can rest again.

23. Fall gently, snowflakes
24. Cover me with white
25. Cold icy kisses and
26. Let me rest tonight.

27. Sun, rain, curving sky
28. Mountain, oceans, leaf and stone
29. Star shine, moon glow
30. You're all that I can call my own.
