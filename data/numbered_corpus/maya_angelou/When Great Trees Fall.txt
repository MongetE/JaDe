1. When great trees fall,
2. rocks on distant hills shudder,
3. lions hunker down
4. in tall grasses,
5. and even elephants
6. lumber after safety.

7. When great trees fall
8. in forests,
9. small things recoil into silence,
10. their senses
11. eroded beyond fear.

12. When great souls die,
13. the air around us becomes
14. light, rare, sterile.
15. We breathe, briefly.
16. Our eyes, briefly,
17. see with
18. a hurtful clarity.
19. Our memory, suddenly sharpened,
20. examines,
21. gnaws on kind words
22. unsaid,
23. promised walks
24. never taken.

25. Great souls die and
26. our reality, bound to
27. them, takes leave of us.
28. Our souls,
29. dependent upon their
30. nurture,
31. now shrink, wizened.
32. Our minds, formed
33. and informed by their
34. radiance,
35. fall away.
36. We are not so much maddened
37. as reduced to the unutterable ignorance
38. of dark, cold
39. caves.

40. And when great souls die,
41. after a period peace blooms,
42. slowly and always
43. irregularly.  Spaces fill
44. with a kind of
45. soothing electric vibration.
46. Our senses, restored, never
47. to be the same, whisper to us.
48. They existed.  They existed.
49. We can be.  Be and be
50. better.  For they existed.
