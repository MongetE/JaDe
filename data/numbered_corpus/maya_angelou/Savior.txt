1. Petulant priests, greedy
2. centurions, and one million
3. incensed gestures stand
4. between your love and me.

5. Your agape sacrifice
6. is reduced to colored glass,
7. vapid penance, and the
8. tedium of ritual.

9. Your footprints yet
10. mark the crest of
11. billowing seas but
12. your joy
13. fades upon the tablets
14. of ordained prophets.

15. Visit us again, Savior.
16. Your children, burdened with
17. disbelief, blinded by a patina
18. of wisdom,
19. carom down this vale of
20. fear. We cry for you
21. although we have lost
22. your name.
