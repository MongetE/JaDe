1. Lying, thinking
2. Last night
3. How to find my soul a home
4. Where water is not thirsty
5. And bread loaf is not stone
6. I came up with one thing
7. And I don't believe I'm wrong
8. That nobody,
9. But nobody
10. Can make it out here alone.
11. Alone, all alone
12. Nobody, but nobody
13. Can make it out here alone.
14. There are some millionaires
15. With money they can't use
16. Their wives run round like banshees
17. Their children sing the blues
18. They've got expensive doctors
19. To cure their hearts of stone.
20. But nobody
21. No, nobody
22. Can make it out here alone.
23. Alone, all alone
24. Nobody, but nobody
25. Can make it out here alone.
26. Now if you listen closely
27. I'll tell you what I know
28. Storm clouds are gathering
29. The wind is gonna blow
30. The race of man is suffering
31. And I can hear the moan,
32. 'Cause nobody,
33. But nobody
34. Can make it out here alone.
35. Alone, all alone
36. Nobody, but nobody
37. Can make it out here alone.
