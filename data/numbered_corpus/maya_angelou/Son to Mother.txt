1. I start no
2. wars, raining poison
3. on cathedrals,
4. melting Stars of David
5. into golden faucets
6. to be lighted by lamps
7. shaded by human skin.

8. I set no
9. store on the strange lands,
10. send no
11. missionaries beyond my
12. borders,
13. to plunder secrets
14. and barter souls.

15. They
16. say you took my manhood,
17. Momma.
18. Come sit on my lap
19. and tell me,
20. what do you want me to say
21. to them, just
22. before I annihilate
23. their ignorance ?
