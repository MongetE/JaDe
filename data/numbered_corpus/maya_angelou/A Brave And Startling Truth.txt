1. We, this people, on a small and lonely planet
2. Traveling through casual space
3. Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns
4. To a destination where all signs tell us
5. It is possible and imperative that we learn
6. A brave and startling truth

7. And when we come to it
8. To the day of peacemaking
9. When we release our fingers
10. From fists of hostility
11. And allow the pure air to cool our palms

12. When we come to it
13. When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate
14. And faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean
15. When battlefields and coliseum
16. No longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters
17. Up with the bruised and bloody grass
18. To lie in identical plots in foreign soil

19. When the rapacious storming of the churches
20. The screaming racket in the temples have ceased
21. When the pennants are waving gaily
22. When the banners of the world tremble
23. Stoutly in the good, clean breeze

24. When we come to it
25. When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders
26. And children dress their dolls in flags of truce
27. When land mines of death have been removed
28. And the aged can walk into evenings of peace
29. When religious ritual is not perfumed
30. By the incense of burning flesh
31. And childhood dreams are not kicked awake
32. By nightmares of abuse

33. When we come to it
34. Then we will confess that not the Pyramids
35. With their stones set in mysterious perfection
36. Nor the Gardens of Babylon
37. Hanging as eternal beauty
38. In our collective memory
39. Not the Grand Canyon
40. Kindled into delicious color
41. By Western sunsets

42. Nor the Danube, flowing its blue soul into Europe
43. Not the sacred peak of Mount Fuji
44. Stretching to the Rising Sun
45. Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi who, without favor,
46. Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores
47. These are not the only wonders of the world

48. When we come to it
49. We, this people, on this minuscule and kithless globe
50. Who reach daily for the bomb, the blade and the dagger
51. Yet who petition in the dark for tokens of peace
52. We, this people on this mote of matter
53. In whose mouths abide cankerous words
54. Which challenge our very existence
55. Yet out of those same mouths
56. Come songs of such exquisite sweetness
57. That the heart falters in its labor
58. And the body is quieted into awe

59. We, this people, on this small and drifting planet
60. Whose hands can strike with such abandon
61. That in a twinkling, life is sapped from the living
62. Yet those same hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness
63. That the haughty neck is happy to bow
64. And the proud back is glad to bend
65. Out of such chaos, of such contradiction
66. We learn that we are neither devils nor divines

67. When we come to it
68. We, this people, on this wayward, floating body
69. Created on this earth, of this earth
70. Have the power to fashion for this earth
71. A climate where every man and every woman
72. Can live freely without sanctimonious piety
73. Without crippling fear

74. When we come to it
75. We must confess that we are the possible
76. We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world
77. That is when, and only when
78. We come to it.
