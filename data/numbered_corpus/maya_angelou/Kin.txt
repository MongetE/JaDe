1. FOR BAILEY

2. We were entwined in red rings
3. Of blood and loneliness before
4. The first snows fell
5. Before muddy rivers seeded clouds
6. Above a virgin forest, and
7. Men ran naked, blue and black
8. Skinned into the warm embraces
9. Of Sheba, Eve and Lilith.
10. I was your sister.

11. You left me to force strangers
12. Into brother molds, exacting
13. Taxations they never
14. Owed or could ever pay.

15. You fought to die, thinking
16. In destruction lies the seed
17. Of birth. You may be right.

18. I will remember silent walks in
19. Southern woods and long talks
20. In low voices
21. Shielding meaning from the big ears
22. Of overcurious adults.

23. You may be right.
24. Your slow return from
25. Regions of terror and bloody
26. Screams, races my heart.
27. I hear again the laughter
28. Of children and see fireflies
29. Bursting tiny explosions in
30. An Arkansas twilight.
