1. FOR DAVID Pâ€”B

2. The eye follows, the land
3. Slips upward, creases down, forms
4. The gentle buttocks of a young
5. Giant. In the nestle,
6. Old adobe bricks, washed of
7. Whiteness, paled to umber,
8. Await another century.

9. Star Jasmine and old vines
10. Lay claim upon the ghosted land,
11. Then quiet pools whisper
12. Private childhood secrets.

13. Flush on inner cottage walls
14. Antiquitous faces,
15. Used to the gelid breath
16. Of old manors, glare disdainfully
17. Over breached time.

18. Around and through these
19. Cold phantasmatalities,
20. He walks, insisting
21. To the languid air,
22. Activity, music,
23. A generosity of graces.

24. His lupin fields spurn old
25. Deceit and agile poppies dance
26. In golden riot.   Each day is
27. Fulminant, exploding brightly
28. Under the gaze of his exquisite
29. Sires, frozen in the famed paint
30. Of dead masters. Audacious
31. Sunlight casts defiance
32. At their feet.
