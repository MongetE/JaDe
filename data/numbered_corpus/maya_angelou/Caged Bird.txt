1. The free bird leaps
2. on the back of the wind
3. and floats downstream
4. till the current ends
5. and dips his wings
6. in the orange sun rays
7. and dares to claim the sky.

8. But a bird that stalks
9. down his narrow cage
10. can seldom see through
11. his bars of rage
12. his wings are clipped and
13. his feet are tied
14. so he opens his throat to sing.

15. The caged bird sings
16. with fearful trill
17. of the things unknown
18. but longed for still
19. and his tune is heard
20. on the distant hill
21. for the caged bird
22. sings of freedom

23. The free bird thinks of another breeze
24. and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees
25. and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn
26. and he names the sky his own.

27. But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams
28. his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
29. his wings are clipped and his feet are tied
30. so he opens his throat to sing

31. The caged bird sings
32. with a fearful trill
33. of things unknown
34. but longed for still
35. and his tune is heard
36. on the distant hill
37. for the caged bird
38. sings of freedom.
