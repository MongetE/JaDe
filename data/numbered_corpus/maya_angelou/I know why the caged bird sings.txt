1. A free bird leaps on the back
2. Of the wind and floats downstream
3. Till the current ends and dips his wing
4. In the orange suns rays
5. And dares to claim the sky.

6. But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage
7. Can seldom see through his bars of rage
8. His wings are clipped and his feet are tied
9. So he opens his throat to sing.

10. The caged bird sings with a fearful trill
11. Of things unknown but longed for still
12. And his tune is heard on the distant hill for
13. The caged bird sings of freedom.

14. The free bird thinks of another breeze
15. And the trade winds soft through
16. The sighing trees
17. And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright
18. Lawn and he names the sky his own.

19. But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams
20. His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream
21. His wings are clipped and his feet are tied
22. So he opens his throat to sing.

23. The caged bird sings with
24. A fearful trill of things unknown
25. But longed for still and his
26. Tune is heard on the distant hill
27. For the caged bird sings of freedom.
