1. Televised news turns
2. a half-used day into
3. a waste of desolation.
4. If nothing wondrous preceded
5. the catastrophic announcements,
6. certainly nothing will follow, save
7. the sad-eyed faces of
8. bony children,
9. distended bellies making
10. mock at their starvation.
11. Why are they always
12. Black ?
13. Whom do they await ?
14. The lamb-chop flesh
15. reeks and cannot be
16. eaten. Even the
17. green peas roll on my plate
18. unmolested. Their innocence
19. matched by the helpless
20. hope in the children's faces.
21. Why do Black children
22. hope ? Who will bring
23. them peas and lamb chops
24. and one more morning ?
