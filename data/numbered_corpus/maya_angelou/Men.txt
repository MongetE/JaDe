1. When I was young, I used to
2. Watch behind the curtains
3. As men walked up and down the street. Wino men, old men.
4. Young men sharp as mustard.
5. See them. Men are always
6. Going somewhere.
7. They knew I was there. Fifteen
8. Years old and starving for them.
9. Under my window, they would pauses,
10. Their shoulders high like the
11. Breasts of a young girl,
12. Jacket tails slapping over
13. Those behinds,
14. Men.

15. One day they hold you in the
16. Palms of their hands, gentle, as if you
17. Were the last raw egg in the world. Then
18. They tighten up. Just a little. The
19. First squeeze is nice. A quick hug.
20. Soft into your defenselessness. A little
21. More. The hurt begins. Wrench out a
22. Smile that slides around the fear. When the
23. Air disappears,
24. Your mind pops, exploding fiercely, briefly,
25. Like the head of a kitchen match. Shattered.
26. It is your juice
27. That runs down their legs. Staining their shoes.
28. When the earth rights itself again,
29. And taste tries to return to the tongue,
30. Your body has slammed shut. Forever.
31. No keys exist.

32. Then the window draws full upon
33. Your mind. There, just beyond
34. The sway of curtains, men walk.
35. Knowing something.
36. Going someplace.
37. But this time, I will simply
38. Stand and watch.

39. Maybe.
