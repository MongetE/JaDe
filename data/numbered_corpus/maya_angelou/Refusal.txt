1. Beloved,
2. In what other lives or lands
3. Have I known your lips
4. Your Hands
5. Your Laughter brave
6. Irreverent.
7. Those sweet excesses that
8. I do adore.
9. What surety is there
10. That we will meet again,
11. On other worlds some
12. Future time undated.
13. I defy my body's haste.
14. Without the promise
15. Of one more sweet encounter
16. I will not deign to die.
