1. I keep on dying again.
2. Veins collapse, opening like the
3. Small fists of sleeping
4. Children.
5. Memory of old tombs,
6. Rotting flesh and worms do
7. Not convince me against
8. The challenge. The years
9. And cold defeat live deep in
10. Lines along my face.
11. They dull my eyes, yet
12. I keep on dying,
13. Because I love to live.
