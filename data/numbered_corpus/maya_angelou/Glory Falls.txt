1. Glory falls around us
2. as we sob
3. a dirge of
4. desolation on the Cross
5. and hatred is the ballast of
6. the rock
7. which his upon our necks
8. and underfoot.
9. We have woven
10. robes of silk
11. and clothed our nakedness
12. with tapestry.
13. From crawling on this
14. murky planet's floor
15. we soar beyond the
16. birds and
17. through the clouds
18. and edge our waays from hate
19. and blind despair and
20. bring horror
21. to our brothers, and to our sisters cheer.
22. We grow despite the
23. horror that we feed
24. upon our own
25. tomorrow.
26. We grow.
