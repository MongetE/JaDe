1. Your hands easy
2. weight, teasing the bees
3. hived in my hair, your smile at the
4. slope of my cheek. On the
5. occasion, you press
6. above me, glowing, spouting
7. readiness, mystery rapes
8. my reason

9. When you have withdrawn
10. your self and the magic, when
11. only the smell of your
12. love lingers between
13. my breasts, then, only
14. then, can I greedily consume
15. your presence.
