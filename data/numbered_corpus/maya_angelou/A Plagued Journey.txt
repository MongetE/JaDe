1. There is no warning rattle at the door
2. nor heavy feet to stomp the foyer boards.
3. Safe in the dark prison, I know that
4. light slides over
5. the fingered work of a toothless
6. woman in Pakistan.
7. Happy prints of
8. an invisible time are illumined.
9. My mouth agape
10. rejects the solid air and
11. lungs hold. The invader takes
12. direction and
13. seeps through the plaster walls.
14. It is at my chamber, entering
15. the keyhole, pushing
16. through the padding of the door.
17. I cannot scream. A bone
18. of fear clogs my throat.
19. It is upon me. It is
20. sunrise, with Hope
21. its arrogant rider.
22. My mind, formerly quiescent
23. in its snug encasement, is strained
24. to look upon their rapturous visages,
25. to let them enter even into me.
26. I am forced
27. outside myself to
28. mount the light and ride joined with Hope.

29. Through all the bright hours
30. I cling to expectation, until
31. darkness comes to reclaim me
32. as its own. Hope fades, day is gone
33. into its irredeemable place
34. and I am thrown back into the familiar
35. bonds of disconsolation.
36. Gloom crawls around
37. lapping lasciviously
38. between my toes, at my ankles,
39. and it sucks the strands of my
40. hair. It forgives my heady
41. fling with Hope. I am
42. joined again into its
43. greedy arms.
