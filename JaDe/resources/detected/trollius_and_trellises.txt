of course, I may die in the next ten minutes []
and I’m ready for that []
but what I’m really worried about is [pb_verb_adv]
that my editor-publisher might retire [pb_verb_adv]
even though he is ten years younger than [pb_verb_adv]
I.
it was just 25 years ago (I was at that ripe []
old age of 45) []
when we began our unholy alliance to [pb_verb_adv]
test the literary waters,
neither of us being much [pb_verb_adv]
known.
I think we had some luck and still have some []
of same []
yet [pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep]
the odds are pretty fair [pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep]
that he will opt for warm and pleasant [pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep]
afternoons [pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep]
in the garden [pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep]
long before I.
writing is its own intoxication [pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep]
while publishing and editing,
attempting to collect bills [pb_adj_noun]
carries its own [pb_adj_noun]
attrition [pb_adj_noun]
which also includes dealing with the [pb_adj_noun]
petty bitchings and demands [pb_adj_noun]
of many [pb_adj_noun]
so-called genius darlings who are [pb_adj_noun]
not.
I won’t blame him for getting []
out [pb_verb_adv]
and hope he sends me photos of his []
Rose Lane, his []
Gardenia Avenue.
will I have to seek other [pb_adj_noun]
promulgators?
that fellow in the Russian [pb_adj_noun]
fur hat?
or that beast in the East [pb_noun_prep]
with all that hair [pb_noun_prep]
in his ears, with those wet and [pb_noun_prep]
greasy lips?
or will my editor-publisher [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
upon exiting for that world of Trollius and [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
trellis [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
hand over the [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
machinery [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
of his former trade to a [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
cousin, a [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
daughter or [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
some Poundian from Big [pb_det_noun ,pb_adj_noun ,pb_noun_prep ,pb_noun_noun]
Sur?
or will he just pass the legacy on []
to the []
Shipping Clerk []
who will rise like []
Lazarus,
fingering new-found []
importance?
one can imagine terrible [pb_adj_noun]
things:
“Mr. Chinaski, all your work [pb_adj_noun]
must now be submitted in [pb_adj_noun]
Rondo form [pb_adj_noun]
and []
typed [pb_adj_noun]
triple-spaced on rice []
paper.” []
power corrupts,
life aborts []
and all you [pb_noun_prep]
have left []
is a [pb_det_noun]
bunch of [pb_det_noun]
warts.
“no, no, Mr. Chinaski:
Rondo form!” []
“hey, man,” I’ll ask,
“haven’t you heard of []
the thirties?” []
“the thirties? what’s []
that?” []
my present editor-publisher []
and I []
at times []
did discuss the thirties,
the Depression []
and []
some of the little tricks it [pb_adv_adv]
taught us— [pb_adv_adv]
like how to endure on almost [pb_adv_adv]
nothing [pb_adv_adv]
and move forward [pb_adv_adv]
anyhow.
well, John, if it happens enjoy your [pb_det_noun]
divertissement to [pb_det_noun]
plant husbandry,
cultivate and aerate [pb_det_noun]
between [pb_det_noun]
bushes, water only in the [pb_det_noun]
early morning, spread [pb_det_noun]
shredding to discourage [pb_det_noun]
weed growth [pb_det_noun]
and []
as I do in my writing:
use plenty of []
manure.
and thank you []
for locating me there at []
5124 DeLongpre Avenue []
somewhere between []
alcoholism and []
madness.
together we []
laid down the gauntlet []
and there are takers [pb_det_noun ,pb_v_chain]
even at this late date [pb_det_noun ,pb_v_chain]
still to be [pb_det_noun ,pb_v_chain]
found []
as the fire sings [pb_det_noun ,pb_v_chain]
through the [pb_det_noun ,pb_v_chain]
trees.
