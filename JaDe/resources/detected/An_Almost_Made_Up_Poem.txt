I see you drinking at a fountain with tiny [ex_subj_verb]
blue hands, no, your hands are not tiny [ex_subj_verb]
they are small, and the fountain is in France [?]
where you wrote me that last letter and [?]
I answered and never heard from you again.
you used to write insane poems about [pb_relword]
ANGELS AND GOD, all in upper case, and you [ex_subj_verb]
knew famous artists and most of them [ex_subj_verb]
were your lovers, and I wrote back, it's all right,
go ahead, enter their lives, I' not jealous [?]
because we' never met. we got close once in [?]
New Orleans, one half block, but never met, never [ex_subj_verb]
touched. so you went with the famous and wrote [pb_verb_prep]
about the famous, and, of course, what you found out [ex_subj_verb]
is that the famous are worried about [pb_noun_prep]
their fame -  not the beautiful young girl in bed [pb_noun_prep]
with them, who gives them that, and then awakens [pb_verb_prep]
in the morning to write upper case poems about [pb_relword]
ANGELS AND GOD. we know God is dead, they told [ex_dobj_verb]
us, but listening to you I wasn' sure. maybe [ex_subj_verb]
it was the upper case. you were one of the [?]
best female poets and I told the publishers,
editors, " her, print her, she' mad but she' [pb_det_noun]
magic. there' no lie in her fire." I loved you [?]
like a man loves a woman he never touches, only [pb_verb_adv]
writes to, keeps little photographs of. I would have [ex_subj_verb]
loved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling a [pb_verb_prep]
cigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,
but that didn' happen. your letters got sadder.
your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, all [ex_subj_verb]
lovers betray. it didn' help. you said [ex_subj_verb]
you had a crying bench and it was by a bridge and [ex_subj_verb]
the bridge was over a river and you sat on the crying [pb_noun_noun]
bench every night and wept for the lovers who had [ex_subj_verb]
hurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but never [pb_verb_prep]
heard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide [?]
3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met you [ex_subj_verb]
I would probably have been unfair to you or you [?]
to me. it was best like this.
