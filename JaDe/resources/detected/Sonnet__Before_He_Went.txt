BEFORE he went to feed with owls and bats [?]
Nebuchadnezzar had an ugly dream,
Worse than an Hus'if's when she thinks her cream [?]
Made a Naumachia for mice and rats.
So scared, he sent for that 'Good King of Cats' [?]
Young Daniel, who soon did pluck away the beam [pb_noun_prep]
From out his eye, and said he did not deem [?]
The sceptre worth a straw his Cushions old door-mats.
A horrid nightmare similar somewhat [pb_adv_adv]
Of late has haunted a most motley crew,
Most loggerheads and Chapmen we are told [?]
That any Daniel tho' he be a sot [?]
Can make the lying lips turn pale of hue [pb_noun_prep]
By belching out 'ye are that head of Gold.' [?]
