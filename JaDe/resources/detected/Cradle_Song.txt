FROM groves of spice,
O'er fields of rice,
Athwart the lotus-stream,
I bring for you,
Aglint with dew [ex_subj_verb]
A little lovely dream.
Sweet, shut your eyes,
The wild fire-fiies [?]
Dance through the fairy neem;
From the poppy-bole
For you I stole [ex_dobj_verb]
A little lovely dream.
Dear eyes, good-night,
In golden light [?]
The stars around you gleam;
On you I press
With soft caress [?]
A little lovely dream.
