ONCE in the dream of a night I stood [ex_dobj_verb]
Lone in the light of a magical wood,
Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang;
And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang,
And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed,
And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed [pb_verb_prep]
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.

Lone in the light of that magical grove,
I felt the stars of the spirits of Love [ex_subj_verb]
Gather and gleam round my delicate youth,
And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth;
To quench my longing I bent me low
By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow [pb_verb_prep]
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.
