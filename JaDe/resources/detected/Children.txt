A word will fill the little heart [pb_noun_prep]
With pleasure and with pride;
It is a harsh, a cruel thing,
That such can be denied.
And yet how many weary hours [?]
Those joyous creatures know;
How much of sorrow and restraint [ex_dobj_verb]
They to their elders owe!
How much they suffer from our faults!
How much from our mistakes!
How often, too, mistaken zeal [?]
An infant's misery makes!
We overrule and overteach,
We curb and we confine,
And put the heart to school too soon,
To learn our narrow line.
No: only taught by love to love,
Seems childhood's natural task;
Affection, gentleness, and hope,
Are all its brief years ask.
