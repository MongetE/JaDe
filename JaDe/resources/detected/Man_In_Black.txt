Where the three magenta [pb_noun_noun]
Breakwaters take the shove
And suck of the grey sea
To the left, and the wave [pb_noun_noun]
Unfists against the dun
Barb-wired headland of [pb_relword]
The Deer Island prison [pb_noun_prep]
With its trim piggeries,
Hen huts and cattle green
To the right, and March ice
Glazes the rock pools yet,
Snuff-colored sand cliffs rise [pb_verb_prep]
Over a great stone spit [pb_noun_adj]
Bared by each falling tide,
And you, across those white [pb_noun_adj]
Stones, strode out in you dead [pb_adj_adj]
Black coat, black shoes, and your [pb_det_noun]
Black hair till there you stood,
Fixed vortex on the far [pb_noun_adj]
Tip, riveting stones, air,
All of it, together.
