Where the three magenta [pb_noun_noun]
Breakwaters take the shove [?]
And suck of the grey sea [pb_verb_prep]
To the left, and the wave [?]
Unfists against the dun [?]
Barb-wired headland of [pb_relword]
The Deer Island prison
With its trim piggeries,
Hen huts and cattle green [?]
To the right, and March ice [pb_verb_prep]
Glazes the rock pools yet,
Snuff-colored sand cliffs rise [pb_verb_prep]
Over a great stone spit [pb_verb_prep]
Bared by each falling tide,
And you, across those white [pb_verb_prep]
Stones, strode out in you dead [ex_dobj_verb]
Black coat, black shoes, and your [pb_det_noun]
Black hair till there you stood,
Fixed vortex on the far [pb_noun_adj]
Tip, riveting stones, air,
All of it, together.
