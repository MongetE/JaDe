listen, he said, you ever seen a bunch of crabs in a [pb_det_noun]
bucket?
no, I told him.
well, what happens is that now and then one crab [ex_subj_verb]
will climb up on top of the others [?]
and begin to climb toward the top of the bucket,
then, just as he's about to escape [?]
another crab grabs him and pulls him back [?]
down.
really? I asked.
really, he said, and this job is just like that, none [ex_subj_verb]
of the others want anybody to get out of [?]
here. that's just the way it is [?]
in the postal service!
I believe you, I said.
just then the supervisor walked up and said,
you fellows were talking.
there is no talking allowed on this [pb_det_noun]
job.
I had been there for eleven and one-half [pb_noun_noun]
years.
I got up off my stool and climbed right up the [pb_det_noun]
supervisor [?]
and then I reached up and pulled myself right [?]
out of there.
it was so easy it was unbelievable.
but none of the others followed me.
and after that, whenever I had crab legs [ex_subj_verb]
I thought about that place.
I must have thought about that place [?]
maybe 5 or 6 times [pb_noun_prep]
before I switched to lobster.
