of course, I may die in the next ten minutes []
and I’m ready for that []
but what I’m really worried about is []
that my editor-publisher might retire [pb_verb_adv]
even though he is ten years younger than []
I.
it was just 25 years ago (I was at that ripe [pb_noun_adj]
old age of 45) []
when we began our unholy alliance to []
test the literary waters,
neither of us being much [pb_verb_adv]
known.
I think we had some luck and still have some []
of same []
yet []
the odds are pretty fair []
that he will opt for warm and pleasant [pb_noun_adj]
afternoons [pb_noun_prep]
in the garden []
long before I.
writing is its own intoxication
while publishing and editing,
attempting to collect bills []
carries its own [pb_noun_adj]
attrition []
which also includes dealing with the []
petty bitchings and demands []
of many []
so-called genius darlings who are []
not.
I won’t blame him for getting []
out []
and hope he sends me photos of his []
Rose Lane, his []
Gardenia Avenue.
will I have to seek other [pb_noun_adj]
promulgators?
that fellow in the Russian [pb_noun_adj]
fur hat?
or that beast in the East []
with all that hair [pb_noun_prep]
in his ears, with those wet and []
greasy lips?
or will my editor-publisher []
upon exiting for that world of Trollius and []
trellis []
hand over the []
machinery [pb_noun_prep]
of his former trade to a []
cousin, a []
daughter or []
some Poundian from Big [pb_noun_adj]
Sur?
or will he just pass the legacy on []
to the []
Shipping Clerk []
who will rise like []
Lazarus,
fingering new-found []
importance?
one can imagine terrible [pb_noun_adj]
things:
“Mr. Chinaski, all your work []
must now be submitted in []
Rondo form []
and []
typed []
triple-spaced on rice []
paper.” []
power corrupts,
life aborts []
and all you []
have left [pb_verb_chain]
is a []
bunch of []
warts.
“no, no, Mr. Chinaski:
Rondo form!”
“hey, man,” I’ll ask,
“haven’t you heard of [pb_noun_prep]
the thirties?” []
“the thirties? what’s []
that?” []
my present editor-publisher []
and I []
at times []
did discuss the thirties,
the Depression []
and []
some of the little tricks it []
taught us— []
like how to endure on almost []
nothing []
and move forward [pb_adv_adv]
anyhow.
well, John, if it happens enjoy your []
divertissement to []
plant husbandry,
cultivate and aerate []
between []
bushes, water only in the []
early morning, spread []
shredding to discourage []
weed growth []
and []
as I do in my writing:
use plenty of []
manure.
and thank you []
for locating me there at []
5124 DeLongpre Avenue []
somewhere between []
alcoholism and []
madness.
together we []
laid down the gauntlet []
and there are takers []
even at this late date []
still to be [pb_verb_chain]
found []
as the fire sings []
through the []
trees.
