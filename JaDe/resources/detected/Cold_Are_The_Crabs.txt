Cold are the crabs that crawl on yonder hills,
Colder the cucumbers that grow beneath,
And colder still the brazen chops that wreathe [ex_dobj_verb]
The tedious gloom of philosophic pills!
For when the tardy film of nectar fills [ex_subj_verb]
The simple bowls of demons and of men,
There lurks the feeble mouse, the homely hen,
And there the porcupine with all her quills.
Yet much remains - to weave a solemn strain [?]
That lingering sadly - slowly dies away,
Daily departing with departing day [?]
A pea-green gamut on a distant plain [pb_adj_adv]
When wily walrusses in congresses meet -
Such such is life -
