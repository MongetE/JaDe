We sit late, watching the dark slowly unfold:
No clock counts this.
When kisses are repeated and the arms hold [?]
There is no telling where time is.
It is midsummer: the leaves hang big and still:
Behind the eye a star,
Under the silk of the wrist a sea, tell [ex_dobj_verb]
Time is nowhere.
We stand; leaves have not timed the summer.
No clock now needs [?]
Tell we have only what we remember:
Minutes uproaring with our heads [pb_verb_prep]
Like an unfortunate King's and his Queen's [pb_det_noun]
When the senseless mob rules;
And quietly the trees casting their crowns [pb_noun_prep]
Into the pools.
