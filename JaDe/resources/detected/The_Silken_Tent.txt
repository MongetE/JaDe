She is as in a field a silken tent [pb_noun_prep]
At midday when the sunny summer breeze [ex_subj_verb]
Has dried the dew and all its ropes relent,
So that in guys it gently sways at ease,
And its supporting central cedar pole,
That is its pinnacle to heavenward [?]
And signifies the sureness of the soul,
Seems to owe naught to any single cord,
But strictly held by none, is loosely bound [?]
By countless silken ties of love and thought [?]
To every thing on earth the compass round,
And only by one's going slightly taut [?]
In the capriciousness of summer air [?]
Is of the slightlest bondage made aware.
