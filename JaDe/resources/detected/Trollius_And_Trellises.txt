of course, I may die in the next ten minutes [ex_subj_verb]
and I’m ready for that [ex_dobj_verb]
but what I’m really worried about is [?]
that my editor-publisher might retire [pb_verb_adv]
even though he is ten years younger than [?]
I.
it was just 25 years ago (I was at that ripe [pb_adj_adj]
old age of 45) [?]
when we began our unholy alliance to [?]
test the literary waters,
neither of us being much [pb_verb_adv]
known.
I think we had some luck and still have some [?]
of same [?]
yet [?]
the odds are pretty fair [?]
that he will opt for warm and pleasant [pb_noun_adj]
afternoons [pb_noun_prep]
in the garden [?]
long before I.
writing is its own intoxication [?]
while publishing and editing,
attempting to collect bills [?]
carries its own [pb_det_noun]
attrition [?]
which also includes dealing with the [?]
petty bitchings and demands [pb_noun_prep]
of many [pb_adj_adv]
so-called genius darlings who are [?]
not.
I won’t blame him for getting [pb_phrasal_verb]
out [?]
and hope he sends me photos of his [?]
Rose Lane, his [pb_det_noun]
Gardenia Avenue.
will I have to seek other [ex_dobj_verb]
promulgators?
that fellow in the Russian [pb_noun_adj]
fur hat?
or that beast in the East [pb_noun_prep]
with all that hair [pb_noun_prep]
in his ears, with those wet and [?]
greasy lips?
or will my editor-publisher [?]
upon exiting for that world of Trollius and [?]
trellis [pb_noun_noun]
hand over the [pb_det_noun]
machinery [?]
of his former trade to a [pb_det_noun]
cousin, a [pb_det_noun]
daughter or [?]
some Poundian from Big [?]
Sur?
or will he just pass the legacy on [pb_verb_prep]
to the [pb_det_noun]
Shipping Clerk [?]
who will rise like [?]
Lazarus,
fingering new-found [?]
importance?
one can imagine terrible [ex_dobj_verb]
things:
“Mr. Chinaski, all your work [?]
must now be submitted in [?]
Rondo form [?]
and [?]
typed [?]
triple-spaced on rice [pb_noun_noun]
paper.” [?]
power corrupts,
life aborts [?]
and all you [ex_subj_verb]
have left [pb_verb_chain]
is a [pb_det_noun]
bunch of [pb_relword]
warts.
“no, no, Mr. Chinaski:
Rondo form!” [?]
“hey, man,” I’ll ask,
“haven’t you heard of [ex_dobj_verb]
the thirties?” [?]
“the thirties? what’s [ex_subj_verb]
that?” [?]
my present editor-publisher [?]
and I [?]
at times [pb_verb_prep]
did discuss the thirties,
the Depression [?]
and [?]
some of the little tricks it [ex_subj_verb]
taught us— [pb_verb_prep]
like how to endure on almost [?]
nothing [?]
and move forward [pb_adv_adv]
anyhow.
well, John, if it happens enjoy your [pb_verb_prep, pb_det_noun]
divertissement to [?]
plant husbandry,
cultivate and aerate [pb_verb_prep]
between [?]
bushes, water only in the [ex_subj_verb]
early morning, spread [?]
shredding to discourage [ex_dobj_verb]
weed growth [?]
and [?]
as I do in my writing:
use plenty of [pb_relword]
manure.
and thank you [pb_verb_prep]
for locating me there at [?]
5124 DeLongpre Avenue [?]
somewhere between [?]
alcoholism and [?]
madness.
together we [ex_subj_verb]
laid down the gauntlet [?]
and there are takers [?]
even at this late date [?]
still to be [pb_verb_chain]
found [?]
as the fire sings [pb_verb_prep]
through the [pb_det_noun]
trees.
