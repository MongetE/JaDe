of course, I may die in the next ten minutes [ex_subj_verb]
and I’m ready for that [ex_dobj_verb]
but what I’m really worried about is [pb_verb_prep]
that my editor-publisher might retire [pb_verb_adv]
even though he is ten years younger than [pb_comp]
I.
it was just 25 years ago (I was at that ripe [pb_adj_adj]
old age of 45)
when we began our unholy alliance to [pb_to_verb]
test the literary waters,
neither of us being much [pb_adj_adv]
known.
I think we had some luck and still have some
of same [pb_adj_adv]
yet
the odds are pretty fair
that he will opt for warm and pleasant [pb_noun_adj]
afternoons [pb_noun_prep]
in the garden
long before I.
writing is its own intoxication
while publishing and editing,
attempting to collect bills [ex_subj_verb]
carries its own [pb_noun_adj]
attrition [cc_cross_clause]
which also includes dealing with the
petty bitchings and demands [pb_noun_prep]
of many [pb_adj_adv]
so-called genius darlings who are
not.
I won’t blame him for getting [pb_phrasal_verb]
out
and hope he sends me photos of his [pb_verb_adv]
Rose Lane, his
Gardenia Avenue.
will I have to seek other [pb_noun_adj]
promulgators?
that fellow in the Russian [pb_noun_adj]
fur hat?
or that beast in the East
with all that hair [pb_noun_prep]
in his ears, with those wet and [pb_relword]
greasy lips?
or will my editor-publisher [pb_noun_prep]
upon exiting for that world of Trollius and [pb_relword]
trellis [ex_subj_verb]
hand over the [pb_det_noun]
machinery [pb_noun_prep]
of his former trade to a [pb_det_noun]
cousin, a [pb_det_noun]
daughter or
some Poundian from Big [ex_verb_adjunct]
Sur?
or will he just pass the legacy on
to the [pb_det_noun]
Shipping Clerk [cc_cross_clause]
who will rise like
Lazarus,
fingering new-found [ex_dobj_verb]
importance?
one can imagine terrible [pb_noun_adj]
things:
“Mr. Chinaski, all your work
must now be submitted in
Rondo form
and
typed
triple-spaced on rice [pb_noun_prep]
paper.”
power corrupts,
life aborts
and all you [ex_subj_verb]
have left [pb_verb_chain]
is a [pb_det_noun]
bunch of [pb_relword]
warts.
“no, no, Mr. Chinaski:
Rondo form!”
“hey, man,” I’ll ask,
“haven’t you heard of [ex_dobj_pverb]
the thirties?”
“the thirties? what’s [ex_subj_verb]
that?”
my present editor-publisher
and I
at times [ex_subj_verb]
did discuss the thirties,
the Depression
and
some of the little tricks it [cc_cross_clause]
taught us—
like how to endure on almost
nothing
and move forward [pb_adv_adv]
anyhow.
well, John, if it happens enjoy your [pb_det_noun]
divertissement to [pb_relword]
plant husbandry,
cultivate and aerate [pb_verb_prep]
between
bushes, water only in the [ex_subj_verb]
early morning, spread [pb_verb_adv]
shredding to discourage [ex_dobj_verb]
weed growth
and
as I do in my writing:
use plenty of [pb_relword]
manure.
and thank you
for locating me there at
5124 DeLongpre Avenue
somewhere between
alcoholism and [pb_relword]
madness.
together we [ex_subj_verb]
laid down the gauntlet
and there are takers
even at this late date
still to be [pb_verb_chain]
found [pb_verb_prep]
as the fire sings [pb_verb_prep]
through the [pb_det_noun]
trees.
