As I went down the hill along the wall [ex_subj_verb]
There was a gate I had leaned at for the view [ex_subj_verb]
And had just turned from when I first saw you [ex_subj_verb]
As you came up the hill. We met. But all [ex_subj_verb]
We did that day was mingle great and small [pb_verb_prep]
Footprints in summer dust as if we drew [ex_dobj_verb]
The figure of our being less than two [?]
But more than one as yet. Your parasol [ex_subj_verb]
Pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust.
And all the time we talked you seemed to see [ex_dobj_verb]
Something down there to smile at in the dust.
(Oh, it was without prejudice to me!) [?]
Afterward I went past what you had passed [?]
Before we met and you what I had passed.
