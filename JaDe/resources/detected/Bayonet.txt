What can I do with this bayonet?
Make a rose bush of it?
Poke it into the moon?
Shave my legs with its silver?
Spear a goldfish?
No. No.
It was made [?]
in my dream [pb_noun_prep]
for you.
My eyes were closed.
I was curled fetally [ex_subj_verb]
and yet I held a bayonet [cc_cross_clause]
that was for the earth of your stomach.
The belly button singing its puzzle.
The intestines winding like alpine roads.
It was made to enter you [ex_subj_verb]
as you have entered me [?]
and to cut the daylight into you [?]
and let out your buried heartland,
to let out the spoon you have fed me with,
to let out the bird that said fuck you,
to carve him onto a sculpture until he is white [ex_dobj_verb]
and I could put him on a shelf,
an object unthinking as a stone,
but with all the vibrations [pb_noun_prep]
of a crucifix.
