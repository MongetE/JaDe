Leafy-with-love banks and the green waters of the canal [?]
Pouring redemption for me, that I do [?]
The will of God, wallow in the habitual, the banal,
Grow with nature again as before I grew.
The bright stick trapped, the breeze adding a third [pb_verb_prep]
Party to the couple kissing on an old seat,
And a bird gathering materials for the nest for the Word [?]
Eloquently new and abandoned to its delirious beat.
O unworn world enrapture me, encapture me in a web [pb_noun_prep]
Of fabulous grass and eternal voices by a beech,
Feed the gaping need of my senses, give me ad lib [?]
To pray unselfconsciously with overflowing speech
For this soul needs to be honoured with a new dress woven [pb_verb_prep]
From green and blue things and arguments that cannot be proven.
