As Hermes once took to his feathers light,
When lulled Argus, baffled, swooned and slept,
So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright [ex_subj_verb]
So played, so charmed, so conquered, so bereft
The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes;
And seeing it asleep, so fled away--
Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,
Nor unto Tempe, where Jove grieved a day;
But to that second circle of sad Hell,
Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw [pb_noun_prep]
Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell [ex_dobj_verb]
Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,
Pale were the lips I kissed, and fair the form [cc_cross_clause]
I floated with, about that melancholy storm.
