Thy shadow, Earth, from Pole to Central Sea,
Now steals along upon the Moon's meek shine [pb_noun_prep]
In even monochrome and curving line [pb_noun_prep]
Of imperturbable serenity.

How shall I link such sun-cast symmetry [pb_noun_prep]
With the torn troubled form I know as thine,
That profile, placid as a brow divine,
With continents of moil and misery?

And can immense Mortality but throw [pb_verb_adv]
So small a shade, and Heaven's high human scheme [ex_subj_verb]
Be hemmed within the coasts yon arc implies?

Is such the stellar gauge of earthly show,
Nation at war with nation, brains that teem,
Heroes, and women fairer than the skies?
