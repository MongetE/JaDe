I traced the Circus whose gray stones incline [pb_verb_adv]
Where Rome and dim Etruria interjoin,
Till came a child who showed an ancient coin [cc_cross_clause]
That bore the image of a Constantine.
She lightly passed; nor did she once opine [pb_verb_adv]
How, better than all books, she had raised for me [?]
In swift perspective Europe's history [pb_noun_prep]
Through the vast years of Caesar's sceptred line.
For in my distant plot of English loam [?]
'Twas but to delve, and straightway there to find [?]
Coins of like impress. As with one half blind [?]
Whom common simples cure, her act flashed home [?]
In that mute moment to my opened mind [?]
The power, the pride, the reach of perished Rome.
