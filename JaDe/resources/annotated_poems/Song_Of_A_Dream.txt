1. ONCE in the dream of a night I stood
2. Lone in the light of a magical wood,
3. Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang;
4. And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang,
5. And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed,
6. And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed
7. In that magical wood in the land of sleep.

8. Lone in the light of that magical grove,
9. I felt the stars of the spirits of Love
10. Gather and gleam round my delicate youth,
11. And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth;
12. To quench my longing I bent me low
13. By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow
14. In that magical wood in the land of sleep.
