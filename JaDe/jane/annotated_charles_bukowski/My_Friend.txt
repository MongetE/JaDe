he tends to lean into cars as he [ex_subj_verb]
transacts business

first time I met him, he said,
"hey! ya gonna make a [pb_det_noun]
killin'?"

"maybe," I answered.

next meeting it was:
"hey, Ramrod! what's [pb_verb_chain]
happening?"

"very little," I told [ex_dobj_verb]
him.

next time I had my girlfriend with me
and he just [pb_adj_adv]
grinned.

next time I was
alone.

"hey," he asked, "where's the young [pb_noun_adj]
chick?"

"I left her at home...." [ex_subj_verb]

"Bullshit! I'll bet she dumped [ex_dobj_verb]
you!"

and the next time
he really leaned into the car:

"what's a guy like you doing driving a
BMW! I'll bet you inherited your [pb_det_noun]
money, you didn't get this car with your [pb_det_noun]
brains!"

"how'd you guess?" I [ex_subj_verb]
answered.

that was some weeks ago.
I haven't seen him lately.
feIlow like that, chances are he just moved on
to better [pb_comp]
things.
