they found him walking along the freeway
all red in
front
he had taken a rusty tin can
and cut off his sexual [pb_noun_adj]
machinery
as if to say --
see what you've done to [ex_subj_verb]
me? you might as well have the [pb_det_noun]
rest.

and he put part of him
in one pocket and [pb_relword]
part of him in [pb_relword]
another
and that's how they found him,
walking [pb_verb_adv]
along.

they gave him over to the [pb_det_noun]
doctors [cc_cross_clause]
who tried to sew the parts
back
on
but the parts were
quite contented
the way they [ex_subj_verb]
were.

I think sometimes of all of the good [pb_noun_adj]
ass [ex_subj_verb]
turned over to the [pb_det_noun]
monsters of the [pb_det_noun]
world.

maybe it was his protest against [pb_relword]
this or [pb_relword]
his protest [pb_noun_prep]
against
everything.

a one man [pb_noun_noun]
Freedom March
that never squeezed in
between
the concert reviews and the [pb_det_noun]
baseball [pb_noun_noun]
scores.

God, or somebody,
bless [ex_dobj_verb]
him.
