In the betting line the other [pb_noun_adj]
day [pb_noun_noun]
man behind me asked,
"are you Henry [pb_noun_prep]
Chinaski?"

"uh huh," I answered.

"I like your books," he went [pb_verb_prep]
on.

"thanks," I answered.

"who do you like in this [pb_det_noun]
race?" he asked.

"uh uh," I answered.

"I like the 4 horse," he [ex_subj_verb]
told me.

I made my bet and went back
to my seat....

the next race I am standing in [ex_subj_verb]
line and here is this same man [cc_cross_clause]
standing behind me
again.
there are at least 50 lines at [pb_comp]
the windows but [pb_relword]
he has to find mine
again.

"I think this race favors the [pb_det_noun]
closers," he said to the back of [pb_relword]
my neck. "the track looks
heavy."

"listen," I said, not looking [pb_verb_adv]
around, "it's the kiss of death to [pb_to_verb]
talk about horses at the [pb_det_noun]
track..."

"what kind of rule is that?"
he asked. "God doesn't make [ex_dobj_verb]
rules..."

I turned around and looked at him:
"maybe not, but I [ex_subj_verb]
do."

after the next race
I got in line, glanced behind
me:
he was not there:

lost another reader.

I lose 2 or 3 each [pb_det_noun]
week.

fine.

let 'em go back to
Kafka.
