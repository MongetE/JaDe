the flesh covers the bone
and they put a mind [pb_noun_prep]
in there and
sometimes a soul,
and the women break [ex_dobj_verb]
vases against the walls [ex_subj_verb]
and the men drink too [pb_adj_adv]
much
and nobody finds the [pb_det_noun]
one
but keep
looking [ex_dobj_verb]
crawling in and out
of beds.
flesh covers [ex_dobj_verb]
the bone and the [pb_det_noun]
flesh searches [pb_verb_prep]
for more than [pb_comp]
flesh.

there's no chance
at all:
we are all trapped [pb_verb_prep]
by a singular [pb_noun_adj]
fate.

nobody ever finds [ex_dobj_verb]
the one.

the city dumps fill [ex_dobj_verb]
the junkyards fill [ex_dobj_verb]
the madhouses fill [ex_dobj_verb]
the hospitals fill [ex_dobj_verb]
the graveyards fill [ex_dobj_verb]

nothing else [pb_verb_adv]
fills.
