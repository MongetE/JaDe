I've come by, she says, to tell you [ex_subj_verb]
that this is it. I'm not kidding, it's
over. this is it.
I sit on the couch watching her arrange [ex_verb_adjunct]
her long red hair before my bedroom [pb_noun_noun]
mirror.
she pulls her hair up and [ex_subj_verb]
piles it on top of her head-
she lets her eyes look at
my eyes-
then she drops her hair and [ex_subj_verb]
lets it fall down in front of her face.
we go to bed and I hold her
speechlessly from the back
my arm around her neck
I touch her wrists and hands [ex_subj_verb]
feel up to [ex_dobj_verb]
her elbows
no further.
she gets up.
this is it, she says,
this will do. well,
I'm going.
I get up and walk her
to the door
just as she leaves [ex_subj_verb]
she says,
I want you to buy me
some high-heeled shoes [pb_noun_prep]
with tall thin spikes,
black high-heeled shoes.
no, I want them [ex_subj_verb]
red.
I watch her walk down the cement walk [pb_noun_prep]
under the trees
she walks all right and [pb_relword]
as the pointsettas drip in the sun
I close the door.
