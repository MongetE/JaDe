call it the greenhouse effect or whatever [ex_subj_verb]
but it just doesn't rain like it used to.
I particularly remember the rains of the [pb_det_noun]
depression era.
there wasn't any money but there was [ex_dobj_verb]
plenty of rain.
it wouldn't rain for just a night or [pb_relword]
a day,
it would RAIN for 7 days and 7 [pb_relword]
nights
and in Los Angeles the storm drains [pb_verb_chain]
weren't built to carry off taht much [ex_dobj_verb]
water
and the rain came down THICK and [ex_subj_verb]
MEAN and [pb_relword]
STEADY
and you HEARD it banging against [ex_dobj_verb]
the roofs and into the ground [pb_noun_noun]
waterfalls of it came down
from roofs
and there was HAIL
big ROCKS OF ICE [pb_noun_noun]
bombing [cc_cross_clause]
exploding smashing into things
and the rain [ex_subj_verb]
just wouldn't
STOP
and all the roofs leaked-
dishpans,
cooking pots [ex_subj_verb]
were placed all about;
they dripped loudly
and had to be emptied [pb_verb_adv]
again and
again.
the rain came up over the street curbings,
across the lawns, climbed up the steps and [ex_subj_verb]
entered the houses.
there were mops and bathroom towels,
and the rain often came up through the [pb_det_noun]
toilets:bubbling, brown, crazy,whirling,
and all the old cars stood in the streets,
cars that had problems starting on a
sunny day,
and the jobless men stood [pb_verb_adv]
looking out the windows [pb_noun_prep]
at the old machines dying [pb_verb_prep]
like living things out there.
the jobless men,
failures in a failing time [ex_subj_verb]
were imprisoned in their houses with their [pb_det_noun]
wives and children
and their [pb_det_noun]
pets.
the pets refused to go out
and left their waste in
strange places.
the jobless men went mad
confined with
their once beautiful wives.
there were terrible arguments [pb_noun_prep]
as notices of foreclosure [ex_subj_verb]
fell into the mailbox.
rain and hail, cans of beans,
bread without butter; fried [ex_dobj_verb]
eggs, boiled eggs, poached [ex_dobj_verb]
eggs; peanut butter [ex_subj_verb]
sandwiches, and an invisible [pb_noun_adj]
chicken in every pot.
my father, never a good man [pb_noun_prep]
at best, beat my mother
when it rained [pb_verb_prep]
as I threw myself
between them,
the legs, the knees, the [ex_subj_verb]
screams [pb_noun_prep]
until they [ex_subj_verb]
seperated.
'I'll kill you,' I screamed [pb_verb_prep]
at him. 'You hit her again [ex_dobj_verb]
and I'll kill you! '
'Get that son-of-a-bitching [pb_noun_noun]
kid out of here! '
'no, Henry, you stay with
your mother! '
all the households were under
seige but I believe that ours [ex_subj_verb]
held more terror than the [pb_comp]
average.
and at night
as we attempted to sleep [ex_dobj_verb]
the rains still came down
and it was in bed [pb_noun_prep]
in the dark [pb_noun_adj]
watching the moon against [ex_dobj_verb]
the scarred window
so bravely [pb_verb_adv]
holding out [ex_dobj_verb]
most of the rain,
I thought of Noah and the [pb_det_noun]
Ark
and I thought, it has come [pb_verb_adv]
again.
we all thought [ex_dobj_verb]
that.
and then, at once, it would [pb_verb_chain]
stop.
and it always seemed to [pb_to_verb]
stop [pb_verb_adv]
around 5 or 6 a.m.,
peaceful then,
but not an exact silence
because things continued to [pb_to_verb]
drip
drip
drip


and there was no smog then
and by 8 a.m.
there was a
blazing yellow sunlight,
Van Gogh yellow-
crazy, blinding!
and then
the roof drains
relieved of the rush of
water [ex_subj_verb]
began to expand in the warmth:
PANG! PANG! PANG!
and everybody got up and looked outside
and there were all the lawns
still soaked [ex_dobj_verb]
greener than green will ever [ex_subj_verb]
be
and there were birds [pb_noun_prep]
on the lawn [cc_cross_clause]
CHIRPING like mad,
they hadn't eaten decently
for 7 days and 7 nights
and they were weary of
berries
andthey waited as the worms [ex_subj_verb]
rose to the top,
half drowned worms.
the birds plucked them [pb_phrasal_verb]
up
and gobbled them
down; there were [ex_dobj_verb]
blackbirds and sparrows.
the blackbirds tried to [pb_to_verb]
drive the sparrows off
but the sparrows,
maddened with hunger,
smaller and quicker,
got their [pb_det_noun]
due.
the men stood on their porches [pb_noun_noun]
smoking cigarettes,
now knowing
they'd have to go out
there
to look for that job [cc_cross_clause]
that probably wasn't
there, to start that car [cc_cross_clause]
that probably wouldn't [ex_subj_verb]
start.
and the once beautiful [pb_noun_adj]
wives [ex_subj_verb]
stood in their bathrooms
combing their hair,
applying makeup,
trying to put their world back [pb_adv_adv]
together again,
trying to forget that [ex_dobj_verb]
awful sadness that [ex_subj_verb]
gripped them,
wondering what they could [pb_verb_chain]
fix for [pb_relword]
breakfast.
and on the radio
we were told that
school was now [pb_adj_adv]
open.
andsoon
there I was [pb_verb_prep]
on the way to school,
massive puddles in the [pb_det_noun]
street,
the sun like a new [pb_noun_adj]
world,
my parents back in that [pb_det_noun]
house,
I arrived at my classroom [pb_noun_prep]
on time.
Mrs. Sorenson greeted us
with, 'we won't have our [ex_dobj_verb]
usual recess, the grounds [ex_subj_verb]
are too wet.'
'AW! ' most of the boys [pb_comp]
went.
'but we are going to do [ex_dobj_verb]
something special at
recess,' she went on,
'and it will be
fun! '
well, we all wondered
what that would [pb_verb_chain]
be
and the two hour wait [ex_subj_verb]
seemed a long time [pb_noun_prep]
as Mrs.Sorenson [ex_subj_verb]
went about
teaching her [pb_det_noun]
lessons.
I looked at the little [pb_noun_adj]
girls, they looked so [pb_adj_adv]
pretty and clean and
alert,
they sat still and [pb_relword]
straight
and their hair was
beautiful
in the California [pb_noun_prep]
sunshine.
the the recess bells rang
and we all waited for the [pb_det_noun]
fun.
then Mrs. Sorenson told us:
'now, what we are going to [pb_to_verb]
do is we are going to tell
each other what we did [pb_verb_prep]
during the rainstorm!
we'll begin in the front row
and go right around!
now, Michael, you're first! ...'
well, we all began to tell
our stories, Michael began
and it went on and on,
and soon we realized that [ex_subj_verb]
we were all lying, not
exactly lying but mostly [pb_verb_adv]
lying and some of the boys [ex_subj_verb]
began to snicker and some
of the girls began to give [ex_dobj_verb]
them dirty looks and [pb_relword]
Mrs.Sorenson said,
'all right! I demand a [pb_det_noun]
modicum of silence
here!
I am interested in what [ex_dobj_verb]
you did [pb_verb_prep]
during the rainstorm
even if you [ex_subj_verb]
aren't! '
so we had to tell our [pb_det_noun]
stories and they were [ex_dobj_verb]
stories.
one girl said that
when the rainbow first [pb_verb_adv]
came [ex_dobj_verb]
she saw God's face [pb_noun_prep]
at the end of it.
only she didn't say which end.
one boy said he stuck [ex_dobj_verb]
his fishing pole [pb_noun_prep]
out the window
and caught a little [pb_noun_adj]
fish
and fed it to his [pb_det_noun]
cat.
almost everybody told [ex_dobj_verb]
a lie.
the truth was just [pb_adv_adv]
too awful and [pb_relword]
embarassing to tell.
then the bell rang [ex_dobj_verb]
and recess was
over.
'thank you,' said Mrs.
Sorenson, 'that was very [pb_adj_adv]
nice.
and tomorrow the grounds [ex_subj_verb]
will be dry
and we will put them
to use [pb_verb_adv]
again.'
most of the boys [pb_comp]
cheered
and the little girls [ex_subj_verb]
sat very straight and [pb_relword]
still,
looking so pretty and [pb_relword]
clean and [pb_relword]
alert,
their hair beautiful in a sunshine that [cc_cross_clause]
the world might never see [pb_verb_adv]
again.
and
