I read a book about John Dos Passos and according to
the book once radical-communist [pb_noun_noun]
John ended up in the Hollywood Hills living off investments [ex_dobj_verb]
and reading the [ex_dobj_verb]
Wall Street Journal

this seems to happen all too often.

what hardly ever happens is [ex_dobj_verb]
a man going from being a young conservative to becoming an
old wild-ass radical [pb_adj_adv]

however:
young conservatives always seem to become old [pb_noun_adj]
conservatives.
it's a kind of lifelong mental vapor-lock.

but when a young radical ends up an
old radical
the critics
and the conservatives [ex_subj_verb]
treat him as if he escaped from a mental [pb_noun_adj]
institution.

such is our politics and you can have it
all.

keep it.

sail it up your [pb_det_noun]
ass.
