the way the music sounds, the way the words are [pb_verb_chain]
written.
It's never quite right, he said, all the things we are [pb_verb_chain]
taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we [ex_subj_verb]

the crushing of the light and the way,
it's not quite right,
it's hardly right at all

something flashed, something broke, something [ex_subj_verb]
remained.

I walked down the stairway and [pb_relword]
into it.
