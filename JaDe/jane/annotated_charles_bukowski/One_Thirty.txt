I laugh sometimes when I think about
say [ex_dobj_verb]
Céline at a typewriter
or Dostoevsky...
or Hamsun...
ordinary men with feet, ears, eyes,
ordinary men with hair on their heads
sitting there typing words
while having difficulties with life
while being puzzled almost to madness.

Dostoevsky gets up
he leaves the machine to piss,
comes back [pb_verb_adv]
drinks a glass of milk and thinks about [ex_dobj_verb]
the casino and [pb_relword]
the roulette wheel.

Céline stops, gets up, walks to the [pb_det_noun]
window, looks out, thinks, my last patient [ex_subj_verb]
died today, I won't have to make any more [pb_comp]
visits there.
when I saw him last
he paid his doctor bill;
it's those who don't pay their bills,
they live on and on.
Céline walks back, sits down at the [pb_det_noun]
machine [ex_subj_verb]
is still for a good two minutes
then begins to type.

Hamsun stands over his machine thinking,
I wonder if they are going to believe [ex_dobj_verb]
all these things I write?
he sits down, begins to type.
he doesn't know what a writer's block [ex_subj_verb]
is:
he's a prolific son-of-a-bitch
damn near as magnificent as
the sun.
he types away.

and I laugh
not out loud
but all up and down these walls, these
dirty yellow and blue walls
my white cat asleep on the [pb_det_noun]
table [cc_cross_clause]
hiding his eyes from the [pb_det_noun]
light.

he's not alone tonight
and neither am
I.
