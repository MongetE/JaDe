first time my father overheard me listening to [ex_dobj_verb]
this bit of music he asked me,
"what is it?" [ex_subj_verb]
"it's called Love For Three Oranges,"
I informed him.
"boy," he said, "that's getting it [ex_subj_verb]
cheap."
he meant sex.
listening to it
I always imagined three oranges [pb_noun_adj]
sitting there,
you know how orange they can [pb_verb_chain]
get,
so mightily orange.
maybe Prokofiev had meant
what my father [ex_subj_verb]
thought.
if so, I preferred it the
other way
the most horrible thing [pb_comp]
I could think of
was part of me being
what ejaculated out of the [pb_det_noun]
end of his
stupid penis.
I will never forgive him
for that,
his trick that I am stuck
with,
I find no nobility in [pb_relword]
parenthood.
I say kill the Father
before he makes more [pb_adj_adv]
such as
I.
