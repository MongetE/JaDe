and you know more than I.
they have long taken your blood,
you are a dry stick in a basket.
is this how it works?
in this room

I kneel in the nights [pb_noun_prep]
before tigers
that will not let me be.

what you were [pb_verb_chain]
will not happen again.
the tigers have found me
and I do not care.
