They are building a house [pb_phrasal_verb]
half a block down
and I sit up here [pb_phrasal_verb]
with the shades down [pb_verb_adv]
listening to the sounds,
the hammers pounding in nails,
thack thack thack thack,
and then I hear birds,
and thack thack thack,
and I go to bed,
I pull the covers to my throat;
they have been building this house [pb_noun_prep]
for a month, and soon it will have [ex_dobj_verb]
its people...sleeping, eating,
loving, moving around,
but somehow [pb_adv_adv]
now
it is not right,
there seems a madness,
men walk on top with nails [pb_noun_prep]
in their mouths
and I read about Castro and Cuba,
and at night I walk by
and the ribs of the house show
and inside I can see cats walking [ex_dobj_verb]
the way cats walk,
and then a boy rides by on a bicycle
and still the house is not done
and in the morning the men [ex_subj_verb]
will be back [pb_verb_adv]
walking around on the house [pb_noun_prep]
with their hammers,
and it seems people should not build houses
anymore,
it seems people should not get married [pb_verb_adv]
anymore,
it seems people should stop working
and sit in small rooms [pb_noun_prep]
on 2nd floors [pb_noun_prep]
under electric lights without shades;
it seems there is a lot to forget [ex_dobj_verb]
and a lot not to do,
and in drugstores, markets, bars,
the people are tired, they do not want [pb_verb_cprep]
to move, and I stand there at night
and look through this house and the [pb_det_noun]
house does not want to be built;
through its sides I can see the purple hills
and the first lights of evening,
and it is cold
and I button my coat [ex_subj_verb]
and I stand there looking through the house
and the cats stop and look at me
until I am embarrased
and move North up the sidewalk [cc_cross_clause]
where I will buy [ex_dobj_verb]
cigarettes and beer
and return to my room.
