the night I was going to die [ex_subj_verb]
I was sweating on the bed [ex_subj_verb]
and I could hear the crickets
and there was a cat fight outside [pb_relword]
and I could feel my soul dropping down through the [pb_det_noun]
mattress
and just before it hit the floor I jumped up [ex_subj_verb]
I was almost too weak to walk [ex_subj_verb]
but I walked around and turned on all the lights [ex_subj_verb]
and then I went back to bed
and dropped it down again and
I was up [pb_verb_adv]
turning on all the lights
I had a 7-year-old daughter [ex_subj_verb]
and I felt sure she wouldn't want me dead
otherwise it wouldn't have [pb_verb_chain]
mattered
but all that night
nobody phoned [ex_dobj_verb]
nobody came by with a beer
my girlfriend didn't phone
all I could hear were the crickets and it was
hot
and I kept working at it
getting up and down
until the first of the sun came through the window [pb_noun_prep]
through the bushes
and then I got on the bed
and the soul stayed [pb_verb_adv]
inside at last and
I slept.
now people come by
beating on the doors and windows [ex_dobj_verb]
the phone rings [ex_dobj_verb]
the phone rings again and again
I get great letters in the mail [ex_subj_verb]
hate letters and love letters.
everything is the same again.
