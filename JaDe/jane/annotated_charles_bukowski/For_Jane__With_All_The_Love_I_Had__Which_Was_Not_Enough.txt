I pick up the skirt,
I pick up the sparkling beads [pb_noun_prep]
in black,
this thing that moved once
around flesh,
and I call God a liar,
I say anything that moved [pb_verb_prep]
like that
or knew [ex_dobj_verb]
my name [ex_subj_verb]
could never die [pb_verb_prep]
in the common verity of dying,
and I pick [pb_verb_prep]
up her lovely [pb_noun_adj]
dress,
all her loveliness gone,
and I speak to all the gods,
Jewish gods, Christ-gods,
chips of blinking things,
idols, pills, bread,
fathoms, risks,
knowledgeable surrender,
rats in the gravy of two gone quite mad
without a chance,
hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance,
I lean upon this,
I lean on all of this [ex_subj_verb]
and I know
her dress upon my arm
but
they will not [ex_subj_verb]
give her back to me.
