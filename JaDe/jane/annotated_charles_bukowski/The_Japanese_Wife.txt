O lord, he said, Japanese women,
real women, they have not forgotten,
bowing and smiling [ex_dobj_verb]
closing the wounds men have made;
but American women will kill you like they [ex_subj_verb]
tear a lampshade,
American women care less than a dime,
they’ve gotten derailed,
they’re too nervous to make good:
always scowling, belly-aching,
disillusioned, overwrought;
but oh lord, say, the Japanese women:
there was this one,
I came home and the door was locked
and when I broke in she broke out the bread knife
and chased me under the bed
and her sister came
and they kept me under that bed for two days,
and when I came out, at last,
she didn’t mention attorneys,
just said, you will never wrong me again,
and I didn’t; but she died on me,
and dying, said, you can wrong me now,
and I did,
but you know, I felt worse then [pb_comp]
than when she was living;
there was no voice, no knife,
nothing but little Japanese prints on the wall,
all those tiny people sitting by red rivers [pb_noun_prep]
with flying green birds,
and I took them down and put them face down [pb_verb_prep]
in a drawer with my shirts,
and it was the first time I realized [pb_verb_prep]
that she was dead, even though I buried her;
and some day I’ll take them all out again,
all the tan-faced little people [ex_subj_verb]
sitting happily by their bridges and huts
and mountains—
but not right now,
not just yet.
