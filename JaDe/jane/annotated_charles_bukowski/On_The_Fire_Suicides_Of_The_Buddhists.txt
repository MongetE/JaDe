'They only burn themselves to reach Paradise' [ex_dobj_verb]
- Mne. Nhu

original courage is good,
motivation be damned,
and if you say they are trained [pb_verb_cprep]
to feel no pain,
are they [ex_subj_verb]
guarenteed this?
is it still not possible [pb_adj_prep]
to die for somebody else?

you sophisticates
who lay back and [pb_relword]
make statements of explanation,
I have seen the red rose burning
and this means more.
