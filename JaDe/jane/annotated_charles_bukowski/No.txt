I'll settle for the 6 horse [pb_noun_prep]
on a rainy afternoon
a paper cup of coffee [pb_noun_prep]
in my hand
a little way to go,
the wind twirling out [ex_dobj_verb]
small wrens from
the upper grandstand roof,
the jocks coming out
for a middle race
silent
and the easy rain making [ex_dobj_verb]
everything
at once [pb_adv_adv]
almost alike,
the horses at peace with [pb_relword]
each other
before the drunken war
and I am under the grandstand [cc_cross_clause]
feeling for
cigarettes [pb_noun_adj]
settling for coffee,
then the horses walk by
taking their little men
away-
it is funereal and graceful
and glad
like the opening [pb_noun_prep]
of flowers.
