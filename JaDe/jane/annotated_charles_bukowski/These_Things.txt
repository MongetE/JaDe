these things that we support most well [pb_comp]
have nothing to do with up,
and we do with them
out of boredom or fear or money
or cracked intelligence;
our circle and our candle of light [cc_cross_clause]
being small,
so small we cannot bear it,
we heave out with Idea
and lose the Center:
all wax without the wick,
and we see names that once meant [ex_dobj_verb]
wisdom,
like signs into ghost towns,
and only the graves are real.
