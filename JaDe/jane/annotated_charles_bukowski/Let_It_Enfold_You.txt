Either peace or happiness,
let it enfold you

when I was a young man [ex_subj_verb]
I felt these things were
dumb, unsophisticated.
I had bad blood, a twisted [pb_noun_adj]
mind, a precarious [pb_adj_adj]
upbringing.

I was hard as granite, I [ex_subj_verb]
leered at the [pb_det_noun]
sun.
I trusted no man and [pb_relword]
especially no [pb_det_noun]
woman.

I was living a hell in [ex_subj_verb]
small rooms, I broke [ex_dobj_verb]
things, smashed things,
walked through glass,
cursed.
I challenged everything,
was continually being [pb_verb_chain]
evicted, jailed, in and [pb_relword]
out of fights, in and out [pb_relword]
of my mind.
women were something
to screw and rail [pb_noun_prep]
at, I had no male [pb_noun_adj]
friends,

I changed jobs and
cities, I hated holidays,
babies, history,
newspapers, museums,
grandmothers,
marriage, movies,
spiders, garbagemen,
english accents,spain,
france,italy,walnuts and [pb_relword]
the color [pb_noun_prep]
orange.
algebra angred me,
opera sickened me,
charlie chaplin was a [pb_det_noun]
fake
and flowers were for
pansies.

peace and happiness to me [ex_subj_verb]
were signs of [pb_relword]
inferiority,
tenants of the weak
and
addled [ex_dobj_verb]
mind.

but as I went on with
my alley fights,
my suicidal years,
my passage through [pb_relword]
any number of [pb_relword]
women-it gradually [pb_verb_adv]
began to occur to
me
that I wasn't different

from the [pb_det_noun]
others, I was the same,

they were all fulsome [pb_verb_prep]
with hatred,
glossed over with petty [pb_noun_adj]
grievances,
the men I fought in [ex_subj_verb]
alleys had hearts of stone.
everybody was nudging,
inching, cheating for
some insignificant [pb_noun_adj]
advantage,
the lie was the [pb_det_noun]
weapon and the [pb_det_noun]
plot was
empty,
darkness was the [pb_det_noun]
dictator.

cautiously, I allowed
myself to feel good
at times.
I found moments of [pb_relword]
peace in cheap [pb_noun_adj]
rooms
just staring at the [pb_det_noun]
knobs of some [pb_det_noun]
dresser
or listening to the [pb_det_noun]
rain in the [pb_det_noun]
dark.
the less I needed [pb_comp]
the better I [pb_comp]
felt.

maybe the other life had worn me [pb_phrasal_verb]
down.
I no longer found [pb_comp]
glamour
in topping somebody
in conversation.
or in mounting the [pb_det_noun]
body of some poor [pb_adj_adj]
drunken female [cc_cross_clause]
whose life had [pb_verb_chain]
slipped away into
sorrow.

I could never accept [ex_dobj_verb]
life as it was,
i could never gobble [pb_verb_prep]
down all its [pb_det_noun]
poisons
but there were parts,
tenuous magic parts [ex_subj_verb]
open for the [pb_det_noun]
asking.

I re formulated [ex_subj_verb]
I don't know when,
date, time, all
that
but the change [ex_subj_verb]
occurred.
something in me [ex_subj_verb]
relaxed, smoothed [pb_phrasal_verb]
out.
i no longer had to [pb_to_verb]
prove that I was a [pb_det_noun]
man,

I didn't have to prove [ex_dobj_verb]
anything.

I began to see things:
coffee cups lined up
behind a counter in a [pb_det_noun]
cafe.
or a dog walking along
a sidewalk.
or the way the mouse [pb_noun_prep]
on my dresser top [ex_subj_verb]
stopped there
with its body,
its ears,
its nose,
it was fixed,
a bit of life [ex_subj_verb]
caught within itself
and its eyes looked [pb_verb_prep]
at me
and they were
beautiful.
then- it was [pb_verb_chain]
gone.

I began to feel good,
I began to feel good
in the worst situations [pb_comp]
and there were plenty
of those.
like say, the boss [pb_noun_prep]
behind his desk,
he is going to have [pb_verb_cprep]
to fire me.

I've missed too many [pb_noun_adj]
days.
he is dressed in a [pb_det_noun]
suit, necktie, glasses,
he says, 'I am going [pb_verb_cprep]
to have to let you go'

'it's all right' I tell [ex_dobj_verb]
him.

He must do what he [ex_subj_verb]
must do, he has a [pb_det_noun]
wife, a house, children,
expenses, most probably [pb_comp]
a girlfriend.

I am sorry for him
he is caught.

I walk onto the blazing [ex_dobj_verb]
sunshine.
the whole day is
mine
temporarily,
anyhow.

(the whole world is at the [pb_det_noun]
throat of the world,
everybody feels angry,
short-changed, cheated,
everybody is despondent,
disillusioned)

I welcomed shots of [pb_relword]
peace, tattered shards of [pb_relword]
happiness.

I embraced that stuff
like the hottest number,
like high heels, breasts,
singing,the [pb_det_noun]
works.

(don't get me wrong,
there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism [cc_cross_clause]
that overlooks all [ex_dobj_verb]
basic problems just for [pb_relword]
the sake of [pb_relword]
itself-
this is a shield and a [pb_det_noun]
sickness.)

The knife got near my [pb_det_noun]
throat again,
I almost turned on the [pb_det_noun]
gas
again
but when the good [pb_noun_adj]
moments arrived [pb_verb_adv]
again
I didn't fight them off
like an alley [pb_noun_noun]
adversary.
I let them take me,
I luxuriated in them,
I made them welcome [ex_dobj_verb]
home.
I even looked into
the mirror
once having thought [pb_adj_prep, pb_adj_adv]
myself to be
ugly,
I now liked what
I saw, almost [pb_adj_adv]
handsome, yes,
a bit ripped and [pb_relword]
ragged,
scares, lumps,
odd turns,
but all in all,
not too bad,
almost handsome,
better at least than [pb_comp]
some of those movie [pb_noun_noun]
star faces [pb_verb_prep]
like the cheeks of [pb_relword]
a baby's
butt.

and finally I discovered [ex_dobj_verb]
real feelings of [pb_relword]
others,
unheralded,
like lately,
like this morning,
as I was leaving,
for the track,
i saw my wife in bed,
just the [pb_det_noun]
shape of [pb_relword]
her head there
(not forgetting [ex_dobj_verb]
centuries of the living
and the dead and
the dying,
the pyramids,
Mozart dead
but his music still [pb_adv_adv]
there in the [pb_det_noun]
room, weeds growing,
the earth turning,
the tote board waiting for
me)
I saw the shape of my [pb_det_noun]
wife's head,
she so still,
I ached for her life,
just being there
under the [pb_det_noun]
covers.

I kissed her in the [pb_det_noun]
forehead,
got down the stairway,
got outside,
got into my marvelous [pb_noun_adj]
car,
fixed the seatbelt,
backed out the [pb_det_noun]
drive.
feeling warm to [ex_dobj_verb]
the fingertips,
down to my [pb_det_noun]
foot on the gas [pb_noun_noun]
pedal,
I entered the world
once [pb_adj_adv]
more,
drove down the [pb_det_noun]
hill
past the houses [pb_noun_adj]
full and empty
of
people,
I saw the mailman,
honked,
he waved [pb_verb_adv]
back
at me.
