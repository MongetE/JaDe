he lives in a house with a swimming pool
and says the job is [pb_verb_chain]
killing him.
he is 27. I am 44. I can’t seem to [pb_to_verb]
get rid of
him. his novels keep coming [pb_verb_adv]
back. “what do you expect me to do?” he screams
“go to New York and pump the hands of the [pb_det_noun]
publishers?”
“no,” I tell him, “but quit your job, go into a
small room and do the [pb_det_noun]
thing.”
“but I need ASSURANCE, I need something to [pb_to_verb]
go by, some word, some sign!”
“some men did not think that way:
Van Gogh, Wagner—” [ex_subj_verb]
“oh hell, Van Gogh had a brother who gave him [ex_dobj_verb]
paints whenever he [ex_subj_verb]
needed them!”


“look,” he said, “I’m over at this broad’s house today and [pb_relword]
this guy walks in. a salesman. you know [pb_verb_adv]
how they talk. drove up in this new [pb_noun_adj]
car. talked about his vacation. said he went to
Frisco—saw Fidelio up there but forgot who [ex_subj_verb]
wrote it. now this guy is 54 years [pb_adj_adv]
old. so I told him: ‘Fidelio is Beethoven’s only
opera.’ and then I told [ex_dobj_verb]
him: ‘you’re a jerk!’ ‘whatcha mean?’ he [ex_subj_verb]
asked. ‘I mean, you’re a jerk, you’re 54 years old and [ex_subj_verb]
you don’t know anything!’”


“what happened [pb_verb_adv]
then?”
“I walked out.”
“you mean you left him there with
her?”
“yes.”


“I can’t quit my job,” he said. “I always have trouble getting a [pb_det_noun]
job. I walk in, they look at me, listen to me talk and [ex_subj_verb]
they think right away, ah ha! he’s too intelligent for [ex_subj_verb]
this job, he won’t stay [pb_verb_adv]
so there’s really no sense in hiring [ex_dobj_verb]
him.
now, YOU walk into a place and you don’t have any trouble:
you look like an old wino, you look like a guy who needs a [pb_det_noun]
job and they look at you and they think:
ah ha!: now here’s a guy who really needs work! if we hire [ex_dobj_verb]
him he’ll stay a long time and work [pb_verb_adv]
HARD!”


“do any of those people,” he asks “know you are a [pb_det_noun]
writer, that you write poetry?”
“no.”
“you never talk about
it. not even to
me! if I hadn’t seen you in that magazine I’d [pb_verb_chain]
have never known.”
“that’s right.”
“still, I’d like to tell these people that you are a [pb_det_noun]
writer.”
“I’d still like to [pb_to_verb]
tell them.”
“why?”
“well, they talk about you. they think you are just a [pb_det_noun]
horseplayer and a drunk.”
“I am both of those.”
“well, they talk about you. you have odd ways. you travel alone.
I’m the only friend you [ex_subj_verb]
have.”
“yes.”
“they talk you down. I’d like to defend you. I’d like to tell
them you write [ex_dobj_verb]
poetry.”
“leave it alone. I work here like they [ex_subj_verb]
do. we’re all the same.” [ex_dobj_verb]
“well, I’d like to do it for myself then. I want them to know why [ex_subj_verb]
I travel with [ex_subj_verb]
you. I speak 7 languages, I know my music—”
“forget it.”
“all right, I’ll respect your [pb_det_noun]
wishes. but there’s something else—”
“what?”
“I’ve been thinking about getting a [pb_det_noun]
piano. but then I’ve been thinking about getting a [pb_det_noun]
violin too but I can’t make up my [pb_det_noun]
mind!”
“buy a piano.”
“you think [pb_verb_adv]
so?”
“yes.”


he walks away [pb_verb_adv]
thinking about
it.

I was thinking about it [ex_subj_verb]
too: I figure he can always come over with his [pb_det_noun]
violin and more [pb_adj_adv]
sad music.
