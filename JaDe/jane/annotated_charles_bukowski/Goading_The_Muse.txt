this man used to be an
interesting writer,
he was able to say brisk and
refreshing things.
at the time
I suggested to the editors and [pb_relword]
the critics that he was one to [pb_to_verb]
be watched
and also that he had hardly yet been [pb_verb_chain]
noticed
and that he certainly should now be [pb_verb_chain]
noticed.
this writer used some of my [pb_det_noun]
remarks as blurbs for his [pb_det_noun]
books, which I didn't [ex_subj_verb]
mind.
all of his publications were little [pb_noun_adj]
chapbooks, 16 to
pages,
mimeographed.
they came out at a
rapid rate,
perhaps three or four a [pb_det_noun]
year.
the problem was that each [pb_det_noun]
chapbook seemed a little weaker [pb_comp]
than the one that preceded [ex_dobj_verb]
it
but he continued to use my old [pb_noun_adj]
blurbs.
my wife noticed the change [pb_noun_prep]
in his writing
too.
'what's happened to his [pb_det_noun]
writing?' she asked me.
'he's doing too much of it, he's [pb_verb_chain]
pushing it out, forcing it.'
'this stuff is bad, you ought to [pb_to_verb]
tell him to stop using your [pb_det_noun]
blurbs.'
'I can't do that, I just wish he [ex_subj_verb]
wouldn't publish so much.'
'well, you publish all the [pb_det_noun]
time too.'
'with me,' I told her, 'it's
different.'

yesterday I received another of his
little chapbooks [pb_noun_prep]
with his delicate dedication scrawled [pb_verb_prep]
on the title page.
this latest effort was totally [pb_adj_adv]
flat.
the words just fell off the [pb_det_noun]
page,
dead on
arrival.

where had he gone?

too much ambition?
too much just doing it for the sake [pb_noun_prep]
of doing it?
just not waiting for the words to [pb_to_verb]
pile up inside and then [pb_verb_adv]
explode of their own [pb_noun_adj]
volition?

I decided then I should take a whole week [pb_noun_prep]
off,
be on the safe side,
just shut the computer down,
forget the whole damned silly [pb_noun_adj]
business [pb_noun_prep]
for awhile.

as I said, that was [ex_dobj_verb]
yesterday.
