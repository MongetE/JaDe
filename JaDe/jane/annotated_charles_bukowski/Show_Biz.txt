I can't have it [ex_subj_verb]
and you can't have it
and we won't [ex_subj_verb]
get it

so don't bet on it
or even think about [ex_dobj_verb]
it [ex_subj_verb]

just get out of bed
each morning

wash
shave
clothe
yoursel f
and go out into
it

because
outside of that [ex_subj_verb]
all that's left is [ex_dobj_verb]
suicide and [pb_relword]
madness

so you just [pb_verb_adv]
can't
expect too much

you can't even [pb_verb_adv]
expect

so what you do
is [pb_verb_chain]
work from a modest [pb_adj_adj]
minimal [pb_noun_adj]
base

like when you [ex_subj_verb]
walk outside [ex_subj_verb]
be glad your car [ex_subj_verb]
might possibly
be there

and if it is-
that the tires [ex_subj_verb]
aren't [pb_adj_adv]
flat

then you get [pb_verb_prep]
in
and if it [ex_subj_verb]
starts--you [ex_subj_verb]
start.

and
it's the damndest [pb_noun_adj]
movie
you've ever [pb_adj_adv]
seen [pb_verb_prep]
because
you're [pb_verb_prep]
in it--

low budget
and
4 billion [pb_noun_adj]
critics

and the longest [pb_noun_adj]
run
you ever hope [pb_verb_prep]
for
is [ex_subj_verb]

one [pb_noun_adj]
day.
