the final curtain on one of the longest running [pb_noun_adj]
musicals ever, some people claim to have [pb_verb_chain]
seen it over one hundred times.
I saw it on the tv news, that final curtain:
flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous [pb_noun_adj]
accolade.I have not seen this particular musical [ex_subj_verb]
but I know if I had that I wouldn't have [ex_subj_verb]
been able to bear it, it would have [pb_verb_chain]
sickened me.
trust me on this, the world and its [pb_det_noun]
peoples and its artful entertainment has [pb_verb_chain]
done very little for me, only to me.
still, let them enjoy one another, it will [ex_subj_verb]
keep them from my door
and for this, my own thunderous [pb_noun_adj]
accolade.
