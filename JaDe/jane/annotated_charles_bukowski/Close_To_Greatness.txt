at one stage in my life
I met a man who claimed to have [pb_verb_chain]
visited Pound at St. Elizabeths.

then I met a woman who not only [pb_verb_adv]
claimed to have visited [ex_dobj_verb]
E.P.
but also to have made love [pb_noun_prep]
to himâ€”she even showed [ex_dobj_verb]
me
certain sections in the [pb_det_noun]
Cantos [cc_cross_clause]
where Ezra was supposed to have [pb_verb_chain]
mentioned [ex_dobj_verb]
her.

so there was this man and [pb_relword]
this woman [ex_subj_verb]
and the woman told me
that Pound had never [pb_adj_adv]
mentioned a visit from this [pb_det_noun]
man [ex_subj_verb]
and the man claimed that the [pb_det_noun]
lady had had nothing to do [pb_verb_prep]
with the [pb_det_noun]
master
that she was a [pb_det_noun]
charlatan

and since I wasn't a
Poundian scholar
I didn't know who to [pb_to_verb]
believe [ex_dobj_verb]
but one thing I do [pb_verb_chain]
know: when a man is [pb_verb_chain]
living [ex_dobj_verb]
many claim relationships
that are hardly [pb_adv_adv]
so
and after he dies, well,
then it's everybody's [pb_det_noun]
party.

my guess is that Pound [ex_subj_verb]
knew neither the lady or the [pb_relword]
gentleman

or if he knew [pb_noun_adj]
one
or if he knew
both

it was a shameful waste of [pb_relword]
madhouse
time.
