the history of melancholia [ex_subj_verb]
includes all of us.

me, I writhe in dirty sheets
while staring at blue walls
and nothing.

I have gotten so used to melancholia [ex_dobj_verb]
that
I greet it like an old [pb_noun_adj]
friend.

I will now do 15 minutes of grieving [pb_noun_prep]
for the lost redhead,
I tell the gods.

I do it and feel quite bad
quite sad,
then I rise
CLEANSED [pb_verb_adv]
even though nothing [ex_subj_verb]
is solved.

that’s what I get for kicking [ex_dobj_verb]
religion in the ass.

I should have kicked the redhead [pb_noun_prep]
in the ass [cc_cross_clause]
where her brains and her bread and [ex_subj_verb]
butter are [pb_verb_prep]
at …

but, no, I’ve felt sad
about everything:
the lost redhead was just another [pb_det_noun]
smash in a lifelong [pb_noun_adj]
loss …

I listen to drums on the radio now
and grin.
there is something wrong with me
besides
melancholia.
