"what?" they say, "you got a [pb_det_noun]
computer?"

it's like I have sold out to [ex_dobj_verb]
the enemy.

I had no idea so many [pb_noun_adj]
people were prejudiced [pb_verb_prep]
against
computers.

even two editors have [pb_verb_chain]
written me letters about [pb_relword]
the computer.

one disparaged the [pb_det_noun]
computer in a mild and [pb_relword]
superior way.
the other seemed [pb_verb_adv]
genuinely [pb_adj_adv]
pissed.

I am aware that a [pb_det_noun]
computer can't create [ex_dobj_verb]
a poem.
but neither can a [pb_det_noun]
typewriter.

yet, still, once or [pb_relword]
twice a week
I hear:
"what?
you have a [pb_det_noun]
computer?
you?"

yes, I do [ex_subj_verb]
and I sit up here [pb_adv_adv]
almost every [pb_det_noun]
night,
sometimes with
beer or [pb_relword]
wine,
sometimes
without
and I work the [ex_dobj_verb]
computer.the damn thing [ex_subj_verb]
even corrects [ex_dobj_verb]
my spelling.

and the poems [ex_subj_verb]
come flying [pb_phrasal_verb]
out,
better than [pb_comp]
ever.

I have no [pb_det_noun]
idea what causes [ex_dobj_verb]
all this [pb_det_noun]
computer [pb_noun_noun]
prejudice.

me?
I want to go [ex_dobj_verb]
the next step [pb_noun_prep]
beyond the [pb_det_noun]
computer.I'm sure it's
there.

and when I get [ex_dobj_verb]
it,
they'll say,
"hey, you hear,
Chinaski got a [pb_det_noun]
space-biter!"

"what?"
"yes, it's true!"

"I can't believe [ex_dobj_verb]
it!"

and I'll also have [ex_dobj_verb]
some beer or [pb_relword]
some wine
or maybe nothing
at all
and I'll be [ex_dobj_verb]
85 years old [pb_adj_adv]
driving it home
to
you and me
and to the little girl
who lost her [pb_det_noun]
sheep.
or her [pb_det_noun]
computer.
