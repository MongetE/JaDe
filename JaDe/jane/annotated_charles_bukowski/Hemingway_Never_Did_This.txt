I read that he lost a suitcase full of manuscripts on a [pb_det_noun]
train and that they never were recovered.
I can't match the agony of this [ex_subj_verb]
but the other night I wrote a 3-page poem
upon this computer
and through my lack of diligence and
practice
and by playing around with commands [pb_noun_prep]
on the menu
I somehow managed to erase the poem
forever.
believe me, such a thing is difficult to do
even for a novice
but I somehow managed to do [ex_dobj_verb]
it.

now I don't think this 3-pager was immortal
but there were some crazy wild lines,
now gone forever.
it bothers more than a touch, it's some-
thing like knocking over a good bottle of [pb_relword]
wine.

and writing about it hardly makes a good [pb_noun_adj]
poem.
still, I thought somehow you'd like to [pb_to_verb]
know?

if not, at least you've read this far
and there could be better work [pb_noun_prep]
down the line.

let's hope so, for your sake
and
mine.
