death wants more death, and its webs are full:
I remember my father's garage, how child-like [ex_subj_verb]
I would brush the corpses of flies [pb_noun_prep]
from the windows they thought were escape-
their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies [pb_noun_adj]
shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass
only to spin and flit [pb_verb_prep]
in that second larger than hell or heaven
onto the edge of the ledge,
and then the spider from his dank hole [ex_subj_verb]
nervous and exposed [ex_dobj_verb]
the puff of body swelling
hanging there [ex_subj_verb]
not really quite knowing,
and then knowing-
something sending it down its string,
the wet web,
toward the weak shield of buzzing,
the pulsing;
a last desperate moving hair-leg
there against the glass
there alive in the sun,
spun in white;
and almost like love:
the closing over,
the first hushed spider-sucking:
filling its sack
upon this thing that lived;
crouching there upon its back [cc_cross_clause]
drawing its certain blood
as the world goes by outside
and my temples scream [ex_subj_verb]
and I hurl the broom against them:
the spider dull with spider-anger [ex_subj_verb]
still thinking of its prey
and waving an amazed broken leg;
the fly very still,
a dirty speck stranded to straw;
I shake the killer loose
and he walks lame and peeved [pb_verb_prep]
towards some dark corner
but I intercept his dawdling
his crawling like some broken hero,
and the straws smash his legs
now waving [pb_verb_prep]
above his head
and looking [pb_verb_prep]
looking for the enemy
and somewhat valiant,
dying without apparent pain
simply crawling backward
piece by piece [cc_cross_clause]
leaving nothing there
until at last the red gut sack [pb_noun_noun]
splashes [ex_dobj_verb]
its secrets,
and I run child-like
with God's anger a step behind,
back to simple sunlight,
wondering [pb_verb_prep]
as the world goes by
with curled smile [pb_noun_prep]
if anyone else [pb_verb_adv]
saw or sensed my crime
