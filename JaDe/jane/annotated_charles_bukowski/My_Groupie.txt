I read last Saturday in the [pb_det_noun]
redwoods outside of Santa Cruz
and I was about 3/4's finished [pb_verb_adv]
when I heard a long high scream
and a quite attractive [pb_adj_adj]
young girl came running toward me [ex_dobj_verb]
long gown & divine eyes of fire
and she leaped up on the stage
and screamed: "I WANT YOU!
I WANT YOU! TAKE  ME! TAKE
ME!"
I told her, "look, get the hell [ex_verb_adjunct]
away from me."
but she kept tearing at my [pb_det_noun]
clothing and throwing herself
at me.
"where were you," I [ex_subj_verb]
asked her, "when I was living [pb_verb_prep]
on one candy bar a day and [pb_relword]
sending short stories to the [pb_det_noun]
Atlantic Monthly?"
she grabbed my balls and almost [pb_verb_adv]
twisted them off. her kisses [ex_subj_verb]
tasted like shitsoup.
2 women jumped up on the stage
and
carried her off into the [pb_det_noun]
woods.
I could still hear her screams [ex_subj_verb]
as I began the next poem.
mabye, I thought, I should have [pb_verb_chain]
taken her on stage in front
of all those eyes.
but one can never be sure
whether it's good poetry or [pb_relword]
bad acid.
