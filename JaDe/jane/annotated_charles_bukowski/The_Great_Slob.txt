I was always a natural slob [ex_subj_verb]
I liked to lay upon the bed [pb_noun_prep]
in undershirt (stained, of
course) (and with cigarette [pb_noun_noun]
holes)
shoes off [pb_relword]
beerbottle in hand [cc_cross_clause]
trying to shake off a [ex_dobj_verb]
difficult night, say with a [pb_det_noun]
woman still around [pb_verb_adv]
walking the floor [cc_cross_clause]
complaining about this and
that,
and I'd work up a [pb_det_noun]
belch and say, "HEY, YOU DON'T [ex_subj_verb]
LIKE IT? THEN GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF HERE!"

I really loved myself, I [ex_dobj_verb]
really loved my slob-
self, and [pb_relword]
they seemed to also:
always leaving
but almost [pb_adv_adv]
always [pb_verb_adv]
coming [pb_verb_adv]
back.
