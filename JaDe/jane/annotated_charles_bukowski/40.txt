at the track today,
Father's Day,
each paid admission was [pb_verb_chain]
entitled to a wallet [ex_dobj_verb]
and each contained a [ex_dobj_verb]
little surprise.
most of the men seemed [pb_verb_prep]
between 30 and 55,
going to fat,
many of them in walking [ex_dobj_verb]
shorts,
they had gone stale in
life,
flattened out....
in fact, damn it, they [ex_subj_verb]
aren't even worth writing [pb_verb_prep]
about!
why am I doing [ex_dobj_verb]
this?
these don't even [pb_verb_adv]
deserve a death bed,
these little walking [ex_dobj_verb]
whales,
only there are so [pb_adj_adv]
many of
them,
in the urinals,
in the food lines,
they have managed to [pb_to_verb]
survive [pb_verb_prep]
in a most limited [pb_noun_adj]
sense
but when you see [pb_verb_adv]
so many of them
like that,
there and not there,
breathing, farting,
commenting,
waiting for a thunder [cc_cross_clause]
that will not arrive,
waiting for the charging [ex_dobj_verb]
white horse of [pb_relword]
Glory,
waiting for the lovely [pb_adj_adj]
female that is not
there,
waiting to WIN,
waiting for the great [pb_noun_adj]
dream to [pb_to_verb]
engulf them
but they do nothing,
they clomp in their [pb_det_noun]
sandals,
gnaw at hot dogs [pb_noun_noun]
dog style,
gulping at the [pb_det_noun]
meat,
they complain about
losing,
blame the jocks,
drink green [pb_noun_adj]
beer,
the parking lot is
jammed with their [pb_det_noun]
unpaid for
cars,
the jocks mount
again for another [pb_det_noun]
race,
the men press [pb_verb_prep]
toward the betting [pb_noun_noun]
windows [ex_subj_verb]
mesmerized,
fathers and non-fathers
Monday is waiting [pb_verb_prep]
for them,
this is the last [pb_adj_adj]
big lark.
and the horses are
totally [pb_adj_adv]
beautiful.
it is shocking how [pb_adj_adv]
beautiful they [ex_subj_verb]
are [pb_verb_prep]
at that time,
at that place,
their life shines [pb_verb_adv]
through;
miracles happen,
even in
hell.
I decide to stay for
one more [pb_noun_adj]
race.
