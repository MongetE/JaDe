The flies are angry bits of life;
why are they so angry?
it seems they want more,
it seems almost as if they [ex_subj_verb]
are angry [ex_subj_verb]
that they are flies;
it is not my fault;
I sit in the room [pb_noun_prep]
with them
and they taunt me
with their agony;
it is as if they were [ex_dobj_verb]
loose chunks of soul [ex_subj_verb]
left out of somewhere;
I try to read a paper
but they will not let me [ex_subj_verb]
be;
one seems to go in half-circles
high along the wall,
throwing a miserable sound
upon my head;
the other one, the smaller one [pb_comp]
stays near and teases my hand,
saying nothing,
rising, dropping [ex_dobj_verb]
crawling near;
what god puts these [ex_subj_verb]
lost things upon me?
other men suffer dictates of [pb_relword]
empire, tragic love…
I suffer [ex_dobj_verb]
insects…
I wave at the little one
which only seems to revive [ex_dobj_verb]
his impulse to challenge:
he circles swifter,
nearer, even making
a fly-sound,
and one above [ex_subj_verb]
catching a sense of the new [pb_noun_adj]
whirling, he too, in excitement,
speeds his flight,
drops down suddenly
in a cuff of noise
and they join [pb_verb_prep]
in circling my hand,
strumming the base [pb_noun_prep]
of the lampshade [pb_noun_prep]
until some man-thing [pb_noun_prep]
in me
will take no more [pb_adj_adv]
unholiness
and I strike [pb_verb_prep]
with the rolled-up-paper -
missing! -
striking,
striking,
they break in discord,
some message lost between them,
and I get the big one
first, and he kicks on his back [cc_cross_clause]
flicking his legs
like an angry whore,
and I come down again
with my paper club
and he is a smear [pb_noun_prep]
of fly-ugliness;
the little one circles high [pb_adv_adv]
now, quiet and swift,
almost invisible;
he does not come near
my hand again;
he is tamed and [pb_relword]
inaccessible; I leave
him be, he leaves me
be;
the paper, of course,
is ruined;
something has happened,
something has soiled my [pb_det_noun]
day,
sometimes it does not [ex_subj_verb]
take man
or a woman,
only something alive;
I sit and watch [ex_dobj_verb]
the small one;
we are woven together
in the air
and the living;
it is late
for both of us.
