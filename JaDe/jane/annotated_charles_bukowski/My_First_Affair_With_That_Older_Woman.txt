when I look back now

at the abuse I took from

her

I feel shame that I was so [pb_adj_adv]

innocent,

but I must say

she did match me drink for

drink,

and I realized that her life

her feelings for things [ex_subj_verb]

had been ruined [pb_verb_prep]

along the way

and that I was no mare than a [pb_det_noun]

temporary [pb_noun_adj]

companion;

she was ten years older [pb_comp]

and mortally hurt by the past

and the present;

she treated me badly:

desertion, other [pb_noun_adj]

men;

she brought me immense [pb_noun_adj]

pain,

continually;

s he lied, stole;

there was desertion,

other men,

yet we had our moments; and [pb_relword]

our little soap opera ended [pb_verb_prep]

with her in a coma [pb_noun_prep]

in the hospital,

and I sat at her bed [pb_noun_prep]

for hours

talking to her,

and then she opened her eyes

and saw me:

"I knew it would be you,"

she said.

then hse closed her [pb_det_noun]

eyes.

the next day she was

dead.

I drank alone

for two years [pb_noun_prep]

after that.
