was a truly amazing man
he pretended to be
rich
even though we lived on beans and mush and weenies [ex_subj_verb]
when we sat down to eat, he said,
"not everybody can eat like this."

and because he wanted to be rich or because he actually [pb_verb_adv]
thought he was rich [ex_subj_verb]
he always voted Republican
and he voted for Hoover against Roosevelt [ex_subj_verb]
and he lost [ex_subj_verb]
and then he voted for Alf Landon against Roosevelt [ex_subj_verb]
and he lost again [pb_verb_adv]
saying, "I don't know what this world is coming to,
now we've got that god damned Red in there again
and the Russians will be in our backyard next!"

I think it was my father who made me decide to [pb_to_verb]
become a bum.
I decided that if a man like that wants to be rich [ex_subj_verb]
then I want to be poor.

and I became a bum.
I lived on nickles and dimes and in cheap rooms and
on park benches.
I thought maybe the bums knew something.

but I found out that most of the bums wanted to be
rich too.
they had just failed at that.

so caught between my father and the bums
I had no place to go [ex_subj_verb]
and I went there fast and slow.
never voted Republican
never voted.

buried him
like an oddity of the earth
like a hundred thousand oddities
like millions of other oddities,
wasted.
