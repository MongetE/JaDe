in glass pagodas hung with veils of green [cc_cross_clause]

to waken dreamers in the milky dawn,
while tulips bow like a college of cardinals [pb_noun_prep]
before that papal paragon, the sun.

Christened in a spindrift of snowdrop stars,
where on pink-fluted feet the pigeons pass [ex_dobj_verb]
and jonquils sprout like solomon's metaphors,
my love and I go garlanded with grass.

Again we are deluded and infer [pb_verb_prep]
that somehow we are younger than we were.
