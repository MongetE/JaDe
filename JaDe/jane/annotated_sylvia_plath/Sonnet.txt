All right, let's say you could take a skull and break it [ex_subj_verb]
The way you'd crack a clock; you'd crush the bone [pb_noun_prep]
Between steel palms of inclination, take it,
Observing the wreck of metal and rare stone.

This was a woman : her loves and stratagems [ex_subj_verb]
Betrayed in mute geometry of broken [pb_noun_adj]
Cogs and disks, inane mechanic whims,
And idle coils of jargon yet unspoken.

Not man nor demigod could put together [ex_dobj_verb]
The scraps of rusted reverie, the wheels [pb_noun_prep]
Of notched tin platitudes concerning weather,
Perfume, politics, and fixed ideals.

The idiot bird leaps up and drunken leans [pb_adj_prep]
To chirp the hour in lunatic thirteens.
