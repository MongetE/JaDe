No novice [pb_noun_prep]
In those elaborate rituals [cc_cross_clause]
Which allay the malice [pb_noun_prep]
Of knotted table and crooked chair,
The new woman in the ward [ex_subj_verb]
Wears purple, steps carefully
Among her secret combinations of eggshells
And breakable hummingbirds,
Footing sallow as a mouse [pb_noun_prep]
Between the cabbage-roses [cc_cross_clause]
Which are slowly opening their furred petals
To devour and drag her down
Into the carpet's design.

With bid-quick eyed cocked askew
She can see in the nick of time
How perilous needles grain the floorboards
And outwit their brambled plan;
Now through her ambushed air,
Adazzle with bright shards [pb_noun_prep]
Of broken glass,
She edges with wary breath,
Fending off jag and tooth,
Until, turning sideways,
She lifts one webbed foot after the other
Into the still, sultry weather [pb_noun_prep]
Of the patients' dining room.
