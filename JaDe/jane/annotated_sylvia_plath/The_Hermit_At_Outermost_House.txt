Sky and sea, horizon-hinged [ex_dobj_verb]
Tablets of blank blue, couldn't,
Clapped shut, flatten this man out.

The great gods, Stone-Head, Claw-Foot [ex_subj_verb]
Winded by much rock-bumping
And claw-threat, realized that.

For what, then, had they endured [pb_verb_adv]
Dourly the long hots and colds,
Those old despots, if he sat [ex_dobj_verb]

Laugh-shaken on his doorsill,
Backbone unbendable as [pb_relword]
Timbers of his upright hut?

Hard gods were there, nothing else.
Still he thumbed out something else.
Thumbed no stony, horny pot,

But a certain meaning green.
He withstood them, that hermit.
Rock-face, crab-claw verged on green.

Gulls mulled in the greenest light.
