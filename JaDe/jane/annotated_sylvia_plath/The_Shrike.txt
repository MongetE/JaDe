When night comes black [pb_adj_adj]
Such royal dreams beckon this man
As lift him apart
From his earth-wife's side [pb_noun_prep]
To wing, sleep-feathered,
The singular air,
While she, envious bride,
Cannot follow after, but lies [pb_verb_prep]
With her blank brown eyes starved wide,
Twisting curses in the tangled sheet [pb_noun_prep]
With taloned fingers,
Shaking in her skull's cage [ex_dobj_verb]
The stuffed shape of her flown mate [ex_subj_verb]
Escaped among moon-plumaged strangers;
So hungered, she must wait in rage [pb_noun_prep]
Until bird-racketing dawn
When her shrike-face [ex_subj_verb]
Leans to peck open those locked lids, to eat [ex_dobj_verb]
Crowns, palace, all [ex_subj_verb]
That nightlong stole her male,
And with red beak [pb_noun_noun]
Spike and suck out [ex_dobj_verb]
Last blood-drop of that truant heart.
