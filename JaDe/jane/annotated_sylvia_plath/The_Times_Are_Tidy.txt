Unlucky the hero born [pb_verb_prep]
In this province of the stuck record [cc_cross_clause]
Where the most watchful cooks go jobless
And the mayor's r√¥tisserie turns [ex_dobj_verb]
Round of its own accord.

There's no career in the venture [pb_noun_prep]
Of riding against the lizard,
Himself withered these latter-days
To leaf-size from lack of action:
History's beaten the hazard.

The last crone got burnt up
More than eight decades back
With the love-hot herb, the talking cat,
But the children are better for it,
The cow milks cream an inch thick.
