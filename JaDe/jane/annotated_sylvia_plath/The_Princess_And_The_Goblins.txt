From fabrication springs the spiral stair [pb_noun_prep]
up which the wakeful princess climbs to find [ex_dobj_verb]
the source of blanching light that conjured her

to leave her bed of fever and ascend [ex_dobj_verb]
a visionary ladder toward the moon [ex_subj_verb]
whose holy blue anoints her injured hand.

With finger bandaged where the waspish pin [ex_subj_verb]
flew from the intricate embroidery
and stung according to the witch's plan,

she mounts through malice of the needle's eye,
trailing her scrupulously simple gown [pb_noun_prep]
along bright asterisks by milky way.

Colonnades of angels nod her in
where ancient, infinite, and beautiful,
her legendary godmother leans down,

spinning a single stubborn thread of wool [cc_cross_clause]
which all the artful wizards cannot crimp [pb_verb_cprep]
to keep the young girl from her crowning goal.

Initiated by the lunar lamp,
kindling her within a steepled flame,
the princess hears the thunder and the pomp

of squadrons underground abducting him
who is the destination of the cord
now bound around her wrist till she redeem [ex_dobj_verb]
this miner's boy from goblin bodyguard.

Guided only by the tug and twitch [pb_verb_prep]
of that mercurial strand, the girl goes down [ex_dobj_verb]
the darkening stair, undoes the palace latch

and slips unseen past watchmen on the lawn [cc_cross_clause]
dozing around their silvered sentry box.
Across the frosted grass she marks the sheen [pb_noun_prep]

of thread conducting her to the worn tracks [pb_noun_adj]
made by miners up the mountainside [pb_noun_prep]
among the jagged mazes of the rocks.

Laboring on the tilt of that steep grade [pb_noun_prep]
behind which the declining moon has set,
she recalls queer stories her nurse read [pb_verb_prep]

about a goblin raid on miner's hut
because new excavations came too near [ex_dobj_verb]
the chambers where their fiendish queen would sit.

Hearing a weird cackle from afar,
she clutches at the talismanic cord
and confronts a cairn of iron ore.

Suddenly a brazen song is heard [pb_verb_prep]
from the pragmatic boy confined within,
gaily cursing the whole goblin horde.

Inviolate in the circle of that skein,
looping like faith about her bleeding feet,
the princess frees the miner, stone by stone,
and leads him home to be her chosen knight.

The princess coaxes the incredulous boy [pb_noun_prep]
through candid kitchens in the rising sun
to seek the staircase by the glare of day.

Hand in hand, they scale meridian,
clambering up the creaking heights of heat [pb_noun_prep]
until she hears the twittering machine [cc_cross_clause]

which quaintly wove the fabric of her fate [pb_noun_prep]
behind the zodiac on attic door [pb_noun_prep]
with abracadabra from the alphabet.

Pointing toward the spindle's cryptic whir,
she tells the greenhorn miner to bow down
and honor the great goddess of the air [ex_subj_verb]

suspended aloft within her planet-shine.
Laughing aloud, the dazzled boy demands [pb_verb_adv]
why he should kneel before a silly scene [cc_cross_clause]

where pigeons promenade the gable-ends
and coo quadrilles about the blighted core [pb_noun_prep]
in a batch of raveled apple rinds.

At his words, the indignant godmother [ex_subj_verb]
vanishes in a labyrinth of hay
while sunlight winds its yarn upon the floor.

O never again will the extravagant straw [ex_subj_verb]
knit up a gilded fable for the child [cc_cross_clause]
who weeps before the desolate tableau [pb_noun_prep]
of clockwork that makes the royal blood run cold.
