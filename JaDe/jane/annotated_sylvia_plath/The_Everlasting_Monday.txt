Thou shalt have an everlasting
Monday and stand in the moon.

The moon's man stands in his shell,
Bent under a bundle [pb_noun_prep]
Of sticks. The light falls chalk and cold
Upon our bedspread.
His teeth are chattering among the leprous [pb_noun_adj]
Peaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes.

He also against black frost [ex_subj_verb]
Would pick sticks, would not rest [pb_verb_prep]
Until his own lit room outshone
Sunday's ghost of sun;
Now works his hell of Mondays in the moon's ball,
Fireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle.
