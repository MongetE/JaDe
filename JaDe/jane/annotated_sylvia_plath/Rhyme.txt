I've got a stubborn goose whose gut's [cc_cross_clause]
Honeycombed with golden eggs,
Yet won't lay one.
She, addled in her goose-wit, struts [ex_dobj_verb]
The barnyard like those taloned hags [cc_cross_clause]
Who ogle men

And crimp their wrinkles in a grin,
Jangling their great money bags.
While I eat grits
She fattens on the finest grain.
Now, as I hone my knife, she begs [ex_dobj_verb]
Pardon, and that's

So humbly done, I'd turn this keen [pb_noun_adj]
Steel on myself before profit [pb_noun_prep]
By such a rogue's
Act, but â€”- How those feathers shine!

Exit from a smoking slit
Her ruby dregs.
