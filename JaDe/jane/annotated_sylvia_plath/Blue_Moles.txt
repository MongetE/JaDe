They're out of the dark's ragbag, these two [pb_noun_adj]
Moles dead in the pebbled rut,
Shapeless as flung gloves, a few feet apart —-
Blue suede a dog or fox has chewed.
One, by himself, seemed pitiable enough,
Little victim unearthed by some large creature [pb_noun_prep]
From his orbit under the elm root.
The second carcass makes a duel of the affair:
Blind twins bitten by bad nature.

The sky's far dome is sane a clear.
Leaves, undoing their yellow caves [pb_noun_prep]
Between the road and the lake water,
Bare no sinister spaces. Already
The moles look neutral as the stones.
Their corkscrew noses, their white hands [ex_subj_verb]
Uplifted, stiffen in a family pose.
Difficult to imagine how fury struck —-
Dissolved now, smoke of an old war.

Nightly the battle-snouts start up
In the ear of the veteran, and again
I enter the soft pelt of the mole.
Light's death to them: they shrivel in it.
They move through their mute rooms while I sleep,
Palming the earth aside, grubbers [pb_noun_prep]
After the fat children of root and rock.
By day, only the topsoil heaves.
Down there one is alone.

Outsize hands prepare a path,
They go before: opening the veins,
Delving for the appendages [pb_noun_prep]
Of beetles, sweetbreads, shards — to be eaten [pb_verb_adv]
Over and over. And still the heaven [ex_subj_verb]
Of final surfeit is just as far
From the door as ever. What happens between us [ex_subj_verb]
Happens in darkness, vanishes [pb_noun_adj]
Easy and often as each breath.
