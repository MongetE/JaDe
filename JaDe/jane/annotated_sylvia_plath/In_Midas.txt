Meadows of gold dust. The silver [pb_noun_noun]
Currents of the Connecticut fan
And meander in bland pleatings under
River-verge farms where rye-heads whiten.
All's polished to a dull luster [pb_noun_prep]

In the sulfurous noon. We move [pb_verb_prep]
With the languor of idols below [pb_relword]
The sky's great bell glass and briefly engrave [ex_dobj_verb]
Our limbs' image on a field of straw
And goldenrod as on gold leaf.

It might be heaven, this static [pb_noun_adj]
Plenitude: apples gold on the bough,
Goldfinch, goldfish, golden tiger cat stock-
Still in one gigantic tapestryâ€”
And lovers affable, dovelike.

But now the water-skiers race,
Bracing their knees. On unseen towlines
They cleave the river's greening patinas;
The mirror quivers to smithereens.
They stunt like clowns in the circus.

So we are hauled, though we would stop [pb_verb_prep]
On this amber bank where grasses bleach.
Already the farmer's after his crop,
August gives over its Midas touch,
Wind bares a flintier landscape.
