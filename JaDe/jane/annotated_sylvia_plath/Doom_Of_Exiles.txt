Now we, returning from the vaulted domes [pb_noun_prep]
Of our colossal sleep, come home to find [ex_dobj_verb]
A tall metropolis of catacombs [ex_subj_verb]
Erected down the gangways of our mind.

Green alleys where we reveled have become [ex_dobj_verb]
The infernal haunt of demon dangers;
Both seraph song and violins are dumb;
Each clock tick consecrates the death of strangers

Backward we traveled to reclaim the day [pb_noun_prep]
Before we fell, like Icarus, undone;
All we find are altars in decay
And profane words scrawled black across the sun.

Still, stubbornly we try to crack the nut [pb_noun_prep]
In which the riddle of our race is shut.
