'Tea leaves I've given up,
And that crooked line [pb_noun_prep]
On the queen's palm [ex_subj_verb]
Is no more my concern.
On my black pilgrimage
This moon-pocked crystal ball [ex_subj_verb]
Will break before it help;
Rather than croak out
What's to come,
My darling ravens are flown.

'Forswear those freezing tricks of sight
And all else I've taught [pb_verb_prep]
Against the flower in the blood:
Not wealth nor wisdom stands [pb_verb_prep]
Above the simple vein,
The straight mouth.
Go to your greenhorn youth [pb_noun_prep]
Before time ends [ex_dobj_verb]
And do good [pb_noun_prep]
With your white hands.'
