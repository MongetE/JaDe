All morning in the strawberry field
They talked about the Russians.
Squatted down between the rows
We listened.
We heard the head woman say,
'Bomb them off the map.'

Horseflies buzzed, paused and stung.
And the taste of strawberries [ex_subj_verb]
Turned thick and sour.

Mary said slowly, 'I've got a fella [pb_noun_adj]
Old enough to go.
If anything should happen…'

The sky was high and blue.
Two children laughed at tag [pb_noun_prep]
In the tall grass,
Leaping awkward and long-legged
Across the rutted road.
The fields were full of bronzed young men [pb_noun_noun]
Hoeing lettuce, weeding celery.

'The draft is passed,' the woman said.
'We ought to have bombed them long ago.'
'Don't,' pleaded the little girl [pb_noun_prep]
With blond braids.

Her blue eyes swam with vague terror.
She added petishly, 'I can't see why
You're always talking this way…'
'Oh, stop worrying, Nelda,' [ex_subj_verb]
Snapped the woman sharply.
She stood up, a thin commanding figure [pb_noun_prep]
In faded dungarees.
Businesslike she asked us, 'How many quarts?' [ex_subj_verb]
She recorded the total in her notebook,
And we all turned back to picking.

Kneeling over the rows,
We reached among the leaves [pb_noun_prep]
With quick practiced hands,
Cupping the berry protectively before
Snapping off the stem [pb_noun_prep]
Between thumb and forefinger.
