This man makes a pseudonym
And crawls behind it like a worm.

This woman on the telephone [ex_subj_verb]
Says she is a man, not a woman.

The mask increases, eats the worm,
Stripes for mouth and eyes and nose,

The voice of the woman hollows—-
More and more like a dead one,

Worms in the glottal stops.
She hates [ex_dobj_verb]

The thought of a baby—-
Stealer of cells, stealer of beauty—-

She would rather be dead than fat,
Dead and perfect, like Nefertit,

Hearing the fierce mask magnify [ex_dobj_verb]
The silver limbo of each eye [cc_cross_clause]

Where the child can never swim,
Where there is only him and him.
