Your clear eye is the one absolutely beautiful thing.
I want to fill it with color and ducks,
The zoo of the new
Whose name you meditate â€”
April snowdrop, Indian pipe,
Little [pb_adj_adj]

Stalk without wrinkle,
Pool in which images [cc_cross_clause]
Should be grand and classical

Not this troublous [pb_noun_adj]
Wringing of hands, this dark [pb_noun_adj]
Ceiling without a star.
