Through fen and farmland walking [pb_noun_prep]
With my own country love
I saw slow flocked cows move [ex_dobj_verb]
White hulks on their day's cruising;
Sweet grass sprang for their grazing.

The air was bright for looking:
Most far in blue, aloft,
Clouds steered a burnished drift;
Larks' nip and tuck arising [ex_subj_verb]
Came in for my love's praising.

Sheen of the noonsun striking [ex_subj_verb]
Took my heart as if
It were a green-tipped leaf [pb_noun_adj]
Kindled by my love's pleasing
Into an ardent blazing.

And so, together, talking,
Through Sunday's honey-air
We walked (and still walk thereâ€”-
Out of the sun's bruising)
Till the night mists came rising.
