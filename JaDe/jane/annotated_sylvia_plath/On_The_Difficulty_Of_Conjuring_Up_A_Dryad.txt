Ravening through the persistent bric-à-brac [pb_noun_prep]
Of blunt pencils, rose-sprigged coffee cup,
Postage stamps, stacked books' clamor and yawp,
Neighborhood cockcrow—all nature's prodigal backtalk,
The vaunting mind
Snubs impromptu spiels of wind
And wrestles to impose [ex_dobj_verb]
Its own order on what is.

‘With my fantasy alone,' brags the importunate head,
Arrogant among rook-tongued spaces,
Sheep greens, finned falls, ‘I shall compose a crisis
To stun sky black out, drive gibbering mad [pb_noun_adj]
Trout, cock, ram,
That bulk so calm
On my jealous stare,
Self-sufficient as they are.'

But no hocus-pocus of green angels [ex_subj_verb]
Damasks with dazzle the threadbare eye;
‘My trouble, doctor, is: I see a tree,
And that damn scrupulous tree won't practice wiles
To beguile sight:
E.g., by cant of light
Concoct a Daphne;
My tree stays tree.

‘However I wrench obstinate bark and trunk [pb_noun_prep]
To my sweet will, no luminous shape [ex_subj_verb]
Steps out radiant in limb, eye, lip,
To hoodwink the honest earth which pointblank [ex_subj_verb]
Spurns such fiction [pb_noun_prep]
As nymphs; cold vision [ex_subj_verb]
Will have no counterfeit [pb_adj_adv]
Palmed off on it.

‘No doubt now in dream-propertied fall some moon-eyed,
Star-lucky sleight-of-hand man watches [ex_dobj_verb]
My jilting lady squander coin, gold leaf stock ditches,
And the opulent air go studded with seed,
While this beggared brain [ex_subj_verb]
Hatches no fortune,
But from leaf, from grass,
Thieves what it has.'
