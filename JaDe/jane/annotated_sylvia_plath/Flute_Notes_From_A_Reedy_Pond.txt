Now coldness comes sifting down, layer after layer,
To our bower at the lily root.
Overhead the old umbrellas of summer [ex_subj_verb]
Wither like pithless hands. There is little shelter.

Hourly the eye of the sky enlarges its blank [pb_noun_adj]
Dominion. The stars are no nearer.
Already frog-mouth and fish-mouth drink [ex_dobj_verb]
The liquor of indolence, and all thing sink

Into a soft caul of forgetfulness.
The fugitive colors die.
Caddis worms drowse in their silk cases,
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep like statues.

Puppets, loosed from the strings of the puppetmaster [ex_subj_verb]
Wear masks of horn to bed.
This is not death, it is something safer.
The wingy myths won't tug at us anymore:

The molts are tongueless that sang from above the water [pb_noun_prep]
Of golgotha at the tip of a reed,
And how a god flimsy as a baby's finger
Shall unhusk himself and steer into the air.
