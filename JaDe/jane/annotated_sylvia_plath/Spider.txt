Anansi, black busybody of the folktales,
You scuttle out on impulse [pb_noun_adj]
Blunt in self-interest
As a sledge hammer, as a man's bunched fist,
Yet of devils the cleverest [pb_comp]
To get your carousals told:
You spun the cosmic web: you squint from center field.

Last summer I came upon your Spanish cousin,
Notable robber baron,
Behind a goatherd's hut:
Near his small stonehenge above the ants' route,
One-third ant-size, a leggy spot,
He tripped an ant with a rope
Scarcely visible. About and about the slope [pb_noun_prep]

Of his redoubt he ran his nimble filament,
Each time round winding that ant
Tighter to the cocoon [pb_comp]
Already veiling the gray spool of stone [pb_noun_prep]
From which coils, caught ants waved legs in
Torpid warning, or lay still
And suffered their livelier fellows to struggle.

Then briskly scaled his altar tiered with tethered ants,
Nodding in a somnolence [ex_dobj_verb]
Appalling to witness,
To the barbarous outlook, from there chose [ex_dobj_verb]
His next martyr to the gross cause [pb_noun_prep]
Of concupiscence. Once more [pb_comp]
With black alacrity bound round his prisoner.

The ants—a file of comers, a file of goers—
Persevered on a set course
No scruple could disrupt,
Obeying orders of instinct till swept [pb_verb_prep]
Off-stage and infamously wrapped [pb_phrasal_verb]
Up by a spry black deus [ex_dobj_verb]
Ex machina. Nor did they seem deterred by this.
