On storm-struck deck, wind sirens caterwaul;
With each tilt, shock and shudder, our blunt ship [ex_subj_verb]
Cleaves forward into fury; dark as anger,
Waves wallop, assaulting the stubborn hull.
Flayed by spray, we take the challenge up,
Grip the rail, squint ahead, and wonder how much longer [pb_adj_adv]

Such force can last; but beyond, the neutral view [pb_noun_noun]
Shows, rank on rank, the hungry seas advancing.
Below, rocked havoc-sick, voyagers lie [pb_verb_adv]
Retching in bright orange basins; a refugee [pb_noun_noun]
Sprawls, hunched in black, among baggage, wincing [pb_verb_prep]
Under the strict mask of his agony.

Far from the sweet stench of that perilous air [pb_noun_prep]
In which our comrades are betrayed, we freeze
And marvel at the smashing nonchalance [pb_noun_prep]
Of nature : what better way to test taut fiber
Than against this onslaught, these casual blasts of ice [cc_cross_clause]
That wrestle with us like angels; the mere chance [pb_noun_prep]

Of making harbor through this racketing flux [ex_subj_verb]
Taunts us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey [ex_subj_verb]
Would be full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched [pb_verb_prep]
With radiance, peacock-colored; instead, bleak rocks [ex_subj_verb]
Jutted early to mark our going, while sky [ex_subj_verb]
Curded over with clouds and chalk cliffs blanched [pb_verb_prep]

In sullen light of the inauspicious day.
Now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the common ill
Knocking our brothers down, we strike a stance
Most mock-heroic, to cloak our waking awe [pb_noun_prep]
At this rare rumpus which no man can control :
Meek and proud both fall; stark violence [ex_subj_verb]

Lays all walls waste; private estates are torn,
Ransacked in the public eye. We forsake [ex_dobj_verb]
Our lone luck now, compelled by bond, by blood,
To keep some unsaid pact; perhaps concern [ex_subj_verb]
Is helpless here, quite extra, yet we must make [ex_dobj_verb]
The gesture, bend and hold the prone man's head.

And so we sail toward cities, streets and homes [pb_noun_prep]
Of other men, where statues celebrate [ex_dobj_verb]
Brave acts played out in peace, in war; all dangers [ex_subj_verb]
End : green shores appear; we assume our names,
Our luggage, as docks halt our brief epic; no debt [ex_subj_verb]
Survives arrival; we walk the plank with strangers.
