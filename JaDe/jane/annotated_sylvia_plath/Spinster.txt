Now this particular girl [pb_noun_prep]
During a ceremonious april walk [pb_noun_prep]
With her latest suitor [pb_comp]
Found herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck [pb_verb_prep]
By the bird's irregular babel
And the leaves' litter.
By this tumult afflicted, she [ex_subj_verb]
Observed her lover's gestures unbalance the air,
His gait stray uneven
Through a rank wilderness of fern and flower;
She judged petals in disarray,
The whole season, sloven.
How she longed for winter then!-
Scrupulously austere in its order [pb_noun_prep]
Of white and black [pb_noun_adj]
Ice and rock; each sentiment within border,
And heart's frosty discipline [ex_subj_verb]
Exact as a snowflake.
But here - a burgeoning
Unruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits [pb_noun_prep]
Into vulgar motley-
A treason not to be borne; let idiots [ex_subj_verb]
Reel giddy in bedlam spring;
She withdrew neatly.
And round her house she set [ex_dobj_verb]
Such a barricade of barb and check [pb_verb_prep]
Against mutinous weather
As no mere insurgent man could hope to break [pb_verb_prep]
With curse, fist, threat
Or love, either.
