The fountains are dry and the roses over.
Incense of death. Your day approaches.
The pears fatten like little buddhas.
A blue mist is dragging the lake.

You move through the era of fishes,
The smug centuries of the pig-
Head, toe and finger [ex_subj_verb]
Come clear of the shadow. History [ex_subj_verb]

Nourishes these broken flutings,
These crowns of acanthus,
And the crow settles her garments.
You inherit white heather, a bee's wing,

Two suicides, the family wolves,
Hours of blankness. Some hard stars [ex_subj_verb]
Already yellow the heavens.
The spider on its own string [ex_subj_verb]

Crosses the lake. The worms [ex_subj_verb]
Quit their usual habitations.
The small birds converge, converge [pb_verb_prep]
With their gifts to a difficult borning.
