He, hunger-strung, hard to slake,
So fitted is for my black luck
(With heat such as no man could have
And yet keep kind)
That all merit's in being meat [ex_subj_verb]
Seasoned how he'd most approve;
Blood's broth [ex_subj_verb]
Filched by his hand,
Choice wassail makes, cooked hot,
Cupped quick to mouth;
Though prime parts cram each rich meal,
He'll not spare
Nor scant his want until [ex_subj_verb]
Sacked larder's gone bone-bare.
