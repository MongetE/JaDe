'Perspective betrays with its dichotomy:
train tracks always meet, not here, but only
in the impossible mind's eye;
horizons beat a retreat as we embark [pb_verb_prep]
on sophist seas to overtake that mark
where wave pretends to drench real sky.'

'Well then, if we agree, it is not odd [ex_subj_verb]
that one man's devil is another's god [ex_subj_verb]
or that the solar spectrum is [ex_dobj_verb]
a multitude of shaded grays; suspense [pb_noun_prep]
on the quicksands of ambivalence [ex_subj_verb]
is our life's whole nemesis.

So we could rave on, darling, you and I,
until the stars tick out a lullaby [pb_noun_prep]
about each cosmic pro and con;
nothing changes, for all the blazing of [pb_relword]
our drastic jargon, but clock hands that move [pb_verb_adv]
implacably from twelve to one.

We raise our arguments like sitting ducks
to knock them down with logic or with luck
and contradict ourselves for fun;
the waitress holds our coats and we put on [ex_dobj_verb]
the raw wind like a scarf; love is a faun
who insists his playmates run.

Now you, my intellectual leprechaun,
would have me swallow the entire sun
like an enormous oyster, down
the ocean in one gulp: you say a mark [pb_noun_prep]
of comet hara-kiri through the dark
should inflame the sleeping town.

So kiss: the drunks upon the curb and dames [pb_verb_prep]
in dubious doorways forget their monday names,
caper with candles in their heads;
the leaves applaud, and santa claus flies in [ex_verb_adjunct]
scattering candy from a zeppelin,
playing his prodigal charades.

The moon leans down to took; the tilting fish [pb_noun_prep]
in the rare river wink and laugh; we lavish [ex_dobj_verb]
blessings right and left and cry
hello, and then hello again in deaf [pb_noun_adj]
churchyard ears until the starlit stiff [pb_noun_adj]
graves all carol in reply.

Now kiss again: till our strict father leans
to call for curtain on our thousand scenes;
brazen actors mock at him,
multiply pink harlequins and sing [pb_verb_prep]
in gay ventriloquy from wing to wing
while footlights flare and houselights dim.

Tell now, we taunt where black or white begins [ex_verb_adjunct]
and separate the flutes from violins:
the algebra of absolutes [pb_noun_noun]
explodes in a kaleidoscope of shapes
that jar, while each polemic jackanapes [ex_subj_verb]
joins his enemies' recruits.

The paradox is that 'the play's the thing':
though prima donna pouts and critic stings,
there burns throughout the line of words,
the cultivated act, a fierce brief fusion [cc_cross_clause]
which dreamers call real, and realists, illusion:
an insight like the flight of birds:

Arrows that lacerate the sky, while knowing [ex_dobj_verb]
the secret of their ecstasy's in going;
some day, moving, one will drop,
and, dropping, die, to trace a wound that heals [cc_cross_clause]
only to reopen as flesh congeals:
cycling phoenix never stops.

So we shall walk barefoot on walnut shells [pb_noun_prep]
of withered worlds, and stamp out puny hells
and heavens till the spirits squeak [ex_dobj_verb]
surrender: to build our bed as high as jack's
bold beanstalk; lie and love till sharp scythe hacks
away our rationed days and weeks.

Then jet the blue tent topple, stars rain down,
and god or void appall us till we drown [pb_verb_prep]
in our own tears: today we start [pb_verb_cprep]
to pay the piper with each breath, yet love [ex_subj_verb]
knows not of death nor calculus above [ex_dobj_verb]
the simple sum of heart plus heart.
