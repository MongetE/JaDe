It beguilesâ€”
This little Odyssey [pb_noun_prep]
In pink and lavender [pb_verb_prep]
Over a surface of gently-
Graded turquoise tiles [cc_cross_clause]
That represent a sea [pb_noun_prep]
With chequered waves and gaily [pb_verb_adv]
Bear up the seafarer,
Gaily, gaily,
In his pink plume and armor.

A lantern-frail [pb_noun_noun]
Gondola of paper [ex_subj_verb]
Ferries the fishpond Sindbad [cc_cross_clause]
Who poises his pastel spear [pb_noun_prep]
Toward three pinky-purple [pb_noun_adj]
Monsters which uprear [pb_verb_prep]
Off the ocean-floor [pb_noun_prep]
With fanged and dreadful head.
Beware, beware [ex_dobj_verb]
The whale, the shark, the squid.

But fins and scales [pb_noun_prep]
Of each scrolled sea-beast [pb_noun_noun]
Troll no slime, no weed.
They are polished for the joust,
They gleam like easter eggshells,
Rose and amethyst.
Ahab, fulfill your boast:
Bring home each storied head.
One thrust, one thrust,
One thrust: and they are sped.

So fables go.
And so all children sing
Their bathtub battles deep,
Hazardous and long,
But oh, sage grownups know [ex_dobj_verb]
Sea-dragon for sofa, fang
For pasteboard, and siren-song
For fever in a sleep.
Laughing, laughing [pb_verb_prep]
Of graybeards wakes us up.
