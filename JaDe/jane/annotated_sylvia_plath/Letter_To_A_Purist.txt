That grandiose colossus who [ex_subj_verb]
Stood astride [ex_dobj_verb]
The envious assaults of sea
(Essaying, wave by wave,
Tide by tide,
To undo him, perpetually),
Has nothing on you,
O my love,
O my great idiot, who
With one foot [ex_subj_verb]
Caught (as it were) in the muck-trap [pb_noun_prep]
Of skin and bone,
Dithers with the other way out [pb_relword]
In preposterous provinces of the madcap [pb_noun_adj]
Cloud-cuckoo,
Agawp at the impeccable moon.
