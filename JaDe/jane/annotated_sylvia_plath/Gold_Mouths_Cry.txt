Gold mouths cry with the green young [pb_noun_adj]
certainty of the bronze boy [cc_cross_clause]
remembering a thousand autumns
and how a hundred thousand leaves [ex_subj_verb]
came sliding down his shoulder blades [pb_noun_adj]
persuaded by his bronze heroic reason.
We ignore the coming doom of gold [ex_subj_verb]
and we are glad in this bright metal season.
Even the dead laugh among the goldenrod.

The bronze boy stands kneedeep in centuries,
and never grieves,
remembering a thousand autumns,
with sunlight of a thousand years upon his lips
and his eyes gone blind with leaves.
