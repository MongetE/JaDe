The nose-end that twitches, the old imperfections—-
Tolerable now as moles on the face [ex_subj_verb]
Put up with until chagrin gives place [pb_noun_prep]
To a wry complaisance—-

Dug in first as God's spurs
To start the spirit out of the mud
It stabled in; long-used, became well-loved [ex_dobj_verb]
Bedfellows of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
