Sing praise for statuary:
For those anchored attitudes [cc_cross_clause]
And staunch stone eyes that stare [pb_verb_prep]
Through lichen-lid and passing bird-foot [pb_noun_prep]
At some steadfast mark [pb_noun_prep]
Beyond the inconstant green [pb_noun_adj]
Gallop and flick of light [pb_noun_prep]
In this precarious park [cc_cross_clause]

Where vivid children twirl
Like colored tops through time
Nor stop to understand [pb_verb_adv]
How all their play is touch-and-go:
But, Go! they cry, and the swing
Arcs up to the tall tree tip;
Go! and the merry-go-round [ex_subj_verb]
Hauls them round with it.

And I, like the children, caught [pb_verb_prep]
In the mortal active verb,
Let my transient eye break a tear [pb_noun_prep]
For each quick, flaring game [pb_noun_prep]
Of child, leaf and cloud,
While on this same fugue, unmoved,
Those stonier eyes look,
Safe-socketed in rock.
