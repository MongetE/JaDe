Flintlike, her feet struck [ex_dobj_verb]
Such a racket of echoes from the steely street,
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the black [pb_noun_adj]
Stone-built town, that she heard the quick air ignite
Its tinder and shake [ex_dobj_verb]

A firework of echoes from wall
To wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages.
But the echoes died at her back as the walls [ex_subj_verb]
Gave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses
Riding in the full

Of the moon, manes to the wind,
Tireless, tied, as a moon-bound sea [pb_noun_noun]
Moves on its root. Though a mist-wraith wound [pb_noun_prep]
Up from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
Ahead, it fattened [pb_verb_prep]

To no family-featured ghost,
Nor did any word body with a name
The blank mood she walked in. Once past
The dream-peopled village, her eyes entertained no dream,
And the sandman's dust [ex_subj_verb]

Lost luster under her footsoles.
The long wind, paring her person down [ex_subj_verb]
To a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle [pb_noun_prep]
In the whorl of her ear, and like a scooped-out pumpkin crown
Her head cupped the babel.

All the night gave her, in return [pb_noun_prep]
For the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat [pb_noun_prep]
Of her heart was the humped indifferent iron [pb_noun_prep]
Of its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set [pb_noun_prep]
On black stone. Barns [ex_subj_verb]

Guarded broods and litters [pb_noun_prep]
Behind shut doors; the dairy herds [ex_subj_verb]
Knelt in the meadow mute as boulders;
Sheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds,
Twig-sleep, wore [ex_dobj_verb]

Granite ruffs, their shadows
The guise of leaves. The whole landscape [ex_subj_verb]
Loomed absolute as the antique world was
Once in its earliest sway of lymph and sap,
Unaltered by eyes,

Enough to snuff the quick [pb_phrasal_verb]
Of her small heat out, but before the weight [pb_noun_prep]
Of stones and hills of stones could break [pb_phrasal_verb]
Her down to mere quartz grit n that stony light
She turned back.
