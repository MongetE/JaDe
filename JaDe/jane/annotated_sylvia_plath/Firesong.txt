Born green we were [pb_verb_prep]
to this flawed garden,
but in speckled thickets, warted as a toad,
spitefully skulks our warden,
fixing his snare [cc_cross_clause]
which hauls down buck, cock, trout, till all most fair [pb_comp]
is tricked to faulter in split blood.

Now our whole task's to hack [ex_dobj_verb]
some angel-shape worth wearing [pb_verb_prep]
from his crabbed midden where all's wrought so awry
that no straight inquiring
could unlock [ex_dobj_verb]
shrewd catch silting our each bright act back
to unmade mud cloaked by sour sky.

Sweet salts warped stem [pb_noun_prep]
of weeds we tackle towards way's rank ending;
scorched by red sun
we heft globed flint, racked in veins' barbed bindings;
brave love, dream
not of staunching such strict flame, but come,
lean to my wound; burn on, burn on.
