O half moon—-

Half-brain, luminosity—-
Negro, masked like a white,

Your dark [pb_noun_adj]
Amputations crawl and appall—-

Spidery, unsafe.
What glove

What leatheriness [ex_subj_verb]
Has protected [ex_dobj_verb]

Me from that shadow—-
The indelible buds.

Knuckles at shoulder-blades, the [ex_subj_verb]
Faces that [ex_subj_verb]

Shove into being, dragging [ex_dobj_verb]
The lopped [pb_noun_adj]

Blood-caul of absences.
All night I carpenter [ex_dobj_verb]

A space for the thing I am given,
A love [pb_noun_prep]

Of two wet eyes and a screech.

Of indifference!
The dark fruits revolve and fall.

The glass cracks across,
The image [ex_subj_verb]

Flees and aborts like dropped mercury.
