No lame excuses can gloss over
Barge-tar clotted at the tide-line, the wrecked pier.
I should have known better.

Fifteen years between me and the bay [ex_subj_verb]
Profited memory, but did away with the old scenery
And patched this shoddy [pb_noun_adj]

Makeshift of a view to quit [ex_dobj_verb]
My promise of an idyll. The blue's worn out:
It's a ****rd estate,

Inimical now. The great green rock
We gave good use as ship and house is black
With tarry muck

And periwinkles, shrunk to common [pb_noun_adj]
Size. The cries of scavenging gulls sound thin
In the traffic of planes [pb_noun_prep]

From Logan Airport opposite.
Gulls circle gray under shadow of a steelier flight.
Loss cancels profit.

Unless you do this tawdry harbor [ex_dobj_verb]
A service and ignore it, I go a liar [pb_noun_noun]
Gilding what's eyesore,

Or must take loophole and blame time [pb_noun_prep]
For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the drabbled scum,
For a churlish welcome.
