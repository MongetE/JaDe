I?
I walk alone;
The midnight street [ex_subj_verb]
Spins itself from under my feet;
When my eyes shut [ex_dobj_verb]
These dreaming houses all snuff out;
Through a whim of mine
Over gables the moon's celestial onion [ex_subj_verb]
Hangs high.

I
Make houses shrink [ex_dobj_verb]
And trees diminish [pb_verb_prep]
By going far; my look's leash [ex_subj_verb]
Dangles the puppet-people [cc_cross_clause]
Who, unaware how they dwindle,
Laugh, kiss, get drunk,
Nor guess that if I choose to blink
They die.

I
When in good humor,
Give grass its green [ex_dobj_verb]
Blazon sky blue, and endow the sun [pb_noun_prep]
With gold;
Yet, in my wintriest moods, I hold [ex_dobj_verb]
Absolute power
To boycott any color and forbid any flower
To be.

I
Know you appear
Vivid at my side,
Denying you sprang out of my head,
Claiming you feel
Love fiery enough to prove flesh real,
Though it's quite clear
All you beauty, all your wit, is a gift, my dear,
From me.
