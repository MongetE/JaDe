Kindness glides about my house.
Dame Kindness, she is so nice!
The blue and red jewels of her rings smoke [pb_verb_prep]
In the windows, the mirrors [ex_subj_verb]
Are filling with smiles.

What is so real as the cry of a child?
A rabbit's cry may be wilder [pb_comp]
But it has no soul.
Sugar can cure everything, so Kindness says.
Sugar is a necessary fluid,
Its crystals a little poultice.

O kindness, kindness
Sweetly picking up pieces!
My Japanese silks, desperate butterflies,
May be pinned any minute, anesthetized.

And here you come, with a cup of tea
Wreathed in steam.
The blood jet is poetry,
There is no stopping it.
You hand me two children, two roses.
