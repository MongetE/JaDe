Sharded in black, like beetles,
Frail as antique earthenwear [ex_dobj_verb]
One breath might shiver to bits,
The old women creep out here
To sun on the rocks or prop [pb_phrasal_verb]
Themselves up against the wall [cc_cross_clause]
Whose stones keep a little heat.

Needles knit in a bird-beaked [ex_dobj_verb]
Counterpoint to their voices:
Sons, daughters, daughters and sons,
Distant and cold as photos,
Grandchildren nobody knows.
Age wears the best black fabric [pb_noun_noun]
Rust-red or green as lichens.

At owl-call the old ghosts flock [pb_verb_cprep]
To hustle them off the lawn.
From beds boxed-in like coffins
The bonneted ladies grin.
And Death, that bald-head buzzard,
Stalls in halls where the lamp wick [ex_subj_verb]
Shortens with each breath drawn.
