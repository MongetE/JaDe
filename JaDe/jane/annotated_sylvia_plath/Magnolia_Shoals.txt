Up here among the gull cries
we stroll through a maze of pale [pb_adj_adj]
red-mottled relics, shells, claws [pb_verb_prep]

as if it were summer still.
That season has turned its back.
Through the green sea gardens stall,

bow, and recover their look [pb_noun_prep]
of the imperishable [pb_noun_adj]
gardens in an antique book

or tapestries on a wall,
leaves behind us warp and lapse.
The late month withers, as well.

Below us a white gull keeps [ex_dobj_verb]
the weed-slicked shelf for his own,
hustles other gulls off. Crabs [ex_subj_verb]

rove over his field of stone;
mussels cluster blue as grapes :
his beak brings the harvest in.

The watercolorist grips
his brush in the stringent air.
The horizon's bare of ships,

the beach and the rocks are bare.
He paints a blizzard of gulls,
wings drumming in the winter.
