Riding home from credulous blue domes,
the dreamer reins his waking appetite [pb_noun_prep]
in panic at the crop of catacombs [ex_subj_verb]
sprung up like plague of toadstools overnight:
refectories where he reveled have become [ex_dobj_verb]
the holstery of worms, rapacious blades [cc_cross_clause]
who weave within the skeleton's white womb [ex_dobj_verb]
a caviare decay of rich brocades.

Turning the tables of this grave gourmet,
the fiendish butler saunters in and serves [pb_verb_prep]
for feast the sweetest meat of hell's chef d' uvres:
his own pale bride upon a flaming tray:
parsleyed with elegies, she lies in state [cc_cross_clause]
waiting for his grace to consecrate.
