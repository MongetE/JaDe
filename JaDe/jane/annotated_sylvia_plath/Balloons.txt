Since Christmas they have lived with us,
Guileless and clear,
Oval soul-animals,
Taking up half the space,
Moving and rubbing on the silk

Invisible air drifts,
Giving a shriek and pop [pb_verb_adv]
When attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling.
Yellow cathead, blue fish————
Such queer moons we live with

Instead of dead furniture!
Straw mats, white walls
And these traveling [ex_dobj_verb]
Globes of thin air, red, green,
Delighting [ex_dobj_verb]

The heart like wishes or free [pb_noun_adj]
Peacocks blessing [ex_dobj_verb]
Old ground with a feather [ex_subj_verb]
Beaten in starry metals.
Your small [pb_noun_adj]

Brother is making
His balloon squeak like a cat.
Seeming to see [ex_dobj_verb]
A funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,
He bites,

Then sits [pb_verb_adv]
Back, fat jug [cc_cross_clause]
Contemplating a world clear as water.
A red [pb_noun_adj]
Shred in his little fist.
