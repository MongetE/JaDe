Take the general mumble,
blunt as the faceless gut [pb_noun_prep]
of an anonymous clam,
vernacular as the strut [pb_verb_prep]
of a slug or a small preamble [pb_noun_prep]
by snail under hump of home:

metamorphose the mollusk
of vague vocabulary [pb_noun_prep]
with the structural discipline:
stiffen the ordinary [pb_adj_adj]
malleable mask [pb_noun_prep]
to the granite grin of bone.

For such a tempering task,
heat furnace of paradox [pb_noun_prep]
in an artifice of ice;
make love and logic mix,
and remember, if tedious risk [ex_subj_verb]
seems to jeopardize this:

it was a solar turbine [ex_subj_verb]
gace molten earth a frame
and it took the diamond stone [ex_dobj_verb]
a weight of world and time [cc_cross_clause]
being crystallized from carbon [pb_noun_prep]
to the hardest substance known.
