Will they occur,
These people with torso of steel [ex_subj_verb]
Winged elbows and eyeholes

Awaiting masses [pb_noun_prep]
Of cloud to give them expression,
These super-people! -
And my baby a nail
Driven, driven in.
He shrieks in his grease [pb_noun_noun]

Bones nosing for distance.
And I, nearly extinct,
His three teeth cutting [ex_dobj_verb]

Themselves on my thumb -
And the star,
The old story.

In the lane I meet sheep and wagons,
Red earth, motherly blood.
O You who eat [ex_dobj_verb]

People like light rays, leave [ex_dobj_verb]
This one [pb_noun_adj]
Mirror safe, unredeemed [ex_dobj_verb]

By the dove's annihilation,
The glory
The power, the glory.
