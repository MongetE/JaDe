Behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled [pb_verb_prep]
On the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats,
Gas tanks, factory stacks- that landscape [pb_noun_prep]
Of imperfections his bowels were part of-
Rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught.
Sun struck the water like a damnation.
No pit of shadow to crawl into,
And his blood beating the old tattoo
I am, I am, I am. Children [ex_subj_verb]
Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift [ex_subj_verb]
Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave.
A mongrel working his legs to a gallop [ex_subj_verb]
Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.

He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
His body beached with the sea's garbage,
A machine to breathe and beat forever.
Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole [pb_noun_adj]
Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber.
The words in his book wormed off the pages.
Everything glittered like blank paper.

Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive [pb_noun_adj]
Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage.
He heard when he walked into the water

The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.
