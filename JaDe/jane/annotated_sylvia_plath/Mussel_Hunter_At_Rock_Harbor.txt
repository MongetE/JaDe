I came before the water —-
Colorists came to get the [pb_det_noun]
Good of the Cape light that scours [ex_dobj_verb]
Sand grit to sided crystal
And buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls [pb_noun_prep]
Of the three fishing smacks beached [pb_verb_prep]
On the bank of the river's

Backtracking tail. I'd come for
Free fish-bait: the blue mussels [ex_subj_verb]
Clumped like bulbs at the grassroot [pb_noun_noun]
Margin of the tidal pools.
Dawn tide stood dead low. I smelt [ex_dobj_verb]
Mud stench, shell guts, gulls' leavings;
Heard a queer crusty scrabble [pb_noun_adj]

Cease, and I neared the silenced [ex_dobj_verb]
Edge of a cratered pool-bed.
The mussels hung dull blue and [pb_relword]
Conspicuous, yet it seemed [ex_dobj_verb]
A sly world's hinges had swung [ex_subj_verb]
Shut against me. All held still.
Though I counted scant seconds,

Enough ages lapsed to win [ex_dobj_verb]
Confidence of safe-conduct [pb_noun_prep]
In the wary other world [cc_cross_clause]
Eyeing me. Grass put forth claws,
Small mud knobs, nudged from under,
Displaced their domes as tiny [pb_noun_adj]
Knights might doff their casques. The crabs [ex_subj_verb]

Inched from their pygmy burrows
And from the trench-dug mud, all Camouflaged in mottled mail [pb_noun_prep]
Of browns and greens. Each wore one [pb_noun_adj]
Claw swollen to a shield large
As itself—no fiddler's arm
Grown Gargantuan by trade,

But grown grimly, and grimly [pb_relword]
Borne, for a use beyond my [pb_det_noun]
Guessing of it. Sibilant [pb_noun_adj]
Mass-motived hordes, they sidled [pb_phrasal_verb]
Out in a converging stream [pb_noun_prep]
Toward the pool-mouth, perhaps to [pb_to_verb]
Meet the thin and sluggish thread [pb_noun_prep]

Of sea retracing its tide-
Way up the river-basin.
Or to avoid me. They moved [pb_verb_adv]
Obliquely with a dry-wet [pb_noun_adj]
Sound, with a glittery wisp
And trickle. Could they feel mud [pb_adj_adj]
Pleasurable under claws

As I could between bare toes?
That question ended it—I [ex_subj_verb]
Stood shut out, for once, for all,
Puzzling the passage of their
Absolutely alien [pb_noun_adj]
Order as I might puzzle [pb_verb_prep]
At the clear tail of Halley's

Comet coolly giving my [pb_det_noun]
Orbit the go-by, made known [pb_verb_prep]
By a family name it [ex_subj_verb]
Knew nothing of. So the crabs [ex_subj_verb]
Went about their business, which [ex_subj_verb]
Wasn't fiddling, and I filled [ex_dobj_verb]
A big handkerchief with blue [pb_noun_adj]

Mussels. From what the crabs saw,
If they could see, I was one
Two-legged mussel-picker.
High on the airy thatching [pb_noun_prep]
Of the dense grasses I found [ex_dobj_verb]
The husk of a fiddler-crab,
Intact, strangely strayed above [ex_dobj_verb]

His world of mud—green color [ex_subj_verb]
And innards bleached out blown off
Somewhere by much sun and wind;
There was no telling if he'd [ex_subj_verb]
Died recluse of suicide
Or headstrong Columbus crab.
The crab-face, etched and set there,

Grimaced as skulls grimace: it [ex_subj_verb]
Had an Oriental look,
A samurai death mask done [pb_verb_prep]
On a tiger tooth, less for [pb_comp]
Art's sake than God's. Far from sea —-
Where red-freckled crab-backs, claws [ex_dobj_verb]
And whole crabs, dead, their soggy [pb_noun_adj]

Bellies pallid and upturned,
Perform their shambling waltzes [pb_noun_prep]
On the waves' dissolving turn
And return, losing themselves
Bit by bit to their friendly [pb_noun_adj]
Element—this relic saved [ex_dobj_verb]
Face, to face the bald-faced sun.
