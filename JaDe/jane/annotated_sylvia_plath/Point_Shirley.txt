From Water-Tower Hill to the brick prison
The shingle booms, bickering under [ex_dobj_verb]
The sea's collapse.
Snowcakes break and welter. This year
The gritted wave leaps
The seawall and drops onto a bier [pb_comp]
Of quahog chips,
Leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten [pb_verb_prep]

In my grandmother's sand yard. She is dead,
Whose laundry snapped and froze here, who [ex_subj_verb]
Kept house against
What the ****tish, rutted sea could do.
Squall waves once danced [ex_dobj_verb]
Ship timbers in through the cellar window;
A thresh-tailed, lanced [ex_dobj_verb]
Shark littered in the geranium bed â€”-

Such collusion of mulish elements
She wore her broom straws to the nub.
Twenty years out
Of her hand, the house still hugs in each drab [pb_noun_adj]
Stucco socket [ex_verb_adjunct]
The purple egg-stones: from Great Head's knob [pb_noun_prep]
To the filled-in Gut
The sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds.

Nobody wintering now behind [ex_dobj_verb]
The planked-up windows where she set
Her wheat loaves [ex_dobj_verb]
And apple cakes to cool. What is it
Survives, grieves [pb_verb_adv]
So, battered, obstinate spit [pb_noun_prep]
Of gravel? The waves'
Spewed relics clicker masses in the wind,

Grey waves the stub-necked eiders ride.
A labor of love, and that labor lost.
Steadily the sea [ex_subj_verb]
Eats at Point Shirley. She died blessed,
And I come by
Bones, only bones, pawed and tossed,
A dog-faced sea.
The sun sinks under Boston, bloody red.

I would get from these dry-papped stones [ex_dobj_verb]
The milk your love instilled in them.
The black ducks dive.
And though your graciousness might stream,
And I contrive,
Grandmother, stones are nothing of home [pb_noun_prep]
To that spumiest dove.
Against both bar and tower the black sea runs.
