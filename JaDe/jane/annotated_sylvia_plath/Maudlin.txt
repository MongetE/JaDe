Mud-mattressed under the sign of the hag [pb_noun_prep]
In a clench of blood, the sleep-talking virgin [pb_noun_adj]
Gibbets with her curse the moon's man,
****-bearing Jack in his crackless egg :

Hatched with a claret hogshead to swig
He kings it, navel-knit to no groan,
But at the price of a pin-stitched skin [pb_noun_noun]
Fish-tailed girls purchase each white leg.
