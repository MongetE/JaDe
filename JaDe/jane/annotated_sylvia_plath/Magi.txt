The abstracts hover like dull angels:
Nothing so vulgar as a nose or an eye [cc_cross_clause]
Bossing the ethereal blanks of their face-ovals.

Their whiteness bears no relation to laundry,
Snow, chalk or suchlike. They're [ex_dobj_verb]
The real thing, all right: the Good, the True . . .

Salutary and pure as boiled water,
Loveless as the multiplication table.
While the child smiles into thin air.

Six months in the world, and she is able [pb_adj_prep]
To rock on all fours like a padded hammock.
For her, the heavy notion of Evil [ex_subj_verb]

Attending her cost less than a bellyache,
And Love the mother of milk, no theory.
They mistake their star, these papery godfolk.

They want the crib of some lamp-headed Plato.
Let them astound his heart with their merit.
What girl ever flourished in such company?
