Halfway up from the little harbor of sardine boats,
Halfway down from groves where the thin, bitter almond pips [ex_subj_verb]
Fatten in green-pocked pods, the three net-menders sit out,
Dressed in black, everybody in mourning for someone.
They set their stout chairs back to the road and face the dark [pb_noun_adj]
Dominoes of their doorways.

Sun grains their crow-colors,
Purples the fig in the leaf's shadow, turns the dust pink.
On the road named for Tomas Ortunio, mica [ex_subj_verb]
Winks like money under the ringed toes of the chickens.
The houses are white as sea-salt goats lick from the rocks.

While their fingers work with the coarse mesh and the fine
Their eyes revolve the whole town like a blue and green ball.
Nobody dies or is born without their knowing it.
They talk of bride-lace, of lovers spunky as gamecocks.

The moon leans, a stone madonna, over the lead sea
And the iron hills that enclose them. Earthen fingers [ex_subj_verb]
Twist old words into the web-threads:

Tonight may the fish [ex_subj_verb]
Be a harvest of silver in the nets, and the lamps [pb_noun_prep]
Of our husbands and sons move sure among the low stars.
