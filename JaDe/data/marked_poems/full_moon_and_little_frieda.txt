A cool small evening shrunk to a dog bark and the clank of a bucket -&&
And you listening.&&
A spider's web, tense for the dew's touch.&&
A pail lifted, still and brimming - mirror%%
To tempt a first star to a tremor.&&
Cows are going home in the lane there, looping the hedges with their warm%%
wreaths of breath -&&
A dark river of blood, many boulders,&&
Balancing unspilled milk.&&
'Moon!' you cry suddenly, 'Moon! Â Moon!'%%
The moon has stepped back like an artist gazing amazed at a work%%
That points at him amazed.&&
